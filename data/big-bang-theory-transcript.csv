0,Scene,1, A corridor at a sperm bank.,1
1,Sheldon,1," So if a photon is directed through a plane with two slits in it and either slit is observed it will not go through both slits. If it‰Ûªs unobserved it will, however, if it‰Ûªs observed after it‰Ûªs left the plane but before it hits its target, it will not have gone through both slits.",1
2,Leonard,1," Agreed, what‰Ûªs your point?",1
3,Sheldon,1," There‰Ûªs no point, I just think it‰Ûªs a good idea for a tee-shirt. ",1
4,Leonard,1, Excuse me?,1
5,Receptionist,1, Hang on. ,1
6,Leonard,1," One across is Aegean, eight down is Nabakov, twenty-six across is MCM, fourteen down is‰Û_ move your finger‰Û_ phylum, which makes fourteen across Port-au-Prince. See, Papa Doc‰Ûªs capital idea, that‰Ûªs Port-au-Prince. Haiti. ",1
7,Receptionist,1, Can I help you?,1
8,Leonard,1," Yes. Um, is this the High IQ sperm bank?",1
9,Receptionist,1," If you have to ask, maybe you shouldn‰Ûªt be here.",1
10,Sheldon,1, I think this is the place.,1
11,Receptionist,1, Fill these out.,1
12,Leonard,1, Thank-you. We‰Ûªll be right back.,1
13,Receptionist,1," Oh, take your time. I‰Ûªll just finish my crossword puzzle. Oh wait.",1
14,Sheldon,1," Leonard, I don‰Ûªt think I can do this.",1
15,Leonard,1," What, are you kidding? You‰Ûªre a semi-pro. ",1
16,Sheldon,1," No. We are committing genetic fraud. There‰Ûªs no guarantee that our sperm is going to generate high IQ offspring, think about that. I have a sister with the same basic DNA mix who hostesses at Fuddruckers.",1
17,Leonard,1," Sheldon, this was your idea. A little extra money to get fractional T1 bandwidth in the apartment.",1
18,Sheldon,1," I know, and I do yearn for faster downloads, but there‰Ûªs some poor woman is going to pin her hopes on my sperm, what if she winds up with a toddler who doesn‰Ûªt know if he should use an integral or a differential to solve the area under a curve.",1
19,Leonard,1, I‰Ûªm sure she‰Ûªll still love him.,1
20,Sheldon,1, I wouldn‰Ûªt.,1
21,Leonard,1," Well, what do you want to do?",1
22,Sheldon,1, I want to leave.,1
23,Leonard,1, Okay.,1
24,Sheldon,1, What‰Ûªs the protocol for leaving?,1
25,Leonard,1," I don‰Ûªt know, I‰Ûªve never reneged on a proffer of sperm before.",1
26,Sheldon,1, Let‰Ûªs try just walking out.,1
27,Sheldon,1, Bye-bye,1
28,Leonard,1, See you.,1
29,Scene,1, The stairs of the apartment building.,1
30,Sheldon,1, Are you still mad about the sperm bank?,1
31,Leonard,1, No.,1
32,Sheldon,1, You want to hear an interesting thing about stairs?,1
33,Leonard,1, Not really.,1
34,Sheldon,1," If the height of a single step is off by as little as two millimetres, most people will trip.",1
35,Leonard,1, I don‰Ûªt care. Two millimetres? That doesn‰Ûªt seem right.,1
36,Sheldon,1," No, it‰Ûªs true, I did a series of experiments when I was twelve, my father broke his clavicle.",1
37,Leonard,1, Is that why they sent you to boarding school?,1
38,Sheldon,1," No, that was the result of my work with lasers.",1
39,Leonard,1, New neighbour?,1
40,Sheldon,1, Evidently.,1
41,Leonard,1, Significant improvement over the old neighbour.,1
42,Sheldon,1," Two hundred pound transvestite with a skin condition, yes she is.",1
43,Penny,1," Oh, hi!",1
44,Leonard,1, Hi.,1
45,Sheldon,1, Hi.,1
46,Leonard,1, Hi.,1
47,Sheldon,1, Hi.,1
48,Penny,1, Hi?,1
49,Leonard,1," We don‰Ûªt mean to interrupt, we live across the hall.",1
50,Penny,1," Oh, that‰Ûªs nice.",1
51,Leonard,1," Oh‰Û_ uh‰Û_ no‰Û_ we don‰Ûªt live together‰Û_ um‰Û_ we live together but in separate, heterosexual bedrooms.",1
52,Penny,1," Oh, okay, well, guess I‰Ûªm your new neighbour, Penny.",1
53,Leonard,1," Leonard, Sheldon.",1
54,Penny,1, Hi.,1
55,Leonard,1, Hi.,1
56,Sheldon,1, Hi.,1
57,Penny,1, Hi. ,1
58,Leonard,1," Hi. Well, uh, oh, welcome to the building.",1
59,Penny,1," Thankyou, maybe we can have coffee sometime.",1
60,Leonard,1," Oh, great.",1
61,Penny,1, Great. ,1
62,Sheldon,1, Great.,1
63,Leonard,1," Great. Well, bye.",1
64,Penny,1, Bye.,1
65,Sheldon,1, Bye.,1
66,Leonard,1, Bye. ,1
67,Leonard,1, Should we have invited her for lunch?,1
68,Sheldon,1, No. We‰Ûªre going to start Season Two of Battlestar Galactica.,1
69,Leonard,1, We already watched the Season Two DVDs.,1
70,Sheldon,1, Not with commentary.,1
71,Leonard,1," I think we should be good neighbours, invite her over, make her feel welcome.",1
72,Sheldon,1, We never invited Louis-slash-Louise over.,1
73,Leonard,1," Well, then that was wrong of us. We need to widen our circle.",1
74,Sheldon,1, I have a very wide circle. I have 212 friends on myspace. ,1
75,Leonard,1," Yes, and you‰Ûªve never met one of them.",1
76,Sheldon,1, That‰Ûªs the beauty of it.,1
77,Leonard,1, I‰Ûªm going to invite her over. We‰Ûªll have a nice meal and chat.,1
78,Sheldon,1, Chat? We don‰Ûªt chat. At least not offline.,1
79,Leonard,1," Well it‰Ûªs not difficult, you just listen to what she says and then you say something appropriate in response.",1
80,Sheldon,1, To what end?,1
81,Leonard,1, Hi. Again.,1
82,Penny,1, Hi.,1
83,Sheldon,1, Hi.,1
84,Leonard,1, Hi.,1
85,Penny,1, Hi. ,1
86,Leonard,1," Anyway, um. We brought home Indian food. And, um. I know that moving can be stressful, and I find that when I‰Ûªm undergoing stress, that good food and company can have a comforting effect. Also, curry is a natural laxative, and I don‰Ûªt have to tell you that, uh, a clean colon is just one less thing to worry about.",1
87,Sheldon,1," Leonard, I‰Ûªm not expert here but I believe in the context of a luncheon invitation, you might want to skip the reference to bowel movements.",1
88,Penny,1," Oh, you‰Ûªre inviting me over to eat?",1
89,Leonard,1," Uh, yes.",1
90,Penny,1," Oh, that‰Ûªs so nice, I‰Ûªd love to.",1
91,Leonard,1, Great.,1
92,Penny,1," So, what do you guys do for fun around here?",1
93,Sheldon,1," Well, today we tried masturbating for money.",1
94,Scene,1, Sheldon and Leonard‰Ûªs apartment.,1
95,Leonard,1," Okay, well, make yourself at home.",1
96,Penny,1," Okay, thankyou.",1
97,Leonard,1, You‰Ûªre very welcome.,1
98,Penny,1," This looks like some serious stuff, Leonard, did you do this?",1
99,Sheldon,1, Actually that‰Ûªs my work.,1
100,Penny,1, Wow.,1
101,Sheldon,1," Yeah, well, it‰Ûªs just some quantum mechanics, with a little string theory doodling around the edges. That part there, that‰Ûªs just a joke, it‰Ûªs a spoof of the Bourne-Oppenheimer approximation.",1
102,Penny,1," So you‰Ûªre like, one of those, beautiful mind genius guys.",1
103,Sheldon,1, Yeah. ,1
104,Penny,1, This is really impressive.,1
105,Leonard,1," I have a board. If you like boards, this is my board.",1
106,Penny,1, Holy smokes.,1
107,Sheldon,1," If by holy smokes you mean a derivative restatement of the kind of stuff you can find scribbled on the wall of any men‰Ûªs room at MIT, sure.",1
108,Leonard,1, What?,1
109,Sheldon,1," Oh, come on. Who hasn‰Ûªt seen this differential below ‰ÛÏhere I sit broken hearted?‰Û",1
110,Leonard,1, At least I didn‰Ûªt have to invent twenty-six dimensions just to make the math come out.,1
111,Sheldon,1," I didn‰Ûªt invent them, they‰Ûªre there.",1
112,Leonard,1, In what universe?,1
113,Sheldon,1," In all of them, that is the point.",1
114,Penny,1," Uh, do you guys mind if I start?",1
115,Sheldon,1," Um, Penny, that‰Ûªs where I sit.",1
116,Penny,1," So, sit next to me. ",1
117,Sheldon,1," No, I sit there.",1
118,Penny,1, What‰Ûªs the difference?,1
119,Sheldon,1, What‰Ûªs the difference?,1
120,Leonard,1, Here we go.,1
121,Sheldon,1," In the winter that seat is close enough to the radiator to remain warm, and yet not so close as to cause perspiration. In the summer it‰Ûªs directly in the path of a cross breeze created by open windows there, and there. It faces the television at an angle that is neither direct, thus discouraging conversation, nor so far wide to create a parallax distortion, I could go on, but I think I‰Ûªve made my point. ",1
122,Penny,1, Do you want me to move?,1
123,Sheldon,1, Well.,1
124,Leonard,1, Just sit somewhere else.,1
125,Sheldon,1," Fine. (Wanders in circles, looking lost.)",1
126,Leonard,1," Sheldon, sit!",1
127,Sheldon,1, Aaah!,1
128,Leonard,1, Well this is nice. We don‰Ûªt have a lot of company over.,1
129,Sheldon,1, That‰Ûªs not true. Koothrapali and Wolowitz come over all the time. ,1
130,Leonard,1," Yes I now, but‰Û_",1
131,Sheldon,1, Tuesday night we played Klingon boggle until one in the morning.,1
132,Leonard,1," Yes, I remember.",1
133,Sheldon,1, I resent you saying we don‰Ûªt have company.,1
134,Leonard,1, I‰Ûªm sorry.,1
135,Sheldon,1, That is an antisocial implication.,1
136,Leonard,1, I said I‰Ûªm sorry.,1
137,Penny,1," So, Klingon boggle?",1
138,Leonard,1," Yeah, it‰Ûªs like regular boggle but, in Klingon. That‰Ûªs probably enough about us, tell us about you.",1
139,Penny,1," Um, me, okay, I‰Ûªm Sagittarius, which probably tells you way more than you need to know.",1
140,Sheldon,1," Yes, it tells us that you participate in the mass cultural delusion that the Sun‰Ûªs apparent position relative to arbitrarily defined constellations and the time of your birth somehow effects your personality.",1
141,Penny,1, Participate in the what?,1
142,Leonard,1," I think what Sheldon‰Ûªs trying to say, is that Sagittarius wouldn‰Ûªt have been our first guess.",1
143,Penny,1," Oh, yeah, a lot of people think I‰Ûªm a water sign. Okay, let‰Ûªs see, what else, oh, I‰Ûªm a vegetarian, oh, except for fish, and the occasional steak, I love steak. ",1
144,Sheldon,1, That‰Ûªs interesting. Leonard can‰Ûªt process corn.,1
145,Leonard,1," Wu-uh, do you have some sort of a job?",1
146,Penny,1," Oh, yeah, I‰Ûªm a waitress at the Cheesecake Factory.",1
147,Leonard,1," Oh, okay. I love cheesecake.",1
148,Sheldon,1, You‰Ûªre lactose intolerant. ,1
149,Leonard,1," I don‰Ûªt eat it, I just think it‰Ûªs a good idea.",1
150,Penny,1," Oh, anyways, I‰Ûªm also writing a screenplay. It‰Ûªs about this sensitive girl who comes to L.A. from Lincoln Nebraska to be an actress, and winds up a waitress at the Cheesecake Factory.",1
151,Leonard,1, So it‰Ûªs based on your life?,1
152,Penny,1," No, I‰Ûªm from Omaha. ",1
153,Leonard,1," Well, if that was a movie I would go see it.",1
154,Penny,1," I know, right? Okay, let‰Ûªs see, what else? Um, that‰Ûªs about it. That‰Ûªs the story of Penny.",1
155,Leonard,1, Well it sounds wonderful.,1
156,Penny,1, It was. Until I fell in love with a jerk. ,1
157,Sheldon (mouths),1, What‰Ûªs happening.,1
158,Leonard (mouths back),1, I don‰Ûªt know.,1
159,Penny,1," Oh God, you know, four years I lived with him, four years, that‰Ûªs like as long as High School. ",1
160,Sheldon,1, It took you four years to get through High School?,1
161,Leonard,1, Don‰Ûªt.,1
162,Penny,1," I just, I can‰Ûªt believe I trusted him.",1
163,Leonard,1, Should I say something? I feel like I should say something.,1
164,Sheldon,1," You? No, you‰Ûªll only make it worse.",1
165,Penny,1," You want to know the most pathetic part? Even though I hate his lying, cheating guts, I still love him. Is that crazy?",1
166,Sheldon,1, Yes. ,1
167,Leonard,1," No, it‰Ûªs not crazy it‰Ûªs, uh, uh, it‰Ûªs a paradox. And paradoxes are part of nature, think about light. Now if you look at Huygens, light is a wave, as confirmed by the double slit experiments, but then, along comes Albert Einstein and discovers that light behaves like particles too. Well, I didn‰Ûªt make it worse.",1
168,Penny,1," Oh, I‰Ûªm so sorry, I‰Ûªm such a mess, and on top of everything else I‰Ûªm all gross from moving and my stupid shower doesn‰Ûªt even work.",1
169,Leonard,1, Our shower works.,1
170,Penny,1, Really? Would it be totally weird if I used it?,1
171,Sheldon,1, Yes. ,1
172,Leonard,1, No.,1
173,Sheldon,1, No?,1
174,Leonard,1, No.,1
175,Sheldon,1, No.,1
176,Leonard,1, It‰Ûªs right down the hall.,1
177,Penny,1," Thanks. You guys are really sweet.",1
178,Sheldon,1, Well this is an interesting development. ,1
179,Leonard,1, How so?,1
180,Sheldon,1, It has been some time since we‰Ûªve had a woman take her clothes off in our apartment.,1
181,Leonard,1," That‰Ûªs not true, remember at Thanksgiving my grandmother with Alzheimer‰Ûªs had that episode.",1
182,Sheldon,1, Point taken. It has been some time since we‰Ûªve had a woman take her clothes off after which we didn‰Ûªt want to rip our eyes out. ,1
183,Leonard,1, The worst part was watching her carve that turkey.,1
184,Sheldon,1," So, what exactly are you trying to accomplish here?",1
185,Leonard,1, Excuse me?,1
186,Sheldon,1, That woman in there‰Ûªs not going to have sex with you.,1
187,Leonard,1, Well I‰Ûªm not trying to have sex with her.,1
188,Sheldon,1," Oh, good. Then you won‰Ûªt be disappointed.",1
189,Leonard,1," What makes you think she wouldn‰Ûªt have sex with me, I‰Ûªm a male and she‰Ûªs a female?",1
190,Sheldon,1," Yes, but not of the same species.",1
191,Leonard,1," I‰Ûªm not going to engage in hypotheticals here, I‰Ûªm just trying to be a good neighbour.",1
192,Sheldon,1," Oh, of course.",1
193,Leonard,1, That‰Ûªs not to say that if a carnal relationship were to develop that I wouldn‰Ûªt participate. However briefly.,1
194,Sheldon,1, Do you think this possibility will be helped or hindered when she discovers your Luke Skywalker no-more-tears shampoo?,1
195,Leonard,1," It‰Ûªs Darth Vader shampoo. (There is a knock on the door.) Luke Skywalker‰Ûªs the conditioner.",1
196,Howard,1, Wait till you see this.,1
197,Raj,1, It‰Ûªs fantastic. Unbelievable.,1
198,Leonard,1, See what?,1
199,Howard,1, It‰Ûªs a Stephen Hawking lecture from MIT in 1974.,1
200,Leonard,1, This is not a good time.,1
201,Leonard,1," That‰Ûªs great, you guys have to go.",1
202,Raj,1, Why?,1
203,Leonard,1, It‰Ûªs just not a good time.,1
204,Sheldon,1, Leonard has a lady over.,1
205,Howard,1," Yeah, right, your grandmother back in town?",1
206,Leonard,1," No. And she‰Ûªs not a lady, she‰Ûªs just a new neighbour.",1
207,Howard,1," Hang on, there really is a lady here?",1
208,Leonard,1, Uh-huh.,1
209,Howard,1, And you want us out because you‰Ûªre anticipating coitus?,1
210,Leonard,1, I‰Ûªm not anticipating coitus.,1
211,Howard,1, So she‰Ûªs available for coitus?,1
212, Leonard,1, Can we please stop saying coitus?,1
213,Sheldon,1, Technically that would be coitus interruptus.,1
214,Penny,1," Hey, is there a trick to getting it to switch from tub to shower. Oh. Hi, sorry. Hello!",1
215,Howard,1," Enchante Madamoiselle. Howard Wolowitz, Cal-Tech department of Applied Physics. You may be familiar with some of my work, it‰Ûªs currently orbiting Jupiter‰Ûªs largest moon taking high-resolution digital photographs.",1
216,Penny,1, Penny. I work at the Cheesecake Factory.,1
217,Leonard,1," Come on, I‰Ûªll show you the trick with the shower.",1
218,Howard,1, Bon douche.,1
219,Penny,1, I‰Ûªm sorry?,1
220,Howard,1, It‰Ûªs French for good shower. It‰Ûªs a sentiment I can express in six languages.,1
221,Leonard,1," Save it for your blog, Howard.",1
222,Howard,1, See-ka-tong-guay-jow.,1
223,Scene,1, In the bathroom.,1
224,Leonard,1," Uh, there it goes, it sticks, I‰Ûªm sorry.",1
225,Penny,1, Okay. Thanks. ,1
226,Leonard,1," You‰Ûªre welcome, oh, you‰Ûªre going to step right, okay, I‰Ûªll‰Û_.",1
227,Penny,1," Hey, Leonard?",1
228,Leonard,1, The hair products are Sheldon‰Ûªs.,1
229,Penny,1," Um, okay. Can I ask you a favour.",1
230,Leonard,1," A favour? Sure, you can ask me a favour, I would do you a favour for you.",1
231,Penny,1, It‰Ûªs okay if you say no.,1
232,Leonard,1," Oh, I‰Ûªll probably say yes.",1
233,Penny,1, It‰Ûªs just not the kind of thing you ask a guy you‰Ûªve just met.,1
234,Leonard,1, Wow.,1
235,Scene,1," Leonard and Sheldon, Inside Leonard‰Ûªs car",1
236,Sheldon,1, I really think we should examine the chain of causality here.,1
237,Leonard,1, Must we?,1
238,Sheldon,1," Event A. A beautiful woman stands naked in our shower. Event B. We drive half way across town to retrieve a television set from the aforementioned woman‰Ûªs ex-boyfriend. Query, on what plane of existence is there even a semi-rational link between these events?",1
239,Leonard,1," She asked me to do her a favour, Sheldon.",1
240,Sheldon,1," Ah, yes, well that may be the proximal cause of our journey, but we both know it only exists in contradistinction to the higher level distal cause.",1
241,Leonard,1, Which is?,1
242,Sheldon,1, You think with your penis.,1
243,Leonard,1, That‰Ûªs a biological impossibility and you didn‰Ûªt have to come.,1
244,Sheldon,1," Oh, right, yes, I could have stayed behind and watched Wolowitz try to hit on Penny in Russian, Arabic and Farsi. Why can‰Ûªt she get her own TV.",1
245,Leonard,1," Come on, you know how it is with break-ups.",1
246,Sheldon,1, No I don‰Ûªt. And neither do you.,1
247,Leonard,1," Wuh, I, I broke up with Joyce Kim.",1
248,Sheldon,1," You did not break up with Joyce Kim, she defected to North Korea.",1
249,Leonard,1, To mend her broken heart. This situation is much less complicated. There‰Ûªs some kind of dispute between Penny and her ex-boyfriend as to who gets custody of the TV. She just wanted to avoid having a scene with him.,1
250,Sheldon,1, So we get to have a scene with him?,1
251,Leonard,1," No, Sheldon, there‰Ûªs not going to be a scene. There‰Ûªs two of us and one of him.",1
252,Sheldon,1," Leonard, the two of us can‰Ûªt even carry a TV. ",1
253,Scene,1, Back at the apartment.,1
254,Penny (to Raj),1," So, you guys work with Leonard and Sheldon at the University?",1
255,Penny,1," Uh, I‰Ûªm sorry, do you speak English?",1
256,Howard,1," Oh, he speaks English, he just can‰Ûªt speak to women.",1
257,Penny,1," Really, why?",1
258,Howard,1, He‰Ûªs kind of a nerd. Juice box?,1
259,Scene,1, Outside Penny‰Ûªs old apartment building.,1
260,Leonard (pushes buzzer),1, I‰Ûªll do the talking.,1
261,Voice from buzzer,1, Yeah.,1
262,Leonard,1," Hi, I‰Ûªm Leonard, this is Sheldon.",1
263,Sheldon,1, Hello.,1
264,Leonard,1," What did I just‰Û_. Uh, we‰Ûªre here to pick up Penny‰Ûªs TV.",1
265,Voice,1, Get lost.,1
266,Sheldon,1," Okay, thanks for your time.",1
267,Leonard,1, We‰Ûªre not going to give up just like that.,1
268,Sheldon,1," Leonard, the TV is in the building, we‰Ûªve been denied access to the building, ergo we are done.",1
269,Leonard,1," Excuse me, if I were to give up at the first little hitch I never would have been able to identify the fingerprints of string theory in the aftermath of the big bang.",1
270,Sheldon,1, My apologies. What‰Ûªs your plan.,1
271,Sheldon,1, It‰Ûªs just a privilege to watch your mind at work.,1
272,Leonard,1," Come on, we have a combined IQ of 360, we should be able to figure out how to get into a stupid building.",1
273,Sheldon,1, What do you think their combined IQ is?,1
274,Leonard,1, Just grab the door.,1
275,Scene,1, Outside Penny‰Ûªs ex-boyfriend‰Ûªs apartment.,1
276,Leonard,1, This is it. (Knocks.) I‰Ûªll do the talking.,1
277,Sheldon,1," Good thinking, I‰Ûªll just be the muscle.",1
278,Enormous man,1, Yeah?,1
279,Leonard,1," I‰Ûªm Leonard, this is Sheldon.",1
280,Sheldon,1, From the intercom.,1
281,Man,1, How the hell did you get in the building?,1
282,Leonard,1, Oh. We‰Ûªre scientists.,1
283,Sheldon,1, Tell him about our IQ.,1
284,Scene,1, Outside the apartment building. Leonard and Sheldon exit. They are not wearing trousers.,1
285,Sheldon,1, Leonard.,1
286,Leonard,1, What?,1
287,Sheldon,1, My mom bought me those pants.,1
288,Leonard,1, I‰Ûªm sorry.,1
289,Sheldon,1, You‰Ûªre going to have to call her.,1
290,Scene,1, On the stairs of Sheldon and Leonard‰Ûªs building.,1
291,Leonard,1," Sheldon, I‰Ûªm so sorry I dragged you through this.",1
292,Sheldon,1," It‰Ûªs okay. It wasn‰Ûªt my first pantsing, and it won‰Ûªt be my last.",1
293,Leonard,1," And you were right about my motives, I was hoping to establish a relationship with Penny that might have some day led to sex.",1
294,Sheldon,1, Well you got me out of my pants.,1
295,Leonard,1," Anyway, I‰Ûªve learned my lesson. She‰Ûªs out of my league, I‰Ûªm done with her, I‰Ûªve got my work, one day I‰Ûªll win the Nobel Prize and then I‰Ûªll die alone.",1
296,Sheldon,1," Don‰Ûªt think like that, you‰Ûªre not going to die alone.",1
297,Leonard,1," Thank you Sheldon, you‰Ûªre a good friend.",1
298,Sheldon,1, And you‰Ûªre certainly not going to win a Nobel Prize.,1
299,Scene,1, Inside Sheldon and Leonard‰Ûªs apartment.,1
300,Howard,1," This is one of my favourite places to kick back after a quest, they have a great house ale.",1
301,Penny,1," Wow, cool tiger.",1
302,Howard,1," Yeah, I‰Ûªve had him since level ten. His name is Buttons. Anyway, if you had your own game character we could hang out, maybe go on a quest.",1
303,Penny,1," Uh, sounds interesting.",1
304,Howard,1, So you‰Ûªll think about it?,1
305,Penny,1," Oh, I don‰Ûªt think I‰Ûªll be able to stop thinking about it.",1
306,Raj,1, Smooth.,1
307,Leonard,1, We‰Ûªre home.,1
308,Penny,1," Oh, my God, what happened?",1
309,Leonard,1," Well, your ex-boyfriend sends his regards and I think the rest is fairly self-explanatory.",1
310,Penny,1," I‰Ûªm so sorry, I really thought if you guys went instead of me he wouldn‰Ûªt be such an ass.",1
311,Leonard,1," No, it was a valid hypothesis.",1
312,Sheldon,1, That was a valid hypothesis? What is happening to you?,1
313,Penny,1," Really, thank you so much for going and trying you‰Ûªre, uh, you‰Ûªre so terrific. Why don‰Ûªt you put some clothes on, I‰Ûªll get my purse and dinner is on me, okay?",1
314,Leonard,1, Really? Great.,1
315,Sheldon,1," Thank you. You‰Ûªre not done with her, are you?",1
316,Leonard,1, Our babies will be smart and beautiful.,1
317,Sheldon,1, Not to mention imaginary.,1
318,Scene,1, All five in Leonard‰Ûªs car.,1
319,Leonard,1, Is Thai food okay with you Penny?,1
320,Penny,1, Sure.,1
321,Sheldon,1," We can‰Ûªt have Thai food, we had Indian for lunch.",1
322,Penny,1, So?,1
323,Sheldon,1, They‰Ûªre both curry based cuisines.,1
324,Penny,1, So?,1
325,Sheldon,1, They would be gastronomically redundant. I can see we‰Ûªre going to have to spell out everything for this girl.,1
326,Penny,1, Any ideas Raj? (He just looks at her with a worried expression.),1
327,Howard,1, Turn left on Lake Street and head up to Colorado. I know a wonderful little sushi bar that has karaoke.,1
328,Penny,1, That sounds like fun.,1
329,Howard (sings),1," Baby, baby don‰Ûªt get hooked on me. Uh, baby, baby don‰Ûªt get hooked on me.",1
330,Scene,2," Sheldon and Leonard‰Ûªs apartment. Sheldon, Leonard, Howard and Raj are present.",1
331,Leonard,2," There you go, Pad Thai, no peanuts.",1
332,Howard,2, But does it have peanut oil?,1
333,Leonard,2," Uh, I‰Ûªm not sure, everyone keep an eye on Howard in case he starts to swell up.",1
334,Sheldon,2," Since it‰Ûªs not bee season, you can have my epinephrine.",1
335,Raj,2, Are there any chopsticks?,1
336,Sheldon,2," You don‰Ûªt need chopsticks, this is Thai food.",1
337,Leonard,2, Here we go.,1
338,Sheldon,2," Thailand has had the fork since the latter half of the nineteenth century. Interestingly they don‰Ûªt actually put the fork in their mouth, they use it to put the food on a spoon which then goes into their mouth.",1
339,Leonard,2," Ask him for a napkin, I dare you. (There is a knock on the door.) I‰Ûªll get it.",1
340,Howard,2, Do I look puffy? I feel puffy.,1
341,Penny,2, Hey Leonard.,1
342,Leonard,2," Oh, hi Penny.",1
343,Penny,2, Am I interrupting.,1
344,Leonard,2, No.,1
345,Sheldon (off),2," You‰Ûªre not swelling, Howard.",1
346,Howard (off),2," No, no, look at my fingers, they‰Ûªre like Vienna sausages.",1
347,Penny,2, Sounds like you have company.,1
348,Leonard,2," They‰Ûªre not going anywhere. (Closes door, staying in hallway.) So, you‰Ûªre coming home from work. That‰Ûªs great. How was work.",1
349,Penny,2," Well, you know, it‰Ûªs the Cheesecake Factory. People order cheesecake, and I bring it to them.",1
350,Leonard,2," So, you sort of act as a carbohydrate delivery system.",1
351,Penny,2," Yeah, call it whatever you want, I get minimum wage. Yeah, anyways, I was wondering if you could help me out with something, I was‰Û_.",1
352,Leonard,2, Yes.,1
353,Penny,2," Oh. Okay, great, I‰Ûªm having some furniture delivered tomorrow, and I may not be here, so‰Û_. (apartment door opens, Sheldon, Raj and Howard appear) Oh! Hel‰Û_hello!",1
354,Howard,2, (speaks a phrase in Russian).,1
355,Penny,2, I‰Ûªm sorry?,1
356,Howard,2, Haven‰Ûªt you ever been told how beautiful you are in flawless Russian?,1
357,Penny,2," No, I haven‰Ûªt.",1
358,Howard,2, Get used to it.,1
359,Penny,2," Yeah, I probably won‰Ûªt, but‰Û_ Hey Sheldon.",1
360,Sheldon,2, Hi.,1
361,Penny,2," Hey Raj! (Raj looks uncomfortable) Still not talking to me, huh?",1
362,Sheldon,2," Don‰Ûªt take it personally, it‰Ûªs his pathology, he can‰Ûªt talk to women.",1
363,Howard,2," He can‰Ûªt talk to attractive women, or in your case a cheesecake‰ÛÒscented Goddess!",1
364,Leonard,2," So, there‰Ûªs gonna be some furniture delivered?",1
365,Penny,2," Yeah, yeah, if it gets here and I‰Ûªm not here tomorrow could you just sign for it and have them put it in my apartment.",1
366,Leonard,2," Yeah, no problem.",1
367,Penny,2," Great, here‰Ûªs my spare key. Thank you.",1
368,Leonard,2," Penny, wait.",1
369,Penny,2, Yeah?,1
370,Leonard,2," Um, if you don‰Ûªt have any other plans, do you want to join us for Thai food and a Superman movie marathon?",1
371,Penny,2," A marathon? Wow, how many Superman movies are there?",1
372,Sheldon,2," You‰Ûªre kidding, right?",1
373,Penny,2," Yeah, I do like the one where Lois Lane falls from the helicopter and Superman swooshes down and catches her, which one was that? ",1
374,"Leonard,Sheldon and Howard together",2, One. (Raj raises one finger). ,1
375,Sheldon,2, You realise that scene was rife with scientific inaccuracy.,1
376,Penny,2," Yes, I know, men can‰Ûªt fly.",1
377,Sheldon,2," Oh no, let‰Ûªs assume that they can. Lois Lane is falling, accelerating at an initial rate of 32 feet per second per second. Superman swoops down to save her by reaching out two arms of steel. Miss Lane, who is now travelling at approximately 120 miles per hour, hits them, and is immediately sliced into three equal pieces. ",1
378,Leonard,2," Unless, Superman matches her speed and decelerates. ",1
379,Sheldon,2," In what space, sir, in what space? She‰Ûªs two feet above the ground. Frankly, if he really loved her, he‰Ûªd let her hit the pavement. It would be a more merciful death.",1
380,Leonard,2," Excuse me, your entire argument is predicated on the assumption that Superman‰Ûªs flight is a feat of strength.",1
381,Sheldon,2," Are you listening to yourself, it is well established that Superman‰Ûªs flight is a feat of strength, it is an extension of his ability to leap tall buildings, an ability he derives from Earth‰Ûªs yellow Sun.",1
382,Howard,2," Yeah, and you don‰Ûªt have a problem with that, how does he fly at night.",1
383,Sheldon,2," Uh, a combination of the moon‰Ûªs solar reflection and the energy storage capacity of Kryptonian skin cells.",1
384,Penny,2, I‰Ûªm just going to go wash up.,1
385,Leonard,2," I have 26 hundred comic books in there, I challenge you to find a single reference to Kryptonian skin cells.",1
386,Sheldon,2, Challenge accepted. (Tries door.) We‰Ûªre locked out.,1
387,Raj,2," Also, the pretty girl left.",1
388,Scene,2, Ground floor hallway of the apartment building. Leonard is signing for the delivery.,1
389,Leonard,2," Okay, her apartment‰Ûªs on the fourth floor but the elevator‰Ûªs broken so you‰Ûªre going to have to (delivery man leaves) oh, you‰Ûªre just going to be done, okay, cool, thanks. I guess we‰Ûªll just bring it up ourselves.",1
390,Sheldon,2, I hardly think so. ,1
391,Leonard,2, Why not?,1
392,Sheldon,2," Well, we don‰Ûªt have a dolly, or lifting belts, or any measurable upper body strength.",1
393,Leonard,2," We don‰Ûªt need strength, we‰Ûªre physicists. We are the intellectual descendents of Archimedes. Give me a fulcrum and a lever and I can move the Earth, it‰Ûªs just a matter‰Û_ (starts to move package) I don‰Ûªt have this‰Û_ I don‰Ûªt have this I don‰Ûªt have this.",1
394,Sheldon,2, Archimedes would be so proud.,1
395,Leonard,2, Do you have any ideas?,1
396,Sheldon,2," Yes, but they all involve a green lantern and a power ring.",1
397,Leonard,2," Easy, easy (package falls) Okay! Now we‰Ûªve got an inclined plane. The force required to lift is reduced by the sine of the angle of the stairs, call it thirty degrees, so about half. ",1
398,Sheldon,2, Exactly half.,1
399,Leonard (snarkily),2," Exactly half. Let‰Ûªs push. Okay, see, it‰Ûªs moving, this is easy, all in the math. ",1
400,Sheldon,2, What‰Ûªs your formula for the corner.,1
401,Leonard,2," What? Oh, okay, uh, okay, yeah, no problem, just come up here and help me pull and turn.",1
402,Sheldon,2," Ah, gravity, thou art a heartless bitch.",1
403,Sheldon,2, You do understand that our efforts here will in no way increase the odds of you having sexual congress with this woman?,1
404,Leonard,2, Men do things for women without expecting sex.,1
405,Sheldon,2," Yeah, those are men who just had sex.",1
406,Leonard,2," I‰Ûªm doing this to be a good neighbour. In any case, there‰Ûªs no way it could lower the odds.",1
407,Leonard,2," Almost there, almost there, almost there. (Lets go of package, it starts to slip down)",1
408,Sheldon,2," No we‰Ûªre not, no we‰Ûªre not, no we‰Ûªre not.",1
409,Scene,2, Inside Penny‰Ûªs apartment. They are laying the package down on the floor.,1
410,Sheldon,2," Watch your fingers. Watch your fingers. Oh God, my fingers!",1
411,Leonard,2, You okay?,1
412,Sheldon,2," No, it hurt‰Û_ (looking around) Great Caesar‰Ûªs Ghost, look at this place?",1
413,Leonard,2, So Penny‰Ûªs a little messy.,1
414,Sheldon,2," A little messy? The Mandelbrot set of complex numbers is a little messy, this is chaos. Excuse me, explain to me an organisational system where a tray of flatware on a couch is valid. I‰Ûªm just inferring that this is a couch, because the evidence suggests the coffee table‰Ûªs having a tiny garage sale. ",1
415,Leonard,2," Did it ever occur to you that not everyone has the compulsive need to sort, organise and label the entire world around them?",1
416,Sheldon,2, No.,1
417,Leonard,2," Well they don‰Ûªt. Hard as it may be for you to believe, most people don‰Ûªt sort their breakfast cereal numerically by fibre content.",1
418,Sheldon,2," Excuse me, but I think we‰Ûªve both found that helpful at times.",1
419,Leonard,2," Come on, we should go.",1
420,Sheldon,2, Hang on.,1
421,Leonard,2, What are you doing?,1
422,Sheldon,2, Straightening up.,1
423,Leonard,2," Sheldon, this is not your home.",1
424,Sheldon,2," This is not anyone‰Ûªs home, this is a swirling vortex of entropy.",1
425,Leonard,2," When the transvestite lived here, you didn‰Ûªt care how he kept the place.",1
426,Sheldon,2," Because it was immaculate, I mean, you open that man‰Ûªs closet, it was left to right, evening gowns, cocktail dresses, then his police uniforms.",1
427,Leonard,2, What were you doing in his closet?,1
428,Sheldon,2, I helped run some cable for a webcam.,1
429,Penny (entering),2, Hey guys.,1
430,Leonard,2," Oh, hey Penny, this just arrived, we just brought this up, just now.",1
431,Penny,2, Great. Was it hard getting it up the stairs?,1
432,Sheldon,2, (sucks in breath),1
433,Leonard,2, No.,1
434,Sheldon,2, No?,1
435,Leonard,2, No.,1
436,Sheldon,2, No.,1
437,Leonard,2," Well, we‰Ûªll get out of your hair.",1
438,Penny,2," Oh, great, thank you again (she throws her jacket over the back of the sofa).",1
439,Sheldon,2," Penny, I just want you to know that, you don‰Ûªt have to live like this. I‰Ûªm here for you.",1
440,Penny,2, What‰Ûªs he talking about?,1
441,Leonard,2, It‰Ûªs a joke.,1
442,Penny,2, I don‰Ûªt get it.,1
443,Leonard,2," Yeah, he didn‰Ûªt tell it right.",1
444,Leonard,2, Sheldon?,1
445,Scene,2, The living room. Leonard enters carrying a light sabre.,1
446,Leonard,2, Sheldon? Hello? ,1
447,Scene,2," Penny‰Ûªs apartment, penny is sleeping, Sheldon is cleaning. Leonard enters.",1
448,Leonard,2, Sheldon!,1
449,Sheldon,2, Sssshhhh! Penny‰Ûªs sleeping.,1
450,Leonard,2," Are you insane, you can‰Ûªt just break into a woman‰Ûªs apartment in the middle of the night and clean.",1
451,Sheldon,2," I had no choice. I couldn‰Ûªt sleep knowing that just outside my bedroom was our living room, and just outside our living room was that hallway, and immediately adjacent to that hallway was‰Û_ this.",1
452,Leonard,2," Do you realise that if Penny wakes up, there is no reasonable explanation as to why we‰Ûªre here?",1
453,Sheldon,2, I just gave you a reasonable explanation.,1
454,Leonard,2," No, no. You gave me an explanation, it‰Ûªs reasonableness will be determined by a jury of your peers.",1
455,Sheldon,2, Don‰Ûªt be ridiculous. I have no peers.,1
456,Leonard,2," Sheldon, we have to get out of here.",1
457,Sheldon,2, You might want to speak in a lower register.,1
458,Leonard,2, What?,1
459,Sheldon,2," Evolution has made women sensitive to high pitched noises while they sleep, so that they‰Ûªll be roused by a crying baby. If you want to avoid waking her, speak in a lower register.",1
460,Leonard,2, That‰Ûªs ridiculous. (Penny snores again.),1
461,Sheldon,2," No, (lowering his voice dramatically,) that‰Ûªs ridiculous.",1
462,Leonard (doing likewise),2," Fine. I accept your premise, now please let‰Ûªs go.",1
463,Sheldon,2, I am not leaving until I‰Ûªm done.,1
464,Leonard,2, O-o-o-oh! (Collapses against wall).,1
465,Sheldon,2," If you have time to lean, you have time to clean.",1
466,Leonard,2," Oh, what the hell.",1
467,Scene,2," Sheldon and Leonard‰Ûªs living room, morning. Sheldon enters, singing to himself. ",1
468,Sheldon,2, Morning.,1
469,Leonard,2, Morning. ,1
470,Sheldon,2," I have to say, I slept splendidly. Granted, not long, but just deeply and well.",1
471,Leonard,2, I‰Ûªm not surprised. A well known folk cure for insomnia is to break into your neighbour‰Ûªs apartment and clean.,1
472,Sheldon,2, Sarcasm?,1
473,Leonard,2, You think?,1
474,Sheldon,2," Granted, my methods may have been somewhat unorthodox, but I think the end result will be a measurable enhancement of Penny‰Ûªs quality of life.",1
475,Leonard,2," You know what, you‰Ûªve convinced me, maybe tonight we should sneak in and shampoo her carpet.",1
476,Sheldon,2, You don‰Ûªt think that crosses a line?,1
477,Leonard,2," Yes! For God‰Ûªs sake, Sheldon, do I have to hold up a sarcasm sign every time I open my mouth.",1
478,Sheldon,2, You have a sarcasm sign?,1
479,Leonard,2," No, I do not have a sarcasm sign.",1
480,Sheldon,2," Do you want some cereal. I‰Ûªm feeling so good today I‰Ûªm going to choose from the low fibre end of the shelf. Hello, Honey Puffs.",1
481,Penny (voice off),2, Son of a Bitch!,1
482,Leonard,2, Penny‰Ûªs up.,1
483,Penny (voice off),2," You sick, geeky bastards!",1
484,Leonard,2, How did she know it was us?,1
485,Sheldon,2, I may have left a suggested organisational schematic for her bedroom closet.,1
486,Penny (voice off),2, Leonard!,1
487,Leonard,2," God, this is going to be bad.",1
488,Sheldon,2," Goodbye, Honey Puffs, hello Big Bran.",1
489,Penny (entering),2, You came into my apartment last night when I was sleeping?,1
490,Leonard,2," Yes, but, only to clean.",1
491,Sheldon,2," Really more to organise, you‰Ûªre not actually dirty, per se.",1
492,Penny,2, Give me back my key.,1
493,Leonard,2," I‰Ûªm very, very sorry.",1
494,Penny,2, Do you understand how creepy this is.,1
495,Leonard,2," Oh, yes, we discussed it at length last night.",1
496,Penny,2," In my apartment, while I was sleeping.",1
497,Sheldon,2," And snoring. And that‰Ûªs probably just a sinus infection, but it could be sleep apnoea, you might want to see an otolaryngologist. It‰Ûªs a throat doctor.",1
498,Penny,2, And what kind of doctor removes shoes from asses?,1
499,Sheldon,2," Depending on the depth, that‰Ûªs either a proctologist or a general surgeon. (Leonard holds up a sign reading ‰ÛÏSarcasm‰Û) Oh!",1
500,Penny,2, God!,1
501,Leonard,2," Okay, look, no Penny, I think what you‰Ûªre feeling is perfectly valid, and maybe a little bit later today when you‰Ûªre feeling a little bit less, for lack of a better word, violated, maybe we could talk about this some more.",1
502,Penny,2, Stay away from me.,1
503,Leonard,2," Sure, that‰Ûªs another way to go.",1
504,Sheldon,2," Penny, Penny, just to clarify because there will be a discussion when you leave, is your objection solely to our presence in the apartment while you were sleeping, or do you also object to the imposition of a new organisational paradigm. (Penny stares in disbelief, then leaves.) Well that was a little non-responsive.",1
505,Leonard,2, You are going to march yourself over there right now and apologise. (Sheldon laughs.) What‰Ûªs funny?,1
506,Sheldon,2, That wasn‰Ûªt sarcasm?,1
507,Leonard,2, No.,1
508,Sheldon,2," Wooh, boy, you are all over the place this morning. (Knocks on Penny‰Ûªs door.) I have a masters and two PhD‰Ûªs, I should not have to do this.",1
509,Penny (opening door),2, What?,1
510,Sheldon,2," I am truly sorry for what happened last night, I take full responsibility. And I hope that it won‰Ûªt colour your opinion of Leonard, who is not only a wonderful guy, but also, I hear, a gentle and thorough lover. (Penny closes door in his face.) I did what I could.",1
511,Scene,2," The stairwell. Raj is coming up the stairs, he meets Penny who is going down.",1
512,Penny,2," Hey Raj. (Raj stands looking uncomfortable.) Hey, listen, I don‰Ûªt know if you heard about what happened last night with Leonard and Sheldon, but I‰Ûªm really upset about it, I mean they just, they let themselves into my place, and then they cleaned it, I mean can you even believe that? How weird is that?",1
513,"Raj (internally, while Penny continues to talk)",2," Ooh, she‰Ûªs standing very close to me. Oh my, she does smell good. What is that, vanilla?",1
514,Penny,2," You know, where I come from, someone comes into your house at night, you shoot, okay? And you don‰Ûªt shoot to wound. I mean, alright, my sister shot her husband, but it was an accident, they were drunk. What was I saying?",1
515,Raj (internally),2," She‰Ûªs so chatty. Maybe my parents are right. Maybe I‰Ûªd be better off with an Indian girl. We‰Ûªd have the same cultural background, and my wife would sing to my children the same lullabies my mother sang to me. ",1
516,Penny,2," It‰Ûªs obvious that they meant well, but I‰Ûªm just, I‰Ûªm having a really rough time, like I said, I broke up with my boyfriend, and it‰Ûªs just freaking me out.",1
517,Penny,2," I mean, just because most of the men I‰Ûªve known in my life happen to be jerks, doesn‰Ûªt mean I should just assume Leonard and Sheldon are. Right?",1
518,Raj (internally),2, She asked me a question. I should probably nod. (Does.),1
519,Penny,2, That‰Ûªs exactly what I thought. Thank you for listening. You‰Ûªre a doll. (She hugs him.),1
520,Raj (internally),2, Oh-oh. Turn your pelvis. (Does.),1
521,Scene,2," Sheldon and Leonard‰Ûªs living room. Howard is there, playing on a dance video game. ",1
522,Howard (jumping off game mat),2," Grab a napkin, homie. You just got served. ",1
523,Leonard,2, It‰Ûªs fine. You win.,1
524,Howard,2, What‰Ûªs his problem?,1
525,Sheldon,2, His imaginary girlfriend broke up with him.,1
526,Howard,2, Been there.,1
527,Raj (entering),2," Hello. Sorry I‰Ûªm late. But I was in the hallway, chatting up Penny.",1
528,Howard,2," Really? You? Rajesh Koothrapali, spoke to Penny?",1
529,Raj,2," Actually, I was less the chatter than the chattee.",1
530,Leonard,2, What did she say? Is she still mad at me?,1
531,Raj,2," Well, she was upset at first, but, probably because her sister shot somebody. Then there was something about you and‰Û_ then she hugged me.",1
532,Howard,2, She hugged you? How did she hug you? (Raj hugs Howard.) Is that her perfume I smell?,1
533,Raj,2," intoxicating, isn‰Ûªt it?",1
534,Scene,2," The hallway, Leonard puts a note under Penny‰Ûªs door. It opens.",1
535,Penny,2, Hi.,1
536,Leonard,2, Oh.,1
537,Penny,2, What‰Ûªs going on?,1
538,Leonard,2," Um, here‰Ûªs the thing. (Reads from note.) Penny. Just as Oppenheimer came to regret his contributions to the first atomic bomb, so too I regret my participation in what was, at the very least, an error in judgement. The hallmark of the great human experiment is the willingness to recognise one‰Ûªs mistakes. Some mistakes, such as Madame Curie‰Ûªs discovery of Radium turned out to have great scientific potential even though she would later die a slow, painful death from radiation poisoning. Another example, from the field of ebola research‰Û_.",1
539,Penny,2, Leonard.,1
540,Leonard,2, Yeah.,1
541,Penny (hugs him),2," We‰Ûªre okay. (Kisses him on cheek. Closes door. Leonard looks happy, walks back across hallway and straight into the apartment door.)",1
542,Scene,2, Penny‰Ûªs apartment. Sheldon and Leonard are trying to construct furniture.,1
543,Leonard,2, Six two inch dowels.,1
544,Sheldon,2, Check.,1
545,Leonard,2," One package, Phillips head screws.",1
546,Sheldon,2, Check.,1
547,Penny,2," Guys, seriously, I grew up on a farm, okay, I rebuilt a tractor engine when I was like twelve, I think I can put together a cheap Swedish media centre. ",1
548,Leonard,2," No, please, we insist, it‰Ûªs the least we can do considering. ",1
549,Sheldon,2, Considering what? How great this place looks?,1
550,Howard (across room with Raj),2," Oh boy, I was afraid of this.",1
551,Leonard,2, What?,1
552,Howard,2, These instructions are a pictographic representation of the least imaginative way to assemble these components. This right here is why Sweden has no space program.,1
553,Penny,2," Well, uh, it looked pretty good in the store.",1
554,Leonard,2," It is an inefficient design, for example Penny has a flat screen TV, which means all the space behind it is wasted.",1
555,Sheldon,2, We could put her stereo back there.,1
556,Leonard,2, And control it how?,1
557,Sheldon,2," Run an infra-red repeater, photocell here, emitter here, easy peasy. ",1
558,Howard (after Raj whispers in his ear),2," Good point, how you gonna cool it?",1
559,Penny,2," Hey guys, I got this. ",1
560,Sheldon,2," Hang on Penny. How about fans, here and here?",1
561,Leonard,2," Also inefficient, and might be loud.",1
562,Howard,2," How about liquid coolant? Maybe a little aquarium pump here, run some quarter inch PVC‰Û_",1
563,Penny,2," Guys, this is actually really simple.",1
564,Howard,2," Hold on, honey, men at work. The PVC comes down here, maybe a little corrugated sheet metal as a radiator here.",1
565,Leonard,2," Oh, really, show me where we put a drip tray, a sluice and an overflow reservoir?",1
566,Sheldon,2, And if water is involved we‰Ûªre going to have to ground the crap out of the thing. ,1
567,Penny,2," Guys, it‰Ûªs hot in here, I think I‰Ûªll just take off all my clothes. ",1
568,Leonard,2," Oh, I‰Ûªve got it. How about if we replace panels A, B and F and crossbar H with aircraft grade aluminium. ",1
569,Sheldon,2," Right, then the entire thing‰Ûªs one big heat sink.",1
570,Howard,2," Perfect, Leonard, why don‰Ûªt you and Sheldon go down to the junk yard and pick up about six square metres of scrap aluminium, Raj and I will run down to my lab and get the oxy-acetaline torch.",1
571,Leonard,2, Meet back here in an hour?,1
572,Howard,2, Done.,1
573,Leonard,2, Got it. (They all leave).,1
574,Penny,2," Okay, this place does look pretty good.",1
575,Teleplay,2, Robert Cohen & Dave Goetsch,1

577,Scene,3," Sheldon and Leonard‰Ûªs apartment. Sheldon, Leonard, Howard and Raj are using laptops. All are wearing microphone headsets.",1
578,Howard,3," Alright, just a few more feet, and‰Û_. here we are gentlemen, the Gates of Elzebub.",1
579,Sheldon,3, Good lord!,1
580,Raj,3, Oooh.,1
581,Leonard,3," Don‰Ûªt panic, this is what the last 97 hours have been about.",1
582,Howard,3," Stay frosty, there‰Ûªs a horde of armed goblins on the other side of that gate guarding the Sword of Azeroth.",1
583,Leonard,3," Warriors, unsheathe your weapons, magic wielders raise your wands.",1
584,Sheldon,3, Lock and load. ,1
585,Howard,3," Raj, blow up the gates.",1
586,Raj,3," Blowing the gates. Control, shift, B! Oh, my God, so many goblins!",1
587,Howard,3," Don‰Ûªt just stand there, slash and move, slash and move.",1
588,Leonard,3, Stay in formation.,1
589,Howard,3," Leonard, you‰Ûªve got one on your tail.",1
590,Leonard,3," That‰Ûªs alright, my tail‰Ûªs prehensile, I‰Ûªll swat him off.",1
591,Raj,3, I‰Ûªve got him Leonard. Tonight I spice my meat with goblin blood!,1
592,Leonard,3," Raj, no, it‰Ûªs a trap, they‰Ûªre flanking us!",1
593,Raj,3," Oooh, he‰Ûªs got me.",1
594,Howard,3," Sheldon, he‰Ûªs got Raj, use your sleath spell. Sheldon! Sheldon!",1
595,Sheldon,3, I‰Ûªve got the Sword of Azeroth!,1
596,Leonard,3," Forget the sword, Sheldon, help Raj.",1
597,Sheldon,3," There is no more Sheldon, I am the Swordmaster!",1
598,Howard,3, Leonard look out!,1
599,Leonard,3," Dammit man, we‰Ûªre dying here. ",1
600,Sheldon,3," Goodbye, peasants. ",1
601,Leonard,3, The bastard teleported. ,1
602,Raj,3, He‰Ûªs selling the Sword of Azeroth on ebay.,1
603,Leonard,3," You betrayed us for money, who are you?",1
604,Sheldon,3," I‰Ûªm a rogue knight elf, don‰Ûªt you people read character descriptions? Wait, wait, wait, somebody just clicked ‰ÛÏbuy it now.‰Û",1
605,Howard,3, I am the Swordmaster!,1
606,Scene,3, The same.,1
607,Sheldon,3," Wooh, I‰Ûªm all sweaty, anybody want to log on to second life and go swimming, I just built a virtual pool.",1
608,Leonard,3," No, I can‰Ûªt look at you or your avatar right now.",1
609,Howard,3, Sounds like your neighbour‰Ûªs home.,1
610,Leonard,3, Excuse me.,1
611,Sheldon,3, Don‰Ûªt forget the mail you took accidentally on purpose so you‰Ûªd have an excuse to talk to her.,1
612,Leonard,3," Oh, right, right right right right.",1
613,Howard,3," Stealing snail mail, very old school, I like it. ",1
614,Leonard (exiting to hallway),3," Penny, the mailman did it again, he‰Û_ (looks up to see Penny kissing a hunky man) Oh! Sorry.",1
615,Penny,3," Um, no, hi Leonard, this is Doug, Doug, this is my neighbour Leonard.",1
616,Doug,3, What‰Ûªs up bro.,1
617,Leonard,3, Not much. Bro. ,1
618,Penny,3," Is, is everything okay.",1
619,Leonard,3," Uh, yeah, uh, I just, I got your mail again, here.",1
620,Penny,3," Thank you, I‰Ûªve got to talk to that mailman.",1
621,Leonard,3," Oh no, that‰Ûªs probably not such a good idea. Civil servants have a documented propensity to, you know, snap. ",1
622,Penny,3," Okay, well, thank you, again.",1
623,Leonard,3," No problem. Bye. Oh, and, bye, bro! (Returns to apartment).",1
624,Sheldon,3, Penny for your thoughts. ,1
625,Raj,3, What‰Ûªs the matter.,1
626,Leonard,3," No, I‰Ûªm fine. Penny‰Ûªs fine, the guy she‰Ûªs kissing is really fine and‰Û_",1
627,Howard,3," Kissing, what kind of kissing? Cheeks? Lips? Chaste? French? ",1
628,Leonard,3, What is wrong with you?,1
629,Howard,3, I‰Ûªm a romantic.,1
630,Sheldon,3, Please don‰Ûªt tell me that your hopeless infatuation is devolving into pointless jealousy.,1
631,Leonard,3," No, I‰Ûªm not jealous, I‰Ûªm just a little concerned for her. I didn‰Ûªt like the look of the guy that she was with.",1
632,Howard,3, Because he looked better than you?,1
633,Leonard,3, Yeah. He was kinda dreamy.,1
634,Sheldon,3," Well, at least now you can retrieve the black box from the twisted smouldering wreckage that was once your fantasy of dating her, and analyse the data so that you don‰Ûªt crash into geek mountain again.",1
635,Howard,3," I disagree, love is not a sprint, it‰Ûªs a marathon. A relentless pursuit that only ends when she falls into your arms. Or hits you with the pepper spray. ",1
636,Leonard,3," Well, I‰Ûªm done with Penny. I‰Ûªm going to be more realistic and go after someone my own speed.",1
637,Raj,3, Like who?,1
638,Leonard,3, I don‰Ûªt know. Olivia Geiger?,1
639,Sheldon,3, The dietician at the cafeteria with the limp and the lazy eye?,1
640,Leonard,3, Yeah.,1
641,Sheldon,3," Well, I don‰Ûªt think you have a shot there. I have noticed that Lesley Winkle recently started shaving her legs. Now, given that winter is coming one can only assume that she is signalling sexual availability. ",1
642,Howard,3," I don‰Ûªt know, you guys work in the same lab.",1
643,Leonard,3, So?,1
644,Howard,3," There are pitfalls, trust me, I know. When it comes to sexual harassment law I‰Ûªm‰Û_ a bit of a self-taught expert. ",1
645,Leonard,3," Look, Howard, if I were to ask Lesley Winkle out it would just be for dinner, I‰Ûªm not going to walk into the lab, ask her to strip naked and dance for me.",1
646,Howard,3," Oh, then you‰Ûªre probably okay.",1
647,Scene,3, Howard and Lesley‰Ûªs lab.,1
648,Leonard,3, Hello Lesley.,1
649,Lesley,3, Hi Leonard. ,1
650,Leonard,3, Lesley I would like to propose an experiment.,1
651,Lesley,3," Goggles, Leonard.",1
652,Leonard,3," Right. Lesley, I would like to propose an experiment.",1
653,Lesley,3, Hang on. I‰Ûªm trying to see how long it takes a five hundred kilowatt oxygen iodine laser to heat up my cup o‰Ûª noodles.,1
654,Leonard,3," Pfff, I‰Ûªve done it, about two seconds, 2.6 for minestrone. Anyway, I was thinking more of a bio-social exploration with a neuro-chemical overlay. ",1
655,Lesley,3," Wait, are you asking me out?",1
656,Leonard,3," I was going to characterise it as the modification of our colleague/friendship paradigm, with the addition of a date-like component. But we don‰Ûªt need to quibble over terminology. ",1
657,Lesley,3, What sort of experiment would you propose?,1
658,Leonard,3," There is a generally accepted pattern in this area, I would pick you up, take you to a restaurant, then we would see a movie, probably a romantic comedy featuring the talents of Hugh Grant or Sandra Bullock. ",1
659,Lesley,3, Interesting. And would you agree that the primary way we would evaluate either the success or failure of the date would be based on the bio-chemical reaction during the goodnight kiss.,1
660,Leonard,3," Heartrate, pheromones, etc, yes. ",1
661,Lesley,3," Well, why don‰Ûªt we just stipulate that the date goes well and move to the key variable.",1
662,Leonard,3," You mean, kiss you now?",1
663,Lesley,3, Yes. ,1
664,Leonard,3, Can you define the parameters of the kiss?,1
665,Lesley,3, Closed mouth but romantic. Mint?,1
666,Leonard,3, Thank you. (Takes mint). Shall I count down from three?,1
667,Lesley,3," No, I think it needs to be spontaneous.",1
668,Lesley,3, What do you think.,1
669,Leonard,3," You proposed the experiment, I think you should present your findings first.",1
670,Lesley,3," Fair enough. On the plus side, it was a good kiss, reasonable technique, no extraneous spittle. On the other hand, no arousal. ",1
671,Leonard,3, None?,1
672,Lesley,3, None.,1
673,Leonard,3," Ah. Well, thank you for your time.",1
674,Lesley,3, Thank you. ,1
675,Leonard,3, None at all?,1
676,Scene,3," Sheldon and Leonard‰Ûªs flat. Sheldon, Raj and Howard are playing Jenga. ",1
677,Howard,3," Sheldon, if you were a robot, and I knew and you didn‰Ûªt, would you want me to tell you?",1
678,Sheldon,3," That depends. When I learn that I‰Ûªm a robot, will I be able to handle it?",1
679,Howard,3," Maybe, although the history of science-fiction is not on your side. ",1
680,Sheldon,3," Uh, let me ask you this. When I learn that I‰Ûªm a robot, would I be bound by Asimov‰Ûªs three laws of robotics?",1
681,Raj,3, You might be bound by them right now.,1
682,Howard,3," That‰Ûªs true. Have you ever harmed a human being, or through inaction allowed a human being to come to harm?",1
683,Sheldon,3, Of course not. ,1
684,Howard,3," Have you ever harmed yourself, or allowed yourself to be harmed except in cases where a human being would have been endangered?",1
685,Sheldon,3," Well, no.",1
686,Howard,3, I smell robot. ,1
687,Leonard (entering),3," Hey, what‰Ûªs going on.",1
688,Sheldon,3, The internet‰Ûªs been down for half an hour. ,1
689,Raj,3," Also, Sheldon may be a robot. ",1
690,Howard,3," So, how did it go with Lesley? ",1
691,Leonard,3," Oh, we tried kissing, but the earth didn‰Ûªt move. I mean any more than the 383 miles that it was going to move anyway. ",1
692,Sheldon,3," Oh, I‰Ûªve seen that look before. This is just going to be two weeks of moping and tedious emo songs, and calling me to come down to pet stores to look at cats. I don‰Ûªt know if I can take it. ",1
693,Raj,3, You could power down.,1
694,Howard,3," Well, as usual, Wolowitz has the solution. I happen to know a place where there are plenty of eligible women, and Leonard could have his pick.",1
695,Scene,3, A salsa class. The four guys and a random fat bloke salsa opposite five middle-aged women.,1
696,Class instructor,3," Remember the Latin hips. Shoulders stay still, and we sway. One two three. Five six seven. ",1
697,Howard (to Leonard),3," I think Mrs Tishman‰Ûªs got her eye on you. I‰Ûªve been there, you‰Ûªre in for a treat. ",1
698,Scene,3," The flat, Leonard is entering, singing to himself a depressing emo song.",1
699,Sheldon,3," Oh, good lord.",1
700,Leonard (singing),3," You don‰Ûªt know me, you don‰Ûªt wear my chains‰Û_ God, that‰Ûªs a good song. ",1
701,Sheldon,3," If you‰Ûªre compiling a mix CD for a double suicide. (Leonard is taking supplies out of a bag) Oh, I hope that scratching post is for you.",1
702,Leonard,3," I know what you‰Ûªre thinking, I‰Ûªve taken your asthma into account. There‰Ûªs a feline geneticist in San Diego who has developed the cutest little hypo-allergenic calicos. ",1
703,Sheldon,3," Leonard, listen to me‰Û_",1
704,Leonard,3," I‰Ûªve been thinking about names, I‰Ûªm kind of torn between Einstein, Newton and Sergeant Fuzzyboots. ",1
705,Sheldon,3," Leonard, do you really think you can satisfy your need for a relationship with a genetically altered cat?",1
706,Leonard,3," Maybe, if it‰Ûªs a cute little cuddly cat.",1
707,Sheldon,3," Oh, come on, Leonard! This is obviously about Penny. ",1
708,Leonard,3," It doesn‰Ûªt matter. The woman‰Ûªs not interested in me, the woman rejected me. ",1
709,Sheldon,3," Okay, look, I think that you have as much of a chance of having a sexual relationship with Penny as the Hubble Telescope does of discovering at the centre of every black hole is a little man with a flashlight searching for a circuit breaker. Nevertheless, I do feel obligated to point out to you that she did no reject you. You did not ask her out. ",1
710,Leonard,3," You‰Ûªre right. I didn‰Ûªt ask her out, I should ask her out.",1
711,Sheldon,3," No. No, now that was not my point. My point was, don‰Ûªt buy a cat. ",1
712,Leonard,3," No, but you‰Ûªre right. I should march over there and ask her out. ",1
713,Sheldon,3," Oh, goody, we‰Ûªre getting a cat. ",1
714,Scene,3, The hallway. Leonard knocks on Penny‰Ûªs door. ,1
715,Penny (opening door),3," Ah, hey Leonard.",1
716,Leonard,3," Good afternoon Penny, so hi, hey. Uh‰Û_ I was wondering if you had plans for dinner.",1
717,Penny,3," Uh, do you mean dinner tonight?",1
718,Leonard,3," There is an inherent ambiguity in the word dinner. Technically it refers to the largest meal of the day whenever it is consumed, so, to clarify here, by dinner I mean supper.",1
719,Penny,3, Supper?,1
720,Leonard,3," Or dinner. I was thinking six thirty, if you can go, or a different time.",1
721,Penny,3," Uh, six thirty‰Ûªs great.",1
722,Leonard,3, Really? Great!,1
723,Penny,3," Yeah, I like hanging out with you guys.",1
724,Leonard,3, Us guys?,1
725,Penny,3," You know, Sheldon, Howard, Raj, who all‰Ûªs coming?",1
726,Leonard,3," They‰Û_. might all be there. Or a subset of them might be there, uh, algebraically speaking there are too many unknowns, for example Sheldon had Quizznos for lunch, sometimes he finds that filling, other times he doesn‰Ûªt, it‰Ûªs no fault of Quizznos, they have a varied menu.",1
727,Penny,3," Okay, whatever, it sounds like fun.",1
728,Leonard,3, Great. Did we say a time?,1
729,Penny,3, Six thirty.,1
730,Leonard,3, And that‰Ûªs still good for you.,1
731,Penny,3, It‰Ûªs fine.,1
732,Leonard,3, Cos it‰Ûªs not carved in stone.,1
733,Penny,3," No, six thirty‰Ûªs great.",1
734,Leonard,3, I‰Ûªll get my chisel.,1
735,Penny,3, Why?,1
736,Leonard,3," To‰Û_ carve the‰Û_ okay, I‰Ûªll see you six thirty.",1
737,Scene,3," Sheldon and Leonard‰Ûªs apartment. Leonard enters from bedrooms, dressed in a smart shirt and trousers. They are covered in sweat stains.",1
738,Leonard,3, How do I look?,1
739,Sheldon,3, Could you be more specific?,1
740,Leonard,3, Can you tell I‰Ûªm perspiring a little?,1
741,Sheldon,3, No. The dark crescent-shaped patterns under your arms conceal it nicely. What time is your date?,1
742,Leonard,3, Six thirty. ,1
743,Sheldon,3," Perfect, that gives you two hours and fifteen minutes for that dense molecular cloud of Aramis to dissipate. ",1
744,Leonard,3, Is it too much?,1
745,Sheldon,3, Not if you‰Ûªre a rugby team. ,1
746,Leonard,3," By the way, if it should ever come up, you didn‰Ûªt join us because you stuffed yourself with a chicken carbonara sub at Quizznos. ",1
747,Sheldon,3, Why would I join you?,1
748,Leonard,3," No reason. Oh, you know what, maybe this isn‰Ûªt such a good idea. ",1
749,Sheldon,3," Oh, no, no, no, well now, there‰Ûªs always the possibility that alcohol and poor judgement on her part might lead to a nice romantic evening.",1
750,Leonard,3," You‰Ûªre right, alcohol, poor judgement, it could go well.",1
751,Sheldon,3," Of course, there‰Ûªs the other possibility that this date kicks off a rather unpleasant six months of the two of you passing awkwardly in the hall until one of you breaks down and moves to another zip code.",1
752,Leonard,3, You could have stopped at ‰ÛÏit could go well.‰Û,1
753,Sheldon,3," If I could of, I would of. ",1
754,Leonard,3," I mean, I‰Ûªm a perfectly nice guy. There‰Ûªs no reason we couldn‰Ûªt go to the restaurant and have a lovely dinner. Maybe take a walk afterwards, talk about things we have in common, ‰ÛÏyou love pottery? I love pottery!‰Û You know, there‰Ûªs a pause, we both know what‰Ûªs happening, I lean in, we kiss, it‰Ûªs a little tentative at first but then I realise, she‰Ûªs kissing me back, and she‰Ûªs biting my lower lip, you know, she wants me, this thing is going the distance, we‰Ûªre going to have sex! Oh God! Oh, my God!",1
755,Sheldon,3, Is the sex starting now?,1
756,Leonard,3, I‰Ûªm having a panic attack.,1
757,Sheldon,3," Oh, okay, well then, calm down.",1
758,Leonard,3," If I could calm down I wouldn‰Ûªt be having a panic attack, that‰Ûªs why they call it a panic attack.",1
759,Sheldon,3," Alright, alright, well, just, sit down, yes, sit down, now close your eyes.",1
760,Leonard,3, Why?,1
761,Sheldon,3, Just do it.,1
762,Leonard,3, Okay.,1
763,Sheldon,3, Now try to increase your alpha-wave activity.,1
764,Leonard,3, What?,1
765,Sheldon,3," It‰Ûªs a bio-feedback technique, it‰Ûªs relaxation through brain-wave manipulation, I read a paper about it in the Journal of American Neuroscience, it was a little sparsely sourced but I think the basic science is valid, I probably have it here somewhere.",1
766,Leonard,3," Oh, who am I kidding, I can‰Ûªt go through with this, you need to call her and cancel.",1
767,Sheldon,3, Me?,1
768,Leonard,3, Yes.,1
769,Sheldon,3, What should I tell her.,1
770,Leonard,3, I don‰Ûªt know. Tell her I‰Ûªm sick.,1
771,Sheldon,3, Okay.,1
772,Leonard,3," Not the kind of illness that will make her want to come over and take care of me, but nothing so critical that she‰Ûªll feel uncomfortable going out with me in the future if I want to try this again.",1
773,Sheldon,3, Got it. So I‰Ûªm assuming nothing venereal. I‰Ûªll just tell her that you had a routine colonoscopy and haven‰Ûªt quite bounced back.,1
774,Leonard,3, Give me the phone. ,1
775,Sheldon,3, But I thought you wanted to cancel?,1
776,Leonard,3, I can‰Ûªt because if I don‰Ûªt show up she‰Ûªll still be expecting you.,1
777,Sheldon,3, Why would she be expecting me? ,1
778,Leonard,3," Stop asking me all these questions, I need to take another shower.",1
779,Scene,3, A restaurant.,1
780,Penny,3, So are the rest of the guys meeting us here?,1
781,Leonard,3," Oh, yeah, no. Turns out that Raj and Howard had to work, and Sheldon had a colonoscopy and he hasn‰Ûªt quite bounced back yet. ",1
782,Penny,3," Ooh, my uncle just had a colonoscopy.",1
783,Leonard,3," You‰Ûªre kidding, well, then, that‰Ûªs something we have in common. ",1
784,Penny,3, How?,1
785,Leonard,3, We both have people in our lives who‰Û_ want to nip intestinal polyps in the bud. ,1
786,Penny,3," So, what‰Ûªs new in the world of physics?",1
787,Leonard,3, Nothing.,1
788,Penny,3," Really, nothing?",1
789,Leonard,3," Well, with the exception of string theory, not much has happened since the 1930‰Ûªs, and you can‰Ûªt prove string theory, at best you can say ‰ÛÏhey, look, my idea has an internal logical consistency.‰Û",1
790,Penny,3, Ah. Well I‰Ûªm sure things will pick up. ,1
791,Leonard,3, What‰Ûªs new at the Cheesecake Factory?,1
792,Penny,3," Oh, uh, not much. We do have a chocolate key lime that‰Ûªs moving pretty well. ",1
793,Leonard,3," Good. Good. And what about your, uh, hallway friend.",1
794,Penny,3," Doug? Oh, yeah, I dunno, I mean, he‰Ûªs nice and funny, but‰Û_",1
795,Waitress,3, Can I get you started with some drinks?,1
796,Leonard,3," No, (waves her away) You were saying, but‰Û_",1
797,Penny,3, I‰Ûªd like a drink.,1
798,Leonard,3, Just say the but thing about Doug and then I‰Ûªll get her back. ,1
799,Penny,3," Okay, well, you know, it‰Ûªs just me. I‰Ûªm still getting over this break-up with Kurt, and this thing with Doug would be just rebound sex.",1
800,Leonard,3," Ugh, don‰Ûªt get me started on rebound sex.",1
801,Penny,3," It‰Ûªs just, it‰Ûªs my pattern. I break up, then I find some cute guy, and then it‰Ûªs just thirty six meaningless of‰Û_ well, you know. ",1
802,Leonard,3," I‰Ûªm not sure that I do. Um, is that one thirty-six hour experience, or is it thirty six hours spread out over say, one‰Û_ glorious summer.",1
803,Penny,3," No, it‰Ûªs usually over a weekend, and trust me, you do not feel good after it.",1
804,Leonard,3," Well, chafing, right?",1
805,Penny,3, Emotionally.,1
806,Leonard,3," Of course, yeah, emotional chafing. Hey, do you want to see something cool? (Penny nods.) I can make this olive go into this glass without touching it. ",1
807,Penny,3, How?,1
808,Leonard,3, Physics. (He places the glass over the olive and spins it until the olive gets caught up on the side).,1
809,Penny,3," Wow, centrifugal force!",1
810,Leonard,3," Actually, it‰Ûªs centripetal force, which is an inward force generated by the glass acting on the olive. (The olive drops.) Excuse me. (Leonard disappears under table.)Now, if you were riding on the olive, you‰Ûªd be in a non-inertial reference frame, and would (he bangs his head on the underside of the table.)",1
811,Penny,3, Are you okay?,1
812,Leonard,3," Yeah, I‰Ûªm okay. Did you spill ketchup?",1
813,Penny,3, No.,1
814,Leonard,3, I‰Ûªm not okay.,1
815,Scene,3, The stairwell of the apartment building.,1
816,Penny,3, Are you sure you don‰Ûªt want to go to the emergency room?,1
817,Leonard,3," No, no, I‰Ûªm okay, it‰Ûªs stopped bleeding.",1
818,Penny,3," I know, but you did throw up. Isn‰Ûªt that a sign of a concussion?",1
819,Leonard,3," Yes, but I get car sick too, so‰Û_",1
820,Penny,3, Okay.,1
821,Leonard,3," Sorry about your car, by the way.",1
822,Penny,3," Oh, no, it‰Ûªs fine, you got most of it out the window. ",1
823,Leonard,3, The poor guy on the bike. I had a nice time.,1
824,Penny,3," Yeah, me too. Um, good night. (Leonard turns across hallway.) Leonard?",1
825,Leonard,3, Yeah.,1
826,Penny,3, Was this supposed to be a date?,1
827,Leonard,3," This? No. No, of course not, this was just you and me hanging out with a bunch of guys who didn‰Ûªt show up, because of work and a colonoscopy.",1
828,Penny,3," Okay, I was just checking.",1
829,Leonard,3," When I take a girl out on a date, and I do, she knows she‰Ûªs been dated. Capital D. Bold face, underline, like Day-ted. I think I might have a little concussion, I‰Ûªm going to go lay down for a while, good night. ",1
830,Scene,3," The apartment, Leonard enters.",1
831,Sheldon,3," So, how was your date?",1
832,Leonard,3, Awesome!,1
833,Sheldon,3, Score one for liquor and poor judgement.,1
834,Teleplay,3, Bill Prady & Steven Molaro,1
835, Story,3, Chuck Lorre,1
836,Scene,4, Sheldon and Leonard‰Ûªs apartment.,1
837,Sheldon,4, I‰Ûªve been thinking about time travel again.,1
838,Leonard,4," Why, did you hit a roadblock with invisibility?",1
839,Sheldon,4," Put it on the back burner. Anyway, it occurs to me, if I ever did perfect a time machine, I‰Ûªd just go into the past and give it to myself, thus eliminating the need for me to invent it in the first place.",1
840,Leonard,4, Interesting.,1
841,Sheldon,4," Yeah, it really takes the pressure off. ",1
842,Leonard,4," Sounds like a breakthrough, should I call the science magazines and tell them to hold the front cover? (Exiting the apartment.)",1
843,Sheldon,4," It‰Ûªs time travel, Leonard, I will have already done that. ",1
844,Leonard,4, Then I guess congratulations are in order.,1
845,Sheldon,4," No, congratulations will have been in order. You know, I‰Ûªm not going to enjoy this party.",1
846,Leonard,4," I know, I‰Ûªm familiar with you.",1
847,Sheldon,4," At the last department party, Dr Finkleday cornered me and talked about spelunking for 45 minutes.",1
848,Leonard,4," Yes, I was there.",1
849,Sheldon,4," You know what‰Ûªs interesting about caves, Leonard?",1
850,Leonard,4, What?,1
851,Sheldon,4, Nothing.,1
852,Leonard,4," Well then we‰Ûªll avoid Finkleday, we‰Ûªll meet the new department head, congratulate him, shake his hand and go. ",1
853,Sheldon,4," How‰Ûªs this? Pleased to meet you, Dr Gablehouser. How fortunate for you that the University has chosen to hire you, despite the fact that you‰Ûªve done no original research in 25 years, and instead have written a series of popular books that reduce the great concepts of science to a series of anecdotes, each one dumbed down to accommodate the duration of an average bowel movement. Mahalo.",1
854,Leonard,4, Mahalo‰Ûªs a nice touch. ,1
855,Sheldon,4, Do you know there are only eight consonants in the Hawaiian language.,1
856,Leonard,4," Interesting, you should lead with that.",1
857,Scene,4," The department party. Sheldon, Raj and Leonard are at the buffet table. ",1
858,Raj,4," Oh, God, Look at this buffet. I love America.",1
859,Leonard,4, You don‰Ûªt have buffets in India?,1
860,Raj,4," Of course, but it‰Ûªs all Indian food. You can‰Ûªt find a bagel in Mumbai to save your life. Schmear me.",1
861,Sheldon,4, Well here‰Ûªs an interesting turn of events.,1
862,Leonard,4, What. (Sees Howard entering with a statuesque blonde) Howard brought a date?,1
863,Sheldon,4, A more plausible explanation is that his work in robotics has made an amazing leap forward.,1
864,Howard,4," Hey, what up, science bitches? May I introduce my special lady friend, Summer. (Puts arm around her.)",1
865,Summer,4," I already told you, touching‰Ûªs extra.",1
866,Howard,4, Right. Sorry.,1
867,Leonard (to Sheldon),4," Here comes our new boss, be polite.",1
868,Gablehouser,4," Hi fellas, Eric Gablehouser.",1
869,Howard,4, Howard Wolowitz.,1
870,Gablehouser,4," Howard, nice to meet you, and you are?",1
871,Sheldon,4, An actual real scientist. (To Leonard) How was that?,1
872,Scene,4, The stairwell of the apartment building. Sheldon is carrying a box of his things.,1
873,Sheldon,4, I can‰Ûªt believe he fired me.,1
874,Leonard,4," Well, you did call him a glorified high-school science teacher whose last successful experiment was lighting his own farts.",1
875,Sheldon,4," In my defence, I prefaced that by saying ‰ÛÏwith all due respect.‰Û",1
876,Scene,4," The apartment, Sheldon is in the kitchen cooking, Leonard enters.",1
877,Leonard,4, Morning,1
878,Sheldon,4, Morning.,1
879,Leonard,4, You‰Ûªre making eggs for breakfast?,1
880,Sheldon,4," This isn‰Ûªt breakfast, it‰Ûªs an experiment. ",1
881,Leonard,4, Huh? Cos it looks a lot like breakfast.,1
882,Sheldon,4," I finally have the time to test my hypothesis, about the separation of the water molecules from the egg proteins, and its impact vis-a-vis taste.",1
883,Leonard,4, Sounds yummy. I look forward to your work with bacon.,1
884,Sheldon,4, As do I.,1
885,Leonard,4," You know, I‰Ûªm sure if you just apologised to Gablehauser he would give you your job back.",1
886,Sheldon,4," I don‰Ûªt want my job back. I‰Ûªve spent the last three and a half years staring at greaseboards full of equations. Before that I spent four years working on my thesis. Before that I was in college, and before that, I was in the fifth grade. This is my first day off in decades, and I‰Ûªm going to savour it.",1
887,Leonard,4, Okay. I‰Ûªll let you get back to fixing your eggs.,1
888,Sheldon,4," I‰Ûªm not just fixing my eggs, I‰Ûªm fixing everyone‰Ûªs eggs.",1
889,Leonard,4, And we all thank you.,1
890,Sheldon,4, Use new eggs. (There is a knock on the door).,1
891,Penny (popping her head round),4," Hi, hey. I‰Ûªm running out to the market, do you guys need anything?",1
892,Sheldon,4," Oh, well this would be one of those circumstances that people unfamiliar with the law of large numbers would call a coincidence.",1
893,Penny,4, I‰Ûªm sorry?,1
894,Sheldon,4, I need eggs. Four dozen should suffice.,1
895,Penny,4, Four dozen?,1
896,Sheldon,4," Yes, and evenly distributed amongst brown, white, free range, large, extra-large and jumbo.",1
897,Penny,4," Okay, one more time?",1
898,Sheldon,4," Never mind, you won‰Ûªt get it right, I‰Ûªd better come with you.",1
899,Penny,4," Oh, yay!",1
900,Scene,4, Penny‰Ûªs car,1
901,Penny,4, How come you didn‰Ûªt go into work today.,1
902,Sheldon,4," I‰Ûªm taking a sabbatical, because I won‰Ûªt kow-tow to mediocre minds. ",1
903,Penny,4," So you got canned, huh?",1
904,Sheldon,4, Theoretical physicists do not get canned. But yeah. ,1
905,Penny,4," Well, maybe it‰Ûªs all for the best, you know I always say, when one door closes, another one opens. ",1
906,Sheldon,4," No it doesn‰Ûªt. Not unless the two doors are connected by relays, or there are motion sensors involved. ",1
907,Penny,4," No, no, I meant‰Û_",1
908,Sheldon,4, Or the first door closing causes a change of air pressure that acts upon the second door.,1
909,Penny,4, Never mind. ,1
910,Sheldon,4," Slow down. Slow down, please slow down.",1
911,Penny,4, We‰Ûªre fine.,1
912,Sheldon,4," Look, you‰Ûªre not leaving yourself enough space between cars.",1
913,Penny,4," Oh, sure I am.",1
914,Sheldon,4," No, no. Let me do the math for you, this car weighs let‰Ûªs say 4,000lb, now add say 140 for me, 120 for you.",1
915,Penny,4, 120?,1
916,Sheldon,4," Oh, I‰Ûªm sorry, did I insult you? Is your body mass somehow tied into your self worth?",1
917,Penny,4," Well, yeah.",1
918,Sheldon,4," Interesting. Anyway, that gives us a total weight of, let‰Ûªs say, 4,400lb.",1
919,Penny,4," Let‰Ûªs say 4,390. ",1
920,Sheldon,4," Fine. We‰Ûªre travelling forward at, good Lord, 51 miles an hour. Now let‰Ûªs assume that your brakes are new and the callipers are aligned, still, by the time we come to a stop, we‰Ûªll be occupying the same space as that Buick in front of us, an impossibility that nature will quickly resolve into death, mutilation and‰Û_ oh look, they built a new put-put course.",1
921,Scene,4, The supermarket.,1
922,Sheldon,4," This is great. Look at me, out in the real world of ordinary people, just living their ordinary, colourless, workaday lives. ",1
923,Penny,4, Thank you.,1
924,Sheldon,4," No, thank you. And thank you, ordinary person. Hey, you want to hear an interesting thing about tomatoes.",1
925,Penny,4," Uh, no, no not really. Listen, didn‰Ûªt you say you needed some eggs. ",1
926,Sheldon,4," Uh, yes, but anyone who knows anything about the dynamics of bacterial growth knows to pick up their refrigerated foods on the way out of the supermarket.",1
927,Penny,4," Oh, okay, well maybe you should start heading on out then. ",1
928,Sheldon,4," No, this is fun. Oh, the thing about tomatoes, and I think you‰Ûªll really enjoy this, is, they‰Ûªre shelved with the vegetables, but they‰Ûªre technically a fruit. ",1
929,Penny,4, Interesting.,1
930,Sheldon,4, Isn‰Ûªt it?,1
931,Penny,4," No, I mean what you find enjoyable. ",1
932,Sheldon (as Penny selects vitamin supplements),4, Oh boy.,1
933,Penny,4, What now?,1
934,Sheldon,4," Well, there‰Ûªs some value to taking a multivitamin, but the human body can only absorb so much, what you‰Ûªre buying here are the ingredients for very expensive urine. ",1
935,Penny,4," Well, maybe that‰Ûªs what I was going for. ",1
936,Sheldon,4, Well then you‰Ûªll want some manganese.,1
937,Scene,4, On the stairwell of the apartment building. ,1
938,Sheldon,4, That was fun. Maybe tomorrow we can go to one of those big warehouse stores. ,1
939,Penny,4," Oh, I don‰Ûªt know Sheldon, it‰Ûªs going to take me a while to recover from all the fun I had today. ",1
940,Sheldon,4," Are you sure. There are a lot of advantages to buying in bulk. For example, I noticed that you purchase your tampons one month‰Ûªs supply at a time.",1
941,Penny,4, What?,1
942,Sheldon,4," Well think about it, it‰Ûªs a product that doesn‰Ûªt spoil, and you‰Ûªre going to be needing them for at least the next thirty years.",1
943,Penny,4, You want me to buy thirty years worth of tampons?,1
944,Sheldon,4," Well, thirty, thirty five, hey, when did your mother go into menopause?",1
945,Penny,4," Okay, I‰Ûªm not talking about this with you.",1
946,Sheldon,4," Oh, Penny, this is a natural human process, and we‰Ûªre talking about statistically significant savings. Now, if you assume 15 tampons per cycle and a 28 day cycle, are you fairly regular? (Penny shuts door in his face.) Okay, no warehouse store, but we‰Ûªre still on for put-put golf, right?",1
947,Scene,4," The apartment, Sheldon has several bowls containing goldfish. ",1
948,Leonard (entering),4," Hey, I just ran into Penny, she seemed upset about something.",1
949,Sheldon,4, I think it‰Ûªs her time of the month. I marked the calendar for future reference. ,1
950,Leonard,4, What‰Ûªs with the fish?,1
951,Sheldon,4, It‰Ûªs an experiment. ,1
952,Leonard,4, What happened to your scrambled egg research?,1
953,Sheldon,4," Oh, that was a dead end. Scrambled eggs are as good as they‰Ûªre ever going to be.",1
954,Leonard,4, So‰Û_ fish. ,1
955,Sheldon,4," I read an article about Japanese scientists, who inserted DNA from luminous jellyfish into other animals, and I thought hey, fish nightlights.",1
956,Leonard,4, Fish nightlights.,1
957,Sheldon,4, It‰Ûªs a billion dollar idea. Shhhhh!,1
958,Leonard,4," Mum‰Ûªs the word. Sheldon, are you sure you don‰Ûªt want to just apologise to Gablehauser and get your job back.",1
959,Sheldon,4," Oh, no, no, no. No, I‰Ûªve too much to do.",1
960,Leonard,4, Like luminous fish.,1
961,Sheldon,4, Shhhhh!,1
962,Leonard,4, Right‰Û_ I didn‰Ûªt‰Û_.,1
963,Sheldon,4," That‰Ûªs just the beginning. I also have an idea for a bulk mail-order feminine hygiene company. Oh, glow in the dark tampons! Leonard, we‰Ûªre going to be rich. ",1
964,Scene,4, The stairwell of the apartment building. ,1
965,Leonard,4, Thank you for coming on such short notice.,1
966,Mrs Cooper,4, You did the right thing calling.,1
967,Leonard,4," I didn‰Ûªt know what else to do, he‰Ûªs lost all focus, every day he‰Ûªs got a new obsession. (They enter the apartment. Sheldon is weaving on a loom. He is wrapped in a poncho.) This is a particularly disturbing one. ",1
968,Sheldon (looking round),4, Mommy.,1
969,Mrs Cooper,4, Hi baby.,1
970,Sheldon (mouths),4, You called my mother?,1
971,Mrs Cooper,4," Oh, you got yourself a loom, how nice.",1
972,Sheldon,4, Thank you.,1
973,Mrs Cooper,4," Honey, why did you get a loom?",1
974,Sheldon,4," I was working with luminous fish, and I thought, hey, loom! Mom, what are you doing here?",1
975,Mrs Cooper,4, Leonard called me. ,1
976,Sheldon,4," I know, but why?",1
977,Leonard,4, Because one of the great minds of the twenty-first century is raising glow-in-the-dark fish and weaving sarapes. ,1
978,Sheldon,4," This is not a sarape. This is a poncho. A sarape is open at the sides, a poncho is closed, this is a poncho, and neither is a reason to call someone‰Ûªs mother. ",1
979,Leonard,4," Really, when was the last time you left the house.",1
980,Sheldon,4, I went to the market with Penny.,1
981,Leonard,4, That was three weeks ago.,1
982,Sheldon,4," Well then buckle up, in the next four to eight days she‰Ûªs going to get very crabby.",1
983,Mrs Cooper,4," Sweetheart, your little friend is concerned about you.",1
984,Sheldon,4," Yes, well I‰Ûªm not a child, I‰Ûªm a grown man capable of living my life as I see fit. And I certainly don‰Ûªt need someone telling on me to my mother. ",1
985,Leonard,4, Where are you going?,1
986,Sheldon,4," To my room, and no-one‰Ûªs allowed in. ",1
987,Mrs Cooper,4, He gets his temper from his daddy.,1
988,Leonard,4, Oh. ,1
989,Mrs Cooper,4, He‰Ûªs got my eyes.,1
990,Leonard,4, I see.,1
991,Mrs Cooper,4," All that science stuff, that comes from Jesus. ",1
992,Scene,4, Everyone but Sheldon is in the kitchen of the apartment.,1
993,Leonard,4, Sheldon? Your mum made dinner.,1
994,Sheldon (off),4, I‰Ûªm not hungry. ,1
995,Mrs Cooper,4," Oh, Leonard, don‰Ûªt trouble yourself, he‰Ûªs stubborn. He may stay in there ‰Û÷til the Rapture.",1
996,Penny,4, Are we so sure that‰Ûªs a bad thing?,1
997,Mrs Cooper,4," I‰Ûªll tell ya, I love the boy to death, but he has been difficult since he fell out of me at the K-Mart. ",1
998,Howard,4," Excuse me for being so bold, but I now see where Sheldon gets his smouldering good looks.",1
999,Mrs Cooper,4," Oh, honey that ain‰Ûªt going to work, but you keep trying. (To Raj) I made chicken, I hope that isn‰Ûªt one of the animals that you people think is magic? You know, we have an Indian gentleman at our church, a Dr Patel, it‰Ûªs a beautiful story, the lord spoke to him, and moved him to give us all 20% off on lasic, you know, those that needed it. ",1
1000,Leonard,4," That is a lovely story, um, are we going to do anything about Sheldon?",1
1001,Mrs Cooper,4," Oh, we will, you have to take your time with Sheldon. His father, God rest his soul, used to say to me, Mary, you have to take your time with Sheldon. ",1
1002,Leonard,4, Sounds like a wise man.,1
1003,Mrs Cooper,4," Oh, not so wise, he was trying to fight a bobcat for some licquorish. So, everybody grab a plate, and a pretty place mat that Shelly wove. ",1
1004,Penny,4, Has Shelly ever freaked out like this before.,1
1005,Mrs Cooper,4," Oh, all the time, I remember one summer when he was thirteen, he built a small nuclear reactor in the shed and told everybody he was going to provide free electricity for the whole town, well the only problem was he had no, whatchacall, fissionable materials. Anyway, when he went on the internets to get some, a man from the government came by and sat him down real gentle and told him it‰Ûªs against the law to have yellow cake uranium in a shed. ",1
1006,Penny,4, What happened?,1
1007,Mrs Cooper,4," Well, the poor boy had a fit, locked himself in his room and built a sonic death ray. ",1
1008,Leonard,4, A death ray?,1
1009,Mrs Cooper,4," Well, that‰Ûªs what he called it, didn‰Ûªt even slow down the neighbour kids. It pissed our dog off to no end. You know, you two make a cute couple. ",1
1010,Leonard,4," No, we‰Ûªre not, we‰Ûªre not, not a couple, two singles, like those individually wrapped slices of cheese that‰Û_. are friends.",1
1011,Mrs Cooper,4, Did I pluck a nerve there?,1
1012,Howard,4, Oh yeah.,1
1013,Mrs Cooper,4," Okay. Alright everybody, it‰Ûªs time to eat. (Everybody begins to do so) Oh Lord, we thank you for this meal, all your bounty, and we pray that you help Sheldon get back on his rocker. (To Raj and Howard) Now after a moment of silent meditation I‰Ûªm going to end with ‰ÛÏIn Jesus‰Ûª Name‰Û but you two don‰Ûªt feel any obligation to join in. Unless, of course, the holy spirit moves you. ",1
1014,Penny,4," Oh my God, this is the best cobbler I‰Ûªve ever had.",1
1015,Mrs Cooper,4, It was always Sheldon‰Ûª s favourite. You know what the secret ingredient is?,1
1016,Penny,4, Love?,1
1017,Mrs Cooper,4, Lard.,1
1018,Howard,4," Hey, look who‰Ûªs come out‰Û_.",1
1019,Mrs Cooper,4," Shhh! You‰Ûªll spook him. He‰Ûªs like a baby deer, you gotta let him come to you.",1
1020,Leonard,4," This is ridiculous. Dammit, Sheldon, snap out of it. You‰Ûªre a physicist, you belong at the University doing research, not hiding in your room. (Sheldon scuttles away)",1
1021,Mrs Cooper,4," You don‰Ûªt hunt, do you?",1
1022,Scene,4, Sheldon‰Ûªs bedroom. He is building a model of some kind of double helix. There is a knock on the door.,1
1023,Mrs Cooper (entering),4," Good morning, snicker-doodle. ",1
1024,Sheldon,4, Morning.,1
1025,Mrs Cooper,4," Oh, well that looks awful fancy, what is that?",1
1026,Sheldon,4, It‰Ûªs my idea of what DNA would look like in a silicon based life form. ,1
1027,Mrs Cooper,4," But intelligently designed by a creator, right?",1
1028,Sheldon,4," What do you want, mom?",1
1029,Mrs Cooper,4, You know how your daddy used to say that you can only fish for so long before you got to throw a stick of dynamite in the water?,1
1030,Sheldon,4, Yeah.,1
1031,Mrs Cooper,4," Well, I‰Ûªm done fishing. (Throwing a pair of trousers on the bed) You put those on.",1
1032,Sheldon,4, What for?,1
1033,Mrs Cooper,4," Because you‰Ûªre going to go down to your office, you‰Ûªre going to apologise to your boss, and get your job back. ",1
1034,Sheldon,4, No.,1
1035,Mrs Cooper,4," I‰Ûªm sorry, did I start that sentence with the words ‰ÛÏif it please your highness?‰Û",1
1036,Sheldon,4," I‰Ûªm not going to apologise, I didn‰Ûªt say anything that wasn‰Ûªt true. ",1
1037,Mrs Cooper,4," Now you listen here, I have been telling you since you were four years old, it‰Ûªs okay to be smarter than everybody but you can‰Ûªt go around pointing it out.",1
1038,Sheldon,4, Why not?,1
1039,Mrs Cooper,4," Because people don‰Ûªt like it. Remember all the ass-kickings you got from the neighbour kids? Now let‰Ûªs get cracking. Shower, shirt, shoes, and let‰Ûªs shove off. (Exits)",1
1040,Sheldon,4, Wouldn‰Ûªt have been any ass-kickings if that stupid death ray had worked.,1
1041,Scene,4, The kitchen,1
1042,Mrs Cooper,4, Problem solved. ,1
1043,Leonard,4, Really? That‰Ûªs impressive.,1
1044,Mrs Cooper,4," Leonard, the Lord never gives us more than we can handle. Thankfully he blessed me with two other children who are dumb as soup. ",1
1045,Scene,4, Dr Gablehouser‰Ûªs office,1
1046,Mrs Cooper,4," Excuse me, Dr Gablehouser, are you busy?",1
1047,Gablehouser,4," Well, actually‰Û_.",1
1048,Mrs Cooper,4," Sheldon, he‰Ûªs just doodling, get in here. ",1
1049,Sheldon,4, Dr Gablehouser.,1
1050,Gablehouser,4, Dr Cooper.,1
1051,Mrs Cooper,4," Let‰Ûªs go, baby, we‰Ûªre losing daylight. ",1
1052,Sheldon,4," Um, as you know, several weeks ago in our first encounter we may have gotten off on the wrong foot, when I called you an idiot. And I just wanted to say that I was wrong. To point it out. ",1
1053,Gablehouser (to Mrs Cooper),4," I‰Ûªm sorry, we haven‰Ûªt been introduced. Dr Eric Gablehouser.",1
1054,Mrs Cooper,4," Mary Cooper, Sheldon‰Ûªs mom.",1
1055,Gablehouser,4," Now that‰Ûªs impossible, you must have had him when you were a teenager. ",1
1056,Mrs Cooper,4," Oh, aren‰Ûªt you sweet, his father‰Ûªs dead. ",1
1057,Gablehouser,4, Recently?,1
1058,Mrs Cooper,4, Long enough. ,1
1059,Gablehouser (indicating chair),4," Please. Sheldon, shouldn‰Ûªt you be working?",1
1060,Sheldon (leaving),4, Okay.,1
1061,Leonard,4," Hey, how did it go?",1
1062,Sheldon,4, I got my job back.,1
1063,Leonard,4, Really? What happened?,1
1064,Sheldon,4, I‰Ûªm not quite sure. It involves a part of the human experience that has always eluded me. ,1
1065,Leonard,4, That narrows it down. ,1
1066,Scene,4, Sheldon‰Ûªs bedroom. Mrs Cooper is tucking him in.,1
1067,Mrs Cooper,4," I‰Ûªm very proud of you honey, you showed a lot of courage today.",1
1068,Sheldon,4," Thanks, mom. Mom?",1
1069,Mrs Cooper,4, Mmm-hmm?,1
1070,Sheldon,4, Is Dr Gablehouser going to be my new daddy?,1
1071,Mrs Cooper,4, We‰Ûªll see. Sleep tight. ,1

1075,Sheldon,5," Alright, I‰Ûªm moving my infantry division, augmented by a battalion of Orcs from Lord of the Rings, we flank the Tennessee Volunteers, and the North once again wins the Battle of Gettysburg.",1
1076,Howard,5," Not so fast, remember the South still has two infantry divisions, plus Superman and Godzilla.",1
1077,Leonard,5," No, no, no, no, Orcs are magic, Superman is vulnerable to magic, not to mention, you already lost Godzilla to the Illinois Cavalry and Hulk.",1
1078,Raj,5, Why don‰Ûªt you just have Robert E. Lee charge the line with Shiva and Ganesh.,1
1079,Penny,5," Hi, you guys ready to order?",1
1080,Howard,5," Hang on, honey. Shiva and Ganesh? The Hindu Gods against the entire Union army?",1
1081,Leonard,5, And Orcs!,1
1082,Penny,5, I‰Ûªll be back.,1
1083,Raj,5," Excuse me, Ganesh is the remover of obstacles, and Shiva is the destroyer. When the smoke clears, Abraham Lincoln will be speaking Hindi and drinking mint juleps. ",1
1084,Penny,5," Alright, my boss says you either have to order, or leave and never come back. ",1
1085,Howard,5, What do you recommend for someone who worked up a man-sized appetite from a morning of weight training and cardio-funk?,1
1086,Penny,5, A shower. ,1
1087,Howard,5, I‰Ûªll take the heart smart platter.,1
1088,Penny,5," Alright, thank you, and Sheldon.",1
1089,Sheldon,5," We don‰Ûªt eat here, I don‰Ûªt know what‰Ûªs good.",1
1090,Penny,5," Well, it‰Ûªs all good. ",1
1091,Sheldon,5, Statistically unlikely. ,1
1092,Leonard,5," Just get a hamburger, you like hamburgers.",1
1093,Sheldon,5," I like the hamburgers where we usually have hamburgers, you can‰Ûªt make the assumption that I‰Ûªll like the hamburgers here. ",1
1094,Leonard,5, I‰Ûªm sorry. Give him a hamburger. ,1
1095,Penny,5," Uh, which one, the Classic Burger, the Ranch House Burger, the Barbecue Burger or the Kobe burger?",1
1096,Sheldon,5, Can‰Ûªt we just go to Big Boy? They only have one burger. The Big Boy. ,1
1097,Penny,5, The Barbecue Burger is like the Big Boy. ,1
1098,Sheldon,5," Excuse me, in a world that already includes the Big Boy, why would I settle for something like a Big Boy?",1
1099,Penny,5, Because you are not at Big Boy!,1
1100,Sheldon,5," Fine, I‰Ûªll have the Barbecue Burger. ",1
1101,Leonard,5, Make it two. ,1
1102,Sheldon,5, Waitresses don‰Ûªt yell at you at Big Boy. ,1
1103,Lesley (entering),5," Hey Leonard, hi guys. ",1
1104,Leonard,5, Hey Lesley. ,1
1105,Lesley,5, I didn‰Ûªt know you ate here.,1
1106,Sheldon,5, We don‰Ûªt. This is a disturbing aberration. ,1
1107,Leonard,5," Lesley, this is Penny, she lives across the hall from Sheldon and me. ",1
1108,Howard,5, And walks in quiet beauty like the night. ,1
1109,Penny,5," Howard, I‰Ûªve asked you not to do that. ",1
1110,Leonard,5, Lesley and I do research together at the University. ,1
1111,Penny,5," Oh, wow, a girl scientist. ",1
1112,Lesley,5," Yep, come for the breasts, stay for the brains. So, I‰Ûªm glad I ran into you, the physics department string quartet needs a new cellist. ",1
1113,Leonard,5, What happened to Elliot Wong?,1
1114,Lesley,5," He switched over to high energy radiation research, had a little mishap, and now the other guys are uncomfortable sitting next to him. So, are you in?",1
1115,Leonard,5," Yeah, sure, why not.",1
1116,Lesley,5," Great, we rehearse on Tuesdays at your place.",1
1117,Leonard,5, Why at my place?,1
1118,Lesley,5," Yeah, the department of energy said our regular space is kind of a hot zone. Nice meeting you.",1
1119,Penny,5," Yeah, you too. Leonard, I didn‰Ûªt know you played the cello?",1
1120,Leonard,5," Yeah, my parents felt that naming me Leonard and putting me in advanced placement classes wasn‰Ûªt getting me beaten up enough. ",1
1121,Howard,5," If you‰Ûªre into music, I happen to be a human beatbox. ",1
1122,Penny,5," Really? (Howard performs some of the worst beatboxing imaginable.) I‰Ûªm actually not that into music. So hey, your friend‰Ûªs really cute, anything going on with you two. ",1
1123,Leonard,5," Lesley? No, no-oh, what are you kidding?",1
1124,Sheldon,5," He asked her out once, it was an embarrassing failure. ",1
1125,Leonard,5, Thank you Sheldon.,1
1126,Sheldon,5," Oh, I‰Ûªm sorry, was that supposed to be a secret?",1
1127,Penny,5," Oh, that‰Ûªs too bad, you guys would make a cute couple. ",1
1128,Raj,5, Oh dear.,1
1129,Howard,5, What‰Ûªs the matter?,1
1130,Raj,5, She didn‰Ûªt take my order.,1
1131,Howard,5, How can she take your order when you‰Ûªre too neurotic to talk to her.,1
1132,Raj,5," Nevertheless, this will be reflected in her tip. ",1
1133,Scene,5, The stairwell of the apartment building.,1
1134,Leonard,5," What did Penny mean, you‰Ûªd make a cute couple?",1
1135,Sheldon,5," Well I assume she meant that the two of you together would constitute a couple that others might consider cute. An alternate, and somewhat less likely interpretation, is that you could manufacture one. As in, oh look, Leonard and Lesley made Mr and Mrs Goldfarb, aren‰Ûªt they adorable. ",1
1136,Leonard,5," If Penny didn‰Ûªt know that Lesley had already turned me down then that would unambiguously mean that she, Penny, thought that I should her, Lesley, out, indicating that she, Penny, had no interest in me asking her, Penny, out. But because she did know that I had asked Lesley out and that she, Lesley, had turned me down then she, Penny, could be offering consolation. That‰Ûªs too bad, you would have made a cute couple. But while thinking, good, Leonard remains available. ",1
1137,Sheldon,5," You‰Ûªre a lucky man, Leonard. ",1
1138,Leonard,5, How so?,1
1139,Sheldon,5, You‰Ûªre talking to one of the three men in the Western hemisphere capable of following that train of thought. ,1
1140,Leonard,5," Well, what do you think.",1
1141,Sheldon,5," I said I could follow it, I didn‰Ûªt say I cared.",1
1142,Scene,5, The apartment living room. The string quartet are practising. ,1
1143,Lesley,5, I admire your fingering. ,1
1144,Leonard,5, Thank you.,1
1145,Lesley,5, Maybe some time you can try that on my instrument. ,1
1146,Lesley,5," Goodnight guys, good job.",1
1147,Male string quartettist,5, Thanks.,1
1148,Female string quartettist,5, See you next week.,1
1149,Leonard,5," That was fun, Lesley, thanks for including me. ",1
1150,Lesley,5, You‰Ûªre welcome. If you‰Ûªre up for it we could practise that middle section again.,1
1151,Leonard,5," Uh, sure, why not. ",1
1152,Lesley,5," Just so we‰Ûªre clear, you understand that me hanging back to practise with you is a pretext for letting you know that I‰Ûªm sexually available. ",1
1153,Leonard,5, Really?,1
1154,Lesley,5," Yeah, I‰Ûªm good to go. ",1
1155,Leonard,5, I thought you weren‰Ûªt interested in me.,1
1156,Lesley,5, That was before I saw you handling that beautiful piece of wood between your legs. ,1
1157,Leonard,5, You mean my cello?,1
1158,Lesley,5," No, I mean the obvious crude double entendre. I‰Ûªm seducing you.",1
1159,Leonard,5, No kidding?,1
1160,Lesley,5," What can I say, I‰Ûªm a passionate and impulsive woman. So how about it?",1
1161,Leonard,5," Gee, uh‰Û_",1
1162,Lesley,5, Is it the waitress?,1
1163,Leonard,5, Penny? What about her?,1
1164,Lesley,5," Well, I thought I saw your pupils dilate when you looked at her, which, unless you‰Ûªre a heroin addict, points to sexual attraction.",1
1165,Leonard,5," Well, I did have a poppy seed bagel for breakfast, which could give a positive urine test for opiates but certainly not dilate my pupils, so I guess there‰Ûªs no point in bringing it up. ",1
1166,Lesley,5, You and the waitress then?,1
1167,Leonard,5," No. No, there‰Ûªs nothing going on between Penny and me.",1
1168,Lesley,5," So, you‰Ûªre open to a sexual relationship?",1
1169,Leonard,5," Yeah. Yeah, I guess I am. ",1
1170,Lesley,5, Good. ,1
1171,Leonard,5," Yeah, yeah it is good. Did you want to start now?",1
1172,Lesley,5, Why don‰Ûªt we finish the section first.,1
1173,Leonard,5, Oh. Okay. A little musical foreplay. Terrific. ,1
1174,Leonard,5," I‰Ûªm good, I‰Ûªm good to go. ",1
1175,Lesley,5, Me too. (Exit in direction of bedrooms.),1
1176,Scene,5," The hallway, Sheldon scuttles out of apartment door and crosses to Penny‰Ûªs. Knocks on it urgently.",1
1177,Penny (opening door),5," Oh, hey Sheldon, what‰Ûªs going on?",1
1178,Sheldon,5, I need your opinion on a matter of semiotics.,1
1179,Penny,5, I‰Ûªm sorry?,1
1180,Sheldon,5," Semiotics. The study of signs and symbols, it‰Ûªs a branch of philosophy related to linguistics.",1
1181,Penny,5," Okay, sweetie, I know you think you‰Ûªre explaining yourself, but you‰Ûªre really not. ",1
1182,Sheldon,5, Just come with me.,1
1183,Sheldon,5, Well?,1
1184,Penny,5, Well what?,1
1185,Sheldon,5, What does it mean?,1
1186,Penny,5," Oh, come on, you went to college.",1
1187,Sheldon,5," Yes, but I was eleven.",1
1188,Penny,5," Alright, look, a tie on the doorknob usually means someone doesn‰Ûªt want to be disturbed because they‰Ûªre, you know, getting busy. ",1
1189,Sheldon,5, So you‰Ûªre saying Leonard has a girl in there.,1
1190,Penny,5," Well, either that or he‰Ûªs lost his tie rack and gotten really into Bryan Adams. ",1
1191,Lesley (voice off),5," Oh Leonard, you magnificent beast. ",1
1192,Penny,5, We really shouldn‰Ûªt be standing here. ,1
1193,Sheldon (entering living room),5, This is very awkward.,1
1194,Penny,5," Oh, come on, you know, Leonard‰Ûªs had girls over before, right?",1
1195,Sheldon,5," Oh, yes, but there‰Ûªs usually planning, courtship and advance notice. Last time I was able to book a cruise to the Arctic to see a solar eclipse. ",1
1196,Penny,5," Wait, you had to leave the state because your roommate was having sex?",1
1197,Sheldon,5," I didn‰Ûªt have to, the dates just happened to coincide. ",1
1198,Penny,5," So, do you know who‰Ûªs in there?",1
1199,Sheldon,5," Well, there‰Ûªs Leonard. (Picking up violin case) And he‰Ûªs either with Lesley Winkle or a 1930‰Ûªs gangster. ",1
1200,Penny,5," Hmmm. Good for him. Good for Leonard. Okay, night.",1
1201,Sheldon,5," No, no, wait, hold on. ",1
1202,Penny,5, What‰Ûªs the matter?,1
1203,Sheldon,5," I don‰Ûªt know what the protocol is here. Do I stay, do I leave? Do I wait to greet them with a refreshing beverage? ",1
1204,Penny,5," Gee, Sheldon, you‰Ûªre asking the wrong girl. I‰Ûªm usually on the other side of the tie. ",1
1205,Sheldon,5," Hi, Leonard. It‰Ûªs me, Sheldon. In the living room. I just, I wanted you to know I saw the tie. Message received. You‰Ûªre welcome. You carry on. Give my best to Lesley. ",1
1206,Scene,5," In Leonard‰Ûªs Bedroom. Leonard wakes up next to Lesley, puts on glasses and grins.",1
1207,Scene,5," Living room, Sheldon is sleeping on the sofa, with his head on Lesley‰Ûªs Violin case.",1
1208,Sheldon,5," Big boy! (Wakes up, looks at watch, wraps self in blanket, walks towards kitchen) Someone touched my board. Oh God, my board. Leonard! Leonard!",1
1209,Leonard (entering),5," Hey, what‰Ûªs the matter? ",1
1210,Sheldon,5," My equations, someone‰Ûªs tampered with my equations. ",1
1211,Leonard,5, Are you sure?,1
1212,Sheldon,5," Of course I‰Ûªm sure. Look at the beta-function of quantum chrono-dynamics, the sign‰Ûªs been changed. ",1
1213,Leonard,5, Oh yeah. But doesn‰Ûªt that fix the problem you‰Ûªve been having?,1
1214,Sheldon,5," Are you insane? Are you out of your mind? Are you‰Û_. hey look, that fixes the problem I‰Ûªve been having. ",1
1215,Lesley (entering),5, You‰Ûªre welcome. ,1
1216,Sheldon,5, You did this?,1
1217,Lesley,5," Yeah, I noticed it when I got up to get a glass of water, so I fixed it, now you can show that quarks are asymptotically free at high energies. Pretty cool, huh?",1
1218,Sheldon,5, Cool?,1
1219,Lesley,5," Listen, I got to hit the lab. Thanks for a great night. ",1
1220,Leonard,5," Thank you, I‰Ûªll see you at work. ",1
1221,Sheldon,5," Uh-duh, hold on, hold on!",1
1222,Lesley,5, What?,1
1223,Sheldon,5, Who told you you could touch my board?,1
1224,Lesley,5, No-one.,1
1225,Sheldon,5, I don‰Ûªt come into your house and touch your board.,1
1226,Lesley,5, There are no incorrect equations on my board. ,1
1227,Sheldon,5," Oh, that is so‰Û_ so‰Û_",1
1228,Lesley,5," I‰Ûªm sorry, I‰Ûªve got to run, if you come up with an adjective, text me. (Leaves). ",1
1229,Sheldon,5," Inconsiderate, that is the adjective, inconsiderate. ",1
1230,Scene,5, The hallway. ,1
1231,Leonard (exiting the apartment),5," You can stare at your board all day Sheldon, she‰Ûªs still going to be right. ",1
1232,Sheldon (inside),5," I‰Ûªm not staring, I‰Ûªm mulling.",1
1233,Penny,5," Oh, hey Leonard.",1
1234,Leonard,5," Oh, hi.",1
1235,Penny,5," So, how‰Ûªs it going?",1
1236,Leonard,5, Pretty good. ,1
1237,Penny,5," Just pretty good, I‰Ûªd think you were doing very good. ",1
1238,Leonard,5," Pretty, very, there‰Ûªs really no objective scale for delineating variations of good, why do you ask?",1
1239,Penny,5," Well, a little bird told me that you and Lesley hooked up last night. ",1
1240,Leonard,5, Sheldon!,1
1241,Sheldon,5, I‰Ûªm coming.,1
1242,Penny,5," So, is it serious, do you like her?",1
1243,Leonard,5," Wuh, I don‰Ûªt‰Û_. th-th-th-that‰Ûªs really two different questions, uh, I‰Ûªm not‰Û_. Sheldon, we have to go! ",1
1244,Sheldon,5," Boy, you‰Ûªre wound awfully tight for a man who just had sexual intercourse. ",1
1245,Penny,5," Alright, well, I‰Ûªll talk to you later, but, I am so happy for you Leonard. ",1
1246,Leonard,5," Thank you. What did she mean, she‰Ûªs happy for me? Is she happy because I‰Ûªm seeing someone, or is she happy because she thinks that I‰Ûªm happy, because anyone who cared for someone would want them to be happy, even if the reason for their happiness made the first person unhappy. You know, because the second person, though happy, is now romantically unavailable to the first person.",1
1247,Sheldon,5, Do you realise I may have to share a Nobel Prize with your booty call?,1
1248,Leonard,5," You know what, I‰Ûªm being ridiculous. But who cares what Penny thinks, Lesley is a terrific girl, she‰Ûªs attractive, we like each other, she‰Ûªs extremely intelligent.",1
1249,Sheldon,5, She‰Ûªs not that intelligent.,1
1250,Leonard,5, She fixed your equation.,1
1251,Sheldon,5, She got lucky.,1
1252,Leonard,5, You don‰Ûªt believe in luck.,1
1253,Sheldon,5, I don‰Ûªt have to believe in it for her to be lucky. ,1
1254,Leonard,5," Regardless, I have a chance at a real relationship with Lesley, I‰Ûªm not going to pass that up for some hypothetical future happiness with a woman who may or may not want me to be happy with a woman who is currently making me happy. ",1
1255,Sheldon,5, Leonard?,1
1256,Leonard,5, Yeah. ,1
1257,Sheldon,5, I still don‰Ûªt care. ,1
1258,Scene,5, Leonard and Lesley‰Ûªs lab. ,1
1259,Leonard,5," Hey, Lesley.",1
1260,Lesley,5," CarefulåÊ Leonard, liquid nitrogen, 320 degrees below zero. ",1
1261,Leonard,5, Brrrr. Why are you smashing a flash frozen banana.,1
1262,Lesley,5, Because I‰Ûªve got a bowl of Cheerios and I couldn‰Ûªt find a knife.,1
1263,Leonard,5, So anyway (puts arms around her) Hello.,1
1264,Lesley,5," Uh, what are you doing?",1
1265,Leonard,5, Just extending the intimacy. Do you want to slip over to the radiation lab and share a decontamination shower?,1
1266,Lesley,5," Okay, uh, what exactly do you think‰Ûªs going on between us?",1
1267,Leonard,5," I‰Ûªm not sure, but I think I‰Ûªm about to discover how the banana felt. ",1
1268,Lesley,5," Listen, Leonard, neither of us are neuroscientists but we both understand the biochemistry of sex, I mean, dopamine in our brains is released across synapses causing pleasure. You stick electrodes in a rat‰Ûªs brain, give him an orgasm button, he‰Ûªll push that thing until he starves to death.åÊ ",1
1269,Leonard,5, Who wouldn‰Ûªt? ,1
1270,Lesley,5," Well, the only difference between us and a rat is that you can‰Ûªt stick an electrode in our hypothalamus. That‰Ûªs where you come in. ",1
1271,Leonard,5," Yeah, well, I‰Ûªm just glad to be a part of it. So what happens now?",1
1272,Lesley,5," Well, I don‰Ûªt know about your sex drive, but I‰Ûªm probably good till New Years. ",1
1273,Leonard,5, Oh. Okay. Thank you.,1
1274,Lesley,5, Thank you!,1
1275,Leonard,5, You want to make plans for New Years.,1
1276,Lesley,5," Woah, Leonard, please, you‰Ûªre smothering me. ",1
1277,Leonard (leaving),5, Sorry.,1
1278,Howard,5," Hey, look, it‰Ûªs Doctor Stud!",1
1279,Leonard,5, Doctor what?,1
1280,Howard,5, The blogosphere is a-buzzing with news of you and Lesley Winkle making eine kleine bang-bang music. ,1
1281,Leonard,5, Wha‰Û_ how did it get on the internet?,1
1282,Howard,5, I put it there. ,1
1283,Leonard,5," Well, how did you know about it?",1
1284,Raj,5, A little bird told us. Apparently you are a magnificent beast. ,1
1285,Leonard,5," Well, that part‰Ûªs true! ",1
1286,Scene,5, The Cheesecake Factory.,1
1287,Sheldon,5," You know, I think I may have misjudged this restaurant. ",1
1288,Leonard,5, No kidding.,1
1289,Sheldon,5," I won‰Ûªt go out on a limb, but I think we may be looking at my new Tuesday hamburger. ",1
1290,Leonard,5, Your old Tuesday hamburger will be so broken hearted. ,1
1291,Sheldon,5," Way ahead of you. I was thinking of moving Big Boy to Thursdays, and just dropping Soup Plantation. ",1
1292,Leonard,5, Really?,1
1293,Sheldon,5," Yeah, the name always confused me anyway, Soup Plantation. You can‰Ûªt grow soup. ",1
1294,Penny,5," So, how‰Ûªs everything. ",1
1295,Sheldon,5," Terrific, you‰Ûªll be happy to know that I plan to come here every Tuesday night for the foreseeable future.",1
1296,Penny,5," Really, oh yay!",1
1297,Sheldon,5, Who do I speak to about permanently reserving this table? ,1
1298,Penny,5," Um, I don‰Ûªt know, a psychiatrist? So hey, how are things with you and Lesley? ",1
1299,Leonard,5," Oh, to be honest, I don‰Ûªt think it‰Ûªs going to work out. ",1
1300,Penny,5," Oh, oh that‰Ûªs too bad. Well hey, don‰Ûªt worry, I‰Ûªm sure there is someone out there who is just right for you. (Walks away smiling).",1
1301,Leonard,5, Well what did she mean by that? Was that just a generic platitude or was that a subtle bid for attention? ,1
1302,Sheldon,5, You know why this hamburger surpasses the Big Boy? This is a single decker hamburger whereas the Big Boy is a double decker. This has a much more satisfying meat to bun to condiment ratio. ,1
1303,Leonard,5, Are you even listening to me?,1
1304,Sheldon,5," Of course I‰Ûªm listening. Blah blah, hopeless Penny delusion, blah blah blah.",1
1305,Leonard,5," Okay then. You know, you can grow the ingredients for soup. (Sheldon nods). ",1
1306,Scene,6," Lobby of the apartment building, Howard, Raj, Sheldon and Leonard enter in combat gear, covered in blue paint.",1
1307,Raj,6," Okay, if no-one else will say it, I will. We really suck at paintball.",1
1308,Howard,6, That was absolutely humiliating.,1
1309,Leonard,6," Oh, come on, some battles you win, some battles you lose.",1
1310,Howard,6," Yes, but you don‰Ûªt have to lose to Kyle Bernstein‰Ûªs Bar-Mitzvah party. ",1
1311,Leonard,6," I think we have to acknowledge, those were some fairly savage pre-adolescent Jews. ",1
1312,Sheldon,6," You know, we were annihilated by our own incompetence and the inability of some people to follow the chain of command. ",1
1313,Leonard,6," Sheldon, let it go.",1
1314,Sheldon,6," No, I want to talk about the fact that Wolowitz shot me in the back. ",1
1315,Howard,6," I shot you for good reason, you were leading us into disaster. ",1
1316,Sheldon,6," I was giving clear, concise orders. ",1
1317,Leonard,6," You hid behind a tree yelling ‰ÛÏget the kid in the yarmulkah, get the kid in the yarmulkah.‰Û",1
1318,Penny (arriving),6," Oh, hey guys.",1
1319,Leonard,6, Hello Penny.,1
1320,Howard,6, Morning ma‰Ûªam. ,1
1321,Penny,6," So, how was paintball, did you have fun?",1
1322,Sheldon,6," Sure, if you consider being fragged by your own troops fun. (To Howard) You clear space on your calendar, there will be an enquiry.",1
1323,Penny,6," Okay, um, oh hey, I‰Ûªm having a party on Saturday so if you guys are around you should come by.",1
1324,Leonard,6, A party? ,1
1325,Penny,6, Yeah.,1
1326,Howard,6, A boy-girl party?,1
1327,Penny,6," Well, there will be boys, and there will be girls, and it is a party. So, it‰Ûªll just be a bunch of my friends, we‰Ûªll have some beer, do a little dancing‰Û_",1
1328,Sheldon,6, Dancing?,1
1329,Leonard,6," Yeah, I don‰Ûªt know, Penny‰Û_",1
1330,Sheldon,6," The thing is, we‰Ûªre not‰Û_.",1
1331,Leonard,6, We‰Ûªre really more‰Û_.,1
1332,Sheldon,6, No.,1
1333,Leonard,6," But thanks, thanks for thinking of us.",1
1334,Penny,6," Are you sure? Come on, it‰Ûªs Halloween.",1
1335,Sheldon,6, A Halloween party?,1
1336,Howard,6," As in, costumes? ",1
1337,Penny,6," Well, yeah. ",1
1338,Leonard,6, Is there a theme?,1
1339,Penny,6," Um, yeah, Halloween.",1
1340,Sheldon,6," Yes, but are the costumes random, or genre specific? ",1
1341,Penny,6," As usual, I‰Ûªm not following.",1
1342,Leonard,6," He‰Ûªs asking if we can come as anyone from science-fiction, fantasy‰Û_",1
1343,Penny,6, Sure.,1
1344,Sheldon,6, What about comic-books?,1
1345,Penny,6, Fine.,1
1346,Sheldon,6, Anime?,1
1347,Penny,6, Of course.,1
1348,Sheldon,6," TV , film, D&D, Manga, Greek Gods, Roman Gods, Norse Gods‰Û_",1
1349,Penny,6," Anything you want, okay? Any costume you want. Bye. ",1
1350,Howard,6," Gentlemen, to the sewing machines.",1
1351,Scene,6, The apartment living room. There is a knock on the door.,1
1352,Leonard (off),6," I‰Ûªll get it. (He enters, wearing a Flash costume. Opens door.)",1
1353,"Howard (Entering at speed, also wearing a Flash costume)",6, Bjow (They stare at each other in shock.),1
1354,Leonard,6," Oh, no. ",1
1355,Sheldon,6, Oh no! (He is also wearing a Flash costume.),1
1356,Raj,6," Make way for the fastest man alive. (Enters, also in a Flash costume.) Oh no!",1
1357,Sheldon,6," See, this is why I wanted to have a costume meeting. ",1
1358,Leonard,6," We all have other costumes, we can change.",1
1359,Raj,6," Or, we could walk right behind each other all night and look like one person going really fast. ",1
1360,Howard,6," No, no, no, it‰Ûªs a boy-girl party, this Flash runs solo. ",1
1361,Leonard,6," Okay, how about this, nobody gets to be The Flash, we all change, agreed?",1
1362,All,6, Agreed. ,1
1363,Leonard,6, I call Frodo!,1
1364,All,6, Damn!,1
1365,Scene,6," The same, later. Leonard is dressed as Frodo. Howard appears to be Peter Pan. There is a knock on the door.",1
1366,Raj (Entering dressed as Thor),6," Hey. Sorry I‰Ûªm late, but my hammer got stuck in the door on the bus.",1
1367,Leonard,6, You went with Thor?,1
1368,Raj,6," What? Just because I‰Ûªm Indian I can‰Ûªt be a Norse God? No, no, no, Raj has to be an Indian God. That‰Ûªs racism. I mean, look at Wolowitz, he‰Ûªs not English, but he‰Ûªs dressed like Peter Pan. Sheldon(entering in a body suit featuring black and white vertical lines) is neither sound nor light, but he‰Ûªs obviously the Doppler Effect. ",1
1369,Howard,6," I‰Ûªm not Peter Pan, I‰Ûªm Robin Hood. ",1
1370,Raj,6," Really, because I saw Peter Pan, and you‰Ûªre dressed exactly like Cathy Rigby. She was a little bigger than you, but it‰Ûªs basically the same look, man. ",1
1371,Leonard,6," Hey, Sheldon, there‰Ûªs something I want to talk to you about before we go to the party.",1
1372,Sheldon,6," I don‰Ûªt care if anybody gets it, I‰Ûªm going as the Doppler Effect. ",1
1373,Leonard,6," No, it‰Ûªs not‰Û_",1
1374,Sheldon,6," If I have to, I can demonstrate. Neeeeoooowwwww!",1
1375,Leonard,6," Terrific. Um, this party is my first chance for Penny to see me in the context of her social group, and I need you not to embarrass me tonight. ",1
1376,Sheldon,6," Well, what exactly do you mean by embarrass you?",1
1377,Leonard,6," For example, tonight no-one needs to know that my middle name is Leakey. ",1
1378,Sheldon,6," Well, there‰Ûªs nothing embarrassing about that, your father worked with Lewis Leakey, a great anthropologist. It had nothing to do with your bed-wetting. ",1
1379,Leonard,6, All I‰Ûªm saying is that this party is the perfect opportunity for Penny to see me as a member of her peer group. A potential close friend and‰Û_ perhaps more. I don‰Ûªt want to look like a dork. ,1
1380,Scene,6, The hallway. Howard knocks on Penny‰Ûªs door with his bow. ,1
1381,Howard,6," Just a heads up fellas, if anyone gets lucky I‰Ûªve got a dozen condoms in my quiver. ",1
1382,"Penny (opening door, not in costume)",6," Oh, hey guys. ",1
1383,Leonard,6," Hey, sorry we‰Ûªre late. ",1
1384,Sheldon,6, And you said the party starts at seven. ,1
1385,Penny,6," Well, yeah, when you start a party at seven, no-one shows up at, you know, seven. ",1
1386,Penny,6," Yes. Yes it is. Okay, well, um, come on in. ",1
1387,Howard,6," What, are all the girls in the bathroom?",1
1388,Penny,6," Probably, but in their own homes. ",1
1389,Sheldon,6, So what time does the costume parade start? ,1
1390,Penny,6, The parade?,1
1391,Sheldon,6," Yeah, so the judges can give out the prizes for best costume, you know, most frightening, most authentic, most accurate visual representation of a scientific principle.",1
1392,Penny,6," Oh, Sheldon, I‰Ûªm sorry but there aren‰Ûªt going to be any parades or judges or prizes. ",1
1393,Sheldon,6, This party is just going to suck. ,1
1394,Penny,6," No, come on, it‰Ûªs going to be fun, and you all look great, I mean, look at you, Thor, and, oh, Peter Pan, that‰Ûªs so cute.",1
1395,Leonard,6," Actually, Penny, he‰Ûªs Rob‰Û_",1
1396,Howard,6, I‰Ûªm Peter Pan! And I‰Ûªve got a handful of pixie dust with your name on it. ,1
1397,Penny,6," No you don‰Ûªt. Oh, hey, what‰Ûªs Sheldon supposed to be.",1
1398,Leonard,6," Oh, he‰Ûªs the Doppler Effect.",1
1399,Sheldon,6, Yes. It‰Ûªs the apparent change in the frequency of a wave caused by relative motion between the source of the wave and the observer. ,1
1400,Penny,6," Oh, sure, I see it now, the Doppler Effect. Alright, I‰Ûªve got to shower, you guys um, make yourselves comfortable. ",1
1401,Leonard,6, Okay. ,1
1402,Sheldon,6," See, people get it. ",1
1403,Raj,6," Mmmm, by Odin‰Ûªs beard, this is good Chex Mix. ",1
1404,Howard,6," No thanks, peanuts, I can‰Ûªt afford to swell up in these tights. ",1
1405,Sheldon,6," I‰Ûªm confused. If there‰Ûªs no costume parade, what are we doing here? ",1
1406,Leonard,6, We‰Ûªre socialising. Meeting new people. ,1
1407,Sheldon,6, Telepathically?,1
1408,"Penny (crossing the room in a cat costume, speaking to someone off-screen)",6," Oh hey, when did you get here, Hi!",1
1409,Raj,6," Penny is wearing the worst Catwoman costume I have ever seen, and that includes Halle Berry‰Ûªs.",1
1410,Leonard,6," She‰Ûªs not Catwoman, she‰Ûªs just a generic cat.",1
1411,Sheldon,6, And that‰Ûªs the kind of sloppy costuming which results from a lack of rules and competition.,1
1412,Howard,6," Hey guys, check out the sexy nurse. I believe it‰Ûªs time for me to turn my head and cough. ",1
1413,Raj,6, What is your move?,1
1414,Howard,6," I‰Ûªm going to use the mirror technique. She brushes her hair back, I brush my hair back, she shrugs, I shrug, subconsciously she‰Ûªs thinking we‰Ûªre in sync, we belong together.",1
1415,Leonard,6, Where do you get this stuff?,1
1416,Howard,6," You know, psychology journals, internet research, and there‰Ûªs this great show on VH1 about how to pick up girls. ",1
1417,Raj,6," Oh, if only I had his confidence. I have such difficulty speaking to women. Or around women. Or at times, even effeminate men. ",1
1418,Howard,6," If that‰Ûªs a working stethoscope, maybe you‰Ûªd like to hear my heart skip a beat.",1
1419,Nurse Costume Girl,6, No thanks.,1
1420,Howard,6," No, seriously, you can, I have transient idiopathic arrhythmia.",1
1421,Leonard,6," IåÊ want to get to know Penny‰Ûªs friends, I just, I don‰Ûªt know how to talk to these people. ",1
1422,Sheldon,6," Well, I actually might be able to help.",1
1423,Leonard,6, How so?,1
1424,Sheldon,6," Like Jane Goodall observing the apes, I initially saw their interactions as confusing and unstructured, but patterns emerge, they have their own language if you will. ",1
1425,Leonard,6, Go on.,1
1426,Sheldon,6," Well, it seems that the newcomer approaches the existing group with the greeting ‰ÛÏHow wasted am I?‰Û which is met with an approving chorus of ‰ÛÏDude.‰Û",1
1427,Leonard,6, Then what happens?,1
1428,Sheldon,6, That‰Ûªs as far as I‰Ûªve gotten.,1
1429,Leonard,6," This is ridiculous, I‰Ûªm jumping in.",1
1430,Sheldon,6, Good luck. ,1
1431,Leonard,6," No, you‰Ûªre coming with me.",1
1432,Sheldon,6," Oh, I hardly think so. ",1
1433,Leonard,6, Come on.,1
1434,Sheldon,6, Aren‰Ûªt you afraid I‰Ûªll embarrass you?,1
1435,Leonard,6, Yes. But I need a wing-man.,1
1436,Sheldon,6," Alright, but if we‰Ûªre going to use flight metaphors I‰Ûªm much more suited to being the guy from the FAA, analysing wreckage. ",1
1437,Girl in Hippie Costume,6," Oh, Hi!",1
1438,Leonard,6, Hi.,1
1439,Sheldon,6, Hello.,1
1440,Girl,6," So, what are you supposed to be?",1
1441,Sheldon,6, Me? I‰Ûªll give you a hint. Neeeeooooowwwww!,1
1442,Girl,6," Uh, a choo-choo train?",1
1443,Sheldon,6, Close! Neeeeeoooooowwwww!,1
1444,Girl,6, A brain damaged choo-choo train?,1
1445,Girl in Butterfly Costume (dropping onto sofa next to Raj),6, How wasted am I? (Raj shrugs.),1
1446,Sheldon,6, Neeeeeooooowwwwww!,1
1447,Girl,6, I still don‰Ûªt get it.,1
1448,Sheldon,6, I‰Ûªm the Doppler Effect. ,1
1449,Girl,6," Okay, if that is some sort of learning disability, I think it‰Ûªs very insensitive.",1
1450,Leonard,6, Why don‰Ûªt you just tell people you‰Ûªre a zebra?,1
1451,åÊSheldon,6," Well, why don‰Ûªt you just tell people you‰Ûªre one of the seven dwarves. ",1
1452,Leonard,6, Because I‰Ûªm Frodo.,1
1453,Sheldon,6," Yes, well, I‰Ûªm the Doppler Effect. ",1
1454,Leonard,6, Oh no.,1
1455,Sheldon,6, What?,1
1456,Leonard,6, That‰Ûªs Penny‰Ûªs ex-boyfriend.,1
1457,Sheldon,6, What do you suppose he‰Ûªs doing here? Besides disrupting the local gravity field. ,1
1458,Leonard,6," If he were any bigger, he‰Ûªd have moons orbiting him.",1
1459,Sheldon,6," Oh, snap. So I guess we‰Ûªll be leaving now. ",1
1460,Leonard,6," Why should we leave? For all we know, he crashed the party and Penny doesn‰Ûªt even want him here. (Penny and Kurt hug).",1
1461,Sheldon,6, You have a back-up hypothesis. ,1
1462,Leonard,6, Maybe they just want to be friends. ,1
1463,Sheldon,6," Or maybe she wants to be friends, and he wants something more. ",1
1464,Leonard,6, Then he and I are on equal ground.,1
1465,Sheldon,6," Yes, but you‰Ûªre much closer to it than he is. ",1
1466,Leonard,6," Look, if this was 15,000 years ago, by virtue of his size and strength, Kurt would be entitled to his choice of female partners.",1
1467,Sheldon,6," And male partners. Animal partners. Large primordial eggplants, pretty much whatever tickled his fancy. ",1
1468,Leonard,6," Yes, but our society has undergone a paradigm shift, in the information age, Sheldon, you and I are the alpha males. We shouldn‰Ûªt have to back down. ",1
1469,Sheldon,6, True. Why don‰Ûªt you text him that and see if he backs down?,1
1470,Leonard,6, No. I‰Ûªm going to assert my dominance face to face. ,1
1471,Sheldon,6," Face to face? Are you going to wait for him to sit down, or are you going to stand on a coffee table?",1
1472,Leonard,6, Hello Penny. Hello Kurt.,1
1473,Penny,6," Oh, hey guys. You having a good time?",1
1474,Sheldon,6," Given the reaction to my costume, this party is a scathing indictment of the American education system. ",1
1475,Kurt,6," What, you‰Ûªre a zebra, right?",1
1476,Sheldon,6, Yet another child left behind. ,1
1477,Kurt,6," And what are you supposed to be, an Elf?",1
1478,Leonard,6," No, I‰Ûªm a Hobbit.",1
1479,Kurt,6, What‰Ûªs the difference? ,1
1480,Leonard,6," Uh, a Hobbit is a mortal Halfling inhabitant of Middle Earth, whereas an Elf is an immortal tall warrior. ",1
1481,Kurt,6, So why the hell would you want to be a Hobbit?,1
1482,Sheldon,6," Because he is neither tall nor immortal, and none of us could be The Flash. ",1
1483,Kurt,6," Well, whatever, why don‰Ûªt you go hop off on a quest, I‰Ûªm talking to Penny here.",1
1484,Leonard,6, I think we‰Ûªre all talking to Penny here.,1
1485,Sheldon,6, I‰Ûªm not. No offence. ,1
1486,Kurt,6," Okay, maybe you didn‰Ûªt hear me, go away.",1
1487,Penny,6," Alright Kurt, be nice.",1
1488,Kurt,6," Aw, I am being nice. Right little buddy.",1
1489,Penny,6, Kurt!,1
1490,Leonard,6," Okay, I understand your impulse to try to physically intimidate me. I mean, you can‰Ûªt compete with me on an intellectual level and so you‰Ûªre driven to animalistic puffery. ",1
1491,Kurt,6, Are you calling me a puffy animal?,1
1492,Penny,6," Of course not, no, he‰Ûªs not, you‰Ûªre not, right Leonard? ",1
1493,Leonard,6," No, I said animalistic. Of course we‰Ûªre all animals, but some of us have climbed a little higher on the evolutionary tree. ",1
1494,Sheldon,6," If he understands that, you‰Ûªre in trouble. ",1
1495,Kurt,6," So what, I‰Ûªm unevolved?",1
1496,Sheldon,6, You‰Ûªre in trouble. ,1
1497,Kurt,6," You know, you use a lot of big words for such a little dwarf. ",1
1498,Penny,6," Okay, Kurt, please.",1
1499,Leonard,6," No, Penny, it‰Ûªs okay, I can handle this. I‰Ûªm not a dwarf, I‰Ûªm a Hobbit. A Hobbit. Are misfiring neurons in your hippocampus preventing the conversion from short-term to long-term memory?",1
1500,Kurt,6," Okay, now you‰Ûªre starting to make me mad. ",1
1501,Leonard,6, A homo-habilus discovering his opposable thumbs says what?,1
1502,Kurt,6, What?,1
1503,Leonard,6, I think I‰Ûªve made my point.,1
1504,Kurt,6," Yeah, how about I make a point out of your pointy little head.",1
1505,Sheldon,6," Let me remind you, while my moral support is absolute, in a physical confrontation I will be less than useless. ",1
1506,Leonard,6," There‰Ûªs not going to be a confrontation, in fact I doubt if he can even spell confrontation.",1
1507,Kurt (physically lifting Leonard from the ground),6, C ‰ÛÒ O ‰ÛÒ N‰Û_ frontation!,1
1508,Penny,6," Kurt, put him down this instant. ",1
1509,Kurt,6, He started it.,1
1510,Penny,6," I don‰Ûªt care, I‰Ûªm finishing it, put him down. ",1
1511,Kurt,6, Fine. You‰Ûªre one lucky little leprechaun. ,1
1512,Sheldon,6, He‰Ûªs a Hobbit! I‰Ûªve got your back. ,1
1513,Penny,6," Leonard, are you okay.",1
1514,Leonard,6," Yeah, no, I‰Ûªm fine. It‰Ûªs good, it‰Ûªs a good party, thanks for having us, it‰Ûªs just getting a little late so‰Û_.",1
1515,Penny,6," Oh, okay, alright, well thank you for coming. ",1
1516,Sheldon,6," Happy Halloween. (They leave) If it‰Ûªs any consolation, I thought that homo-habilus line really put him in his place. ",1
1517,Scene,6, The living room. Sheldon brings Leonard a cup of tea.,1
1518,Leonard,6, What‰Ûªs that?,1
1519,Sheldon,6, Tea. When people are upset the cultural convention is to bring them hot beverages. There there. You want to talk about it?,1
1520,Leonard,6, No.,1
1521,Sheldon,6, Good. There there was really all I had. ,1
1522,Leonard,6, Good night Sheldon.,1
1523,Sheldon,6, Good night Leonard. ,1
1524,Penny (knocking on door and entering),6, Hey Leonard.,1
1525,Leonard,6, Hi Penny.,1
1526,Penny,6," Hey, I just wanted to make sure you‰Ûªre okay.",1
1527,Leonard,6, I‰Ûªm fine. ,1
1528,Penny,6, I‰Ûªm so sorry about what happened.,1
1529,Leonard,6, It‰Ûªs not your fault.,1
1530,Penny,6," Yes it is. That‰Ûªs why I broke up with him, he always does stuff like that. ",1
1531,Leonard,6, So why was he at your party?,1
1532,Penny,6," Well, I ran into him last week and, he was‰Û_ åÊjust, all apologetic, about how he‰Ûªs changed, he was just going on and on and I believed him, and I‰Ûªm an idiot because I always believe guys like that and‰Û_ I can‰Ûªt go back to my party because he‰Ûªs there, and I know you don‰Ûªt want to hear this and I‰Ûªm upset and I‰Ûªm really drunk and I just want to‰Û_ (bursts into tears and rests head on Leonard‰Ûªs shoulder.)",1
1533,Leonard,6, There there. ,1
1534,Penny,6," God, what is wrong with me.",1
1535,Leonard,6," Nothing, you‰Ûªre perfect.",1
1536,Penny,6," Gah, I‰Ûªm not perfect.",1
1537,Leonard,6, Yes you are. ,1
1538,Penny,6," You really think so, don‰Ûªt you? (She kisses hm.)",1
1539,Leonard,6, Penny?,1
1540,Penny,6, Yeah. ,1
1541,Leonard,6, How much have you had to drink tonight?,1
1542,Penny,6, Just‰Û_. a lot. ,1
1543,Leonard,6," Are you sure that your being drunk, and your being angry with Kurt doesn‰Ûªt have something to do with what‰Ûªs going on here?",1
1544,Penny,6," It might. Boy, you‰Ûªre really smart.",1
1545,Leonard,6," Yeah, I‰Ûªm a frickin‰Ûª genius. ",1
1546,Penny,6," Leonard, you are so great. Why can‰Ûªt all guys be like you? ",1
1547,Leonard,6," Because if all guys were like me, the human race couldn‰Ûªt survive. ",1
1548,Penny,6, I should probably go.,1
1549,Leonard,6, Probably. ,1
1550,Penny (in doorway),6, Thank you. (She kisses him again. Kurt is watching.),1
1551,Leonard,6," That‰Ûªs right, you saw what you saw. That‰Ûªs how we roll in The Shire. (Closes door quickly, locks and chains it.)",1
1552,Scene,6," The apartment, there is a knock on the door. ",1
1553,Sheldon,6, Coming. (Opens door to Howard.),1
1554,Howard,6," Hey, have you seen Koothrapali?",1
1555,Sheldon,6, He‰Ûªs not here. Maybe the Avenger summoned him. ,1
1556,Howard,6," He‰Ûªs not the Marvel comic story, he‰Ûªs the original Norse God. ",1
1557,Sheldon,6, Thank you for the clarification. ,1
1558,Howard,6, I‰Ûªm supposed to give him a ride home.,1
1559,Sheldon,6, Well I‰Ûªm sure he‰Ûªll be fine. He has his hammer. ,1
1560,Scene,6, A random bedroom. Butterfly costume girl is climbing off of Raj. ,1
1561,Butterfly Girl,6," Wow, I have to say, you are an amazing man. You‰Ûªre gentle and passionate, and my God, you are such a good listener! ",1
1562,Scene,7," The apartment, the living room.",1
1563,Howard,7," Watch this, it‰Ûªs really cool. Call Leonard Hofstadter.",1
1564,Howard‰Ûªs phone,7," Did you say, call Helen Boxleitner?",1
1565,Howard,7, No. Call Leonard Hofstadter.,1
1566,Howard‰Ûªs phone,7," Did you say, call Temple Beth Sader. ",1
1567,Howard,7, No.,1
1568,Leonard,7," Here, let me try. Call McFlono McFloonyloo. Heh-heh. ",1
1569,Howard‰Ûªs phone,7, Calling Rajesh Koothrappali. (Raj‰Ûªs phone rings).,1
1570,Raj,7," Oh, that‰Ûªs very impressive. And a little racist. ",1
1571,Leonard,7, So? We‰Ûªll start now.,1
1572,Sheldon,7," Yes, first we have to decide if those lost six minutes will be coming out of game time, bathroom time or the pizza break.",1
1573,Raj,7," We can split it two, two and two.",1
1574,Howard,7, If we‰Ûªre having anchovies on the pizza we can‰Ûªt take it out of bathroom time. (There is a knock on the door.),1
1575,Sheldon,7," Oh, what fresh hell is this?",1
1576,Leonard (opening door),7," Hey Penny, come on in.",1
1577,Penny,7, Hey guys. ,1
1578,Howard,7," See a Penny, pick her up, and all the day you‰Ûªll have good luck.",1
1579,Penny,7," No you won‰Ûªt. Uh, can I hide out here for a while.",1
1580,Leonard,7, Sure. What‰Ûªs going on.,1
1581,Penny,7," Well, there‰Ûªs this girl I know from back in Nebraska, Christie, well anyway she called me up and she‰Ûªs like ‰ÛÏHey, how‰Ûªs California,‰Û and I‰Ûªm like ‰ÛÏAwesome‰Û ‰Û÷cos, you know, it‰Ûªs not Nebraska, and the next thing I know she‰Ûªs invited herself out here to stay with me. ",1
1582,Penny,7," Anyway, she got here today, and she‰Ûªs just been in my apartment, yakkety-yakking about every guy she‰Ûªs slept with in Omaha, which is basically every guy in Omaha, and washing the sluttiest collection of underwear you have ever seen in my bathroom sink.",1
1583,Howard,7," Well, is she doing it one thong at a time, or does she just throw it all in, like some sort of erotic bouillabaisse.",1
1584,Penny,7, He really needs to dial it down.,1
1585,Leonard,7," So, if you don‰Ûªt like this Christie, why are you letting her stay? ",1
1586,Penny,7," Well, she was engaged to my cousin while she was sleeping with my brother, so she‰Ûªs kind of family. ",1
1587,Sheldon,7," You know, I apologise for my earlier outburst, who needs Halo when we can be regaled with the delightfully folksy tale of the whore of Omaha?",1
1588,Leonard,7," Oh, I don‰Ûªt think she‰Ûªs a whore.",1
1589,Penny,7," No, yeah she‰Ûªs definitely a whore. I mean, she has absolutely no standards, this one time, she was at‰Û_ where‰Ûªs Howard?",1
1590,Howard (voice off),7," Bonjour mademoiselle, I understand you‰Ûªre new in town. ",1
1591,Sheldon,7, Oh good grief.,1
1592,Scene,7," Penny, Sheldon, Raj and Leonard stand in the apartment doorway. Romantic music plays from Penny‰Ûªs apartment door. ",1
1593,Penny,7," Ugh, I cannot believe Christie let Howard into my apartment. åÊåÊåÊ",1
1594,Leonard,7," Okay, fine, we‰Ûªll just play one on one until he gets back. ",1
1595,Sheldon,7," One on one? We don‰Ûªt play one on one, we play teams, not one on one. One on one!",1
1596,Leonard,7, Well the only way we can play teams at this point is if we cut Raj in half.,1
1597,Raj,7," Oh, sure, cut the foreigner in half, there‰Ûªs a billion more where he came from. ",1
1598,Penny,7," Hey, if you guys need a fourth, I‰Ûªll play.",1
1599,Leonard,7, Great idea.,1
1600,Sheldon,7," Uh, no. The wheel was a great idea. Relativity was a great idea. This is a notion, and a rather sucky one at that. ",1
1601,Penny,7, Why?,1
1602,Sheldon,7," Why? Oh, Penny, Penny, Penny.",1
1603,Penny,7," Oh, what, what, what? ",1
1604,Sheldon,7," This is a complex battle simulation with a steep learning curve, there are myriad weapons, vehicles and strategies to master, not to mention an extremely intricate back-story.",1
1605,"Penny (picking up a controller, there is the sound of an explosion from the television)",7," Oh cool, whose head did I just blow off? ",1
1606,Sheldon,7, Mine. ,1
1607,Penny,7," Okay, I got this, lock and load boys. ",1
1608,Leonard,7, It‰Ûªs the only way we can play teams. ,1
1609,Sheldon,7," Yes, but whoever‰Ûªs her partner will be hamstrung by her lack of experience and not to mention that fact that sh‰Û_. (another explosion)",1
1610,Penny,7," Ha-ha, there goes your head again.",1
1611,Sheldon,7," Okay, this isn‰Ûªt at all good sportsmanship to shoot somebody who‰Ûªs just respawned, you need to give them a chance to (explosion) now come on!",1
1612,Sheldon,7," Raj, Raj, she‰Ûªs got me cornered, cover me.",1
1613,Penny,7," Cover this, suckers. Ha-ha-ha!",1
1614,Leonard,7," Penny, you are on fire.",1
1615,Penny,7," Yeah, so is Sheldon. ",1
1616,Sheldon,7," Okay, that‰Ûªs it, I don‰Ûªt know how, but she is cheating. No-one can be that attractive and be this skilled at a video game. ",1
1617,Penny,7," Wait, wait, Sheldon, come back, you forgot something. ",1
1618,Sheldon,7, What?,1
1619,Penny,7," This plasma grenade. (Explosion.) Ha! Look, it‰Ûªs raining you! ",1
1620,Sheldon,7," You laugh now, you just wait until you need tech support. ",1
1621,Penny,7," Gosh, he‰Ûªs kind of a sore loser, isn‰Ûªt he?",1
1622,Leonard,7," Well, to be fair, he is also a rather unpleasant winner. ",1
1623,Penny,7," Well, it‰Ûªs been fun.",1
1624,Leonard,7," You know, Penny, we make such a good team, maybe we could enter a couple of Halo tournaments sometime.",1
1625,Penny,7, Or we could just have a life. ,1
1626,Leonard,7, I guess for you that‰Ûªs an option.,1
1627,Penny,7," Good night, Leonard.",1
1628,Leonard,7, Good night.,1
1629,Penny,7," As usual, nice talking to you Raj (leaves.) ",1
1630,Raj,7, What do you suppose she meant by that?,1
1631,Leonard,7," She‰Ûªs an enigma, Raj. ",1
1632,Sheldon,7," And another thing, there‰Ûªs a certain ethic to the game, Penny, a well estab‰Û_",1
1633,Leonard,7," She‰Ûªs gone, Sheldon. ",1
1634,Sheldon,7, Well she could have said goodbye. ,1
1635,Penny (entering again),7," Okay, I have a problem.",1
1636,Sheldon,7," It‰Ûªs called carpal tunnel syndrome, and quite frankly you deserve it. ",1
1637,Leonard,7, What‰Ûªs wrong?,1
1638,Penny,7," Um, well, Howard and Christie are‰Û_ kind of‰Û_ hooking up in my bedroom. ",1
1639,Leonard,7, Are you sure?,1
1640,Penny,7," Look, I grew up on a farm, okay, from what I heard they‰Ûªre either having sex or Howard‰Ûªs caught in a milking machine. Do you mind if I stay here tonight?",1
1641,Leonard,7," No, take the couch, or my bed, I just got new pillows, hypo-allergenics. ",1
1642,Penny,7," Uh, the couch is good.",1
1643,Sheldon,7," Hold that thought, Leonard, a moment.",1
1644,Leonard,7," Let me guess, you have a problem with this.",1
1645,Sheldon,7, Where do I begin? ,1
1646,Leonard,7," It‰Ûªs up to you, crazy person‰Ûªs choice. ",1
1647,Sheldon,7," Well first, we don‰Ûªt have house guests, frankly if I could afford the rent I‰Ûªd ask you to leave. ",1
1648,Leonard,7," Your friendship means a lot to me as well, what else? ",1
1649,Sheldon,7," Well, our earthquake supplies, we have a two day, two man kit.",1
1650,Leonard,7, So? ,1
1651,Sheldon,7," So, if there is an earthquake and the three of us are trapped here, we could be out of food by tomorrow afternoon. ",1
1652,Leonard,7," I‰Ûªm sorry, are you suggesting that if we let Penny stay we might succumb to cannibalism?",1
1653,Sheldon,7, No-one ever thinks it will happen until it does. ,1
1654,Leonard,7," Penny, if you promise not to chew the flesh off our bones while we sleep, you can stay. ",1
1655,Penny,7, Hu.. what?,1
1656,Sheldon,7," He‰Ûªs engaging in reductio-ad-absurdum. It‰Ûªs the logical fallacy of extending someone‰Ûªs argument to ridiculous proportions and then criticising the result, and I do not appreciate it. ",1
1657,Leonard,7, I‰Ûªll get you a blanket and a pillow. ,1
1658,Penny,7, How am I supposed to plan my bodily functions?,1
1659,Sheldon,7, I suggest no liquids after 11pm. ,1
1660,Leonard,7, Here you go.,1
1661,Penny,7, Thanks Leonard. (Arranges pillows on left of couch.),1
1662,Sheldon,7," Hmmph, wrong. ",1
1663,Penny,7, I‰Ûªm listening.,1
1664,Sheldon,7, Your head goes on the other end.,1
1665,Penny,7, Why? ,1
1666,Sheldon,7," It‰Ûªs culturally universal, a bed, even a temporary bed, is always oriented with the headboard away from the door. It serves the ancient imperative of protecting oneself against marauders.",1
1667,Penny,7, I‰Ûªll risk it.,1
1668,Sheldon,7, Hm! ,1
1669,Penny,7, Anything else I should know.,1
1670,Sheldon,7, Yes. If you use my toothbrush I‰Ûªll jump out that window. Please don‰Ûªt come to my funeral. Have a good night. ,1
1671,Leonard,7, Sorry about that.,1
1672,Penny,7, That‰Ûªs okay. ,1
1673,Leonard,7," FYI, his toothbrush is the red one in the plexiglass case under the UV light. ",1
1674,Penny,7, Got it.,1
1675,Leonard,7," Well, sleep tight.",1
1676,Penny,7, Thanks. ,1
1677,Leonard,7," Funny expression, sleep tight. It refers to the early construction of beds which featured a mattress suspended on interlocking ropes which would occasionally‰Û_ sleep tight. ",1
1678,Scene,7," The following morning. Sheldon is in the kitchen making breakfast. He crosses to the couch, sees Penny sleeping there, looks lost. He is about to sit down on Penny when Leonard enters.",1
1679,Leonard,7, What are you doing? ,1
1680,Leonard,7, Penny‰Ûªs still sleeping.,1
1681,Leonard,7," I know, I know, look, you have a TV in your room, why don‰Ûªt you just have breakfast in bed? ",1
1682,Sheldon,7, Because I am neither an invalid nor a woman celebrating Mother‰Ûªs Day. ,1
1683,Penny,7," Uh, what time is it?",1
1684,Penny,7, I slept all day?,1
1685,Penny,7, What the hell is your problem?,1
1686,Sheldon,7," Okay, this cereal has lost all its molecular integrity, I now have a bowl of shredded wheat paste.",1
1687,Howard (entering),7," Ola, nerd-migos. ",1
1688,Penny,7, Why do you people hate sleep? Are you wearing my robe?,1
1689,Howard,7," Oh, yeah, sorry, I‰Ûªll have it cleaned.",1
1690,Penny,7," That‰Ûªs okay, keep it. Where‰Ûªs Christie.",1
1691,Howard,7," In the shower. Oh, by the way, where did you get that loofah mitt, yours reaches places that mine just won‰Ûªt.",1
1692,Penny,7, Y-you used my loofah?,1
1693,Howard,7, More precisely we used your loofah. I exfoliated her brains out! ,1
1694,Penny,7, You can keep that too.,1
1695,Howard,7," Ah, well then we‰Ûªll probably need to talk about your stuffed bear collection.",1
1696,Christie (voice off),7, Howard?,1
1697,Howard,7, In here my lady.,1
1698,Christie (entering),7," Mmmm, there‰Ûªs my little engine that could.",1
1699,Howard,7, chka-chka-chka-chka-chka-chka-chka (they kiss).,1
1700,Sheldon,7, Well there‰Ûªs one beloved children‰Ûªs book I‰Ûªll never read again.,1
1701,Christie,7," Hi, Christie.",1
1702,Leonard,7, Leonard. ,1
1703,Sheldon,7, I‰Ûªm Sheldon.,1
1704,Christie,7," Right, you‰Ûªre Howard‰Ûªs entourage. ",1
1705,Penny,7," Uh, so Christie, what are your plans?",1
1706,Christie,7," Oh, well, Howard said he‰Ûªd take me shopping in Beverley Hills. ",1
1707,Penny,7," Yeah, no, I meant plans to find some place to live. Other than with me, not that I don‰Ûªt love having you, but it‰Ûªs‰Û_ a little crowded.",1
1708,Leonard,7," Penny, you‰Ûªre always welcome to stay with us.",1
1709,Sheldon,7," Oh, terrific, now we‰Ûªre running a cute little B&B.",1
1710,Howard,7," Let me offer a little outside the box thinking here, why doesn‰Ûªt Christie stay with me.",1
1711,Leonard,7, For one thing you live with your mother.,1
1712,Howard,7," I do not, my mother lives with me. ",1
1713,Sheldon,7," Well then, it‰Ûªs all settled, Christie will stay with Howard, Penny can go back to her apartment, and I‰Ûªll watch the last 24 minutes of Doctor Who, although at this point it‰Ûªs more like Doctor Why Bother. ",1
1714,Leonard,7, Sheldon you just can‰Ûªt dictate‰Û_,1
1715,Sheldon,7," No more talking, everybody go. ",1
1716,Howard,7," So, what do you say, you wanna repair to Castle Wolowitz? ",1
1717,Christie,7," What is that, like a Mexican deli?",1
1718,Howard,7," I‰Ûªm sorry, I should have mentioned this earlier, my last name is Wolowitz.",1
1719,Christie,7," Oh, that‰Ûªs so cool. My first Jew!",1
1720,Sheldon,7, I imagine there aren‰Ûªt many kosher corn-huskers. ,1
1721,Christie,7," But you‰Ûªre still taking me shopping, right?",1
1722,Howard,7, Anything you want.,1
1723,Christie,7," Okay, I‰Ûªll go pack my stuff.",1
1724,Howard,7, When they perfect human cloning I‰Ûªm going to order twelve of those.,1
1725,Leonard,7," Howard, can‰Ûªt you see she‰Ûªs using you?",1
1726,Howard,7," Who cares, last night she pulled off her blouse and I wept!",1
1727,Penny,7," Look, Howard, I know her, okay, she‰Ûªll have sex with anyone as long as they keep buying her things. ",1
1728,Howard,7, Really?,1
1729,Penny,7, Yeah.,1
1730,Howard,7," Yay! If you‰Ûªll excuse me, I have some Bar-Mizvah bonds to cash. ",1
1731,Scene,7, A Chinese restaurant. ,1
1732,Sheldon,7," I‰Ûªm sorry, we cannot do this without Wolowitz.",1
1733,Leonard,7, We can‰Ûªt order Chinese food without Wolowitz?,1
1734,Sheldon,7," Let me walk you through it, our standard is, the steamed dumpling appetizer, General So‰Ûªs chicken, beef with broccoli, shrimp with lobster sauce and vegetable lo-main. Do you see the problem?",1
1735,Leonard,7, I see a problem. ,1
1736,Sheldon,7, Our entire order is predicated on four dumplings and four entrees divided among four people. ,1
1737,Leonard,7," So, we‰Ûªll just order three entrees.",1
1738,Sheldon,7," Fine, what do you want to eliminate, and who gets the extra dumpling. ",1
1739,Raj,7, We could cut it into thirds. ,1
1740,Sheldon,7," Then it is no longer a dumpling, once you cut it open it is at best a very small open faced sandwich. ",1
1741,Waiter,7," Hi fellas. Oh, where‰Ûªs your annoying little friend who thinks he speaks Mandarin?",1
1742,Sheldon,7," He‰Ûªs putting his needs ahead of the collective good. (Pointing at waiter) Where he comes from, that‰Ûªs punishable by death.",1
1743,Waiter,7, I come from Sacramento. ,1
1744,Leonard,7," Can we get an order of dumplings, but with three instead of four.",1
1745,Waiter,7, No substitutions.,1
1746,Leonard,7," This isn‰Ûªt a substitution, it‰Ûªs a reduction. ",1
1747,Waiter,7," Okay, no reductions.",1
1748,Leonard,7," Fine, bring us three orders of dumplings, that‰Ûªs twelve, we‰Ûªll each have four. ",1
1749,Raj,7, That works. ,1
1750,Sheldon,7," No, if we fill up on dumplings we‰Ûªll need to eliminate another entree. ",1
1751,Waiter,7, No eliminations. ,1
1752,Leonard,7," If we have extra, we‰Ûªll just take the leftovers home.",1
1753,Sheldon,7," And divide it how, I‰Ûªm telling you we cannot do this without Wolowitz. ",1
1754,Leonard,7," Wolowitz is with his new girlfriend, if you had let me invite Penny then you would have had your fourth.",1
1755,Sheldon,7," Have you seen Penny eat Chinese food, she uses a fork, and she double dips her egg rolls. ",1
1756,Leonard,7, We don‰Ûªt order egg rolls.,1
1757,Sheldon,7," Exactly, but we‰Ûªd have to if she was here.",1
1758,Raj,7," Can we please make a decision, not only are there children starving in India, there‰Ûªs an Indian starving right here. ",1
1759,Leonard,7," Here‰Ûªs an idea, why don‰Ûªt we just go out for Indian food.",1
1760,Sheldon,7, No.,1
1761,Raj,7, Uurgh.,1
1762,Waiter,7," You are nice boys. Tell you what I‰Ûªm going to do. I‰Ûªm going to bring you the four dumplings. When I‰Ûªm walking over to the table, maybe I get bumped, one of the dumplings falls to the floor, no-one has to know. ",1
1763,Sheldon,7, I‰Ûªll know. ,1
1764,Waiter,7, (wanders away cursing in Mandarin.),1
1765,Raj,7, How about soup?,1
1766,Leonard,7," Yeah, we can always divide soup.",1
1767,Sheldon,7, What about the won-tons?,1
1768,Scene,7, Outside Penny‰Ûªs door. Leonard knocks. ,1
1769,Penny (answering),7," Oh, hey guys, what‰Ûªs up?",1
1770,Sheldon,7, It‰Ûªs Halo night.,1
1771,Penny,7, Yeah. Okay. So?,1
1772,Leonard,7," Well, with Wolowitz spending all of his time with your friend Christie, ",1
1773,Penny,7, She‰Ûªs not my friend. Friends do not get their friends care bears all sweaty. ,1
1774,Leonard,7," Right, anyway, uh, with Wolowitz occupied elsewhere, we had something we wanted to ask you. Sheldon?",1
1775,Sheldon,7," Yes. Penny, we would very much appreciate it if you would be the fourth member of our Halo team. I don‰Ûªt think I need to tell you what an honour this is. ",1
1776,Penny,7," Oh, that‰Ûªs so sweet. But I‰Ûªm going out dancing with a girlfriend. ",1
1777,Sheldon,7," You can‰Ûªt go out, it‰Ûªs Halo night. ",1
1778,Penny,7," Well, for Penny it‰Ûªs dancing night. ",1
1779,Sheldon,7, You go dancing every Wednesday.,1
1780,Penny,7, No.,1
1781,Sheldon,7,åÊ Then it‰Ûªs not dancing night. ,1
1782,Penny,7," Look, why don‰Ûªt I play with you guys tomorrow?",1
1783,Sheldon,7," Tonight is Halo night, it‰Ûªs like talking to a wall. ",1
1784,Penny,7," Alright, now Sheldon, you and I are about to have a problem. ",1
1785,Leonard,7," Sheldon, remember, we role-played this.",1
1786,Sheldon,7," Yes, but you didn‰Ûªt portray her as completely irrational.",1
1787,Penny,7," Alright fellas, I gotta go. Good luck. ",1
1788,Leonard,7, Maybe we should have asked if we could go dancing with her and her girlfriend. ,1
1789,Sheldon,7," Okay, assuming we could dance, which we can‰Ûªt, there are three of us and two of them.",1
1790,Leonard,7, So?,1
1791,Sheldon,7," It‰Ûªs the Chinese restaurant all over again. I assure you that cutting a dumpling in thirds is child‰Ûªs play compared with three men, each attempting to dance with 67% of a woman.",1
1792,Leonard,7," Aaah, for God‰Ûªs sake, Sheldon, you are driving me crazy. ",1
1793,Sheldon,7," Your anger‰Ûªs not with me, sir, but with basic mathematics.",1
1794,Leonard,7," No, I‰Ûªm pretty sure my anger‰Ûªs with you.",1
1795,Raj,7, What‰Ûªs happening to us? We‰Ûªre falling apart. ,1
1796,Leonard,7, Who are you calling?,1
1797,Sheldon,7, The only man who can restore any semblance of balance to our universe.,1
1798,Howard (voice),7, åÊHi this is Howard Wolowitz.,1
1799,Christie (voice),7, And this is Christie Van Der Bell. ,1
1800,Howard (voice),7, We can‰Ûªt get to the phone right now because we‰Ûªre having sex.,1
1801,Christie (voice),7, You‰Ûªre not going to put that on your message are you?,1
1802,Howard (voice),7," No, I‰Ûªm just kidding, I‰Ûªll re-record it. (beep)",1
1803,Scene,7, Outside Howard‰Ûªs house. ,1
1804,Leonard,7," Sheldon, think this through, you‰Ûªre going to ask Howard to choose between sex and Halo.",1
1805,Sheldon,7," No, I‰Ûªm going to ask him to choose between sex and Halo 3. As far as I know, sex has not been upgraded to include high-def graphics and enhanced weapon systems. ",1
1806,Leonard,7," You‰Ûªre right, all sex has is nudity, orgasms and human contact. ",1
1807,Sheldon,7, My point.,1
1808,Christie (voice from within),7," I‰Ûªm just saying, you can take the damned plastic off the couch once in a while.",1
1809,Howard‰Ûªs Mother (voice),7," Why, so you and Howard can hump on it? ",1
1810,Howard (voice),7," Ladies, ladies, I‰Ûªm sure there‰Ûªs a middle ground.",1
1811,Christie and Howard‰Ûªs Mother together,7, Shut up Howard. ,1
1812,Howard (voice),7," You girl‰Ûªs talk, I‰Ûªm going to take my scooter out for a little spin. ",1
1813,Christie (voice as Howard emerges through door),7," Are you happy, you drove your own son out of the house. ",1
1814,Howard‰Ûªs Mother (voice),7, Why don‰Ûªt you stop butting in where you don‰Ûªt belong.,1
1815,Howard,7, What are you guys doing here? ,1
1816,Sheldon,7, It‰Ûªs Halo night. ,1
1817,Howard‰Ûªs Mother (voice),7," He‰Ûªs not a man, he‰Ûªs a putz, and don‰Ûªt you take that tone with me, you gold digger.",1
1818,Christie (voice),7, What did you call me? ,1
1819,Howard‰Ûªs Mother (voice),7," You heard me, and I‰Ûªll tell you something else, you‰Ûªre barking up the wrong tree, cos as long as you‰Ûªre around, Howard is out of the will.",1
1820,Howard‰Ûªs Mother (voice),7," That‰Ûªs right, go back to Babylon, you whore. ",1
1821,Howard,7," So, Halo night, huh? ",1
1822,Raj,7, I thought she was the whore of Omaha?,1
1823,Sheldon,7, Shhh! ,1
1824,Scene,7," The apartment, Halo night. ",1
1825,Howard,7," Sheldon, you got him in your sights, fire, he‰Ûªs charging his plasma rifle. ",1
1826,Sheldon,7," I can‰Ûªt shoot now, I‰Ûªm cloaking.",1
1827,Leonard,7," Now, Raj, kill Sheldon.",1
1828,Raj,7, I can‰Ûªt see him.,1
1829,Sheldon,7," That‰Ûªs why the call it cloaking, dead man.",1
1830,Leonard,7, Well then start throwing grenades.,1
1831,Raj,7, I‰Ûªm all out. ,1
1832,Penny (entering with three other sexy women),7," Hi guys, my friends and I got tired of dancing, so we came over to have sex with you. ",1
1833,Leonard,7," That will do, Raj, straight for the tank.",1
1834,Sheldon,7, We said no tanks.,1
1835,Raj,7, There are no rules in hell! ,1
1836,Howard,7," Son of a bitch, medpack, I need a medpack! ",1
1837,Penny,7, Told yah! (They leave). ,1
1838,Leonard,7," There‰Ûªs a sniper, use your rocket launcher. ",1
1839,Raj,7," All I‰Ûªve got is a needler, and I‰Ûªm all out of ammo. ",1
1840,Sheldon,7, And now you‰Ûªre out of life. Why did you hit pause?,1
1841,Leonard,7, I thought I heard something. ,1
1842,Raj,7, What?,1
1843,Leonard,7," No, never mind, alright, go. ",1
1844,Scene,8, The Apartment.,1
1845,Sheldon,8," Damn you, walletnook.com.",1
1846,Leonard,8, Problem?,1
1847,Sheldon,8," The online description was completely misleading, they said eight slots plus removable ID, to any rational person that would mean room for nine cards, but they don‰Ûªt tell you the removable ID takes up one slot, it‰Ûªs a nightmare. ",1
1848,Leonard,8," Okay, now, do you really need the honorary Justice League of America membership card?",1
1849,Sheldon,8, It‰Ûªs been in every wallet I‰Ûªve owned since I was five. ,1
1850,Leonard,8, Why?,1
1851,Sheldon,8, It says keep this on your person at all times. (Knock on door) It‰Ûªs right here under Batman‰Ûªs signature.,1
1852,Raj,8, And this is Leonard and Sheldon‰Ûªs apartment. ,1
1853,Howard,8, Guess whose parents just got broadband. ,1
1854,Raj,8," May I present, live from New Delhi, Dr and Mrs V. M. Koothrappali. ",1
1855,Leonard,8, Hi.,1
1856,Dr Koothrappali,8, Lift up the camera. I‰Ûªm looking at his crotch.,1
1857,Raj,8, Sorry papa.,1
1858,Dr Koothrappali,8," Oh, there‰Ûªs much better. Hi.",1
1859,Leonard,8, Hi! ,1
1860,Raj,8, And over here is Sheldon.,1
1861,Sheldon,8, Hi.,1
1862,Raj,8, He lives with Leonard. ,1
1863,Mrs Koothrappali,8," Oh, that‰Ûªs nice. Like Haroun and Tanweer. ",1
1864,Raj,8," No, no, not like Haroun and Tanweer.",1
1865,Mrs Koothrappali,8," Such sweet young men, they just adopted the cutest little Punjabi baby. ",1
1866,Leonard,8," Yeah, we‰Ûªre not like Haroun and Tanweer!",1
1867,Dr Koothrappali,8, So are you boys academics like our son?,1
1868,Together,8, Yes. ,1
1869,Dr Koothrappali,8, And your parents are comfortable with your limited earning potential?,1
1870,Together,8, Not at all. ,1
1871,Raj,8," Papa, please don‰Ûªt start. ",1
1872,Dr Koothrappali,8," God, it‰Ûªs just a question, he‰Ûªs so sensitive.",1
1873,Raj,8," Okay, that‰Ûªs my life, that‰Ûªs my friends, good to see you, say goodbye.",1
1874,Together,8, Bye! ,1
1875,Dr Koothrappali,8," Wait, wait. Before you go we have good news. Put the computer down and gather your friends. ",1
1876,Raj,8, What is it papa.,1
1877,Dr Koothrappali,8, Friends. ,1
1878,Howard (as they gather),8," Is it just me, or does webchatting with your clothes on seem a little pointless. ",1
1879,Mrs Koothrappali,8," Rajesh, do you remember Lalita Gupta? ",1
1880,Raj,8, The little fat girl that used to kick me in the samosas and call me untouchable.,1
1881,Mrs Koothrappali,8," Yes. Well, now she‰Ûªs a dental student at USC, so we gave her your contact information. ",1
1882,Raj,8, Why did you do that?,1
1883,Dr Koothrappali,8, You‰Ûªre 26 years old Rajesh. We want grandchildren.,1
1884,Raj,8," But Papa, I‰Ûªm not supposed‰Û_",1
1885,Mrs Koothrappali,8, Lalita‰Ûªs parents approve the match. ,1
1886,Dr Koothrappali,8," If you decide on a spring wedding, we can avoid monsoon season. ",1
1887,Raj,8, Spring wedding?,1
1888,Mrs Koothrappali,8," It‰Ûªs up to you dear, we don‰Ûªt want to meddle.",1
1889,Raj,8," If you don‰Ûªt want to meddle, then why are you meddling.",1
1890,Sheldon,8," If I may, your parents probably don‰Ûªt consider this meddling, while arranged marriages are no longer the norm, Indian parents continue to have a greater than average involvement in their children‰Ûªs lives.",1
1891,Raj,8, Why are you telling me about my own culture? ,1
1892,Sheldon,8, You seemed confused.,1
1893,Raj,8," Sorry, Mommy, Papa, but with all due respect I really can‰Ûªt go through‰Û_",1
1894,Mrs Koothrappali,8," Sorry darling, we have to go. Doogie Howser is on. Grandma, it‰Ûªs Doogie time! Bye bye.",1
1895,Dr Koothrappali,8, Bye bye. ,1
1896,Raj,8, I don‰Ûªt believe it.,1
1897,Howard,8," Neither do I. Doogie Howser‰Ûªs been off the air for like, twenty years. ",1
1898,Leonard,8," Actually, I read somewhere that it‰Ûªs one of the most popular programmes in India. ",1
1899,Sheldon,8, It might speak to a cultural aspiration to have one‰Ûªs children enter the medical profession. ,1
1900,Leonard,8, I bet you‰Ûªre right.,1
1901,Howard,8, I bet they love Scrubs.,1
1902,Sheldon,8, What‰Ûªs not to love?,1
1903,Raj,8," Excuse me, hello? My parents are trying to marry me off to a total stranger, what am I going to do?",1
1904,Sheldon,8, I suggest you go through with it.,1
1905,Raj,8, What?,1
1906,Sheldon,8," Romantic love as the basis for marriage has only existed since the nineteenth century. Up until then, arranged marriages were the norm, and it served society quite well.",1
1907,Howard,8, It‰Ûªs the entire premise of Fiddler on the Roof.,1
1908,Leonard,8," I‰Ûªm not a big fan of musicals, but I love that show. ",1
1909,Howard,8," Me too. Of course, it speaks to me culturally. ",1
1910,Sheldon,8," Understandable, but there‰Ûªs a universality to that story which transcends ethnicity.",1
1911,Howard,8, Let‰Ûªs not forget it‰Ûªs got some really catchy tunes.,1
1912,All,8, (various noises of agreement),1
1913,Raj,8," Okay, I know what I‰Ûªm going to do.",1
1914,Leonard,8, What? ,1
1915,Raj,8, Find new friends. ,1
1916,Howard,8, So who wants to rent Fiddler?,1
1917,Sheldon,8," No need, we have the special edition. ",1
1918,Leonard,8," Well, maybe we are like Haroun and Tanweer. ",1
1919,Scene,8, The apartment.,1
1920,Sheldon (on phone),8," This is Dr Sheldon Cooper. Yeah, I need to cancel my membership to the Planetarium. Yeah, well I‰Ûªm sorry too, but there‰Ûªs just no room for you in my wallet. Yeah, I understand, but it was between you and the Museum of Natural History and, frankly, you don‰Ûªt have dinosaurs. Well I‰Ûªll miss you too, bye bye. Okay, I know you‰Ûªre texting about me, and I‰Ûªd really like you to stop.",1
1921,Raj (entering),8," Oh dear, I am rightly and truly screwed. ",1
1922,Leonard,8," Hey, I thought you were finding new friends.",1
1923,Raj,8," I‰Ûªve got some feelers out. In the meantime, listen to this.",1
1924,Lalita (voice from Raj‰Ûªs phone),8," Hi Rajesh, this is Lalita Gupta. Your mother gave my mother your phone number to give to me. So I‰Ûªm calling you, and, ah‰Û_ call me back. Bye. ",1
1925,Raj,8, Can you believe how pushy she is?,1
1926,Leonard,8, So don‰Ûªt call her.,1
1927,Raj,8," If I don‰Ûªt call her, I won‰Ûªt hear the end of it from my parents.",1
1928,Leonard,8, So call her. ,1
1929,Raj,8," How can I call her, you know I can‰Ûªt talk to women. ",1
1930,Leonard,8," I‰Ûªm done, anybody else?",1
1931,Howard,8, Give me the phone.,1
1932,Raj,8, Why?,1
1933,Howard,8, Just give it to me. (Dials),1
1934,Raj,8, What are you doing?,1
1935,Howard,8," Don‰Ûªt worry, you‰Ûªll thank me. (In a fake Indian accent) Hello Lalita, Raj Koothrappali. (Raj starts to chase Howard across the room.) Yes it is good to talk to you too. So, what are you wearing. Oh, not important, so, anyhow, when would you like to meet. Friday works for me. And I call you with the time and place, but in the meantime, keep it real babe. (In own voice) You may now thank me. ",1
1936,Raj,8," For what, making me sound like a Simpsons character? ",1
1937,Howard,8," Fine, next time make your own date.",1
1938,Raj,8, I didn‰Ûªt want to make this one.,1
1939,Leonard,8," Look on the bright side, she might turn out to be a nice, beautiful girl. ",1
1940,Raj,8," Great, then we‰Ûªll get married, I won‰Ûªt be able to talk to her, and we‰Ûªll spend the rest of our lives in total silence. ",1
1941,Howard,8, Worked for my parents. ,1
1942,Penny (knocking and entering),8, Hi guys.,1
1943,Leonard,8," Oh, hey. ",1
1944,Penny,8, I need some guinea pigs.,1
1945,Sheldon,8," Okay, there‰Ûªs a lab animal supply company in Reseda you could try, but if your research is going to have human applications may I suggest white mice instead, their brain chemistry is far closer to ours. ",1
1946,Penny,8," I swear to God, Sheldon, one day I‰Ûªm going to get the hang of talking to you. ",1
1947,Leonard,8, His mom‰Ûªs been saying that for years. What‰Ûªs up?,1
1948,Penny,8," Well, I finally convinced the restaurant to give me a bar tending shift, so I need to practice making drinks.",1
1949,Leonard,8," Oh, great, well the key to acquiring proficiency in any task is repetition.",1
1950,Sheldon,8," With certain obvious exceptions. Suicide, for example. ",1
1951,Penny,8," So Leonard, how about it?",1
1952,Leonard,8," Look, Penny, we‰Ûªd love to help you, but Raj is going through some stuff right now. And besides, he doesn‰Ûªt drink, so‰Û_ (Raj whispers in his ear) Really? Um, Raj is going through some stuff right now and he‰Ûªd like to take up drinking. ",1
1953,Scene,8, Penny‰Ûªs apartment. ,1
1954,Penny,8," Okay, here you go, Leonard, one tequila sunrise. ",1
1955,Leonard,8, Thank you. This drink is a wonderful example of how liquids with different specific gravities interact in a cylindrical container. Thank you. ,1
1956,Penny,8," Okay, Raj, what‰Ûªll it be? (Raj whispers in Leonard‰Ûªs ear.) ",1
1957,Leonard,8, Whatever you recommend.,1
1958,Penny,8," Uh, how about a grasshopper. I make a mean grasshopper. Okay? Good. Coming up. Sheldon, what are you going to have?",1
1959,Sheldon,8, I‰Ûªll have a diet coke.,1
1960,Penny,8," Okay, can you please order a cocktail, I need to practice mixing drinks.",1
1961,Sheldon,8, Fine. I‰Ûªll have a virgin cuba libre. ,1
1962,Penny,8," That‰Ûªs, um, rum and coke without the rum.",1
1963,Sheldon,8," Yes, ",1
1964,Penny,8, So coke.,1
1965,Sheldon,8, Yes. And would you make it diet? ,1
1966,Penny,8, There‰Ûªs a can in the fridge. ,1
1967,Sheldon,8, A cuba libre traditionally comes in a tall glass with a lime wedge.,1
1968,Penny,8, Then swim to Cuba.,1
1969,Sheldon,8, Bartenders are supposed to have people skills. ,1
1970,Penny,8," Okay, Raj, here you go. Alright, who‰Ûªs next?",1
1971,Howard,8, I‰Ûªd like to try a slippery nipple. ,1
1972,Penny,8," Okay, you‰Ûªre cut off. Anybody need a refill?",1
1973,Raj,8," Where did my life go, Penny? One day I‰Ûªm a carefree batchelor, and the next I‰Ûªm married and driving a minivan to peewee cricket matches in suburban New Delhi. ",1
1974,Penny,8, A‰Û_ are you talking to me?,1
1975,Raj,8," Is there another Penny here? I had such plans. I had dreams. I was going to be the Indira Gandhi of particle astro-physics. But with a penis, of course. ",1
1976,Leonard,8, It‰Ûªs amazing.,1
1977,Raj,8," Ever since I was a little boy my father wanted me to be a gynaecologist like him. How can I be a gynaecologist, I can barely look a woman in the eye. You know what, I‰Ûªm not going to let my parents control my future any longer, it‰Ûªs time for a showdown. Somebody give me a computer with a webcam. ",1
1978,Penny,8," Okay, sweetie, I think that‰Ûªs the grasshopper talking. ",1
1979,Raj,8, And it‰Ûªs about to tell my parents that I‰Ûªm not riding an elephant down the aisle with Lalita Gupta. ,1
1980,Penny,8," Okay, calm down, no-one can make you get married. Why don‰Ûªt you just meet this girl and, see what happens.",1
1981,Raj,8," Haven‰Ûªt you been listening to me, I cannot talk to women.",1
1982,Leonard,8, Um‰Û_ Raj.,1
1983,Howard,8," No, no, let‰Ûªs see how long it takes him.",1
1984,Penny,8," Um, Raj, honey, you say you can‰Ûªt talk to women but‰Û_ you‰Ûªve been talking to me.",1
1985,Sheldon,8, And now we‰Ûªll never know. ,1
1986,Raj,8," You‰Ûªre right. I‰Û_ I am talking to you. Hello Penny, how are you?",1
1987,Penny,8, I‰Ûªm fine.,1
1988,Raj,8," Okay, now I just need to make sure I have a Lalita before I meet the grasshopper. It‰Ûªs a sweet green miracle. ",1
1989,Penny,8," Okay, if you‰Ûªre going to drink on this date just promise me you won‰Ûªt overdo it. ",1
1990,Raj,8, Overdo what? Happiness? Freedom? This warm glow inside of me that promises everything is going to be all hunky donkey?,1
1991,Penny,8," Yeah, that. Uh, why don‰Ûªt you bring her to my restaurant when I‰Ûªm tending the bar so I can keep an eye on you?",1
1992,Raj,8, Okay.,1
1993,Leonard,8," Wait a minute, what‰Ûªs the plan here? Let‰Ûªs say he meets her and he likes her and they get married, what‰Ûªs he going to do, stay drunk for the rest of his life?",1
1994,Howard,8, Worked for my parents. ,1
1995,Scene,8, The restaurant.åÊåÊ ,1
1996,Raj,8, I can‰Ûªt believe I‰Ûªm sitting here next to little Lalita Gupta. ,1
1997,Lalita,8," Well, you are. ",1
1998,Raj,8," Little Lalita. That‰Ûªs kind of fun to say. Little Lalita, Little Lalita, Little Lalita, you should try it.",1
1999,Lalita,8," No, it‰Ûªs okay. ",1
2000,Raj,8," You have lost so much weight! That must have been difficult for you because you were so, so fat! Do you remember?",1
2001,Lalita,8," Yes, I do.",1
2002,Raj,8, Of course you do. Who could forget being that fat? ,1
2003,Lalita,8," Well, I‰Ûªve been trying. ",1
2004,Raj,8," So you‰Ûªre a dental student? Hmm, are you aware that dentists have an extremely high suicide rate? Not as high as, say, air traffic controllers, but then there are far more dentists than air traffic controllers, so in pure numbers you‰Ûªre still winning. ",1
2005,Lalita,8, Yay me! ,1
2006,Leonard (to Penny),8, You have a drink that‰Ûªll make him less obnoxious?,1
2007,Penny,8, Drinks do not work that way. ,1
2008,Howard,8," I‰Ûªd say he was doing fine, look at her, last girl my mom set me up with had a moustache and a vestigial tail. ",1
2009,Sheldon,8, Sorry I‰Ûªm late.,1
2010,Leonard,8, What happened?,1
2011,Sheldon,8," Nothing, I just really didn‰Ûªt want to come. Virgin diet cuba libre please.",1
2012,Penny,8, Okay.,1
2013,Sheldon,8," In a tall glass, with a lime wedge.",1
2014,Penny,8," Oh, I‰Ûªll wedge it right in there. ",1
2015,Sheldon,8," So, how‰Ûªs Koothrappali d‰Û_. oh my Lord.",1
2016,Leonard,8, What?,1
2017,Sheldon,8, That‰Ûªs Princess Punchali. ,1
2018,Leonard,8, I‰Ûªm pretty sure her name‰Ûªs Lalita.,1
2019,Sheldon,8," No, no, Princess Punchali from The Monkey and the Princess. ",1
2020,Howard,8," Oh, yeah, I tried to watch that online, but they wanted a credit card. ",1
2021,Sheldon,8, It‰Ûªs a children‰Ûªs story.,1
2022,Howard,8," Oh, no it isn‰Ûªt. ",1
2023,Sheldon,8," When I was a little boy and got sick, which was most of the time, my mother would read it to me. It‰Ûªs about an Indian princess who befriends a monkey, who was mocked by all the other monkeys because he was different. For some reason I related to it quite strongly. ",1
2024,Penny,8, I know the reason. ,1
2025,Leonard,8," We all know the reason. Sheldon, what are you getting at?",1
2026,Sheldon,8, That woman looks exactly like the pictures of Princess Punchali in the book. How often does one see a beloved fictional character come to life?,1
2027,Howard,8," Every year at Comic Con. Every day at Disneyland you can hire Snow White to come to your house. Course they prefer it if you have a kid, but‰Û_ ",1
2028,Raj,8," Hey guys. This is Lalita Gupta, Lalita this is Leonard and Sheldon and Howard and Penny. Isn‰Ûªt it great, she isn‰Ûªt fat any more! ",1
2029,Sheldon,8," Forgive me your highness, for I am but a monkey, and it is in my nature to climb. I did not mean to gaze upon you as you comb your hair.",1
2030,Lalita,8, I‰Ûªm sorry? ,1
2031,Sheldon,8, You are the living embodiment of the beautiful Princess Punchali. ,1
2032,Lalita,8," Oh, no kidding? Oh, who is that?",1
2033,Sheldon,8, A beloved character from an Indian folk tale. ,1
2034,Lalita,8," Oh. Us Indian, or ‰ÛÏcome to our casino‰Û Indian?",1
2035,Sheldon,8, You Indian.,1
2036,Lalita,8, Oh. ,1
2037,Sheldon,8, The resemblance is remarkable. I can practically smell the lotus blossoms woven into your ebony hair. ,1
2038,Lalita,8, Thanks. I imagine you smell very nice too. ,1
2039,Sheldon,8, I shower twice a day and wash my hands as often as I can. ,1
2040,Lalita,8," Really, so do I.",1
2041,Raj,8," But you‰Ûªre a dentist, he‰Ûªs nuts. ",1
2042,Lalita,8," Don‰Ûªt be insulting Rajesh. So, Sheldon, tell me more about this princess you say I look like. ",1
2043,Sheldon,8," It was said that the Gods fashioned her eyes out of the stars, and that roses were ashamed to bloom in the presence of her ruby lips. ",1
2044,Lalita,8, Oh my.,1
2045,Raj,8, Back off Sheldon. ,1
2046,Sheldon,8, What?,1
2047,Raj,8, If you do not stop hitting on my lady you will feel the full extent of my wrath.,1
2048,Sheldon,8, I‰Ûªm not hitting on her.,1
2049,Lalita,8, And I am not your lady. ,1
2050,Howard,8, And you have no wrath. ,1
2051,Raj,8, You are my lady. Our parents said so. We are for all intents and purposes one hundred percent hooked up.,1
2052,Lalita,8," Okay, let‰Ûªs get something straight here. The only reason I came tonight was to get my parents off my case, I certainly don‰Ûªt need to be getting this old world crap from you.",1
2053,Sheldon,8, Exactly the kind of spirit with which Princess Punchali led the monkeys to freedom. ,1
2054,Raj,8," Oh, screw Princess Punchali.",1
2055,Lalita,8," Hey, you can‰Ûªt talk to me like that.",1
2056,Raj,8, But you‰Ûªre not Princess Punchali.,1
2057,Sheldon,8," Luckily for you, she could have you beheaded.",1
2058,Lalita,8," Sheldon, are you hungry?",1
2059,Sheldon,8, I could eat. ,1
2060,Lalita,8, Let‰Ûªs go. ,1
2061,Raj,8, What just happened?,1
2062,Leonard,8, Beats the hell out of me. ,1
2063,Howard,8," I‰Ûªll tell you what just happened, I just learned how to pick up Indian chicks. ",1
2064,Scene,8, The apartment. Raj is talking to his parents on the webcam.,1
2065,Mrs Koothrappali,8, What are we supposed to say to Lalita‰Ûªs parents?,1
2066,Dr Koothrappali,8," I play golf with her father, I won‰Ûªt be able to look at him.",1
2067,Raj,8," Maybe you should keep your eye on the ball, Papa. ",1
2068,Dr Koothrappali,8," Oh, now you‰Ûªre a funny man? This is not funny, Mr Funny Man. ",1
2069,Leonard,8," Doctor and Mrs Koothrappali, in all fairness, it wasn‰Ûªt entirely Raj‰Ûªs fault. ",1
2070,Dr Koothrappali,8, This is a family matter Sheldon.,1
2071,Leonard,8," No, I‰Ûªm Leonard. ",1
2072,Dr Koothrappali,8," Oh, sorry, you all look alike to us. ",1
2073,Raj,8," But he‰Ûªs right, Papa, listen to him. (Sheldon enters) You! You are the one who ruined everything! ",1
2074,Mrs Koothrappali,8, Who is it? We can‰Ûªt see.,1
2075,Dr Koothrappali,8," Turn us, turn us. ",1
2076,Raj,8," Go ahead, tell my parents why they won‰Ûªt have any grandchildren.",1
2077,Sheldon,8," How would I know, do you have a low sperm count?",1
2078,Raj,8, This has nothing to do with my sperm count.,1
2079,Mrs Koothrappali,8," You are wearing the boxers that we sent you, aren‰Ûªt you Rajesh.",1
2080,Raj,8, Yes Mommy.,1
2081,Mrs Koothrappali,8, Because you know what happens to the samosas when you wear the tidy whities. ,1
2082,Raj,8," Can we please stop talking about my testicles? Sheldon, tell them what you did.",1
2083,Sheldon,8, What did I do? ,1
2084,Leonard,8, You left with his date. Friends don‰Ûªt do that to each other. ,1
2085,Sheldon,8," Oh. Alright, noted. Sorry.",1
2086,Raj,8, Sorry? That‰Ûªs all you can say is sorry?,1
2087,Leonard,8," Take it, Raj. It‰Ûªs more than I‰Ûªve ever gotten. ",1
2088,Sheldon,8, And may I point out she wouldn‰Ûªt have asked me to go with her if you hadn‰Ûªt been drunk and boring. ,1
2089,Dr Koothrappali,8, Drunk?,1
2090,Sheldon,8," And boring, her words. ",1
2091,Dr Koothrappali,8," I knew it, he moves to America and becomes an alcoholic. ",1
2092,Raj,8, I‰Ûªm not an alcoholic.,1
2093,Dr Koothrappali,8, Then why were you drunk?,1
2094,Raj,8," It was just this one time, Papa, I swear. ",1
2095,Dr Koothrappali,8, Are you in denial? Do we have to come over and do an intervention? ,1
2096,Mrs Koothrappali,8, Don‰Ûªt embarrass him in front of his friends. ,1
2097,Dr Koothrappali,8," Alright. Carry us outside, we want to talk to you in private. ",1
2098,Raj,8," But Papa, please‰Û_.",1
2099,Dr Koothrappali,8," Now, Rajesh. ",1
2100,Raj (to Leonard and Sheldon),8, I have to go. åÊåÊ,1
2101,Dr Koothrappali,8, Now listen to me‰Û_.,1
2102,Raj,8, Please wait until I get into the hall. ,1
2103,Sheldon,8," Okay, well, good night.",1
2104,Leonard,8, Hold on. What happened with you and Lalita?,1
2105,Sheldon,8," We ate. She lectured me on the link between gum disease and heart attacks, nothing I didn‰Ûªt already know, and I came home. ",1
2106,Leonard,8, So you‰Ûªre not going to see her again?,1
2107,Sheldon,8, Why would I see her again? I already have a dentist. (Exits),1
2108,Leonard,8, I wonder who‰Ûªs going to tell his parents they‰Ûªre not having grandchildren. ,1
2109,Scene,8," Penny‰Ûªs restaurant. Sheldon is on the piano, singing ‰ÛÏTo Life‰Û from Fiddler on the Roof enthusiastically. ",1
2110,Leonard,8," I don‰Ûªt believe it, what‰Ûªs gotten into him? ",1
2111,Penny,8," Oh, maybe a couple of virgin cuba libres that turned out to be kind of slutty. ",1
2112,Leonard,8, You didn‰Ûªt?,1
2113,Penny,8," Hey, you do your experiments, I do mine. ",1
2114,Scene,9," The apartment, Leonard is attaching something to a lamp.",1
2115,Leonard,9," Okay, the X10s are online.",1
2116,Howard,9," Gentlemen, I am now about to send a signal from this laptop through our local ISP, racing down fibre-optic cable at the speed of light to San Francisco, bouncing off a satellite in geosynchronous orbit to Lisbon, Portugal, where the data packets will be handed off to submerged transatlantic cables terminating in Halifax, Nova-Scotia, and transferred across the continent via microwave relays back to our ISP and the X10 receiver attached to this (clicks mouse, lamp switches on) lamp. (The others cheer and clap). ",1
2117,Sheldon,9," Look at me, look at me, I‰Ûªve got goosebumps. ",1
2118,Howard,9, Are we ready on the stereo? ,1
2119,Raj,9, Go for stereo. ,1
2120,Penny (entering),9, Hey guys. ,1
2121,"All (calming down, embarrassed)",9, Hello.,1
2122,Penny,9, It‰Ûªs a little loud.,1
2123,Howard,9," No problem, turning it down. (Using mouse again) San Francisco, Lisbon, Halifax (the music gets quieter) et voila. ",1
2124,Penny,9," Okay, thanks.",1
2125,Leonard,9," Hang on, hang on, do you not realise what we just did.",1
2126,Penny,9," Yeah, you turned your stereo down with your laptop. ",1
2127,Sheldon,9," No, we turned our stereo down by sending a signal around the world via the internet. ",1
2128,Penny,9," Oh. You know you can just get one of those universal remotes at Radio Shack, they‰Ûªre really cheap.",1
2129,Leonard,9," No, no, no, you don‰Ûªt get it, um, Howard, enable public access. ",1
2130,Howard,9, Public access enabled. (They all stare around for a moment in silence.),1
2131,Penny,9," Boy, that‰Ûªs brilliant, but I‰Ûªll see you.",1
2132,Leonard,9," No, hang on, hang on. (The lamp goes off and on again.) See! ",1
2133,Penny,9, No.,1
2134,Sheldon,9," Someone in Sezchuan province, China is using his computer to turn our lights on and off. ",1
2135,Penny,9," Huh, well that‰Ûªs handy. Um, here‰Ûªs a question, why? ",1
2136,All together,9, Because we can. (There is a loud noise),1
2137,Sheldon,9, They found the remote controlled cars.,1
2138,Penny,9," Well, wait, wait, what‰Ûªs on top of them. ",1
2139,Leonard,9," Wireless webcams, wave hello. ",1
2140,Howard,9," The monster truck is out of Austin, Texas, and the blue Viper is being operated from suburban Tel Aviv. ",1
2141,Sheldon,9, You may want to put on slacks. ,1
2142,Penny,9," What? (Seeing red car is trying to get between her legs) Ew, stop it, no, leave me alone. ",1
2143,Leonard,9, Who‰Ûªs running the red Corvette?,1
2144,Howard,9, That would be me. ,1
2145,Scene,9," The same, clearing up.",1
2146,Sheldon,9," You know, in the future, when we‰Ûªre disembodied brains in jars, we‰Ûªre going to look back on this as eight hours well wasted. ",1
2147,Raj,9, I don‰Ûªt want to be in a jar. I want my brain in an android body. Eight feet tall and ripped. ,1
2148,Howard,9, I‰Ûªm with you. I just have to make sure if I‰Ûªm a synthetic human I‰Ûªd still be Jewish. I promised my mother. ,1
2149,Raj,9, I suppose you could have your android penis circumcised. But that‰Ûªs something your Rabbi would have to discuss with the manufacturers. ,1
2150,Sheldon,9, Not to mention you‰Ûªd have to power down on Saturdays. ,1
2151,Leonard,9," Sheldon, why is this letter in the trash? ",1
2152,Sheldon,9," Well, there‰Ûªs always the possibility that a trash can spontaneously formed around the letter, but Occam‰Ûªs Razor would suggest that someone threw it out. ",1
2153,Leonard,9, It‰Ûªs from the Institute for Experimental Physics. They want us to present our paper on the properties of super solids at the topical conference on Bowes-Einstein condensates. ,1
2154,Sheldon,9, I know. I read it before I threw it out. ,1
2155,Leonard,9," Okay‰Û_ if I may drill down to the bedrock of my question, why did you throw it out.",1
2156,Sheldon,9," Because I have no interest in standing in the Rose Room of the Pasadena Marriott in front of a group of judgemental strangers, who wouldn‰Ûªt recognise true genius if it were standing in front of them giving a speech. Which, if I were there, it would be. ",1
2157,Howard,9," I don‰Ûªt know, Sheldon, those topical conferences on Bowes-Einstein condensates parties are legendary. ",1
2158,Leonard,9, Forget the parties.,1
2159,Howard,9, Forget the parties? What a nerd. ,1
2160,Leonard,9, Are there any other honours I‰Ûªve gotten that I don‰Ûªt know about? Did UPS drop off a Nobel Prize with my name on it?,1
2161,Sheldon,9," Leonard, please don‰Ûªt take this the wrong way, but the day you win a Nobel Prize, is the day I begin my research on the drag co-efficient of tassles on flying carpets. ",1
2162,Raj,9, Hoo-hoo-hoo. The only thing missing from that insult was ‰ÛÏyo mamma.‰Û ,1
2163,Howard,9," I‰Ûªve got one, hey Leonard, your mamma‰Ûªs research methodology is so flawed‰Û_.",1
2164,Leonard,9," Shut up, Howard. Sheldon, we have to do this.",1
2165,Sheldon,9," No we don‰Ûªt. We have to take in nourishment, expel waste, and inhale enough oxygen to keep ourselves from dying, everything else is optional. ",1
2166,Leonard,9," Okay, let me put it this way, I‰Ûªm doing it.",1
2167,Sheldon,9, You can‰Ûªt. I‰Ûªm the lead author. ,1
2168,Leonard,9," Oh, come on. The only reason you‰Ûªre the lead author is because we went alphabetically. ",1
2169,Sheldon,9," I let you think we went alphabetically to spare you the humiliation of dealing with the fact that it was my idea. Not to put too fine a point on it, but I was throwing you a bone. You‰Ûªre welcome. ",1
2170,Leonard,9," Excuse me, I designed the experiment that proved the hypothesis. ",1
2171,Sheldon,9, It doesn‰Ûªt need proving. ,1
2172,Leonard,9, So the entire scientific community is just supposed to take your word?,1
2173,Sheldon,9," They‰Ûªre not supposed to, but they should. ",1
2174,Leonard,9," Alright, I don‰Ûªt care what you say, I‰Ûªm going to the conference and I‰Ûªm presenting our findings. ",1
2175,Sheldon,9, And I forbid it. ,1
2176,Leonard,9, You forbid it?,1
2177,Sheldon,9, If I‰Ûªm not taking credit for our work then nobody is. ,1
2178,Leonard,9," Oh, you admit that it‰Ûªs our work.",1
2179,Sheldon,9," No, once again, I‰Ûªm throwing you a bone. And once again, you are welcome. ",1
2180,Leonard,9, Ah!,1
2181,Howard,9, Oh no he dit‰Ûªnt!,1
2182,Scene,9, Leonard‰Ûªs bedroom. Penny is looking through his closet. ,1
2183,Penny,9," So, how‰Ûªs it going with Sheldon, are you guys still not talking to each other? ",1
2184,Leonard,9," Not only is he still not talking to me, but there‰Ûªs this thing he does where he stares at you and tries to get your brain to explode. You know, like in the classic sci-fi movie Scanners? (Put‰Ûªs fingers to head) You know, bzzz-pchew! Never mind. How about this one. It says, ‰ÛÏI know my physics, but I‰Ûªm still a fun guy!‰Û",1
2185,Penny,9," Oh, hey, I didn‰Ûªt know they still made corduroy suits!",1
2186,Leonard,9," They don‰Ûªt, that‰Ûªs why I saved this one. ",1
2187,Penny,9," Okay, well, let‰Ûªs just see what else you have. Okay, here, take this, and this, and this, and these.",1
2188,Leonard,9, Is this all stuff you want me to try on?,1
2189,Penny,9," No, this is stuff I want you to throw out. ",1
2190,Leonard,9, Oh.,1
2191,Penny,9," Seriously, don‰Ûªt even give it to charity, you won‰Ûªt be helping anyone. What‰Ûªs this.",1
2192,Leonard,9," Oh, that‰Ûªs the bottled city of Kandor. ",1
2193,Penny,9, Uh-huh. ,1
2194,Leonard,9," You see, Kandor was the capital city of the planet Krypton, it was miniaturised by Brainiac before Krypton exploded and then rescued by Superman. ",1
2195,Penny,9," Oh, nice. ",1
2196,Leonard,9, It‰Ûªs a lot cooler when girls aren‰Ûªt looking at it.,1
2197,Penny,9," Here, why don‰Ûªt you put these on while I find a shirt and sport-coat to match. ",1
2198,Leonard,9," Great, be right back.",1
2199,Penny,9," Well, where you going, just put them on. ",1
2200,Leonard,9, Here?,1
2201,Penny,9," Oh, are you shy? ",1
2202,Leonard,9," No, I‰Ûªm not shy.",1
2203,Penny,9," Don‰Ûªt worry, I won‰Ûªt look. ",1
2204,Leonard,9," I know you won‰Ûªt look, why would you look, there‰Ûªs nothing to see, well, not nothing‰Û_.",1
2205,Penny,9," Sweetie, put the pants on.",1
2206,Leonard,9, Putting them on.,1
2207,Penny,9," So, you know, isn‰Ûªt there maybe some way you and Sheldon could compromise on this whole presentation thing.",1
2208,Leonard,9," No. No. Scientists do not compromise. Our minds are trained to synthesise facts and come to inarguable conclusions. Not to mention, Sheldon is batcrap crazy. ",1
2209,Penny,9, What is this?,1
2210,Leonard,9," Oh, careful. That‰Ûªs my original series Battlestar Galactica flight suit. ",1
2211,Penny,9," Oh, why didn‰Ûªt you wear it at Halloween?",1
2212,Leonard,9," Because it‰Ûªs not a costume, it‰Ûªs a flight suit. ",1
2213,Penny,9," Okay, alright, moving on, oh, wow, a paisley shirt.",1
2214,Leonard,9," Uh-huh, it goes with my corduroy suit. ",1
2215,Penny,9," If you mean it should end up in the same place then, I agree. Is this your‰Û_ your only tie?",1
2216,Leonard,9," Ah. Technically yes, but, if you‰Ûªll notice, it‰Ûªs reversible. So it works as two. ",1
2217,Penny,9," Oh, sweetie, I don‰Ûªt think it even works as one. Is this all your clothes?",1
2218,Leonard,9, Yeah. Everything since the eighth grade. ,1
2219,Penny,9, The‰Û_ the eighth grade?,1
2220,Leonard,9, My last growth spurt. ,1
2221,Penny,9," Okay, well, I guess we‰Ûªre back to the corduroy suit. ",1
2222,Leonard,9, Great.,1
2223,Penny,9," Yup. (Leonard picks up paisley shirt) I said no, put it down. ",1
2224,Scene,9, The ground floor hallway.,1
2225,Penny,9, Hey Sheldon! ,1
2226,Sheldon (unlocking his mailbox),9, Hello Penny. åÊ,1
2227,Penny,9, Get anything good? ,1
2228,Sheldon,9," Uh, just the latest copy of Applied Particle Physics Quarterly.",1
2229,Penny,9," Oh, you know, that is so weird that yours came and mine didn‰Ûªt. (Sheldon looks confused). It was a joke. (Sheldon gives a fake laugh.) Yup, tip your waitresses, I‰Ûªm here all week. ",1
2230,Sheldon,9," Penny, just to save you from further awkwardness know that I‰Ûªm perfectly comfortable with the two of us climbing the stairs in silence. ",1
2231,Penny,9," Oh yeah, me too. Zip it, lock it. (The begin to climb) Put it in your pocket. So you and Leonard‰Û_",1
2232,Sheldon,9, Oh dear God! ,1
2233,Penny,9," Little misunderstanding, huh. ",1
2234,Sheldon,9, A little misunder‰Û_. Galileo and the Pope had a little misunderstanding.,1
2235,Penny,9," Anyway, I was talking to Leonard this morning and I think he feels really bad about it. ",1
2236,Sheldon,9, Huh.,1
2237,Penny,9, Well how do you feel?,1
2238,Sheldon,9, I don‰Ûªt understand the question.,1
2239,Penny,9, Well I‰Ûªm just asking if it‰Ûªs difficult to be fighting with your best friend. ,1
2240,Sheldon,9, Oh. I hadn‰Ûªt thought about it like that. I wonder if I‰Ûªve been experiencing physiological manifestations of some sort of unconscious emotional turmoil. ,1
2241,Penny,9, Wait‰Û_ what? ,1
2242,Sheldon,9, I couldn‰Ûªt poop this morning. ,1
2243,Penny,9," You should just talk to him, I‰Ûªm sure you guys can work this out. ",1
2244,Sheldon,9, It‰Ûªs certainly preferable to my plan.,1
2245,Penny,9, Which was? ,1
2246,Sheldon,9, A powerful laxative. ,1
2247,Penny,9," Okay, so you absolutely should talk to him, look, I know Leonard values you as a friend, and he told me himself that without your little idea there‰Ûªs no way he could have come up with this whole experiment thing.",1
2248,Sheldon,9," Excuse me, little idea? ",1
2249,Penny,9," Yeah, I mean he tried to explain it to me, I didn‰Ûªt really understand it but‰Û_",1
2250,Sheldon,9," Of course you didn‰Ûªt, he said little idea? ",1
2251,Penny,9," Uh, well no, no, not in‰Û_ not in those words.",1
2252,Sheldon,9," In what words then, exactly",1
2253,Penny,9," Um, gee, the exact words aren‰Ûªt written‰Û_ it‰Ûªs more the spirit in which it‰Ûªs ",1
2254,Sheldon,9, What did he say?,1
2255,Penny,9, You had a lucky hunch. ,1
2256,Leonard (coming out of apartment),9," Hey, Sheldon, I‰Ûªve been thinking, instead of arguing about this why don‰Ûªt‰Û_.",1
2257,Sheldon,9, Don‰Ûªt you ever speak to me again. ,1
2258,Leonard,9, What‰Û_ (Sheldon goes into apartment and slams the door). ,1
2259,Penny,9," Uh, he‰Û_ (makes ‰ÛÏhe‰Ûªs screwy‰Û hand movements, turns to go). ",1
2260,Scene,9, The apartment. Leonard is dressed in the corduroy suit. ,1
2261,Leonard,9," Okay, I‰Ûªm leaving for the conference. ",1
2262,Sheldon,9, Have fun presenting my lucky hunch. ,1
2263,Leonard,9, Sheldon I didn‰Ûªt mean it like that.,1
2264,Sheldon,9, Then why did you say it.,1
2265,Leonard,9," I don‰Ûªt know, I wasn‰Ûªt choosing my‰Û_",1
2266,Sheldon,9, Were you trying to impress Penny?,1
2267,Leonard,9," No, no not at all. A little bit. ",1
2268,Sheldon,9, How‰Ûªd that work out for you?,1
2269,Penny (entering),9," Leonard, ready to go?",1
2270,Sheldon,9," Libido 1, truth zero. ",1
2271,Leonard,9," Okay, I‰Ûªm going to ask you one more time, we did the work together, lets present the paper together.",1
2272,Sheldon,9," And I‰Ûªm telling you for the last time it‰Ûªs pandering, it‰Ûªs undignified and bite me. ",1
2273,Leonard,9, Let‰Ûªs go.,1
2274,Penny,9, Bye Sheldon. ,1
2275,Sheldon,9," Goodbye Penny. (Places fingers to head to try to make Leonard‰Ûªs brain explode. Leonard leaves.) Oooh, one of these days, Pkshhhh!",1
2276,Scene,9, A corridor at the conference. Penny is attaching Leonard‰Ûªs name tag. ,1
2277,Penny,9, There you go. ,1
2278,Leonard,9," You‰Ûªre right, this side does look better. ",1
2279,Penny,9," No, no, I didn‰Ûªt say better, I said less stained. ",1
2280,Howard,9," I just checked the house, there‰Ûªs probably twenty, twenty-five people in there.",1
2281,Leonard,9, You‰Ûªre kidding. ,1
2282,Penny,9, Is that all?,1
2283,Leonard,9," All? In particle physics, twenty five is Woodstock. ",1
2284,Penny,9," Oh, well, then good!",1
2285,Leonard,9," I wasn‰Ûªt expecting such a crowd, I‰Ûªm a little nervous. ",1
2286,Howard,9," It‰Ûªs okay, just open with a joke, you‰Ûªll be fine. ",1
2287,Leonard,9," A joke. Okay. How about this, um, okay, uh there‰Ûªs this farmer, and he has these chickens, but they won‰Ûªt lay any eggs. So, he calls a physicist to help. The physicist then does some calculations, and he says, um, I have a solution, but it only works with spherical chickens in a vacuum. (Raj and Howard laugh.) Right? ",1
2288,Penny,9," Oh, sorry, I‰Ûªve just, I‰Ûªve heard it before. ",1
2289,Howard,9," Let‰Ûªs roll. Hey, nice suit.",1
2290,Leonard,9," It‰Ûªs a classic, right? ",1
2291,Penny,9, I really should have brought my own car. ,1
2292,Scene,9, Leonard is presenting.,1
2293,Leonard,9," So, in conclusion, the data show that at temperatures approaching absolute zero, the moment of inertia changes, and the solid becomes a super-solid, which clearly appears to be a previously unknown state of matter. (Applause) Thank you. (Penny is asleep on Howard‰Ûªs shoulder. Howard is taking a photograph with his camera phone.) Are there any questions?",1
2294,Voice,9, Yeah. What the hell was that? ,1
2295,Leonard,9, Any other questions?,1
2296,"Sheldon (who previously spoke, now removing his hood and dark glasses)",9," Doctor Sheldon Cooper here, I am the lead author of this particular paper. (No reaction.) Thank you. And you, sir, you have completely skipped over the part where I was walking through the park, and I saw these children on a merry-go-round, which started me thinking about the moment of inertia in gasses like helium at temperatures approaching absolute zero. ",1
2297,Leonard,9," I didn‰Ûªt skip it, it‰Ûªs just an anecdote. It‰Ûªs not science.",1
2298,Sheldon,9," Oh, I see, was the apple falling on Newton‰Ûªs head, was that just an anecdote?",1
2299,Leonard,9, You are not Isaac Newton.,1
2300,Sheldon,9," No, no that‰Ûªs true, gravity would have been apparent to me without the apple. ",1
2301,Leonard,9, You cannot possibly be that arrogant.,1
2302,Sheldon,9," You continue to underestimate me, my good man. ",1
2303,Leonard,9," Look, if you weren‰Ûªt happy with my presentation then maybe you should have given it with me.",1
2304,Sheldon,9," As I have explained repeatedly, unlike you, I don‰Ûªt need validation from lesser minds. No offence. ",1
2305,Leonard,9," Really, so why did you come?",1
2306,Sheldon,9, Because I knew you‰Ûªd screw this up.,1
2307,Leonard,9, I didn‰Ûªt screw it up.,1
2308,Sheldon,9," Oh, please. I admit, that spherical chicken joke, that was hilarious. But it was straight downhill from there. ",1
2309,Leonard,9," I‰Ûªve had enough of your condescension. Maybe I didn‰Ûªt go to college when I was eleven like you, maybe I got my doctorate at 24 instead of 16, but you are not the only person who is smarter than everyone else in this room. No offense. And I am clearly not the only person who is tormented by insecurity and has an ego in need of constant validation.",1
2310,Sheldon,9, So you admit that you‰Ûªre an egotist?,1
2311,Leonard,9," Yes. (To audience) My name is Dr Leonard Hofstadter, and I could never please my parents so I need to get all my self-esteem from strangers like you. But he‰Ûªs worse.",1
2312,Sheldon,9," Okay, that is it. (Tries to explode brain again.)",1
2313,Leonard,9, You cannot blow up my head with your mind. ,1
2314,Sheldon,9, Then I‰Ûªll settle for an aneurysm. ,1
2315,Leonard (knocking his hands down),9, Stop it.,1
2316,Sheldon,9," You hit me. You saw him, he hit me.",1
2317,Leonard,9, You were trying to blow up my head.,1
2318,Sheldon,9, So it was working.,1
2319,Leonard,9," It wasn‰Ûªt, it was not, you are a nutcase.",1
2320,Sheldon,9," Oh we‰Ûªll see about that (tries again), heads up you people in the front row, this is a splash zone.",1
2321,Leonard,9," Stop, stop it, quit it. (The start to fight.)",1
2322,Penny,9, Is this usually how these physics things go?,1
2323,Howard,9, More often than you‰Ûªd think.,1
2324,Leonard (getting Sheldon on floor),9, Vulcan nerve pinch!,1
2325,Scene,9, The apartment. ,1
2326,Sheldon,9, You could have offered me a ride home. ,1
2327,Leonard,9, You‰Ûªre lucky I didn‰Ûªt run you over. ,1
2328,Sheldon,9," I really don‰Ûªt understand what you‰Ûªre so unhappy about, you begged me to come, I came, there‰Ûªs just no pleasing you. ",1
2329,Leonard,9," You‰Ûªre right, I‰Ûªm the problem, I‰Ûªm the one that needs help. ",1
2330,Sheldon,9," Well that‰Ûªs not much of an apology, but I‰Ûªll take it. ",1
2331,Leonard,9, Excuse me. Is there anything you‰Ûªd like to apologise for?,1
2332,Sheldon,9, Yes. I‰Ûªm sorry I tried to blow up your head. It was uncalled for. ,1
2333,Howard (entering with Raj),9, You won‰Ûªt believe this.,1
2334,Raj,9, Somebody got the whole thing on a cell phone and put it on youtube. ,1
2335,Leonard,9, What? ,1
2336,Sheldon,9," Now, who would do that?",1
2337,Howard,9," That would be me. Hey, check it out, it‰Ûªs a featured video. (The watch). ",1
2338,Leonard,9, Oh jeez. Is this suit really look that bad?,1
2339,Sheldon,9," Forget your suit, look at my arms waving, I‰Ûªm like a flamingo on Ritalin. ",1
2340,Penny (entering),9," Howard, would you like to explain to me why your facebook page has a picture of me sleeping on your shoulder captioned ‰ÛÏMe and my Girlfriend?‰Û",1
2341,Howard,9," Uh-oh, here comes ‰ÛÏthe talk.‰Û ",1
2342,Scene,9," Captioned ‰ÛÏSomewhere in China‰Û, two Chinese students watch the video on their computer. ",1
2343,Student one (in captions),9, What losers. ,1
2344,Student two,9, Yeah. Gigantic American geeks. (The lights flicker),1
2345,Student one,9,åÊ Who‰Ûªs doing that? ,1
2346,Student two,9," Someone from Pasadena, California named‰Û_ ‰ÛÏWolowizard.‰Û ",1
2347,Together,9, Awesome!,1
2348,Scene,10, The downstairs lobby.,1
2349,Leonard,10," See, the liquid metal Terminators were created in the future by Skynet, and Skynet was developed by Miles Dyson, but that future no longer exists, due to Dyson‰Ûªs death in Terminator 2.",1
2350,Sheldon,10," Okay, then riddle me this. Assuming all the good Terminators were originally evil Terminators created by Skynet but then reprogrammed by the future John Connor, why would Skynet, an artificial computer intelligence, bother to create a petite hot 17 year-old killer robot?",1
2351,Leonard,10, Skynet is kinky? I don‰Ûªt know. ,1
2352,Sheldon,10, Artificial intelligences do not have teen fetishes. ,1
2353,Leonard,10," Alright, oh wait, they use it to in‰Û_",1
2354,Sheldon,10," (Buzzing noise), too late, I win. ",1
2355,"Penny (voice off, singing, quite tunelessly)",10, Let‰Ûªs go-oh-oh Ou-oooo-ut tonight. I have to go-oh-oh-oh ou-ooooo-ut tonight. ,1
2356,Leonard,10, What the hell is that? ,1
2357,Sheldon,10," I don‰Ûªt know, but if cats could sing, they‰Ûªd hate it too. (The continue up the stairs and disappear from view).",1
2358,Penny (still singing off),10," You wanna prowl, be my night owl, (Leonard and Sheldon reappear, running down the stairs) we‰Ûªll take my‰Û_ (appearing) Hey guys, hi! Where you going?",1
2359,Leonard,10, What? Oh we just had to‰Û_ mail some letters and (seeing Sheldon has large bag in hand and bin is nearby) throw away some chicken. (Sheldon very reluctantly does.),1
2360,Penny,10, You‰Ûªll never guess what just happened.,1
2361,Leonard,10," Oh, I give up.",1
2362,Sheldon,10," I don‰Ûªt guess. As a scientist I reach conclusions based on observation and experimentation, although as I‰Ûªm saying this it occurs to me you may have been employing a rhetorical device rendering my response moot. ",1
2363,Penny,10, What was that?,1
2364,Leonard,10," Believe it or not, personal growth. What happened?",1
2365,Penny,10," Alright, remember when I auditioned for that workshop production of Rent, but I didn‰Ûªt get it and I couldn‰Ûªt figure out why?",1
2366,Sheldon,10, I have a conclusion based on an observation.,1
2367,Leonard,10, No you don‰Ûªt. No he doesn‰Ûªt.,1
2368,Penny,10," Well, the girl they picked to play Mimi, she dropped out and they asked me to replace her. ",1
2369,Leonard,10," Oh, congratulations, what a lucky break.",1
2370,Penny,10," It‰Ûªs not a big deal, just a one night showcase, but they invite a lot of casting people and agents so, you never know. ",1
2371,Sheldon,10, I think I know.,1
2372,Leonard,10, No you don‰Ûªt. He doesn‰Ûªt.,1
2373,Penny,10," It‰Ûªs this Friday at eight, you guys want to come?",1
2374,Together,10, No.,1
2375,Leonard,10," Because‰Û_. uh, Friday, we are attending a symposium on molecular positronium.",1
2376,Sheldon,10, I think that‰Ûªs a week from Tuesday at six. ,1
2377,Leonard,10," No, it‰Ûªs this Friday, at eight. ",1
2378,Penny,10," Oh, too bad, well, I got to get to rehearsal, see you guys. ",1
2379,Leonard,10, See you. (Penny exits singing) ,1
2380,Sheldon,10, You just lied to Penny.,1
2381,Leonard,10," Yes, I did. ",1
2382,Sheldon,10," And you did it so casually, no rapid breathing, no increase in perspiration.",1
2383,Leonard,10, So?,1
2384,Sheldon,10," So, lack of a physiological response while lying is characteristic of a violent sociopath. ",1
2385,Leonard,10," Sheldon, are you worried about your safety.",1
2386,Sheldon,10," No, I imagine if you were going to kill me you‰Ûªd have done it a long time ago. ",1
2387,Leonard,10, That‰Ûªs very true. ,1
2388,Scene,10, Outside Leonard‰Ûªs bedroom. ,1
2389,Sheldon,10," (Knock, knock, knock, knock) Leonard, (Knock, knock, knock, knock) Leonard, (Knock, knock, knock, knock) Leonard‰Û_",1
2390,Leonard,10, What?,1
2391,Sheldon,10, I need to speak to you.,1
2392,Leonard,10, It‰Ûªs two o‰Ûªclock in the morning,1
2393,Sheldon,10, It‰Ûªs important.,1
2394,Leonard,10, I highly doubt that. Go away. (Long pause). Are you still out there? ,1
2395,Sheldon,10, Yes. ,1
2396,Leonard (opening door),10, What? ,1
2397,Sheldon,10," You‰Ûªre right, it can wait until morning. ",1
2398,Leonard (following Sheldon into living room),10," What, what, what, what, what? ",1
2399,Sheldon,10," Never mind. I clearly woke you up in the middle of a REM cycle, you‰Ûªre in no state to talk.",1
2400,Leonard,10," Sheldon, what is it? ",1
2401,Sheldon,10, I‰Ûªm uncomfortable having been included in your lie to Penny. ,1
2402,Leonard,10, What was I supposed to say. ,1
2403,Sheldon,10, You could have told her the truth.,1
2404,Leonard,10, That would have hurt her feelings. ,1
2405,Sheldon,10, Is that a relevant factor? ,1
2406,Leonard,10, Yes.,1
2407,Sheldon,10, Then I suppose you could have agreed to go. ,1
2408,Leonard,10, And what would I have said afterwards? ,1
2409,Sheldon,10," I would suggest something to the effect of, singing is neither an appropriate vocation nor avocation for you, and if you disagree, I‰Ûªd recommend you have a CAT scan, to look for a tumour pressing on the cognitive processing centre of your brain.",1
2410,Leonard,10," I couldn‰Ûªt say that, I would have to say, you were terrific and I can‰Ûªt wait to hear you sing again. ",1
2411,Sheldon,10, Why? ,1
2412,Leonard,10," It‰Ûªs the social protocol, it‰Ûªs what you do when you have a friend who‰Ûªs proud of something they really suck at. ",1
2413,Sheldon,10, I was not aware of that. ,1
2414,Leonard,10, Well now you are.,1
2415,Sheldon,10," Oh, alright. Leonard.",1
2416,Leonard,10, Yes.,1
2417,Sheldon,10," When we played chess earlier, you were terrific and I can‰Ûªt wait to play you again. Goodnight. ",1
2418,Scene,10, Leonard‰Ûªs bedroom. ,1
2419,Sheldon,10," (Knock, knock, knock, knock) Leonard, (Knock, knock, knock, knock) Leonard, (Knock, knock, knock, knock) Leonard, (Knock, knock, knock, knock) Leonard, (Knock, knock, knock, knock)‰Û_.. ",1
2420,Leonard,10, Oooaw. This would be so much easier if I were a violent sociopath. (Opening door) What?,1
2421,Sheldon,10," I was analysing our lie, and I believe we‰Ûªre in danger of Penny seeing through the ruse.",1
2422,Leonard,10, How?,1
2423,Sheldon,10," Simple. If she were to log on to www.socalphysicsgroup.org/activities/other, click on upcoming events, scroll down to seminars, download the pdf schedule, and look for the seminar on molecular positronium, well then, bippidy-boppidy-boo, our pants are metaphorically on fire. ",1
2424,Sheldon,10," Well, sir, my trousers will not be igniting today. ",1
2425,Scene,10, Outside Penny‰Ûªs door. ,1
2426,Sheldon,10," (Knock, knock, knock, knock) Penny, (Knock, knock, knock, knock) Penny, (Knock, knock, knock, knock) Penny, (door opens) Good morning.",1
2427,Penny,10, Do you have any idea what time it is? ,1
2428,Sheldon,10," Of course I do. My watch is linked to the atomic clock in Boulder, Colorado. It‰Ûªs accurate to one tenth of a second. But as I‰Ûªm saying this it occurs to me that once again your question may have been rhetorical.",1
2429,Penny,10, What do you want?,1
2430,Sheldon,10, Remember how Leonard told you we couldn‰Ûªt come to your performance because we were attending a symposium on molecular positronium?,1
2431,Penny,10, I remember symposium.,1
2432,Sheldon,10," Yes, well, he lied.",1
2433,Penny,10," Wait, what?",1
2434,Sheldon,10," He lied, and I‰Ûªm feeling very uncomfortable about it.",1
2435,Penny,10, Well imagine how I‰Ûªm feeling. ,1
2436,Sheldon,10, Hungry? Tired? I‰Ûªm sorry this really isn‰Ûªt my strong suit. ,1
2437,Scene,10, The living room. ,1
2438,Leonard,10," You told her I lied, why would you tell her I lied?",1
2439,Sheldon,10, To help you. ,1
2440,Leonard,10," I‰Ûªm sorry, I‰Ûªm not seeing the help.",1
2441,Sheldon,10," She was going to see through your lie eventually, so I told her that you were lying to protect me. ",1
2442,Leonard,10," Oh, I‰Ûªm getting a bad feeling. ",1
2443,Sheldon,10," Hunger? Indigestion, I‰Ûªm sorry I‰Ûªm really not very good at this. Anyway, Penny now believes that on Friday night, we‰Ûªre going to participate in my cousin Leopold‰Ûªs drug intervention. ",1
2444,Leonard,10, Your cousin Leopold?,1
2445,Sheldon,10," Yea, who most people call Leo, but he also answers to Lee, remember that, it‰Ûªs important. ",1
2446,Leonard,10, What‰Ûªs important?,1
2447,Sheldon,10," Details, Leonard, the success or failure of our deceitful enterprise turns on details. ",1
2448,Leonard,10, Do you have a cousin Leopold.,1
2449,Sheldon,10," No, I made him up. I think you‰Ûªd call him Lee. ",1
2450,Leonard,10," I don‰Ûªt get it, I already told her a lie, why replace it with a different lie?",1
2451,Sheldon,10," Well, first of all, your lie was laughably transparent, where mine is exquisitely convoluted. While you were sleeping I was weaving an un-unravelable web. ",1
2452,Leonard,10, Un-unravelable?,1
2453,Sheldon,10," Yes, if she googles Leopold Houston she‰Ûªll find a facebook page, an online blog depicting his descent into drug use, and a desperate yet hopeful listing on e-harmony.com.",1
2454,Leonard,10," Okay, why would I go to a drug intervention for your cousing.",1
2455,Sheldon,10," Ah, because it‰Ûªs in Long Beach, and I don‰Ûªt drive. ",1
2456,Leonard,10, We‰Ûªre going to Long Beach?,1
2457,Sheldon,10," No, of course not, there‰Ûªs no cousin Leo, there‰Ûªs no intervention, focus Leonard.",1
2458,Leonard,10," Oh, come on!",1
2459,Sheldon,10," We just leave the house on Friday night, and we return in the wee hours emotionally wrung out from the work of convincing Leo to go back into rehab.",1
2460,Leonard,10, So he goes back into rehab?,1
2461,Sheldon,10," Yes, but, he can relapse if Penny ever invites us to go hear her sing again.",1
2462,Leonard,10, You still told her I lied.,1
2463,Sheldon,10," For a noble purpose, to spare me the social embarrassment of having a drug-addled first cousin, which I‰Ûªm assuming is embarrassing, yes?",1
2464,Leonard,10, I don‰Ûªt know. How am I supposed to remember all of this.,1
2465,Sheldon,10," That‰Ûªs the best part, you don‰Ûªt have to, see I told Penny that you would be embarrassed, if you knew that she found out that you had lied, so she‰Ûªs agreed to operate as if the original lie was still in force. ",1
2466,Leonard,10," So she‰Ûªs expecting me to lie about going to a symposium in Pasadena, when in actuality we‰Ûªre pretending to go to a drug intervention in Long Beach? ",1
2467,Sheldon,10, Un-unravelable. ,1
2468,Scene,10, The apartment.,1
2469,Leonard (opening door),10," Oh hey Penny, wow, look at you, all ready for your showcase, you look great.",1
2470,Penny,10, Thanks. I just wanted to come by and wish you guys luck with your symposium. ,1
2471,Leonard,10," Oh, well, thankyou.",1
2472,Penny,10," You know, I got to tell you, a lot of friends would let their friend go alone, but that‰Ûªs not who you are, you are the kind of guy who stands by a friend when‰Û_ when he has a symposium to go to. ",1
2473,Leonard,10, I don‰Ûªt know what to say. ,1
2474,Penny,10," It‰Ûªs okay, Leonard (hugs him.)",1
2475,Leonard,10," Oh, okay, alright, good. ",1
2476,Howard (arriving),10," Oh boy, group hug.",1
2477,Penny,10, Uh-huh!,1
2478,Howard,10, Uh-huh?,1
2479,Penny,10, Uh-huh!,1
2480,Howard,10, Okay. So what‰Ûªs up? ,1
2481,Sheldon,10," Well, uh, Penny is on her way to perform in a one night showcase production of Rent, which we are unable to attend because we are going to a symposium on molecular positronium, given by Dr Emile Farminfarmian.",1
2482,Howard,10," Wait a minute, Farminfarmian is speaking and you‰Ûªre Bogarding the symposium. ",1
2483,Leonard,10," Howard, I‰Ûªm sorry‰Û_ we‰Ûªre‰Û_ we‰Ûªre",1
2484,Howard,10," No, no, you‰Ûªre quark-blocking us. ",1
2485,Leonard,10, I don‰Ûªt know what to say.,1
2486,Howard,10, Wow.,1
2487,Leonard,10," Howard, listen‰Û_",1
2488,Howard,10," No, it‰Ûªs okay, it‰Ûªs your Millenium Falcon, you and Chewbacca do whatever you want to do. Me and Princess Leia here will find some other way to spend the evening. ",1
2489,Penny,10," Howard, wait. Sheldon, I think we should tell them.",1
2490,Sheldon,10," Okay, sure. I don‰Ûªt see a problem with that. ",1
2491,Penny,10," There‰Ûªs no symposium, Leonard lied to me, isn‰Ûªt that right Leonard. ",1
2492,Leonard,10, Well‰Û_ I don‰Ûªt know what to say. ,1
2493,Penny,10," It‰Ûªs okay, I do, look, Leonard is helping Sheldon through a family crisis, he made up the whole story about the symposium with Dr Farmin..farm‰Û_ian",1
2494,Sheldon,10, Good for you. ,1
2495,Penny,10," Hah, yeah! Because he didn‰Ûªt want Sheldon to be embarrassed, and there is nothing to be embarrassed okay, every family in America has a relative holed up in a garage somewhere huffing paint thinner.",1
2496,Howard (after Raj whispers in his ear),10," No, I‰Ûªm lost too, I think she skipped a step. ",1
2497,Penny,10," No, look, Sheldon‰Ûªs cousin Leo escaped rehab, and he‰Ûªs in a Motel 8 at Long Beach, the whole family‰Ûªs going out for an intervention. Leonard is driving Sheldon down there to help him through this because he‰Ûªs such a good man.",1
2498,Leonard,10," Oh, another hug, thank you.",1
2499,Penny,10," Alright you guys, good luck.",1
2500,Leonard,10, Thanks Penny. ,1
2501,Howard,10," Yeah, uh, break a leg.",1
2502,Sheldon,10, Break a leg. (She leaves),1
2503,Howard,10," So, road trip to Long Beach.",1
2504,Leonard,10," No, we‰Ûªre not going to Long Beach.",1
2505,Raj,10, Why not? ,1
2506,Leonard,10, Because Sheldon doesn‰Ûªt have a drug addicted cousin Leopold. ,1
2507,Raj,10," Oh, too bad. I‰Ûªve always wanted to go to Long Beach. ",1
2508,Sheldon,10," It‰Ûªs a very nice community. The Queen Mary is docked there, once the largest ocean liner in the world, it‰Ûªs now a hotel and restaurant where they host a surprisingly gripping murder mystery dinner. ",1
2509,Raj,10, Sounds fun.,1
2510,Howard,10, I‰Ûªm game.,1
2511,Raj,10, Shotgun.,1
2512,Sheldon,10," No, no, no, Leonard gets nauseous unless he sits in front, and even then it‰Ûªs iffy.",1
2513,Leonard,10," Wait, are we really going to Long Beach? ",1
2514,Scene,10, Leonard‰Ûªs bedroom. The bedside table is piled with Queen Mary memorabilia.,1
2515,åÊSheldon,10," (Knock, knock, knock, knock) Leonard, (Knock, knock, knock, knock) Leonard, (Knock, knock, knock, knock) Leonard‰Û_",1
2516,Leonard,10," Let it go, Sheldon, the murderer was the first mate whether it makes sense to you or not. ",1
2517,Sheldon,10," No, that‰Ûªs the least of our worries. I‰Ûªve been doing some research on addiction, both the biochemical and behavioural aspects, and I think there‰Ûªs a problem with the current version of our lie. ",1
2518,Leonard,10," What are you talking about, it‰Ûªs fine, she bought it, it‰Ûªs over. ",1
2519,Sheldon,10," Sadly, it‰Ûªs not. Substance abuse is a lifelong struggle, but beyond that I have realised that the Leo I described would not have agreed to go to rehab.",1
2520,Leonard,10, Why not? ,1
2521,Sheldon,10, Because Leo is a middle child. ,1
2522,Leonard,10," There is no Leo, how can you say that? ",1
2523,Sheldon,10," You didn‰Ûªt read the bio, did you? He‰Ûªs not just a middle child, he‰Ûªs the quintessential middle child, from a broken home to boot. Psychologically speaking, the attention he gets by rebelling even to the point of self-destruction is more emotionally valuable than the help he would get at rehab.",1
2524,Leonard,10, I‰Ûªve got a solution.,1
2525,Sheldon,10," Great, what is it?",1
2526,Leonard,10, Get out.,1
2527,Sheldon,10," Fine. (He leaves. A moment later he comes back.) I‰Ûªve hesitated to point this out, but I must now remind you that we are in our current predicament because of your initial and totally inadequate deceit. I‰Ûªm just trying to clean up after your mess. (Leonard throws a glass ornament at him. He just manages to shut the door in time.) We‰Ûªll talk in the morning.",1
2528,Scene,10, The living room. Leonard enters in his dressing gown. There is a strange man eating cereal at the kitchen table. ,1
2529,Strange man,10, Morning. ,1
2530,Leonard,10, Who are you? ,1
2531,Man,10, I am Sheldon‰Ûªs cousin Leo.,1
2532,Leonard,10," Oh, God! Sheldon does not have a cousin Leo.",1
2533,Man,10," Au contraire. I‰Ûªm 26 years old, I‰Ûªm originally from (reads off crib notes) Denton, Texas, but I was a Navy brat so I was brought up on a variety of military bases around the world, as a result I‰Ûªve often felt like an outsider, never really fitting in, which is probably the reason for my substance abuse problem.",1
2534,Sheldon,10," Excuse me, we just went over this. As the quintessential middle child, your addiction is rooted in your unmet need for attention.",1
2535,Man,10," Oh, Sheldon, are we really going to go with pop psychology.",1
2536,Sheldon,10," For your information, this is all based on solid research, stick with the character profile I wrote for you. ",1
2537,Leonard,10, Sheldon?,1
2538,Sheldon,10," I‰Ûªm sorry, Leonard, this is Toby Loobenfeld, he‰Ûªs a research assistant in the particle physics lab, but he also minored in theatre at MIT.",1
2539,Toby,10, It was more of a double major actually. Theatre and physics. You can guess which one my bourgeois parents pushed me towards. ,1
2540,Leonard,10," Yeah, I got it, Sheldon, why?",1
2541,Sheldon,10," Well, you see, while Leo would not have gone into rehab, it is completely plausible that we would have talked him into leaving the motel, and coming home with us.",1
2542,Leonard,10, Oh‰Û_!,1
2543,Toby,10," Sheldon, how about this as my motivation. When I was fourteen years old I was abused in the Philippines by a club footed Navy chaplain.",1
2544,Sheldon,10," No. We‰Ûªre going with middle child, and a generic predisposition to inadequate serotonin production.",1
2545,Toby,10," Swell, how do I play genetic predisposition?",1
2546,Sheldon,10," Subtextually, of course. (There is a knock on the door.) Just have fun with it. (Opening door.) Morning Penny.",1
2547,Penny,10, Hi. How did the intervention go.,1
2548,Sheldon,10," Unfortunately, we weren‰Ûªt able to convince him to go to rehab. ",1
2549,Penny,10," Well, based on what you told me, I‰Ûªm not surprised. ",1
2550,Sheldon,10," But we did convince him to leave the motel. Come say hello. Leo, this is Penny, our friend and neighbour.",1
2551,Penny,10," Hi Leo, how are you feeling?",1
2552,Toby,10," Let me ask you something, Penny. Have you ever woken up in a fleabag motel, covered in your own vomit, next to a transsexual prostitute? ",1
2553,Penny,10, No.,1
2554,Toby,10, Then don‰Ûªt ask me how I‰Ûªm feeling. ,1
2555,Leonard,10," Well, that‰Ûªs Leo. Hey, um, why don‰Ûªt you tell me about your showcase last night?",1
2556,Penny,10," Oh, it was okay I guess, wasn‰Ûªt a big turn out but they both really seemed to like it. ",1
2557,Leonard,10, There were only two people there?,1
2558,Penny,10, By the end. Yeah. ,1
2559,Toby,10," Damn you, Chaplain Horrigan! ",1
2560,Penny,10, I‰Ûªm‰Û_ I‰Ûªm sorry.,1
2561,Toby,10," The Philippines. 1992. The Subic Bay Naval Station. A young boy on the cusp of manhood. His only companions mongrel dogs and malarial mosquitos. Desperate and alone he reached out to a man who promised to introduce him to a merciful, loving God, but who instead introduced him to a gin pickled tongue shoved down his adolescent throat. What choice did he have but to drink, shoot and snort his pain away.",1
2562,Sheldon,10, Don‰Ûªt forget his genetic predisposition towards addiction.,1
2563,Toby,10, That‰Ûªs never been proven.,1
2564,Sheldon,10, There have been studies.,1
2565,Toby,10, Not double blind studies.,1
2566,Sheldon,10," How could there be a double blind study, who would be the control group. ",1
2567,Leonard,10," As you can see, detoxing can get pretty ugly, let‰Ûªs give them some privacy.",1
2568,Penny,10," Yeah. Hey, do you want to come over to my place, have coffee?",1
2569,Leonard,10, Sounds good.,1
2570,Penny,10," I have a video of me singing last night, do you want to see it? ",1
2571,Leonard,10," Gee, why wouldn‰Ûªt I?",1
2572,Penny,10," This is even better than you coming to the showcase, because now I get to watch you watch me.",1
2573,Leonard,10, Yeah! Funny how things work out. ,1
2574,Toby,10, And that he loved the companionship and the wisdom that his own father failed to provide. ,1
2575,Sheldon,10, Your parents made the right decision. ,1
2576,Toby,10, I cannot work like this! ,1
2577,Scene,10, The apartment. Penny is on the sofa with Toby. They are watching TV.,1
2578,Toby,10," This is amazing. Just sitting on a couch, watching TV with a woman. Not being drunk, or high, or‰Û_ or‰Û_ wondering if you‰Ûªre a dude down there.",1
2579,Penny,10," Leo, you are a very sweet, really funny guy. You‰Ûªre gonna do okay. ",1
2580,Toby,10," One day at a time, Penny, one day at a time. ",1
2581,Leonard,10, How long is he going to stay here.,1
2582,Sheldon,10," He‰Ûªs a homeless drug addict, Leonard, where is he going to go? Boy, you have a lot to learn about lying.",1
2583,Scene,11," The living room of the apartment. Leonard and Sheldon are playing the three dimensional chess game from the original Star Trek series. It is Leonard‰Ûªs move. He takes his time, moving round the board and checking things from various angles. Finally he tentatively makes a move. Sheldon moves almost immediately.",1
2584,Sheldon,11, Checkmate.,1
2585,Leonard,11, O-o-o-o-h! Again?,1
2586,Sheldon,11," Obviously you‰Ûªre not well suited for three-dimensional chess, perhaps three dimensional candyland would be more your speed. ",1
2587,Leonard,11, Just reset the board.,1
2588,Sheldon,11, It must be humbling to suck on so many different levels. ,1
2589,Penny (knocking and entering),11, Hi guys.,1
2590,Leonard,11, Hey! ,1
2591,Penny,11, Did you get my mail.,1
2592,Leonard,11," Yeah, right here. How was Nebraska?",1
2593,Penny,11," Oh, better than North Dakota! (Pause) I guess that joke‰Ûªs only funny in Nebraska.",1
2594,Sheldon,11, From the data at hand you really can‰Ûªt draw that conclusion. All you can say with absolute certainty is that that joke is not funny here. ,1
2595,Penny,11," Boy, it‰Ûªs good to be back. ",1
2596,Leonard,11, How was your family?,1
2597,Penny,11," Ugh, it was the worst trip, everyone got sick over the weekend.",1
2598,Sheldon,11, Sick? ,1
2599,Leonard,11, Here we go. ,1
2600,Sheldon (running to opposite side of the room),11, What kind of sick?,1
2601,Penny,11," Oh, the flu I guess.",1
2602,Sheldon,11," I don‰Ûªt need you to guess, I need you to know, now when did the symptoms first appear?",1
2603,Penny,11, Maybe Friday.,1
2604,Sheldon,11," Friday, was that morning or afternoon? ",1
2605,Penny,11, I‰Û_ I don‰Ûªt‰Û_,1
2606,Sheldon,11," Think woman, who blew their nose and when? ",1
2607,Leonard,11," Sheldon, relax, she doesn‰Ûªt have any symptoms, I‰Ûªm sure she‰Ûªs not contagious.",1
2608,Sheldon,11," Oh please, if influenza was only contagious after symptoms appear it would have died out thousands of years ago. Somewhere between tool using and cave painting, homo habilus would have figured out to kill the guy with the runny nose. ",1
2609,Leonard,11," Penny, you‰Ûªll have to excuse Sheldon, he‰Ûªs a bit of a germophobe. ",1
2610,Penny,11," Oh, it‰Ûªs okay, I understand.",1
2611,Sheldon,11," Thanks for your consideration, now please leave.",1
2612,Leonard,11, You‰Ûªd better go before he starts spraying you with Lysol. ,1
2613,Penny,11," Okay, well, thank you for getting my mail.",1
2614,Leonard,11, No problem. Welcome home. (Sees Penny out. Turns to find Sheldon spraying the air with Lysol.),1
2615,Sheldon,11, What?,1
2616,Scene,11, The kitchen,1
2617,Leonard,11, What the hell are you doing?,1
2618,Sheldon,11, I‰Ûªm making petrie dishes to grow throat cultures. ,1
2619,Leonard,11, With lime jello?,1
2620,Sheldon,11," I need a growth medium, and someone polished off the apricot yoghurt. Here, swab my throat.",1
2621,Leonard,11, I don‰Ûªt think so.,1
2622,Sheldon,11, Leonard! If I‰Ûªm going to get ahead of this thing I need to find out what‰Ûªs growing in my throat. ,1
2623,Leonard,11," Sheldon, you are not sick. This is, but you are not. ",1
2624,Sheldon,11, We have no idea what pathogen Typhoid Penny has introduced into our environment. And having never been to Nebraska I‰Ûªm fairly certain that I have no cornhusking antibodies. ,1
2625,Leonard,11," Sheldon, don‰Ûªt you think you‰Ûªre overreacting? ",1
2626,Sheldon,11," When I‰Ûªm lying comatose in a hospital relying on inferior minds to cure me, these jello cultures and my accompanying notes will give them a fighting chance. ",1
2627,Leonard,11, I‰Ûªm going back to bed. ,1
2628,Sheldon,11, Wait. (Handing him a measuring jug) Put this in the bathroom.,1
2629,Leonard,11, What for? ,1
2630,Sheldon,11, I need to measure my fluid intake and output to make sure my kidneys aren‰Ûªt shutting down.,1
2631,Leonard,11, I mix pancake batter in this! ,1
2632,Sheldon,11," No, that measuring cup has always been for urine.",1
2633,Leonard,11," You had time to make a label for everything in this apartment, including the label maker, but you didn‰Ûªt have ten seconds to make one that said urine cup? ",1
2634,Sheldon,11, It‰Ûªs right here on the bottom. ,1
2635,Leonard,11, Huh. I guess I owe the Betty Crocker company a letter of apology. ,1
2636,Scene,11, Sheldon‰Ûªs bedroom. Sheldon wakes up and coughs. Picks up an electronic thermometer and takes his temperature.,1
2637,Sheldon,11," Oh, dear God. (Shouting) Leonard! Leonard, I‰Ûªm sick!",1
2638,Sheldon (voice off),11, Leonard! Leonard I‰Ûªm sick!,1
2639,"Sheldon (entering, wrapped in duvet)",11," Leonard! Leonard! Leonard. Leonard, my comforter fell down, and my sinuses hurt when I bend over. Leonard? (Bends to get phone) Ow! ",1
2640,Leonard (voice on phone),11, Hey.,1
2641,Sheldon,11," Leonard, where are you? ",1
2642,Leonard (running down stairs),11, I‰Ûªm at work. ,1
2643,Sheldon,11, At six-thirty in the morning? ,1
2644,Leonard,11, Yes.,1
2645,Sheldon,11, On Sunday? ,1
2646,Leonard,11, Yes.,1
2647,Sheldon,11, Why? ,1
2648,Leonard,11, They asked me to come in.,1
2649,Sheldon,11," Well, I didn‰Ûªt hear the phone ring.",1
2650,Leonard,11, They texted me. ,1
2651,Sheldon,11," Well, as I predicted, I am sick. My fever has been tracking up exponentially since 2am, and I am producing sputum at an alarming rate. ",1
2652,Leonard,11, No kidding?,1
2653,Sheldon,11," No. Not only that, it has shifted from clear to milky green. ",1
2654,Leonard,11," Alright, well, get some rest and drink plenty of fluids. ",1
2655,Sheldon,11, What else would I drink? Gasses? Solids? Ionised plasma?,1
2656,Leonard,11, Drink whatever you want.,1
2657,Sheldon,11, I want soup.,1
2658,Leonard,11, Then make soup. ,1
2659,Sheldon,11, We don‰Ûªt have soup. ,1
2660,Leonard,11," I‰Ûªm at work, Sheldon. (A woman enters the apartment building with a barking dog.) ",1
2661,Sheldon,11, Is that a dog?,1
2662,Leonard,11," Yes, ",1
2663,Sheldon,11, In the lab?,1
2664,Leonard,11," Yes, they‰Ûªre training dogs to operate the centrifuge for when they need dogs to operate the centrifuge for blind scientists, I have to go. ",1
2665,Scene,11, Howard‰Ûªs bedroom. The phone is ringing.,1
2666,Howard‰Ûªs Mother (voice),11," Howard, it‰Ûªs the phone.",1
2667,Howard,11," I know it‰Ûªs the phone, Ma, I hear the phone.",1
2668,Howard‰Ûªs Mother,11, Well who‰Ûªs calling at this ungodly hour? ,1
2669,Howard,11, I don‰Ûªt know.,1
2670,Howard‰Ûªs Mother,11, Well ask them why they‰Ûªre calling at this ungodly hour. ,1
2671,Howard,11, How can I ask them when I‰Ûªm talking to you! (Into phone) Hello.,1
2672,Leonard,11," Howard, it‰Ûªs Leonard, code Milky Green. ",1
2673,Howard,11," Dear Lord, not Milky Green! ",1
2674,Leonard,11," Affirmative, with fever.",1
2675,Howard‰Ûªs Mother,11, Who‰Ûªs on the phone.,1
2676,Howard,11, It‰Ûªs Leonard.,1
2677,Howard‰Ûªs Mother,11, Why is he calling.,1
2678,Howard,11, Sheldon‰Ûªs sick.,1
2679,Howard‰Ûªs Mother,11, Were you playing with him? ,1
2680,Howard,11," For God‰Ûªs sake, Ma, I‰Ûªm twenty six years old.",1
2681,Howard‰Ûªs Mother,11, Excuse me Mr Grown-up. Whadda-ya want for breakfast.,1
2682,Howard,11, Chocolate milk and eggoes please! ,1
2683,Leonard,11," Howard, listen to me.",1
2684,Howard,11," Hang on, call waiting.",1
2685,Leonard (voice),11," No, don‰Ûªt, don‰Ûªt‰Û_.",1
2686,Howard,11, Hello.,1
2687,Sheldon,11," Howard, I‰Ûªm sick. ",1
2688,Howard (imitating his mother‰Ûªs voice),11," Howard‰Ûªs sleeping, this is his mother. Why are you calling at this ungodly hour? ",1
2689,Sheldon,11, I need soup.,1
2690,Howard,11, Then call your own mother. (To Leonard) It was Sheldon.,1
2691,Leonard,11, I tried to stop you. ,1
2692,Howard,11," It‰Ûªs my own fault, I forgot the protocol we put in place after the great ear infection of ‰Ûª06. ",1
2693,Leonard,11," You call Koothrappali, we need to find a place to lay low for the next eighteen to twenty four hours. ",1
2694,Howard,11," Stand by. Ma, can my friends come over?",1
2695,Howard‰Ûªs Mother,11, I just had the carpets steamed. ,1
2696,Howard,11, That‰Ûªs a negatory. But there‰Ûªs a Planet of the Apes marathon at the New Art today. ,1
2697,Leonard,11," Five movies, two hours apiece. It‰Ûªs a start. ",1
2698,Scene,11, The Cheesecake Factory.,1
2699,Waitress,11, Homeless crazy guy at table eighteen. ,1
2700,Penny,11," No, just crazy. Sheldon, what are you doing here?",1
2701,Sheldon,11," I‰Ûªm sick, thank you very much. ",1
2702,Penny,11," How could you have gotten it from me, I‰Ûªm not sick.",1
2703,Sheldon,11, You‰Ûªre a carrier. All these people here are doomed. You‰Ûªre doomed! ,1
2704,Penny,11," Shhh! Sheldon, what do you want.",1
2705,Sheldon,11, I want soup.,1
2706,Penny (over Sheldon‰Ûªs strange throat clearance),11, Why didn‰Ûªt you just‰Û_. (louder throat clearance) Why didn‰Ûªt you just have soup at home. ,1
2707,Sheldon,11," Penny, I have an IQ of 187, don‰Ûªt you imagine that if there were a way for me to have had soup at home I would have thought of it?",1
2708,Penny,11, You can have soup delivered.,1
2709,Sheldon,11," I did not think of that. Clearly febrile delirium is setting in, please bring me some soup while I still understand what a spoon is for. ",1
2710,Penny,11," Okay, what kind of soup do you want.",1
2711,Sheldon,11," Well, my mother used to make me this split pea with little frankfurter slices and these home made croutons.",1
2712,Penny,11, We have Chicken Tortilla and Potato Leek. ,1
2713,Sheldon,11, Can I get any of those with little frankfurter slices and home made croutons?,1
2714,Penny,11, No.,1
2715,Sheldon,11, Then surprise me. (Blows nose into handkerchief. Shows it to next table) Would you call that moss green or forest green? ,1
2716,Scene,11, The cinema. Everyone is wearing ape masks. ,1
2717,Howard,11," Look at this, everyone went chimp. ",1
2718,Raj,11," Well I‰Ûªd like to point out, I voted for orang-utan, but you shouted me down. (Phone rings).",1
2719,Leonard,11," Oh, hi Penny!",1
2720,Penny,11," Hey, where are you? ",1
2721,Leonard,11, I‰Ûªm‰Û_ uh‰Û_ at work.,1
2722,Penny,11, You sound funny.,1
2723,Leonard,11, I‰Ûªm‰Û_ uh‰Û_ in a‰Û_ I‰Ûªm in a radiation suit. What‰Ûªs up?,1
2724,Penny,11," Yeah, well I‰Ûªm at work too, and you‰Ûªll never guess who‰Ûªs here infecting my entire station. ",1
2725,Leonard (To Howard and Raj),11, Sheldon‰Ûªs at the Cheesecake Factory. (Into phone) Just tell him to go home. ,1
2726,Penny,11," He won‰Ûªt leave, he says he‰Ûªs afraid he‰Ûªll pass out on the bus and someone will harvest his organs.",1
2727, Leonard (To Howard and Raj),11," He‰Ûªs paranoid, and he‰Ûªs established a nest. ",1
2728,Penny,11, Can you please come get him? ,1
2729,Leonard,11," Uh, yeah, I‰Ûªd be‰Û_ I‰Ûªd be happy to Penny. (Holds phone up, Howard makes warning siren noises) Oh my God there‰Ûªs a breech in the radiation unit (Raj joins in) The whole city is in jeopardy, oh my God, Professor Googenfeil is melting, gotta go, bye! (To Howard and Raj) I feel really guilty. ",1
2730,Raj,11, You did what you had to do. (Steals some of Howard‰Ûªs popcorn),1
2731,Howard,11, Take your stinking paws off my popcorn you damn dirty ape. ,1
2732,Scene,11, The stairwell.,1
2733,Sheldon,11, Thanks for bringing me home. ,1
2734,Penny,11," Oh, it‰Ûªs okay, I didn‰Ûªt really need to work today, it‰Ûªs not like I have rent or car payments or anything.",1
2735,Sheldon,11, Good. Good.,1
2736,Penny,11," Okay, well, you feel better.",1
2737,Sheldon,11," Wait, where are you going? ",1
2738,Penny,11," Um, home, to write some bad cheques.",1
2739,Sheldon,11, You‰Ûªre going to leave me? ,1
2740,Penny,11," Sheldon, you are a grown man, haven‰Ûªt you ever been sick before? ",1
2741,Sheldon,11," Well, of course, but, not by myself. ",1
2742,Penny,11," Really, never?",1
2743,Sheldon,11," Well, once. When I was fifteen, and spending the summer at the Heidelberg Institute in Germany.",1
2744,Penny,11, Studying abroad?,1
2745,Sheldon,11," No, visiting professor. Anyway, the local cuisine was a little more sausage-based than I‰Ûªm used to, and the result was an internal blitzkrieg with my lower intestine playing the part of Czechoslovakia. ",1
2746,Penny,11, And there was no-one there to take care of you?,1
2747,Sheldon,11," No. No, my mum had to fly back to Texas to help my dad because the house had slipped off the cinderblocks again. ",1
2748,Penny,11, Again?,1
2749,Sheldon,11," It was tornado season. And it was an aluminium house. Anyway, the housekeeper in the faculty residence didn‰Ûªt speak any English, when I finally managed to convince her I was sick, she said ‰ÛÏMÌ¦chtest Du eine DarmspÌ_lung?‰Û",1
2750,Penny,11, What does that mean?,1
2751,Sheldon,11," Based on what happened next, I assume it means ‰ÛÏwould you like an enema?‰Û",1
2752,Penny,11," Okay, sweetie, I‰Ûªll take care of you, what do you need?",1
2753,Sheldon,11," Well, my mom used to give me sponge baths. ",1
2754,Penny,11," Okay, ground rules, no sponge baths, and definitely no enemas. ",1
2755,Sheldon,11, Agreed. ,1
2756,Scene,11, The cinema. ,1
2757,Raj,11," Here we go, ten and a half hours of apey goodness. ",1
2758,Leonard,11," Oh dammit, my glasses. Okay, I‰Ûªm blind here guys, can you help me find them?",1
2759,Howard,11, Sorry. (Crunching sound) Found ‰Û÷em. ,1
2760,Leonard,11, Oh great.,1
2761,Howard,11," Sorry, don‰Ûªt you have a spare.",1
2762,Leonard,11," Yeah, at home. ",1
2763,Raj,11," Well if you leave now, you can be back before the gorillas rip the crap out of Charlton Heston. ",1
2764,Howard,11," Unless Sheldon‰Ûªs there, in which case you‰Ûªll be trapped forever in his whiny hyper neurotic snot-web. ",1
2765,Leonard (Dials phone),11," Hi, Penny. I was wondering, is Sheldon still at the restaurant? Okay, that was very nice of you. Okay, gotta go, got kind of a full blown Chernobyl thing here, gotta go, bye. (To Howard) He‰Ûªs home, I‰Ûªm screwed. Ten and a half hours of apey blurriness. ",1
2766,Raj,11, How about Lasic? ,1
2767,Leonard,11, You want me to get eye surgery? ,1
2768,Raj,11," Would you rather go back to the apartment and deal with Sheldon, or have a stranger carve out your corneas with a laser beam?",1
2769,Howard,11, Well?,1
2770,Leonard,11, I‰Ûªm thinking! ,1
2771,Scene,11, Sheldon‰Ûªs bedroom.,1
2772,Penny,11," Okay, nice and cosy, okay, I‰Ûªll see you later.",1
2773,Sheldon,11, Wait. Will you please rub this on my chest. ,1
2774,Penny,11," Oh, Sheldon, can‰Ûªt you do that yourself?",1
2775,Sheldon,11, Vaporub makes my hands smell funny. ,1
2776,Penny,11, But Sheldon‰Û_.,1
2777,Sheldon,11," Please, please, please, please, please, please, please.",1
2778,Penny,11, I can‰Ûªt believe I‰Ûªm doing this. ,1
2779,Sheldon,11," No, no, counter-clockwise or my chest hair mats. ",1
2780,Penny,11, Sorry. ,1
2781,Sheldon,11, Can you sing ‰ÛÏSoft Kitty‰Û. ,1
2782,Penny,11, What?,1
2783,Sheldon,11, My mom used to sing it to me when I was sick.,1
2784,Penny,11," I‰Ûªm sorry, honey, I don‰Ûªt know it.",1
2785,Sheldon,11," I‰Ûªll teach you. ‰ÛÏSoft kitty, warm kitty, little ball of fur, happy kitty, sleepy kitty, purr purr purr.‰Û Now you. ",1
2786,Penny (after a loud sigh),11," Soft kitty, warm kitty‰Û_",1
2787,Sheldon,11, Little ball of fur. Keep rubbing. ,1
2788,Penny (through gritted teeth),11, Little ball of fur. ,1
2789,Scene,11," The living room door, a fibre-optic camera emerges from underneath. We see the scene from its point of view. Cut to outside. Raj is holding a laptop, Howard is feeding the camera under the door. ",1
2790,Leonard,11," What do you see, what do you see.",1
2791,Raj,11, The living room appears to be empty. ,1
2792,Leonard,11," Okay, he must be in his bedroom. My spare glasses are in my bedroom, on my dresser, next to my Bat-signal. ",1
2793,Howard,11, I‰Ûªm not going in there.,1
2794,Leonard,11, Raj?,1
2795,Raj,11," No way, Jose. ",1
2796,Leonard,11," Well I can‰Ûªt do it, I can‰Ûªt see anything. ",1
2797,Howard,11," It‰Ûªs all right, wireless mini-cam and Bluetooth headset. We‰Ûªll be your eyes. ",1
2798,Leonard,11, Fine.,1
2799,Howard,11," One more thing. This is a subsonic impact sensor. If Sheldon gets out of bed and starts to walk, this device will register it and send a signal to the laptop. At that point, based on the geography of the apartment and the ambulatory speed of a sick Sheldon, you‰Ûªll have seven seconds to get out, glasses or no glasses.",1
2800,Leonard,11, Won‰Ûªt my footsteps set it off? ,1
2801,Howard,11," No, you‰Ûªll be on your hands and knees. Now you‰Ûªll need to get the sensor as close as you can to Sheldon‰Ûªs room. ",1
2802,Leonard,11," Well, how do I carry it if I‰Ûªm on my hands and knees?",1
2803,Howard,11, Stay low. Bear left. Now keep true.,1
2804,Leonard,11, What? ,1
2805,Howard,11, It means go straight.,1
2806,Leonard,11, Then just say go straight. ,1
2807,Howard,11," You don‰Ûªt stay go straight when you‰Ûªre giving bearings, you say keep true. ",1
2808,Leonard,11, Alright (Bangs head on a trunk.) I just hit my head. ,1
2809,Howard,11," Because you didn‰Ûªt keep true. (Time shift, Leonard is now outside bedrooms) Okay, turn right. ",1
2810,Raj,11, The‰Û_ the picture‰Ûªs breaking up. ,1
2811,Howard,11," Angle your head to the right. A little more. A little more. (Leonard now has his head at right angles to his body) That‰Ûªs it, now just keep true. Alright, you‰Ûªre close enough to Sheldon‰Ûªs room, deploy the sensor. Now turn it on.",1
2812,Leonard,11, It wasn‰Ûªt on? ,1
2813,Howard,11, No.,1
2814,Leonard,11, Then why did I have to crawl? ,1
2815,Howard,11," Oh, I guess you didn‰Ûªt. ",1
2816,Leonard,11," Okay, it‰Ûªs on.",1
2817,Howard,11, Good. From this point forward you will have to crawl. ,1
2818,Leonard,11, I know. ,1
2819,Howard,11," Hang on, the sensor‰Ûªs picking up something, turn your head back. (Camera angle shows a pair of female legs.) ",1
2820,Penny,11, You rat bastard. ,1
2821,Howard (running down stairs with Raj),11, Told you the sensor would work. ,1
2822,Leonard,11, Hi!,1
2823,Penny,11, You deliberately stuck me with Sheldon. ,1
2824,Leonard,11," Well, I had to, you see what he‰Ûªs like. ",1
2825,Sheldon (off),11," Penny! Penny, I‰Ûªm hungry. ",1
2826,Penny,11," Uh, it‰Ûªs okay, sweetie, good news, Leonard‰Ûªs home!",1
2827,Leonard,11, No! ,1
2828,Penny (handing him vaporub),11," Here you go, good luck, bye.",1
2829,Leonard,11, W-wait! ,1
2830,Sheldon,11," Leonard, I‰Ûªm hungry!",1
2831,Leonard,11, Wait! Penny! Take me with you! (Runs after her and bumps into pillar. Falls semi-conscious to the floor. åÊSheldon appears in his comforter.) ,1
2832,Sheldon,11, I want grilled cheese. ,1
2833,Sheldon,11, Do you think Penny will come here and take care of us? ,1
2834,Leonard,11, I don‰Ûªt think Penny‰Ûªs ever coming here again. ,1
2835,Sheldon,11, I‰Ûªm very congested. ,1
2836,Leonard,11," Yeah, so?",1
2837,Sheldon,11," Can you go to the kitchen, and get me the turkey baster labelled mucus.",1
2838,Leonard,11," If I stand, I‰Ûªll vomit. ",1
2839,Sheldon,11," Under the sink, yellow Tupperware bowl. ",1
2840,Scene,12, The University cafeteria. ,1
2841,Sheldon,12, Here‰Ûªs the problem with teleportation.,1
2842,Leonard,12, Lay it on me. ,1
2843,Sheldon,12," Assuming the device could be invented which would identify the quantum state of matter of an individual in one location, and transmit that pattern to a distant location for reassembly, you would not have actually transported the individual. You would have destroyed him in one location, and recreated him in another.",1
2844,Leonard,12, How about that. ,1
2845,Sheldon,12," Personally, I would never use a transporter. Because the original Sheldon would have to be disintegrated in order to create a new Sheldon.",1
2846,Leonard,12, Would the new Sheldon be in any way an improvement on the old Sheldon? ,1
2847,Sheldon,12," No, he would be exactly the same. ",1
2848,Leonard,12, That is a problem. ,1
2849,Sheldon,12," So, you see it too.",1
2850,Dr Gablehouser (arriving),12," Dr Hofstadter, Dr Cooper. ",1
2851,Together,12, Dr Gablehouser.,1
2852,Gablehouser,12," Gentlemen, I‰Ûªd like you to meet Dennis Kim. Dennis is a highly sought after Doctorial candidate and we‰Ûªre hoping to have him do his graduate work here. ",1
2853,Leonard,12," Graduate work, very impressive.",1
2854,Gablehouser,12, And he‰Ûªs only fifteen years old.,1
2855,Sheldon,12," Not bad, I myself started graduate school at fourteen.",1
2856,Dennis,12," Well, I lost a year while my family was tunnelling out of North Korea. ",1
2857,Leonard,12, Advantage Kim. ,1
2858,Gablehouser,12," I thought maybe you boys could show Dennis around, let him see why we‰Ûªre the best physics research facility in the country.",1
2859,Dennis,12," I already know you‰Ûªre not. You don‰Ûªt have an open science grid computer, or a free electron laser, and the string theory research being done here is nothing but a dead end. ",1
2860,Sheldon,12," Excuse me, that is my research, and it is by no means a dead end.",1
2861,Dennis,12," Well, obviously you don‰Ûªt see it yet, but trust me, you will.",1
2862,Gablehouser,12," Dennis, we discussed this, we‰Ûªre in the process of updating our equipment, and we welcome your input on our research goals, and we‰Ûªve agreed to look the other way if you want to use up to 20% of the grant money you attract to smuggle your grandfather out of Pyongyang. We want him here boys, make it happen.",1
2863,Leonard,12, Yes sir. ,1
2864,Sheldon,12," You can count on us, we‰Ûªre on it. What the hell do you mean, dead end. ",1
2865,Dennis,12," I mean, the whole landscape of false vacuums in string theory could be as large as ten to the five-hundredth power. In addition‰Û_ ooh, look, chocolate milk. ",1
2866,Sheldon,12, I sense a disturbance in the force. ,1
2867,Leonard (in a Yoda voice),12," A bad feeling I have about this, mmm-hmmm. ",1
2868,Scene,12, A corridor.,1
2869,Leonard,12," So, Dennis, how long have you been in America.",1
2870,Dennis,12, A year and a half.,1
2871,Leonard,12," No kidding, you speak English really well.",1
2872,Dennis,12, So do you. Except for your tendency to end sentences with prepositions. ,1
2873,Leonard,12, What are you talking about? ,1
2874,Dennis,12, That. ,1
2875,Sheldon,12," He‰Ûªs not wrong. Alright, and this is my office.",1
2876,Dennis,12, Is this part of the tour? ,1
2877,Sheldon,12, Nope. Goodbye. ,1
2878,Leonard,12," Come on, Sheldon, we‰Ûªve hardly shown him anything.",1
2879,Sheldon,12," Oh, alright, this is my desk, these are my books, this is my door, please close it behind you. Goodbye. ",1
2880,Dennis,12, Looks like you‰Ûªre doing work in quantum loop corrections.,1
2881,Sheldon,12," Keen observation, goodbye. ",1
2882,Dennis,12," You see where you went wrong, don‰Ûªt you? ",1
2883,Sheldon,12, Leonard.,1
2884,Leonard,12," Huh, yeah? ",1
2885,Sheldon,12, Get him out. ,1
2886,Leonard,12," Come on, Dennis, I‰Ûªll show you the rec centre, they‰Ûªve got nautilus equipment.",1
2887,Dennis,12, Do I look like I lift weights. ,1
2888,Leonard,12, Not heavy ones. ,1
2889,Dennis,12, It‰Ûªs startling to me you haven‰Ûªt considered a Lorentz invariant field theory approach.,1
2890,Sheldon,12, You think I haven‰Ûªt considered it? You really think I haven‰Ûªt considered it? ,1
2891,Dennis,12, Have you considered it?,1
2892,Sheldon,12, Get him out Leonard.,1
2893,Leonard,12," Come on, Dennis, I‰Ûªll show you the radiation lab.",1
2894,Dennis,12," Wow, you won the Stephenson award.",1
2895,Sheldon,12," Yes, in fact I am the youngest person ever to win it. ",1
2896,Dennis,12," Really, how old?",1
2897,Sheldon,12, Fourteen and a half.,1
2898,Dennis,12, You were the youngest person ever to win it. ,1
2899,Leonard,12," It‰Ûªs like looking into an obnoxious little mirror, isn‰Ûªt it? ",1
2900,Scene,12, The living room of the apartment.,1
2901,Penny (to Raj),12," Mmm, this is really delicious, isn‰Ûªt it? (Raj looks uncomfortable, then nods.) Still can‰Ûªt talk to me unless you‰Ûªre drunk, huh? (Shakes head) Oh, sweetie, you are so damaged. ",1
2902,Howard,12," Hey, I‰Ûªm damaged too. How about a hug for Howie? ",1
2903,Penny,12," Sure. Raj, hug Howard. ",1
2904,Sheldon (dramatically),12, Uh-uh-uh. ,1
2905,Leonard,12, Something you‰Ûªd like to share? A tale of woe perhaps.,1
2906,Sheldon,12," Fifteen years old. Dennis Kim is fifteen years old, and he‰Ûªs already correcting my work. Today I went from being Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart to‰Û_ you know, that other guy.",1
2907,Howard,12, Antonio Salieri?,1
2908,Sheldon,12," Oh, God, now even you‰Ûªre smarter than me.",1
2909,Howard,12," You know, Sheldon, you don‰Ûªt have so many friends that you can afford to start insulting them. ",1
2910,Leonard,12," Just eat, Sheldon, you‰Ûªll feel better. ",1
2911,Sheldon,12," Why waste food. In Texas when a cow goes dry they don‰Ûªt keep feeding it, they just take her out and shoot her between the eyes. ",1
2912,Penny,12," I‰Ûªm confused, did Sheldon stop giving milk? ",1
2913,Leonard,12, You can‰Ûªt let this kid get to you. You always knew that someday someone would come along who was younger and smarter.,1
2914,Sheldon,12," Yes, but I assumed I would have been dead hundreds of years, and that there would be an asterisk by his name because he would be a cyborg. ",1
2915,Penny,12," So, you‰Ûªve got a bit of competition, I really don‰Ûªt see what the big deal is. ",1
2916,Sheldon,12," Well of course you don‰Ûªt, you‰Ûªve never excelled at anything. ",1
2917,Penny,12," I don‰Ûªt understand, exactly how did he get any friends in the first place? ",1
2918,Howard,12, We liked Leonard.,1
2919,Leonard,12," Well, what are you going to do, Sheldon, give up?",1
2920,Sheldon,12," Yes. That‰Ûªs what a rational person does when his entire life‰Ûªs work is invalidated by a post-pubescent Asian wunderkind. He ceases his fruitless efforts, he donates his body to scientific research, and he waits to die. ",1
2921,Penny,12," You know, I‰Ûªm confused again, is he waiting, or do we get to shoot him between the eyes?",1
2922,Scene,12," The same, later that night",1
2923,Sheldon,12, Hey.,1
2924,Leonard,12, Hey.,1
2925,Sheldon,12, I‰Ûªve decided you‰Ûªre right. My career is not over. ,1
2926,Leonard,12, Great.,1
2927,Sheldon,12," But, since the arrival of Dennis Kim has rendered my research pointless, I just have to find something else to focus on.",1
2928,Leonard,12, Great.,1
2929,Sheldon,12," So I‰Ûªve decided, I‰Ûªm going to collaborate with you.",1
2930,Leonard,12, Great. ,1
2931,Sheldon,12," What exactly is it you do? I know you chatter on about it all the time, but I‰Ûªve never really paid attention.",1
2932,Leonard,12," Okay, well, right now I‰Ûªm designing an experiment to study the soft component of cosmic radiation at sea-level, but I really don‰Ûªt need any help. ",1
2933,Sheldon,12," Oh, sure you do. Now, see, what‰Ûªs this here in the schematic, is that a laser array?",1
2934,Leonard,12, Yes.,1
2935,Sheldon,12, No. Hmmm. What happens if you use argon lasers instead of helium neon?,1
2936,Leonard,12, It would blow up.,1
2937,Sheldon,12, Are you sure? ,1
2938,Leonard,12, Pretty sure.,1
2939,Sheldon,12," Pretty sure‰Ûªs not very scientific, is this how you normally work, just hunches and guesses and stuff?",1
2940,Leonard,12," Okay, Sheldon, I understand that you‰Ûªre going through a bit of a career crisis, you‰Ûªre searching for some other area where you can feel valuable and productive but I need to tell you something and I want you to listen carefully. ",1
2941,Sheldon,12, Alright.,1
2942,Leonard,12, Go away.,1
2943,Sheldon,12," If you‰Ûªre concerned about sharing credit with me, you‰Ûªre name can go first‰Û_ I‰Ûªm going. ",1
2944,Scene,12, Howard‰Ûªs lab.,1
2945,Howard (into phone),12," It‰Ûªs a small brown paper bag, Ma, I‰Ûªm looking at it right now. (Pause.) Why would I make that up, there‰Ûªs no ding-dong in it. (Pause.) How are two ding-dongs tomorrow going to help me today? ",1
2946,Sheldon (entering),12," So, this is engineering, huh? ",1
2947,Howard (into phone),12, I‰Ûªll talk to you later. ,1
2948,Sheldon,12," Engineering. Where the noble semi-skilled labourers execute the vision of those who think and dream. Hello, oompah-loompahs of science.",1
2949,Howard,12," Sheldon, what are you doing here?",1
2950,Sheldon,12, I just came by to say hello.,1
2951,Howard,12," I‰Ûªve been at this lab for three years, you‰Ûªve never came by to say hello.",1
2952,Sheldon,12," Well, up until now I‰Ûªve had better things to do. So, what are we making today? ",1
2953,Howard,12, A small payload support structure for a European science experimental package that‰Ûªs going up on the next space shuttle. ,1
2954,Sheldon,12," Really, how does it work?",1
2955,Howard,12," When this is done, it will be attached to the payload bay, and the sensor apparatus will rest on it. ",1
2956,Sheldon,12," Uh, huh. So it‰Ûªs a shelf? ",1
2957,Howard,12," No, you don‰Ûªt understand, during acceleration it needs to stay perfectly level and provide‰Û_ yeah, okay, it‰Ûªs a shelf. ",1
2958,Sheldon,12," Now, I notice you‰Ûªre using titanium, did you give any consideration to carbon nanotubes, they‰Ûªre lighter, cheaper and half twice the tensile strength.",1
2959,Howard,12," Sheldon, there‰Ûªs a diploma in my office that says I have a masters in engineering.",1
2960,Sheldon,12," And you also have a note from your mother that says I love you, bubbula. But neither of those is a cogent argument for titanium over nanotubes. ",1
2961,Howard,12, Sheldon.,1
2962,Sheldon,12, Yes.,1
2963,Howard,12, Go away. ,1
2964,Sheldon,12, Did Leonard tell you to say that? ,1
2965,Howard,12," No, I thought of it all by myself. ",1
2966,Sheldon,12, Huh. It can‰Ûªt be a coincidence. There must be some causal link I‰Ûªm missing.,1
2967,Scene,12, Raj is exiting his office.,1
2968,Raj,12, Go away. (Sheldon exits),1
2969,Sheldon,12, Curiouser and curiouser. ,1
2970,Scene,12, The apartment.,1
2971,Howard (entering),12, Is he here? ,1
2972,Leonard,12," If he were, I wouldn‰Ûªt be. ",1
2973,Raj,12," Do you know what he did. He watched me work for ten minutes, and then started to design a simple piece of software that could replace me. ",1
2974,Leonard,12, Is that even possible?,1
2975,Raj,12," As it turns out, yes.",1
2976,Howard,12," Something‰Ûªs got to be done about him, Leonard.",1
2977,Leonard,12, Like what? He‰Ûªll never be able to cope with the fact that some fifteen year-old kid is smarter and more accomplished than he is. ,1
2978,Raj,12," Well, what if something were to happen to this boy so he was no longer a threat to Sheldon?",1
2979,Howard,12, Then our problem would be solved. ,1
2980,Leonard,12," Hang on, are we talking about murdering Dennis Kim? I‰Ûªm not saying no. ",1
2981,Howard,12," We don‰Ûªt have to go that far, there are other means available.",1
2982,Raj,12, We can‰Ûªt send him back to North Korea. He knows how to get out. ,1
2983,Howard,12, The only thing we need to do is make this Kim kid lose his focus.,1
2984,Leonard,12," That won‰Ûªt happen, he‰Ûªs not interested in anything but physics.",1
2985,Howard,12, What about biology? ,1
2986,Leonard,12, What?,1
2987,Howard,12," You know, biology? The one thing that can completely derail a world class mind. ",1
2988,Leonard,12," Howard, he‰Ûªs fifteen.",1
2989,Howard,12," Yeah, so, when I was fifteen I met Denise Polmerry and my grade point average fell from a 5.0 to a 1.8. ",1
2990,Raj,12, She was sleeping with you?,1
2991,Howard,12," No, I just wasted a lot of time thinking about what it would be like if she did. ",1
2992,Sheldon (entering),12," Oh, good, you‰Ûªre all here. Look, I‰Ûªve decided that if the three of you drop whatever it is you‰Ûªre working on and join me, we could lick cold fusion in less than a decade, twelve years tops. (They stare at him.) Go away? (They nod) Hmm. Could it be me? ",1
2993,Scene,12, Outside Penny‰Ûªs apartment. ,1
2994,Penny (opening door),12," Oh, hey guys, what‰Ûªs up?",1
2995,Howard,12, We need a hot fifteen year-old Asian girl with a thing for smart guys. ,1
2996,Penny,12, What?,1
2997,Leonard,12," Howard, that‰Ûªs racist, any fifteen year-old girl will do the trick. (Penny slams door.)",1
2998,Raj,12, It‰Ûªs possible she may have misunderstood us. ,1
2999,Scene,12, Sheldon‰Ûªs office. He is making measurements on maps. There is a knock on the door. ,1
3000,Gablehouser (entering),12," Dr Cooper? Oh, are we interrupting?",1
3001,Sheldon,12," No, no, please, come in. Yeah, I think you‰Ûªll appreciate this, very exciting.",1
3002,Gablehouser,12," Oh, what are you working on?",1
3003,Sheldon,12," Something remarkable. Since my prospects for the Nobel Prize in physics have disappeared, thank you very much, I‰Ûªve decided to refocus my efforts and use my people skills to win the Nobel Peace Prize. Look, I‰Ûªm going to solve the Middle-East Crisis by building an exact replica of Jerusalem in the middle of the Mexican desert. ",1
3004,Gablehouser,12, To what end?,1
3005,Sheldon,12," You know, it‰Ûªs like the baseball movie, build it and they will come. ",1
3006,Gablehouser,12, Who will come?,1
3007,Sheldon,12, The Jewish people.,1
3008,Gablehouser,12, What if they don‰Ûªt come.,1
3009,Sheldon,12," We‰Ûªll make it nice, put out a spread. ",1
3010,Gablehouser,12," Okay, well, um, speaking of spreads, we‰Ûªre having a small welcoming party this afternoon for Mr Kim, who‰Ûªs agreed to join us here at the University.",1
3011,Sheldon,12," Of course he has, the oracle told us little Neo was the one. You can see the Matrix, can‰Ûªt you.",1
3012,Gablehouser,12," Okay, well, uh, obviously you‰Ûªre very busy with your‰Û_ uh, um, come Dennis. You‰Ûªll have to excuse Dr Cooper, he‰Ûªs been under a lot of‰Û_ um‰Û_ he‰Ûªs nuts. ",1
3013,"Sheldon (voice off, sings to a Mexican tune)",12," Ah, la-la-la, Hava Nagila. They‰Ûªll come, they‰Ûªll settle and I‰Ûªll win the prize‰Û_",1
3014,Scene,12, The welcoming party,1
3015,Sheldon,12," I really don‰Ûªt understand your objections, Professor Goldfarb, why wouldn‰Ûªt the Senoran Desert make a perfectly good promised land?",1
3016,Goldfarb,12, Go away. ,1
3017,Sheldon,12, We could call it Nuevo Cherusalem. ,1
3018,Goldfarb,12, Please go away. ,1
3019,Sheldon,12, Said Pharoah to Moses. ,1
3020,Gablehouser,12, Why are all these young women here?,1
3021,Leonard,12, It‰Ûªs take your daughter to work day. ,1
3022,Gablehouser,12," Really, I was not aware of that. ",1
3023,Raj,12," Oh, yes. There was a very official email that was sent to everyone whose insurance files indicated they had daughters between the ages of 14 and 16. ",1
3024,Gablehouser,12, Hm?,1
3025,Howard,12, Smooth.,1
3026,Raj,12, Thank you. ,1
3027,Gablehouser,12, There‰Ûªs the man of the hour. ,1
3028,Leonard,12," Okay, so we now have a socially awkward genius in a room full of attractive age-appropriate women. ",1
3029,Howard,12," All he has to do now is hook up with one of them. (The look at Dennis, who is picking his ear.)",1
3030,Leonard,12, Does anyone else see the flaw in this plan?,1
3031,Raj,12, We need a social catalyst.,1
3032,Leonard,12, Like what? We can‰Ûªt get fifteen year-old girls drunk. åÊ,1
3033,Howard,12, Or can we?,1
3034,Leonard,12," No, we can‰Ûªt. ",1
3035,Howard,12, I don‰Ûªt think you mean we can‰Ûªt. I think you mean we shouldn‰Ûªt. ,1
3036,Sheldon,12," Hey, Howard. You‰Ûªre a Jew. If there was another wailing wall, exactly like the one in Jerusalem, but close to taco stands and cheap prescription drugs, would you still be able to wail at it? Okay, it‰Ûªs definitely me. ",1
3037,Leonard,12," Okay, we cannot leave this to chance, lets pick a girl, and figure out how to get her together with Dennis. ",1
3038,Raj,12, Okay. How about that one.,1
3039,Howard,12," Uh-uh. I know the type, cheerleader, student council, goes out with jocks, won‰Ûªt even look at anybody in the gifted programme. And if, after two years of begging, she does agree to go out with you, it turns out to be a set-up and you‰Ûªre in the back seat of your mom‰Ûªs car with your pants off while the whole football team laughs at you.",1
3040,Raj,12, Are you crying?,1
3041,Howard,12," No, I have allergies. ",1
3042,Raj,12," Okay, uh, how about her? ",1
3043,Leonard,12," Sure. If he wants to spend a couple of years doing her homework while she drinks herself into a stupor with non-fat White Russians, while you‰Ûªre the one holding her head out of the toilet while she‰Ûªs puking and telling you she wishes more guys were like you, and they she gets into Cornell because you wrote her essay for her, and you drive up to visit her one weekend and she acts like she doesn‰Ûªt even know you. ",1
3044,Raj,12," Okay, so not her either. How about her?",1
3045,Howard,12," Interesting, kind of pretty, a little chubby so probably low self-esteem. ",1
3046,Leonard,12, I think that‰Ûªs our girl. One of us should go talk to her. ,1
3047,Raj,12," I can‰Ûªt talk to her, you do it. ",1
3048,Leonard,12," I can‰Ûªt just go up and talk to her. Howard, you talk to her. ",1
3049,Howard,12," Oh no, she‰Ûªll never go for the kid once she gets a peek at this. ",1
3050,Raj,12," You know, if we were in India this would be simpler. Five minutes with her dad, twenty goats and a laptop and we‰Ûªd be done.",1
3051,Leonard,12," Well, we‰Ûªre not in India. ",1
3052,Raj,12," Alright, why don‰Ûªt we do it your way then? We‰Ûªll arrange for this girl to move in across the hall from Dennis so he can pathetically moon over her for months on end.",1
3053,Leonard,12," Okay, that was uncalled for.",1
3054,Raj,12," You started it, dude. ",1
3055,Gablehouser,12, Could I have everyone‰Ûªs attention please. What a wonderful occasion this is. And how fortunate that it should happen to fall on take your daughter to work day. We‰Ûªre here to welcome Mr Dennis Kim to our little family.,1
3056,Sheldon (sarcastically),12, Welcome Dennis Kim. ,1
3057,Gablehouser,12," Mr Kim was not only the valedictorian at Stamford University, he is also the youngest recipient of the prestigious Stephenson Award.",1
3058,Sheldon,12, Youngest till the cyborgs rise up! ,1
3059,Gablehouser,12," And now, without any further ado, let me introduce the man of the hour, Mr Dennis Kim. Dennis! Dennis!",1
3060,Dennis,12, What? ,1
3061,Gablehouser,12, Would you like to tell us a little bit about your upcoming research.,1
3062,Dennis,12," Um, no thanks. I‰Ûªm going to the mall with Emma. ",1
3063,Gablehouser,12," Well, uh, well, uh‰Û_.",1
3064,Leonard,12, The kid got a girl. ,1
3065,Raj,12, Unbelievable.,1
3066,Howard,12, Did anyone see how he did it?,1
3067,Sheldon (to Gablehouser),12," Don‰Ûªt worry, I‰Ûªve got this. Ladies and Gentlemen, honoured daughters. While Mr Kim, by virtue of his youth and naivety, has fallen prey to the inexplicable need for human contact, let me step in and assure you that my research will go on uninterrupted, and that social relationships will continue to baffle and repulse me. Thank you. ",1
3068,Howard,12, He‰Ûªs back.,1
3069,Leonard,12," Yeah, mission accomplished. ",1
3070,Raj,12," Forget the mission, how did that little yutz get a girl on his own?",1
3071,Howard,12, I guess times have changed since we were young. Smart is the new sexy. ,1
3072,Leonard,12," Well, why do we go home alone every night, we‰Ûªre still smart. ",1
3073,Raj,12, Maybe we‰Ûªre too smart. So smart it‰Ûªs offputting. ,1
3074,Howard,12," Yeah, let‰Ûªs go with that. ",1
3075,Scene,12, The park. The four guys are carrying remote control rockets.,1
3076,Howard,12," Unbelievable. Components I built are on the International Space Station, and I get a ticket for launching a model rocket in the park. ",1
3077,Leonard,12," I don‰Ûªt know if the ticket was so much for the launch as it was for you telling the policewoman ‰ÛÏyou have to frisk me, I have a rocket in my pants.‰Û",1
3078,Raj,12," Hey, look at that. (There is a group of youngsters on the grass, laying about. One is playing a guitar. Dennis Kim is among them. He is drinking something from a bottle in a brown paper bag.) It‰Ûªs Dennis Kim.",1
3079,Howard,12," Wow, I almost didn‰Ûªt recognise him.",1
3080,Raj,12," You know, I kind of feel bad about what we did to him. (Dennis is now snogging the face off Emma)",1
3081,Leonard,12," Yeah, we really ruined his life. ",1
3082,Sheldon,12," Screw him, he was weak. ",1
3083,Scene,13, The apartment. Howard is looking at his mobile phone.,1
3084,Howard,13," Ooh, more details about the new Star Trek film. There‰Ûªs going to be a scene depicting Spock‰Ûªs birth. ",1
3085,Raj,13, I‰Ûªd be more interested in a scene depicting Spock‰Ûªs conception. ,1
3086,Sheldon,13," Oh, please. For Vulcans, mating, or, if you will, Pon Farr, it‰Ûªs an extremely private matter.",1
3087,Leonard,13," Still, I‰Ûªd like to know the details. His mother was human, his father was Vulcan, they couldn‰Ûªt just conceive.",1
3088,Howard,13, Maybe they had to go to a clinic. Imagine Spock‰Ûªs dad in a little room with a copy of pointy ears and shapely rears.,1
3089,Raj,13," How come on Star Trek everybody‰Ûªs private parts are the same. No alien lady ever told Captain Kirk, hey, get your thing out of my nose. ",1
3090,Penny (entering),13," Hi, can you help me, I was writing an email and the A key got stuck. Now it‰Ûªs just going ‰ÛÏaaaaaaa‰Û.",1
3091,Leonard,13, What did you spill on it?,1
3092,Penny,13, Nothing. Diet coke. And yoghurt. A little nail polish. ,1
3093,Leonard,13, I‰Ûªll take a look at it. ,1
3094,Howard,13," Gentlemen, switching to local nerd news. Fishman, Chen, Chowdry, McNair aren‰Ûªt fielding a team in the university physics bowl this year. ",1
3095,Leonard,13," You‰Ûªre kidding, why not?",1
3096,Howard,13," They formed a barbershop quartet, and got a gig playing Knotsbury Farm. ",1
3097,Penny,13," Wow, so in your world, you‰Ûªre like, the cool guys. ",1
3098,Howard,13, Recognise. ,1
3099,Leonard,13," This is our year! With those guys out, the entire physics bowl will kneel before Zod. ",1
3100,Penny,13, Zod?,1
3101,Howard,13, Kryptonian villain. Long story.,1
3102,Raj,13, Good story. (Clasps hands to mouth in shock.) ,1
3103,Sheldon,13, Well count me out.,1
3104,Howard,13, What? Why?,1
3105,Sheldon,13, You want me to use my intelligence in a tawdry competition? Would you ask Picasso to play Pictionary? Would you ask Noah Webster to play Boggle? Would you ask Jacques Cousteau to play Go Fish? ,1
3106,Leonard,13," Come on, you need a four person team, we‰Ûªre four people. ",1
3107,Sheldon,13," By that reasoning we should also play bridge, hold up a chuppah and enter the Olympic bobsled competition.",1
3108,Penny,13, I want tickets to that please. ,1
3109,Leonard,13," Sheldon, what, do I need to quote Spock‰Ûªs dying words to you.",1
3110,Sheldon,13," No, don‰Ûªt. ",1
3111,Leonard,13, The needs of the many.,1
3112,Howard,13, Outweigh the needs of the few. ,1
3113,Sheldon,13," Or the one. Dammit, I‰Ûªll do it. ",1
3114,Scene,13, The cafeteria.,1
3115,Raj,13, Okay. First order of physics bowl business. We need a truly kick-ass team name. Suggestions.,1
3116,Howard,13," How about the perpetual motion squad? It‰Ûªs beyond the laws of physics, plus a little heads up for the ladies. ",1
3117,Leonard,13, The ladies?,1
3118,Howard,13," Perpetual motion squad, we can go all night.",1
3119,Raj,13, I like it.,1
3120,Sheldon,13," I don‰Ûªt. Teams are traditionally named after fierce creatures, thus intimidating ones opponent.",1
3121,Raj,13, Then we can be the Bengal Tigers.,1
3122,Sheldon,13," Poor choice. Gram for gram, no animal exceeds the relative fighting strength of the army ant. ",1
3123,Raj,13, Maybe so. But you can‰Ûªt incinerate a Bengal Tiger with a magnifying glass. ,1
3124,Leonard,13, Let‰Ûªs put it to a vote. All those in favour‰Û_.,1
3125,Sheldon,13," Point of order. I move that any vote on team names should be unanimous. No man should be forced to emblazon his chest with the bengal tiger, when common sense dictates it should be an army ant. ",1
3126,Leonard,13, Will the gentleman from the great state of denial yield for a question? ,1
3127,Sheldon,13, I will yield.,1
3128,Leonard,13," After we go through the exercise of an annoying series of votes, all of which the gentleman will lose, does he then intend to threaten to quit if he does not get his way?",1
3129,Sheldon,13, He does. ,1
3130,Leonard,13," I move we are the Army Ants, all those in favour?",1
3131,Scene,13, The apartment.,1
3132,Penny,13," Good afternoon, and welcome to today‰Ûªs physics bowl practice round. I‰Ûªm Penny, and I‰Ûªll be your host, because apparently I didn‰Ûªt have anything else to do on a Saturday afternoon, and isn‰Ûªt that just a little sad? Gentlemen, are you ready?",1
3133,Leonard,13, Yes.,1
3134,Sheldon,13, Of course. ,1
3135,Howard,13, Fire away. (Raj puts his thumb up.),1
3136,Penny,13," You know, it‰Ûªs none of my business, but isn‰Ûªt a guy who can‰Ûªt speak in front of women going to hold you back a little?",1
3137,Leonard,13," Oh, uh, he‰Ûªll be okay once the women are mixed into the crowd. He only has a problem when they‰Ûªre one on one and smell nice.",1
3138,Penny,13," Oh, thanks Raj, it‰Ûªs vanilla oil.",1
3139,Leonard,13," I was actually the one who noticed, okay, let‰Ûªs just start. ",1
3140,Penny,13," Okay, the first question is on the topic of optics. What is the shortest light pulse ever produced? Dr Cooper.",1
3141,Sheldon,13," And of course, the answer is 130 adoseconds.",1
3142,Penny,13, That is correct.,1
3143,Leonard,13, I knew that too.,1
3144,Penny,13," Good for you, sweetie. Okay, next question. What is the quantum mechanical effect used to encode data on hard disk drives? Howard.",1
3145,Sheldon,13," And of course, the answer is giant magneto resistance.",1
3146,Penny,13, Right. ,1
3147,Howard,13," Hey, I buzzed in. ",1
3148,Sheldon,13," But I answered, it‰Ûªs called teamwork. ",1
3149,Howard,13, Don‰Ûªt you think I should answer the engineering questions? I am an engineer.,1
3150,Sheldon,13, By that logic I should answer all the anthropology questions because I‰Ûªm a mammal.åÊ ,1
3151,Leonard,13, Just ask another one.,1
3152,Penny,13, Okay. What artificial satellite has seen glimpses of Einsteins predicted frame dragging? (Raj buzzes.),1
3153,Sheldon,13, And of course it‰Ûªs Gravity Probe B.,1
3154,Leonard,13," Sheldon, you have to let somebody else answer. ",1
3155,Sheldon,13, Why? ,1
3156,Penny,13, Because it‰Ûªs polite.,1
3157,Sheldon,13, What do manners have to do with it? This is war. Were the Romans polite when they salted the ground of Carthage to make sure nothing would ever grow again?,1
3158,Penny,13," Leonard, you said I only had to ask questions. ",1
3159,Sheldon,13," The objective of the competition is to give correct answers, if I know them, why shouldn‰Ûªt I give them? ",1
3160,Howard,13, Some of us might have the correct answers too. ,1
3161,Sheldon,13," Oh please, you don‰Ûªt even have a PhD. ",1
3162,Howard,13," Alright, that‰Ûªs it.",1
3163,Leonard,13," Howard, sit down.",1
3164,Howard,13, Okay. ,1
3165,Leonard,13, maybe we should take a little break.,1
3166,Sheldon,13," Good idea, I need my wrist brace, all this button pushing is aggravating my old Nintendo injury. ",1
3167,Howard (after Raj whispers in his ear),13, I agree.,1
3168,Penny,13, What did he say? ,1
3169,Howard,13, He compared Sheldon to a disposable feminine cleansing product one might use on a summer‰Ûªs eve. ,1
3170,Penny,13," Yeah, and the bag it came in. ",1
3171,Scene,13," The same, later. Sheldon is on his laptop. Leonard enters.",1
3172,Sheldon,13," Leonard, excellent, I want to show you something.",1
3173,Leonard,13," Can it wait, I need to talk to you.",1
3174,Sheldon,13," Just look. I‰Ûªve designed the perfect uniforms for our team. The colours are based on Star Trek, the original series. The three of you will wear support red, and I will wear command gold. ",1
3175,Leonard,13, Why do they say AA? ,1
3176,Sheldon,13, Army Ants. ,1
3177,Leonard,13, Isn‰Ûªt that confusing? AA might mean something else to certain people. ,1
3178,Sheldon,13, Why would a physics bowl team be called anodised aluminium?,1
3179,Leonard,13," No, I meant‰Û_. never mind. Hey, check it out. I got you a Batman cookie jar!",1
3180,Sheldon,13," Oh neat, what‰Ûªs the occasion?",1
3181,Leonard,13," Well, you‰Ûªre a friend, and you like Batman, and cookies, and you‰Ûªre off the team. ",1
3182,Sheldon,13, What?,1
3183,Leonard,13," Howard, Raj and I just had a team meeting. ",1
3184,Sheldon,13, No you didn‰Ûªt.,1
3185,Leonard,13," Yes we did, I just came from it.",1
3186,Sheldon,13," Okay, I don‰Ûªt know where you just came from, but it couldn‰Ûªt have been a team meeting because I‰Ûªm on the team and I wasn‰Ûªt there, ergo the team did not meet. ",1
3187,Leonard,13," Okay, let me try it this way, uh, I was at a coffee klatch with a couple of friends and one thing led to another and it turns out you‰Ûªre off the team. ",1
3188,Sheldon,13, Why?,1
3189,Leonard,13, Because you‰Ûªre taking all the fun out of it.,1
3190,Sheldon,13," Well, I‰Ûªm sorry, is the winner of the physics bowl the team that has the most fun?",1
3191,Leonard,13," Okay, let me try it this way, you‰Ûªre annoying and no-one wants to play with you any more. ",1
3192,Sheldon,13," I see. Well. At this point I should inform you that I intend to form my own team and destroy the molecular bonds that bind your very matter together, and reduce the resulting particulate chaos to tears.",1
3193,Leonard,13, Thanks for the heads up. ,1
3194,Sheldon,13, You‰Ûªre welcome. One more thing.,1
3195,Leonard,13, Yes.,1
3196,Sheldon,13," It‰Ûªs on, bitch. ",1
3197,Scene,13, The cafeteria. ,1
3198,Howard,13, So who‰Ûªd he get to be on his team.,1
3199,Leonard,13," He won‰Ûªt say. He just smiles, and eats macaroons out of his bat jar. ",1
3200,Raj,13," He‰Ûªs using psychological warfare. We must reply in kind. I say we wait until he looks at us, then laugh like, yes, you are a smart and strong competitor, but we are also smart and strong and we have a reasonable chance of defeating you. ",1
3201,Leonard,13, How exactly would that laugh go? ,1
3202,Raj,13, Hee hee hee hee hee hee hee!,1
3203,Howard,13," That sounds more like, we are a tall thin woman who wants to make a coat out of your Dalmatians. ",1
3204,Leonard,13," Guys, let‰Ûªs remember that Sheldon is still our friend and my room mate.",1
3205,Howard,13, So?,1
3206,Leonard,13," So nothing, let‰Ûªs destroy him. ",1
3207,Sheldon (walking past),13, Gentlemen.,1
3208,Raj,13, Hee hee hee hee hee hee hee!,1
3209,Howard,13," Okay, we‰Ûªre going to need a strong fourth for our team.",1
3210,Raj,13," You know who‰Ûªs apparently very smart, is the girl who played TV‰Ûªs Blossom. She got a PhD in neuroscience or something. ",1
3211,Leonard,13," Raj, we‰Ûªre not getting TV‰Ûªs Blossom to join our physics bowl team. ",1
3212,Raj,13, How about the girl from the Wonder Years? ,1
3213,Howard,13," Gentlemen, I believe I‰Ûªve found the solution to all our problems. ",1
3214,Leonard,13, We can‰Ûªt ask Leslie Winkle.,1
3215,Raj,13, Why? Because you slept together and when she was done with you she discarded you like last night‰Ûªs chutney? ,1
3216,Leonard,13, Yes. ,1
3217,Howard,13, Sometimes you‰Ûªve got to take one for the team.,1
3218,Raj,13," Yeah. Sack up, dude. ",1
3219,Leonard,13," Fine. Here I go, taking one for the team. In the sack. Hey Leslie.",1
3220,Leslie,13, Hi guys.,1
3221,Leonard,13," Leslie, I have a question for you, and it might be a little awkward, you know, given that I‰Û_",1
3222,Howard,13, Hit that thang. ,1
3223,Leslie,13," Leonard, there‰Ûªs no reason to feel uncomfortable just because we‰Ûªve seen each other‰Ûªs faces and naked bodies contorted in the sweet agony of coitus. ",1
3224,Leonard,13," There‰Ûªs not? Gee, cos it sure sounds like there should be. ",1
3225,Leslie,13," Rest assured that any aspects of our sexual relationship regarding your preferences, your idiosyncrasies, your performance, are still protected by the inherent confidentiality of the bedroom.",1
3226,Leonard,13," That‰Ûªs all very comforting, but if it‰Ûªs okay, I‰Ûªd like to get on with my question now.",1
3227,Leslie,13, Proceed.,1
3228,Leonard,13, We are entering the physics bowl and we need a fourth for our team.,1
3229,Leslie,13," No thanks, I‰Ûªm really busy with my like sign dilepton super symmetry search.",1
3230,Howard,13," Dilepton, schmilepton, we need you. ",1
3231,Leslie,13, Sorry. ,1
3232,Howard,13," Well, we tried. Just have to face Sheldon mano-e-mano-e-mano. A-mano. ",1
3233,Leslie,13," Wait, you‰Ûªre going up against Sheldon Cooper? ",1
3234,Howard,13, Yes.,1
3235,Leslie,13," That arrogant, misogynistic East-Texas doorknob that told me I should abandon my work with high energy particles for laundry and child bearing? ",1
3236,Leonard,13, She‰Ûªs in. ,1
3237,Scene,13, The Physics Bowl.,1
3238,Penny,13," So, how do you feel? Nice and loose? Come to play? Got your game face on? (The guys look confused.) Are you ready?",1
3239,Leonard,13," Oh, yeah. You know you don‰Ûªt have to stay for the whole thing. ",1
3240,Penny,13," Oh, no, no, I want to. It sounds really interesting. ",1
3241,Sheldon (entering in his Star Trek themed shirt),13, Gentlemen.,1
3242,Leonard,13, Sheldon.,1
3243,Howard,13, Sheldon. ,1
3244,Raj,13, Hee hee hee hee hee hee hee hee.,1
3245,Penny,13, Sheldon. I‰Ûªm just going to sit down. ,1
3246,Leonard,13," So, is that your team.",1
3247,Sheldon,13," Actually, I don‰Ûªt need a team, I could easily defeat you single-handedly. But the rules require four, so may I introduce, the third floor janitor, he lady from the lunchroom, and, my Spanish is not good, either her son or her butcher. And what about your team? What rat have you recruited to the SS Sinking Ship?",1
3248,Leslie,13," Hello, Sheldon. ",1
3249,Sheldon,13, Leslie Winkle? ,1
3250,Leslie,13," Yeah, Leslie Winkle. The answer to the question, who made Sheldon Cooper cry like a little girl? ",1
3251,Sheldon,13," Yes, well, I‰Ûªm polymerised tree sap and you‰Ûªre non-organic adhesive so, whatever verbal projectile you launch in my direction is reflected off of me, returns on its original trajectory, and adheres to you. ",1
3252,Leslie,13," Oh, ouch. ",1
3253,Dr Gablehouser,13," Okay, if everyone could please take your seats. ",1
3254,Leonard,13, Here‰Ûªs your tee-shirt. (Hands her a tee-shirt with PMS on it. Takes jacket off to reveal similar.) ,1
3255,Leslie,13," PMS? It‰Ûªs a couple of days early, but‰Û_",1
3256,Leonard,13," No, it stands for Perpetual Motion Squad. ",1
3257,Leslie,13," Oh, right, of course, what was I thinking? ",1
3258,Gablehouser,13," Good afternoon everyone, and welcome to this year‰Ûªs physics bowl. Today‰Ûªs preliminary match features two great teams‰Û_ AA versus PMS. ",1
3259,Howard,13," All night long, y‰Ûªall! (Stands and turns round to reveal the back of the tee-shirt which reads ‰ÛÏWe Can Go All Night‰Û.)",1
3260,Gablehouser,13," Okay, well let‰Ûªs jump right in, first question, for ten points. What is the isospan singlet partner of the Pi Zero Meson? (Buzz) PMS?",1
3261,Leonard,13, The Eta Meson.,1
3262,Gablehouser,13, Correct. ,1
3263,Sheldon,13, Formal protest.,1
3264,Gablehouser,13, On what grounds?,1
3265,Sheldon,13, The Velcro on my wrist brace caught on my shirt.,1
3266,Gablehouser,13," Denied. Alright, for ten points, what is the lightest element on earth with no stable isotope. (Buzz) AA?",1
3267,Sheldon,13," And of course, the answer is Technetium.",1
3268,Gablehouser,13," Terrific. Next question, what is the force between two uncharged plates due to quantum vacuum fluctuation. (Buzz) PMS?",1
3269,Raj,13," Sheldon can suck on, the Casimir Effect.",1
3270,Gablehouser,13, Correct. ,1
3271,Gablehouser,13, How does a quantum computer factor large numbers. (Buzz) PMS?,1
3272,Leslie,13, Shor‰Ûªs Algorithm.,1
3273,Gablehouser,13, Correct. ,1
3274,Sheldon,13, 4.1855 times ten to the seventh ergs per calorie.,1
3275,Leonard,13, Prevost‰Ûªs theory of exchanges. ,1
3276,Sheldon,13, Lamda equals one over Pi R squared N ,1
3277,Howard,13," 760 degrees celsius, the approximate temperature of the young lady in the front row.",1
3278,Gablehouser,13," Mr Wolowitz, this is your second warning. ",1
3279,Sheldon,13, A sigma particle.,1
3280,Leslie,13," Yes, assuming the hypothetical planet has a mass greater than the earth.",1
3281,Gablehouser,13," Correct. Ladies and gentlemen, I hold in my hand the final question. The score now stands AA 1150, PMS 1175. So, for one hundred points, and the match, please turn your attention to the formula on the screens. Solve the equation. ",1
3282,Raj,13, Holy crap. ,1
3283,Leonard,13, What the hell is that.,1
3284,Howard,13, It looks like something they found on the ship at Roswell. ,1
3285,Leonard,13," Come on, think, Leslie.",1
3286,Leslie,13," Leonard, it‰Ûªs not going to work if you rush me, you have to let me get there.",1
3287,Leonard,13," You‰Ûªre never going to let that go, are you? ",1
3288,Gablehouser,13, Ten seconds. (Buzz) PMS.,1
3289,Leonard,13," Sorry, I panicked. ",1
3290,Howard,13, Then guess.,1
3291,Leonard,13," Um, eight. (Gablehouser stares at him.) Point four. ",1
3292,Gablehouser,13," I‰Ûªm sorry, that‰Ûªs incorrect. AA, if you can answer correctly, the match is yours. ",1
3293,Howard,13, He doesn‰Ûªt have it. He‰Ûªs got squat.,1
3294,Gablehouser,13," AA, I need your answer. (Buzz)",1
3295,Third Floor Janitor,13, The answer is minus eight by alpha. ,1
3296,Sheldon,13," Hang on, hang on a second, that‰Ûªs not our answer. What are you doing?",1
3297,Third Floor Janitor,13, Answering question. Winning physics bowl. ,1
3298,Sheldon,13, How do you know anything about physics?,1
3299,Third Floor Janitor,13," Here I am janitor, in former Soviet Union I am physicist. Leningrad Politechnica. Go Polar Bears. ",1
3300,Sheldon,13," Well that‰Ûªs a delightful little story, but our arrangement was that you sit here and not say anything, I answer the questions.",1
3301,Third Floor Janitor,13, You didn‰Ûªt answer question.,1
3302,Sheldon,13," Hey look, now maybe you have democracy now in your beloved Russia, but on this physics bowl team I rule with an iron fist. (Makes fist in the air). Ow!",1
3303,Gablehouser,13," AA, I need your official answer.",1
3304,Sheldon,13, Well it‰Ûªs not what he said.,1
3305,Gablehouser,13, Then what is it? ,1
3306,Sheldon,13, I want a different question.,1
3307,Gablehouser,13, You can‰Ûªt have a different question. ,1
3308,Sheldon,13, Formal protest.,1
3309,Gablehouser,13, Denied.,1
3310,Sheldon,13, Informal protest.,1
3311,Gablehouser,13, Denied. I need your official answer.,1
3312,Sheldon,13, No. I decline to provide one.,1
3313,Gablehouser,13," Well, that‰Ûªs too bad, because the answer your teammate gave was correct. ",1
3314,Sheldon,13, That‰Ûªs your opinion.,1
3315,Gablehouser,13," Alright, the winner of the match is‰Û_",1
3316,Leonard,13," Hang on. Sheldon, is proving that you are single-handedly smarter than everyone else so important that you would rather lose by yourself than win as part of a team. ",1
3317,Sheldon,13, I don‰Ûªt understand the question. ,1
3318,Leonard,13, Go ahead.,1
3319,Gablehouser,13, The winner is PMS! ,1
3320,Scene,13, The apartment. Sheldon goes to sit in his spot.,1
3321,Leonard,13," Sorry, somebody‰Ûªs sitting there.",1
3322,Sheldon,13, Who?,1
3323,Leonard,13, My Physics Bowl Trophy! ,1
3324,Sheldon,13," That trophy is meaningless, I forfeited, therefore you did not win. ",1
3325,Leonard,13, I know someone who would disagree.,1
3326,Sheldon,13, Who?,1
3327,Leonard,13," My Physics Bowl Trophy! (In weird voice) ‰ÛÏLeonard is so smart, Sheldon who?‰Û",1
3328,Sheldon,13, Alright that is very immature.,1
3329,Leonard,13," You‰Ûªre right, I‰Ûªm sorry. (In voice, waving trophy in Sheldon‰Ûªs face) I‰Ûªm not! ",1
3330,Penny (entering),13," Okay, new contest. ",1
3331,Leonard,13, What are you doing?,1
3332,Penny,13," I‰Ûªm settling once and for all who is the smartest around here. Okay, are you ready?",1
3333,Sheldon,13, Absolutely.,1
3334,Leonard,13, Bring it on.,1
3335,Penny,13," Okay. Marsha, Jan and Cindy were the three daughters of what TV family? (They stare at her.) The Brady Bunch. Okay, Sammy Hagar replaced David Lee Roth as the lead singer in what group?",1
3336,Sheldon (after they look at each other in confusion),13, The Brady Bunch? ,1
3337,Penny,13," Van Halen. Alright, Madonna was married to this Ridgemont High alum. (Pause) Oh my God, Sean Penn!",1
3338,Leonard,13, How do you know these things?,1
3339,Penny,13," I go outside and I talk to people. Alright, here, what actor holds the record for being named people magazine‰Ûªs sexiest man alive?",1
3340,Sheldon,13, William Shatner.,1
3341,Leonard,13," Wait, I don‰Ûªt think it‰Ûªs Shatner.",1
3342,Sheldon,13, Then it‰Ûªs got to be Patrick Stewart. ,1
3343,Penny,13, No.,1
3344,Sheldon,13, Formal protest. ,1
3345,Penny,13," Alright, singer who sang ‰ÛÏOops I Did It Again.‰Û (Sheldon starts involuntarily twitching again.) Okay, Tweetie Bird, taught he taw a what?",1
3346,Sheldon (after they pass a smug look between each other),13, Romulan.,1
3347,Penny,13, Yes. He taught he taw a Romulan. ,1
3348,Scene,14, The apartment.,1
3349,Sheldon,14," Well, this sandwich is an unmitigated disaster. I asked for turkey and roast beef with lettuce and swiss on wholewheat.",1
3350,Raj,14, What did they give you?,1
3351,Sheldon,14, Turkey and roast beef with swiss and lettuce on wholewheat. It‰Ûªs the right ingredients but in the wrong order. In a proper sandwich the cheese is adjacent to the bread to create a moisture barrier against the lettuce. They might as well have dragged this thing through a car wash. ,1
3352,Leonard,14, I don‰Ûªt believe it.,1
3353,Sheldon,14," I know, it‰Ûªs basic culinary science. ",1
3354,Leonard,14, Some guy is auctioning off a miniature time machine prop from the original film and no-one is bidding on it. ,1
3355,Howard,14, A time machine from the movie The Time Machine? ,1
3356,Leonard,14," No, a time machine from Sophie‰Ûªs Choice. ",1
3357,Raj,14," Boy, Sophie could have used a time machine in that movie. Did you see it, it‰Ûªs rough. ",1
3358,Howard,14," Oh, that‰Ûªs cool.",1
3359,Leonard,14, Uh-huh.,1
3360,Raj,14, It‰Ûªs only $800?,1
3361,Leonard,14, Yeah. And that‰Ûªs my bid.,1
3362,Sheldon,14, You bid $800.,1
3363,Leonard,14," It was a spur of the moment thing, I figured it would go for thousands and I just wanted to be a part of it. ",1
3364,Sheldon,14, There‰Ûªs only 30 seconds left in the auction.,1
3365,Howard,14, Do you have $800?,1
3366,Leonard,14, Not to blow on a miniature time machine. ,1
3367,Howard,14," Don‰Ûªt worry, the way these things work there‰Ûªs people waiting ‰Û÷til the last second to bid, and then they swoop in and get it, it‰Ûªs called sniping.",1
3368,Raj,14, Fifteen seconds.,1
3369,Leonard,14," Come on, snipers. ",1
3370,Raj,14," Ten, nine, eight‰Û_",1
3371,Leonard,14, Where are your snipers?,1
3372,Raj,14, Five.,1
3373,Leonard,14, Snipe.,1
3374,Raj,14, Four.,1
3375,Leonard,14, Snipe. ,1
3376,Raj,14, Three.,1
3377,Leonard,14, Snipe!,1
3378,Raj,14, Two.,1
3379,Leonard,14, SNIPE!,1
3380,Raj,14, One.,1
3381,Leonard,14, Aaaa-aw! ,1
3382,Raj,14," Congratulations, you are the proud owner of a miniature time machine.",1
3383,Howard,14, You lucky duck. ,1
3384,Sheldon,14," I wonder why no-one else bid, this is a classic piece of sci-fi movie memorabilia. ",1
3385,Leonard,14," Yeah, I know, I still can‰Ûªt afford it. ",1
3386,Howard,14, Why don‰Ûªt we share it? We‰Ûªll each put in two hundred bucks and we‰Ûªll take turns having it in our homes.,1
3387,Raj,14, A time share time machine? I‰Ûªm in. Sheldon?,1
3388,Sheldon,14, Need you ask? But I still don‰Ûªt understand why no-one else bid. ,1
3389,Scene,14, The lobby. The guys stand around a full sized time machine. ,1
3390,Sheldon,14, I understand why no-one else bid. ,1
3391,Scene,14, The same,1
3392,Raj,14, Did the listing actually say miniature?,1
3393,Leonard,14, I just assumed. Who sells a full sized time machine for $800?,1
3394,Sheldon,14," In a venn diagram, that would be an individual located within the intersection of the sets ‰ÛÏno longer want my time machine‰Û and ‰ÛÏneed $800‰Û.",1
3395,Howard,14," It‰Ûªs actually a tremendous bargain, even with shipping it works out to less than four dollars a pound. ",1
3396,Raj,14, Cocktain shrimp are $12.50.,1
3397,Leonard,14, How are we going to get it upstairs? ,1
3398,Howard,14, If we take the dish off it might fit in the elevator. ,1
3399,Leonard,14, Yes but the elevator‰Ûªs been broken for two years. ,1
3400,Sheldon,14," I‰Ûªve been meaning to ask you, do you think we should make a call about that? ",1
3401,Howard,14," Not necessary, I have a masters in engineering, I remotely repair satellites on a regular basis. I troubleshoot space shuttle payloads. When the Mars rover started pulling to the left I performed a front end alignment from 62 million miles away. (Presses lift button. Nothing happens.) No, that baby‰Ûªs broken. ",1
3402,Scene,14," The stairwell, approaching the apartment door. Leonard and Sheldon are pulling the time machine up the last part of the stairs.",1
3403,Leonard,14," Come on, guys, push. ",1
3404,Howard (off),14, If I push any harder I‰Ûªm going to give birth to my colon. ,1
3405,Raj (off),14," I can‰Ûªt feel my fingers, hurry up. ",1
3406,Sheldon,14," It‰Ûªs the same amount of work no matter how fast you go, basic physics.",1
3407,Raj,14, Sheldon?,1
3408,Sheldon,14, Yeah. ,1
3409,Raj,14," If my fingers ever work again, I‰Ûªve got a job for the middle one. ",1
3410,Penny (coming out of her apartment),14," Oh, hey guys.",1
3411,"Leonard (letting go of time machine, as does Sheldon)",14," Uh, hi Penny. (Raj and Howard are heard to scream as the time machine slides back down the stairs.) Take a break, guys! ",1
3412,Penny,14, What are you doing?,1
3413,Leonard,14," Oh, just, you know, moving‰Û_ something upstairs. ",1
3414,Penny,14, What is it?,1
3415,Leonard,14," It‰Ûªs‰Û_ you know, time machine. ",1
3416,Penny,14," Yeah, okay, neat, but I really got to get to work, so‰Û_.",1
3417,Leonard,14," Uh, just give us a few minutes.",1
3418,Penny,14," I don‰Ûªt have a few minutes, I‰Ûªm running really late.",1
3419,Sheldon,14," Then I have a simple solution, go up to the roof, hop over to the next building, there‰Ûªs a small gap, don‰Ûªt look down if you‰Ûªre subject to vertigo, and use their stairwell. ",1
3420,Penny,14," You‰Ûªre joking, right?",1
3421,Sheldon,14," Oh, I never joke when it comes to vertigo. ",1
3422,Penny,14," Damn, okay, I‰Ûªll just take the roof. ",1
3423,Leonard,14," Hey, if you wait for us to set up the time machine, I can drop you off at work yesterday. Time travel joke, it‰Ûªs not‰Û_ never mind. ",1
3424,Sheldon,14," For what it‰Ûªs worth, I thought it was humorous. ",1
3425,Leonard,14," Let‰Ûªs just do this. Guys, ready to push?",1
3426,Raj,14, In a minute. Howard stepped outside to throw up. ,1
3427,Scene,14, The living room. The time machine is set up.,1
3428,Sheldon,14, I don‰Ûªt know what you were worried about. I think it really works in the room.,1
3429,Leonard,14, Yeah. It is by far the coolest thing I have ever owned. ,1
3430,Sheldon,14," The exact time machine that carried actor Rod Taylor from Victorian England into the post-apocalyptic future, which society had splintered into two factions, the sub-terranean Morlocks, who survived by feasting on the flesh of the gentle surface dwelling Eloy. ",1
3431,Howard,14, Talk about your chick magnets. ,1
3432,Raj,14," Oh yeah. The guy who lives next to me is always like, I have a Jacuzzi on my balcony, I have a Jacuzzi on my balcony. But wait until I tell him, I‰Ûªve got a time machine on my balcony. Stuff that in your speedos, Jacuzzi Bob!",1
3433,Sheldon,14," Gentlemen, I know we said we‰Ûªd take turns, but I think you‰Ûªd agree that practicality dictates it remain here. ",1
3434,Howard,14," You can‰Ûªt just keep it here, what if I meet a girl and say, ‰ÛÏyou wanna come up and see my time machine, it‰Ûªs at my friends house,‰Û how lame is that? ",1
3435,Raj,14, He‰Ûªs got a point.,1
3436,Sheldon,14," Alright, I think we‰Ûªre going to need some ground rules, in addition to the expected no shoes in the time machine and no eating in the time machine, I propose that we add pants must be worn at all times in the time machine. ",1
3437,Leonard,14, Seconded. ,1
3438,Howard,14, I was going to put down a towel. ,1
3439,Raj,14, I still want it on my balcony. I say we move it on a bi-monthly basis. ,1
3440,Leonard,14, That sounds fair.,1
3441,Sheldon,14," Hold on. Bi-monthly is an ambiguous term, do you mean move it every other month, or twice a month? ",1
3442,Raj,14, Twice a month.,1
3443,Sheldon,14, Then no. ,1
3444,Raj,14," Okay, every other month.",1
3445,Sheldon,14, No. ,1
3446,Leonard,14," Sheldon, you can‰Ûªt be selfish, we all paid for it, so it belongs to all of us. Now out of the way so I can sit in my time machine. (Sits and turns it on. The three lights on the front illuminate. All let out an ‰ÛÏoh‰Û.) Okay, I am setting the dials for March 10th, 1876. ",1
3447,Howard,14," Good choice, Alexander Graham Bell invents the telephone and calls out for Dr Watson.",1
3448,Sheldon,14," Wait a minute, I‰Ûªd want to see that too. ",1
3449,Leonard,14," So, when it‰Ûªs your turn you can.",1
3450,Sheldon,14," But if we all go back to the same point in time, Bell‰Ûªs lab is going to get very crowded, he‰Ûªll know something‰Ûªs up. ",1
3451,Raj,14," Also, since the time machine doesn‰Ûªt move in space, you‰Ûªll end up in 1876 Pasadena. ",1
3452,Howard,14," And even if you can make it to Boston, what are you going to do, knock on the door and say to Mrs Bell, ‰ÛÏhey Mrs Bell, big fan of your husband, can I come in and watch him invent the telephone?‰Û",1
3453,Raj,14," Mrs Bell was deaf, she‰Ûªs not even going to hear you knock. ",1
3454,Sheldon,14," Oh, I have a solution, first go into the future and obtain a cloaking device.",1
3455,Raj,14," Ooh, how far into the future?",1
3456,Sheldon,14," If I remember correctly, Captain Kirk will steal a cloaking device from the Romulans on Stardate 5027.3, which will be January 10th 2328 by pre-federation reckoning.",1
3457,Leonard,14," Okay, I am setting the dials for January 10th, 2328. Here we go into the future. (Pulls lever, the disk begins to spin. The other guys all run around the flat as if moving in fast motion.) That was fun. ",1
3458,Raj,14, My turn.,1
3459,Penny (entering),14," Okay, first of all, what you call a gap was nearly three feet wide, I slipped and skinned my knee.",1
3460,Leonard,14, Are you okay?,1
3461,Penny,14," Zzz-zz-zz-zz! Second of all, the door to the stairwell of the other building was locked, so I had to go down the fire escape which ends on the third floor, forcing me to crawl through the window of a lovely Armenian family, who insisted I stay for lunch. ",1
3462,Leonard,14, That doesn‰Ûªt sound too bad.,1
3463,Penny,14," It was eight courses of lamb, and they tried to fix me up with their son.",1
3464,Leonard,14, Sorry.,1
3465,Penny,14," Not done. By the time I finally got to work, they‰Ûªd given my shift away. Yeah, that‰Ûªs right, I‰Ûªve lost an entire day‰Ûªs pay thanks to this‰Û_ this‰Û_",1
3466,Sheldon,14, Time machine. ,1
3467,Leonard,14," The lights flash and the dish spins, you wanna try it?",1
3468,Penny,14," No! I don‰Ûªt want to try it, my God, you are grown men, how could you waste your lives with these stupid toys and costumes and comic books and‰Û_ and now that‰Û_ that‰Û_",1
3469,Sheldon,14," Again, time machine. ",1
3470,Penny,14," Oh please, it‰Ûªs not a time machine, if anything it looks like something Elton John would drive through the Everglades.",1
3471,Sheldon,14, It only moves in time. It would be worse than useless in a swamp. ,1
3472,Penny,14," Pathetic. All of you, completely pathetic. (Storms out. A beat, and then‰Û_) ",1
3473,Raj,14, My turn! ,1
3474,Scene,14," Later that night, Leonard is sitting in the time machine, turning the lights on and off. Sheldon enters.",1
3475,Sheldon,14," Leonard, it‰Ûªs two in the morning. ",1
3476,Leonard,14, So?,1
3477,Sheldon,14, So it‰Ûªs my turn. Why did you set it for the day before yesterday?,1
3478,Leonard,14, Because I want to go back and keep myself from getting a time machine.,1
3479,Sheldon,14," You can‰Ûªt. If you were to prevent yourself from buying it in the past, you would not have it available in the present to travel back and stop yourself from buying it, ergo you would still have it. This is a classic rookie time travel mistake. ",1
3480,Leonard,14, Can I go back and prevent you from explaining that to me?,1
3481,Sheldon,14," Same paradox. If you were to travel back in time and, say, knock me unconscious, you would not then have the conversation that irritated you, motivating you to go back and knock me unconscious. ",1
3482,Leonard,14, What if I knocked you unconscious right now? ,1
3483,Sheldon,14, It won‰Ûªt change the past. ,1
3484,Leonard,14, But it would make the present so much nicer. ,1
3485,Sheldon,14, Are you upset about something? ,1
3486,Leonard,14, What was your first clue?,1
3487,Sheldon,14," Well, it was a number of things. First the late hour, then your demeanour seems very low energy, plus your irritability‰Û_",1
3488,Leonard,14, Yes I‰Ûªm upset. ,1
3489,Sheldon,14, Oh! I don‰Ûªt usually pick up on those things. Good for me. ,1
3490,Leonard,14," Yeah, good for you. ",1
3491,Sheldon,14," Oh, wait. Did you want to talk about what‰Ûªs bothering you? ",1
3492,Leonard,14, I don‰Ûªt know. Maybe.,1
3493,Sheldon,14," Wow, I‰Ûªm on fire tonight. ",1
3494,Leonard,14," Uh, here‰Ûªs the thing. Girls like Penny never end up with guys who own time machines. ",1
3495,Sheldon,14, I disagree. Your inability to successfully woo Penny long predates your acquisition of the time machine. That failure clearly stands on its own.,1
3496,Leonard,14, Thanks for pointing it out.,1
3497,Sheldon,14," In addition, your premise is flawed. In the original film, Rod Taylor got Yvette Mimeaux with that very time machine. In Back to the Future, Marty McFly got the opportunity to hook up with his extremely attractive young mother. ",1
3498,Leonard,14, Those are movies.,1
3499,Sheldon,14, Well of course they‰Ûªre movies. Were you expecting me to come up with an example involving a real life time machine? That‰Ûªs absurd. ,1
3500,Scene,14," The stairwell. It is the previous day, and again Leonard and Sheldon are pulling the time machine up the stairs.",1
3501,Leonard,14," Come on, guys, push. ",1
3502,Howard (off),14, If I push any harder I‰Ûªm going to give birth to my colon. ,1
3503,Penny (coming out of her apartment),14," Oh, hey guys.",1
3504,"Leonard (letting go of time machine, as does Sheldon)",14," Uh, hi Penny. (Raj and Howard are heard to scream as the time machine slides back down the stairs.) Take a break, guys! ",1
3505,Penny,14, What are you doing?,1
3506,Leonard,14," Oh, just, you know, moving a‰Û_ time machine. ",1
3507,Penny,14," Yeah, okay, neat, but I really got to get to work, so‰Û_.",1
3508,Leonard,14," No problem. (Removes glasses, pulls down out of order tape from lift doors, and forces them open.) Hang on. (Takes Penny in his arms as he holds onto the lift cable.)",1
3509,Penny,14," But, what about your time machine.",1
3510,Leonard,14, Some things are more important than toys. (She puts her arms around his neck as he dangles from the cable.),1
3511,Penny,14," Oh, I‰Ûªm scared. ",1
3512,Leonard,14," Don‰Ûªt worry baby, I‰Ûªve got you.",1
3513,Penny,14," Oh, Leonard. (Kisses him as they descend from view. Leonard wakes up still sitting in the time machine.)",1
3514,Sheldon,14, It‰Ûªs still my turn.,1
3515,Scene,14, The living room. ,1
3516,Sheldon,14, What are you doing?,1
3517,Leonard,14, I‰Ûªm packing up all my collectibles and taking them down to the comic book store to sell. ,1
3518,Sheldon,14, Well is that really necessary. If you need money you can always sell blood. And semen. ,1
3519,Leonard,14, It‰Ûªs not about money.,1
3520,Raj (entering),14, We brought food.,1
3521,Howard,14," Lox and bagels, the breakfast of time travellers.",1
3522,Leonard,14," Terrific, does anyone want to buy my share of the time machine?",1
3523,Raj,14, Why?,1
3524,Leonard,14, Because I don‰Ûªt want it any more. ,1
3525,Howard,14, Why?,1
3526,Leonard,14, Just‰Û_ personal reasons. ,1
3527,Sheldon,14, My spidey-sense tells me this has something to do with Penny. ,1
3528,Leonard,14," Look, do you want to buy me out or not?",1
3529,Raj,14," I‰Ûªll give you a hundred dollars, which will make me half owner, and we‰Ûªll put it on my balcony. ",1
3530,Howard,14," Screw his balcony, I‰Ûªll give you a hundred and twenty and we‰Ûªll put it in my garage. ",1
3531,Leonard,14, I paid two hundred dollars for my share.,1
3532,Raj,14," Dude, everyone knows a time machine loses half its value the minute you drive it off the lot.",1
3533,Sheldon,14," I‰Ûªll go for two hundred, that time machine stays right where it is. ",1
3534,Raj,14," Three hundred, and I‰Ûªll throw in my original 1979 Mattel Millenium Falcon with real light speed sound effects. ",1
3535,Leonard,14," No, no more toys or action figures or props or replicas or costumes or robots or Darth Vader voice changers, I‰Ûªm getting rid of all of it. ",1
3536,Howard,14," You can‰Ûªt do that, look what you‰Ûªve created here, it‰Ûªs like nerdvana. ",1
3537,Raj,14," More importantly, you‰Ûªve a Darth Vader voice changer? ",1
3538,Leonard,14, Not for long.,1
3539,Raj,14," Oh, I call dibs on the Golden Age Flash.",1
3540,Howard,14," Hang on, I need that to complete my Justice Society of America collection.",1
3541,Raj,14," Too bad, I called dibs.",1
3542,Howard,14, Well you can‰Ûªt just call dibs.,1
3543,Raj,14," I can and I did, look up dibs on Wikipedia.",1
3544,Sheldon,14, Dibs doesn‰Ûªt apply in a bidding war. ,1
3545,Leonard,14," It‰Ûªs not a bidding war, I‰Ûªm selling it all to Larry down at the comic book store. ",1
3546,Raj,14, Why Larry? Did Larry call dibs? ,1
3547,Howard,14, Will you forget dibs! ,1
3548,Leonard,14, He offered me a fair price for the whole collection.,1
3549,Sheldon,14," What‰Ûªs the number, I‰Ûªll match it. ",1
3550,Raj,14," I‰Ûªll match it, plus a thousand rupees. ",1
3551,Sheldon,14, What‰Ûªs the exchange rate.,1
3552,Raj,14, None of your business. Take it or leave it.,1
3553,Howard (on phone),14," Mom, my bar-mizvah bonds, how much do I got? Thanks. I can go twenty six hundred dollars and two trees in Israel. ",1
3554,Leonard,14," Forget it guys, if I sell to one of you, the other two are going to be really mad at me.",1
3555,Sheldon,14," Who cares, as long as you pick me. ",1
3556,Raj,14," Okay, Leonard, put down the box, let‰Ûªs talk.",1
3557,Leonard,14," Sorry Raj, my mind is made up.",1
3558,Sheldon (moving to block his path),14, No. I can‰Ûªt let you do this. ,1
3559,Leonard,14," Sheldon, get out of my way.",1
3560,Sheldon (brandishing toy sword from Leonard‰Ûªs box),14, None shall pass. ,1
3561,Howard,14," Okay man, be cool, we‰Ûªre all friends here. ",1
3562,Penny (coming out of her flat),14, What the hell‰Ûªs going on? ,1
3563,Sheldon,14, You hypocrite!,1
3564,Penny,14, What?,1
3565,Sheldon,14," Little Miss ‰ÛÏgrown ups don‰Ûªt play with toys‰Û. If I were to go into that apartment right now, would I find Beanie Babies? Are you not an accumulator of Care Bears and My Little Ponies? And who is that Japanese feline I see frolicking on your shorts? Hello,Hello Kitty! ",1
3566,Penny,14," Okay, okay look, if this is about yesterday, Leonard, I am really sorry about what I said, I was just a bit upset.",1
3567,Leonard,14," No, I needed to hear it.",1
3568,Penny,14," No you didn‰Ûªt. Look, you are a great guy, and it is things you love that make you who you are. ",1
3569,Howard,14, I guess that makes me large breasts. ,1
3570,Leonard,14," Still, I think it‰Ûªs time for me to get rid of this stuff and‰Û_ you know‰Û_ move on with my life. ",1
3571,Penny,14, Really?,1
3572,Leonard,14, Yeah.,1
3573,Penny,14, Oh. Wow. Good for you. (Kisses his cheek.),1
3574,Leonard,14," Thanks. Hey, do you want to, I don‰Ûªt know, later‰Û_",1
3575,Good looking man coming up stairs,14," Excuse me. Hey, Penny!",1
3576,Penny,14, Hi Mike.,1
3577,Mike,14, Are you ready to go. ,1
3578,Penny,14," Yeah, I just have to change.",1
3579,Mike,14, I‰Ûªll give you a hand.,1
3580,Penny,14," Oh, stop it! Bye guys. ",1
3581,Leonard (after a long pause),14, My turn on the time machine. ,1
3582,Scene,14," A jungle. As the camera moves, the time machine becomes visible. Sheldon is sitting in it The disk stops spinning, and he looks around. The dials read APR 28 802,701. ",1
3583,Sheldon,14," It worked. It really worked. They said I was mad, but it worked. (Large hairy creatures with glowing eyes emerge from the forest and walk towards him menacingly.) Oh no, not Morlocks! Not flesh-eating Morlocks! He-e-e-e-e-e-e-elp! (With a yelp, he wakes up in the time machine in the living room.) ",1
3584,Leonard,14," Sheldon, are you okay? ",1
3585,Sheldon,14, We have to get rid of the time machine. ,1
3586,Leonard,14," It is a little big for the living room, isn‰Ûªt it?",1
3587,Sheldon,14," Yeah, that‰Ûªs the problem, it‰Ûªs too big. ",1
3588,Leonard,14," I‰Ûªm glad you agree. I hired some guys to help us move it, come on in fellas. (A pair of Morlocks come through the door.)",1
3589,Sheldon,14," Oh no, Morlocks? Eat him, eat him. Aaaaargh. (Sheldon wakes up in his own bed.) Leonard!!!!!!!!",1
3590,Scene,15, A corridor at the University.,1
3591,Leonard,15," On the other hand, some physicists are concerned that if the super collider actually works, it will create a black hole and swallow up the Earth ending life as we know it. ",1
3592,Raj,15," Psh, what a bunch of crybabies. No guts, no glory man. ",1
3593,Leonard (looking at an orange notice on the noticeboard),15," Hey, check it out, the school of pharmacology is looking for volunteers.",1
3594,Raj,15," We are testing a new medication for social anxiety, panic attacks, agoraphobia and obsessive compulsive disorder. Why would they be looking for test subjects here? ",1
3595,Leonard,15," I don‰Ûªt know, Raj. Maybe the comic book store doesn‰Ûªt have a bulletin board. (Sees crowds in the corridor) What‰Ûªs going on?",1
3596,Howard,15, Shhh! Hot girl in Sheldon‰Ûªs office. ,1
3597,Leonard,15, Sheldon‰Ûªs office? Is she lost? ,1
3598,Howard,15, Don‰Ûªt think so. I followed her here from the parking lot. ,1
3599,Leonard,15, Maybe she‰Ûªs his lawyer.,1
3600,Howard,15, Well she‰Ûªs free to examine my briefs.,1
3601,Leonard,15, Howard‰Û_,1
3602,Howard,15," I know, I‰Ûªm disgusting, I should be punished. By her, oh look, I did it again. ",1
3603,Girl,15," Well, that should do it.",1
3604,Sheldon,15, Thank you for coming by. (He rises from his desk. Everyone rushes to look nonchalant.) Hello.,1
3605,Leonard,15," Oh, hey buddy. ",1
3606,Sheldon,15, Buddy.,1
3607,Howard,15," Sorry I‰Ûªm late, I‰Ûªm working on a project that may take me up on the next space shuttle.",1
3608,Sheldon,15," How can you be late, I wasn‰Ûªt expecting you at all. ",1
3609,Howard,15," Nobody ever expects me, sometimes you just look and‰Û_ BAM! (shakes girl‰Ûªs hand) Howard Wolowitz. ",1
3610,Leonard,15," Sheldon, are you going to introduce us? ",1
3611,Sheldon,15," Oh, alright, this is Missy, Missy this is Leonard and Rajesh and you‰Ûªve already met Howard. ",1
3612,Missy,15, It‰Ûªs nice to meet you.,1
3613,Leonard,15," You too, swell, also.",1
3614,Howard,15, Yeah. ,1
3615,Leonard,15," So, how do you two know each other.",1
3616,Missy,15," Oh, he once spent nine months with my legs wrapped around his head. ",1
3617,Leonard,15, Excuse me?,1
3618,Sheldon,15," She‰Ûªs my twin sister, she thinks she‰Ûªs funny but frankly I‰Ûªve never been able to see it.",1
3619,Missy,15," It‰Ûªs because you have no measurable sense of humour, Shelly.",1
3620,Sheldon,15, How exactly would one measure a sense of humour? A humourmometer? ,1
3621,Howard,15," Well, I think you‰Ûªre delightfully droll. Or as the French say, Tres Drole. ",1
3622,Missy,15," Okay, so let me see if I got this. Leonard, Howard and‰Û_ I‰Ûªm sorry what was your name again. (Raj looks uncomfortable, turns and walks away, disappears round corner. He then reappears, takes the orange paper from the noticeboard and leaves again.)",1
3623,Sheldon,15, Rajesh. ,1
3624,Scene,15, The same.,1
3625,Leonard,15," So Missy, what brings you all the way from Texas? ",1
3626,Howard,15," Was it perhaps destiny, I think it was destiny. ",1
3627,Missy,15, My friend‰Ûªs getting married in Disneyland tomorrow night. ,1
3628,Howard,15," Destiny, thy name is Anaheim. ",1
3629,Missy,15, And I had to drop off some papers for Shelly to sign for my dad‰Ûªs estate.,1
3630,Sheldon,15," The papers could have been mailed, Mom just sent you here to spy on me, didn‰Ûªt she.",1
3631,Missy,15, I guess that‰Ûªs why they call you a genius. ,1
3632,Sheldon,15," They call me a genius because I‰Ûªm a genius. Tell Mom that I currently weigh 165 pounds, and that I‰Ûªm having regular bowel movements. Enjoy the wedding, goodbye.",1
3633,Leonard and Howard together,15," Woah, woah. ",1
3634,Leonard,15," If the wedding‰Ûªs not until tomorrow, why don‰Ûªt you stay with us tonight? ",1
3635,Missy,15," Oh, I don‰Ûªt think so. Shelly doesn‰Ûªt like company. Even as a little boy he‰Ûªd send his imaginary friends home at the end of the day. ",1
3636,Sheldon,15," They were not friends, they were imaginary colleagues. ",1
3637,Leonard,15," Look, you‰Ûªre here, we have plenty of room.",1
3638,Sheldon,15, No we don‰Ûªt.,1
3639,Howard,15," Come on, Shelly, she‰Ûªs family.",1
3640,Sheldon,15, So what? I don‰Ûªt issue invitations to your mother.,1
3641,Missy,15, Well it would be nice not to have to drive out to Anaheim in rush hour.,1
3642,Sheldon,15, And don‰Ûªt ever call me Shelly.,1
3643,Leonard,15, So it‰Ûªs settled. You‰Ûªll stay with us.,1
3644,Howard,15," I‰Ûªll walk you to your car. You‰Ûªre in structure 3 level C, right? ",1
3645,Sheldon,15, What just happened?,1
3646,Scene,15, The apartment.,1
3647,Missy,15," So anyway, we‰Ûªre eight years old, and Sheldon converts my easy-bake oven to some kind of high-powered furnace.",1
3648,Leonard,15," Hee-hee, just classic. ",1
3649,Sheldon,15, I needed a place to fire ceramic semi-conductor substrates for home-made integrated circuits. ,1
3650,Missy,15, He was trying to build some kind of armed robot to keep me out of his room.,1
3651,Sheldon,15, Made necessary by her insistence on going into my room.,1
3652,Missy,15," Anyway, I go to make those little corn muffins they give you, there‰Ûªs a big flash, next thing you know my eyebrows are gone.",1
3653,Howard,15," Ha-ha, not your eyebrows? ",1
3654,Missy,15, Yep. I had to go through the entire second grade with crooked eyebrows my Mom drew on.,1
3655,Sheldon,15, Is that what that was? I just assumed that the second grade curriculum had rendered you quizzical. ,1
3656,"Penny (knocking and entering, holding up a pair of superman undershorts.)",15," Hey, Leonard, you left your underwear in the dryer downstairs. ",1
3657,Leonard,15, Those are not mine.,1
3658,Penny,15," Really, they have your little name label in them. ",1
3659,Leonard,15," Yeah, no, I do, I use those‰Û_ uh‰Û_ just to polish up my‰Û_ spear-fishing equipment. I spear fish. When I‰Ûªm not crossbow hunting, I spear fish. Uh, Penny, this is Sheldon‰Ûªs twin sister, Missy. Missy, this is our neighbour Penny.",1
3660,Missy,15, Hi. ,1
3661,Penny,15," Wow, you don‰Ûªt look that much alike.",1
3662,Howard,15, Can I get a hallelujah. ,1
3663,Sheldon,15," Fraternal twins come from two separate eggs, they are no more alike than any other siblings.",1
3664,Howard,15, Hallelujah. ,1
3665,Raj (running in),15," Hey, guess what. I‰Ûªve been accepted as a test subject for a new miracle drug to overcome pathological shyness. ",1
3666,Penny,15," Hey, good for you, Raj.",1
3667,Raj,15," Yes, I‰Ûªm very hopeful. Hello Missy. (He waves his hand. It keeps waving.) They mentioned there may be side effects. ",1
3668,Scene,15," The same, later.",1
3669,Raj,15," So, Missy. Have you ever met a man from the exotic subcontinent of India? ",1
3670,Missy,15," Well, there‰Ûªs Dr Patel at our church. ",1
3671,Raj,15," Ah yes, Dr Patel, good man.",1
3672,Howard,15," Do you like motorcycles, ‰Û÷cos I ride a hog. ",1
3673,Raj,15, A hog? You have a two cylinder scooter with a basket on the front. ,1
3674,Howard,15, You still have to wear a helmet. ,1
3675,Raj,15, Have you ever heard of the Kama Sutra? ,1
3676,Missy,15, The sex book?,1
3677,Raj,15," The Indian sex book. In other words if you wonder wonder who wrote the book of love, it was us.",1
3678,Penny (to Leonard),15," Hey, Sheldon‰Ûªs sister‰Ûªs pretty cute, I w‰Û_.",1
3679,Leonard,15, I wasn‰Ûªt staring! ,1
3680,Penny,15," I didn‰Ûªt say you were, I just said she was cute. ",1
3681,Leonard,15," Oh. Huh, um, maybe, if you like women who are tall‰Û_ and perfect. ",1
3682,Penny,15," Sheldon, why are you ignoring your sister?",1
3683,Sheldon,15, I‰Ûªm not ignoring my sister. I‰Ûªm ignoring all of you. ,1
3684,Leonard,15, I brought snacks.,1
3685,Missy,15, Oh my! Gherkins and‰Û_.,1
3686,Leonard,15," Onion dip, it‰Ûªs onion dip. ",1
3687,Missy,15, Oh.,1
3688,Leonard,15, We don‰Ûªt entertain much. ,1
3689,Raj,15," Missy, do you enjoy pajamas?",1
3690,Missy,15, I guess. ,1
3691,Raj,15, We Indians invented them. You‰Ûªre welcome.,1
3692,Howard,15," Yeah, well my people invented circumcision. You‰Ûªre welcome!",1
3693,Penny,15," Missy, I‰Ûªm going to go get my nails done. Do you want to come?",1
3694,Missy,15, God yes. Thanks.,1
3695,Penny,15, You‰Ûªre welcome. ,1
3696,Missy,15, Bye guys.,1
3697,Howard,15, Bye Missy.,1
3698,Leonard,15," Bye Missy, see you.",1
3699,Penny,15, Goodbye Leonard! ,1
3700,Leonard,15," Uh, yeah, no, uh, bye Penny.",1
3701,Howard,15," Okay, you two have to back off.",1
3702,Raj,15," Why should I back off, you back off dude.",1
3703,Leonard,15," Excuse me, this is my apartment and she‰Ûªs my roommate‰Ûªs sister.",1
3704,Howard,15," So what, you‰Ûªve already got Penny. ",1
3705,Leonard,15, How do I have Penny? In what universe do I have Penny?,1
3706,Howard,15, So I can have Penny?,1
3707,Leonard,15," Hell, no! ",1
3708,Sheldon,15," Excuse me, can I interject something. I‰Ûªm ordering pizza online, is everyone okay with pepperoni? ",1
3709,Leonard,15," Sheldon, can I talk to you in private?",1
3710,Sheldon,15," I guess. Don‰Ûªt worry, I was going to order you cheeseless.",1
3711,Leonard,15, Thank you. ,1
3712,Sheldon,15, That‰Ûªs okay. Lactose intolerance is nothing to be embarrassed about. ,1
3713,Howard,15," I‰Ûªm a fancy Indian man, we invented pajamas! ",1
3714,Raj,15," Hey, look at me, I don‰Ûªt have a foreskin. ",1
3715,Scene,15, Sheldon‰Ûªs bedroom.,1
3716,Leonard,15," Sheldon, are you aware that your sister is an incredibly attractive woman?",1
3717,Sheldon,15," Hmmm? She certainly has the symmetry and low body fat that western culture deems desirable. It‰Ûªs noteworth that at other points in history, heavier women were the standard for beauty because their girth suggested affluence. ",1
3718,Leonard,15," That‰Ûªs fascinating, but I‰Û_",1
3719,Sheldon,15," I didn‰Ûªt say it was fascinating, I said it was noteworthy.",1
3720,Leonard,15," Alright, noted. But my point is that Koothrappali and Wolowitz‰Û_ they‰Ûªre hitting on your sister. ",1
3721,Sheldon,15," Oh. Okay. You know, I don‰Ûªt want to criticise your rhetorical style but, we‰Ûªd be a lot further along in this conversation if you‰Ûªd begun with that thought. ",1
3722,Leonard,15," That‰Ûªs great, but I‰Û_.",1
3723,Sheldon,15, What I‰Ûªm saying is that we took quite an unnecessary detour from what I now understand to be your thesis.,1
3724,Leonard,15, Whatever. You have to do something about it.,1
3725,Sheldon,15, Why?,1
3726,Leonard,15, Because she‰Ûªs your sister. ,1
3727,Sheldon,15," I don‰Ûªt understand. Yes, we shared a uterus for nine months, but since then we‰Ûªve pretty much gone our own separate ways. ",1
3728,Leonard,15," Okay, uh‰Û_. oh, consider this. With your father gone, it is your responsibility to make sure that Missy chooses a suitable mate. ",1
3729,Sheldon,15, I hadn‰Ûªt considered that. We do share DNA.,1
3730,Leonard,15, Uh-huh. ,1
3731,Sheldon,15," So there is the possibility, however remote, that resting in her loins is the potential for another individual as remarkable as myself. ",1
3732,Leonard,15," Exactly. And, you owe it to yourself and to posterity to protect the genetic integrity of your sister‰Ûªs future offspring. ",1
3733,Sheldon,15," You‰Ûªre right. If someone wants to get at Missy‰Ûªs fallopian tubes, they‰Ûªll have to go through me. ",1
3734,Scene,15," The living room. Raj and Howard are on the floor, fighting. ",1
3735,Raj,15," I am Shiva the destroyer, I will have the woman! ",1
3736,Howard,15," I‰Ûªm warning you, I was judo champion at math camp. ",1
3737,Sheldon,15," Alright, that‰Ûªs enough juvenile squabbling, stop it, stop it I say. I‰Ûªm going to settle this right now. Neither of you are good enough for my sister. ",1
3738,Howard,15, Who are you to decide that?,1
3739,Leonard,15," He‰Ûªs the man of his family, you have to respect his wishes.",1
3740,Sheldon,15," You‰Ûªre out too, by the way.",1
3741,Leonard,15, Say what?,1
3742,Sheldon,15," It‰Ûªs nothing personal, I‰Ûªd just prefer if my future niece or nephew didn‰Ûªt become flatulent every time they eat an Eskimo pie. ",1
3743,"Howard (to Raj, who is smiling)",15, What are you so happy about?,1
3744,Raj,15," I‰Ûªm not happy, it‰Ûªs the medication, I can‰Ûªt stop smiling. (Waves hand at mouth. It keeps waving.)",1
3745,Sheldon,15," Now that Leonard‰Ûªs made me aware of how high the genetic stakes are, we have to face the fact that none of you are suitable mates for my sister. ",1
3746,Howard,15, Wait a minute. Leonard made you aware of that? ,1
3747,Leonard,15," We all make mistakes, let‰Ûªs move on. ",1
3748,Raj,15," Excuse me, but I think you‰Ûªre missing a big opportunity here. ",1
3749,Sheldon,15, How so?,1
3750,Raj,15, Everybody knows genetic diversity produces the strongest offspring. Why not put a little mocha in the family latte. ,1
3751,Sheldon,15," In principle you have a point, but as a practical matter, need I remind you that it takes experimental pharmaceuticals to simply enable you to speak to the opposite sex.",1
3752,Raj (waving finger at him),15, I think you‰Ûªre focussing entirely too much on the drugs. (Finger keeps waving. Leonard has to reach out and stop it.),1
3753,Howard,15," Is it ‰Û÷cause I‰Ûªm Jewish, ‰Û÷cause I‰Ûªd kill my Rabbi with a porkchop to be with your sister.",1
3754,Sheldon,15," This has nothing to do with religion. This has to do with the fact that you‰Ûªre a tiny, tiny man who still lives with his mother. ",1
3755,Leonard,15," Sheldon, you are really being unreasonable. ",1
3756,Sheldon,15, Am I? Here. Eat this cheese without farting and you can sleep with my sister. ,1
3757,Missy (who has just entered),15, Oh really? ,1
3758,Sheldon,15, Oops. ,1
3759,Missy,15," Shelly, can I speak to you for a minute? Alone? ",1
3760,Sheldon,15, Why does everyone suddenly want to talk to me alone? Usually nobody wants to be alone with me. åÊåÊ,1
3761,Leonard (to Penny who is standing next to him grinning),15," We all make mistakes, let‰Ûªs move on.",1
3762,Scene,15, Sheldon‰Ûªs bedroom.,1
3763,Missy,15, Okay. I‰Ûªm not even going to ask why you‰Ûªre pimping me out for cheese. But since when do you care at all about who I sleep with? ,1
3764,Sheldon,15," Truthfully, I‰Ûªve never given it any thought, but it has been pointed out to me that you carry DNA of great potential.",1
3765,Missy,15, What on earth are you talking about? ,1
3766,Sheldon,15," Let me explain. You see, I‰Ûªm a superior genetic mutation, an improvement on the existing mediocre stock. ",1
3767,Missy,15," And what do you mean, mediocre stock? ",1
3768,Sheldon,15," That would be you. But residing within you is the potential for another me. Perhaps even taller, smarter and less prone to freckling, a Sheldon 2.0 if you will. ",1
3769,Missy,15, Sheldon 2.0?,1
3770,Sheldon,15," Exactly. Now, I am not saying that I should be the sole decider of who you mate with. If you‰Ûªre not attracted to the suitor then the likelihood of conception would be reduced.",1
3771,Missy,15, You have got to be kidding me! ,1
3772,Sheldon,15, Not at all. Frequent coitus dramatically increases the odds of fertiliziation. ,1
3773,Missy,15," Okay Shelly, sit down. Now I‰Ûªve lived my whole life dealing with the fact that my twin brother is, as Mom puts it, one of God‰Ûªs special little people. ",1
3774,Sheldon,15," I always thought I was more like a cuckoo bird. You know, a superior creature whose egg is placed in the nest of ordinary birds. Of course the newly hatched cuckoo eats all the food, leaving the ordinary siblings to starve to death. Luckily for you, that‰Ûªs where the metaphor ended. ",1
3775,Missy,15," I thought it ended at cuckoo. Now you listen to me, if you want to start acting like a brother who cares about me, then terrific. Bring it on. But you try one time to tell me who I should be sleeping with, and you and I are going to go round and round the way we did when we were little. Remember? (Sheldon hurriedly crosses his legs.) ",1
3776,Sheldon,15, I have an alternate proposal. ,1
3777,Missy,15, Go on.,1
3778,Sheldon,15," You donate eggs. We will place them in cryogenic storage. I will find an appropriate sperm donor for your eggs, have them fertilized and implanted in you, that way everybody wins. ",1
3779,Scene,15," The living room. Sheldon enters limping, holding his groin area. ",1
3780,Sheldon,15, Correction. Missy can date whoever she wants. ,1
3781,Scene,15," The same, later. ",1
3782,Howard,15," Look, we have to settle this.",1
3783,Leonard,15, I agree. Sheldon‰Ûªs sister is hiding at Penny‰Ûªs because we‰Ûªve all been hitting on her at the same time. ,1
3784,Raj,15," She‰Ûªs not hiding. She needed privacy to call her grandmother who‰Ûªs apparently very sick. Oh, and then I believe she has to wash her hair. ",1
3785,Howard,15," Oh, you poor, deluded bastard. ",1
3786,Raj,15, Don‰Ûªt start with me dude.,1
3787,Howard,15, You want to go again? Let‰Ûªs go. ,1
3788,Leonard,15, Sit down.,1
3789,Howard,15, Okay. ,1
3790,Leonard,15," If we‰Ûªre going to fight over Missy, let‰Ûªs do it the right way. The honourable way.",1
3791,Leonard,15, And he‰Ûªs down!,1
3792,Howard,15," Come on, come on, get up. ",1
3793,Leonard,15," Stay down, bitch. Yeah, ha ha, natural selection at work.",1
3794,Sheldon,15, I weep for humanity. ,1
3795,Leonard,15, Excuse me while I go tell Missy the good news. (Leaves and knocks on Penny‰Ûªs door.),1
3796,Penny (answering),15," Ah, hey Leonard.",1
3797,Leonard,15," Hi Penny, how‰Ûªs it going. Listen, that guy Mike that you were dating, is that still going on?",1
3798,Penny,15," Uh, pretty much, why?",1
3799,Leonard,15," Nothing, just catching up. By the way, may I speak to Missy please? ",1
3800,Penny,15, Of course.,1
3801,Missy,15," Hi, Leonard, what‰Ûªs up?",1
3802,Leonard,15," Well, since you‰Ûªre leaving tomorrow I was wondering if you‰Ûªd like to go out to dinner with me?",1
3803,Missy,15, That‰Ûªs so sweet. But no thanks.,1
3804,Leonard,15," Oh. You have other plans, or‰Û_?",1
3805,Missy,15, No.,1
3806,Leonard,15, Oh. Alright uh‰Û_ enjoy the rest of your evening.,1
3807,Missy,15, Thanks. See you.,1
3808,Leonard (returning),15," Um, here‰Ûªs something we didn‰Ûªt anticipate. ",1
3809,Penny,15," What do you want, Howard?",1
3810,Howard,15," I‰Ûªm fine, thanks for asking. I‰Ûªve come to call on Missy. ",1
3811,Penny,15, Missy?,1
3812,Missy,15, Hi Howard.,1
3813,Howard,15, The amazing Howard. Do you like magic?,1
3814,Missy,15, Not really. No.,1
3815,Howard,15," Then you are in for a treat. Behold, an ordinary cane. (Taps against doorpost. While humming he tries to perform a trick, but the cane falls in half with a yellow handkerchief flying out. Howard has to retrieve the pieces.) Da-dah! (Emerges with the handkerchief, on which are written the words ‰ÛÏwill you go out with me?‰Û)",1
3816,Missy,15, No.,1
3817,Howard,15," Okay. (Does something with hands, from which another yellow handkerchief emerges. This one reads ‰ÛÏare you sure?‰Û Missy closes the door.)",1
3818,Penny,15, Missy?,1
3819,Raj,15, Thank you. I apprec‰Û_. (looks panicked) apprec‰Û_. appreeee‰Û_. oh-oh.,1
3820,Penny,15," Oh, honey, is your medication wearing off?åÊ (Raj nods.)",1
3821,Missy,15," Oh, hi, cutie pie. I was hoping you‰Ûªd show up. ",1
3822,Missy,15, We had a dog who made a noise like that. Had to put him down. ,1
3823,Scene,15, The stairwell. Missy and Sheldon are descending. ,1
3824,Missy,15, Any news you want me to pass along to Mom?,1
3825,Sheldon,15," Well, she might be interested to know that I have refocused my research from bosonic string theory to heteronic string theory. ",1
3826,Missy,15," Yeah, I‰Ûªll just tell her you said hey.",1
3827,Sheldon,15," Okay, well, it was pleasant seeing you, other than that business with my testicles. (Holds out hand to shake.)",1
3828,Missy,15," Come on, Shelly. (Hugs him. He looks uncomfortable, then hugs back half heartedly.) I want you to know I‰Ûªm very proud of you.",1
3829,Sheldon,15, Really?,1
3830,Missy,15," Yup, I‰Ûªm always bragging to my friends about my brother the rocket scientist. ",1
3831,Sheldon,15, You tell people I‰Ûªm a rocket scientist?,1
3832,Missy,15, Well yeah.,1
3833,Sheldon,15, I‰Ûªm a theoretical physicist.,1
3834,Missy,15, What‰Ûªs the difference?,1
3835,Sheldon,15, What‰Ûªs the difference?,1
3836,Missy,15, Goodbye Shelly.,1
3837,Sheldon,15," My God! Why don‰Ûªt you just tell them I‰Ûªm a toll taker at the Golden Gate Bridge? Rocket scientist, how humiliating. ",1
3838,Scene,16," The Cheesecake Factory. Raj and Sheldon are arm wrestling while playing tetris. There is a cacophony of cries such as ‰ÛÏtake him down‰Û and ‰ÛÏhe‰Ûªs got you, Sheldon.‰Û",1
3839,Penny,16," Hey, guys, guys, some of the other waitresses wanted me to ask you something.",1
3840,Leonard,16," Oh, it‰Ûªs called trestling.",1
3841,Howard,16, It combines the physical strength of arm wrestling with the mental agility of tetris into the ultimate sport. ,1
3842,Penny,16," Yeah, that‰Ûªs terrific, but what they wanted me to ask you was to cut it the hell out. (To someone off) Right come on guys, come on. (Singing while approaching another table) Happy birthday to you, happy birthday to you‰Û_",1
3843,Sheldon,16," We might as well stop, it‰Ûªs a stalemate. You‰Ûªre beating me in tetris, but you‰Ûªve got the upper body strength of a Keebler Elf.",1
3844,Raj,16," Keebler Elf? I‰Ûªve got your Keebler Elf right here. (Strains to push Sheldon‰Ûªs arm down. Tries using both hands, still with no effect.) Okay, it‰Ûªs a stalemate. ",1
3845,Penny,16," So Leonard, will we be seeing you on Saturday for your free birthday cheesecake?",1
3846,Sheldon,16," He can‰Ûªt eat cheesecake, he‰Ûªs lactose intolerant. ",1
3847,Penny,16," Okay, he can have carrot cake.",1
3848,Sheldon,16, What about the cream cheese frosting.,1
3849,Penny,16, he can scrape it off. ,1
3850,Leonard,16," Forget about the cake, how did you know that my birthday is Saturday? ",1
3851,Penny,16," I did your horoscope, remember, I was going to do everybody‰Ûªs until Sheldon went on one of his typical psychotic rants.",1
3852,Sheldon,16," For the record, that psychotic rant was a concise summation of the research of Bertram Forer, who in 1948 proved conclusively through meticulously designed experiments, that astrology is nothing but pseudo scientific hokum. ",1
3853,Penny,16," Blah blah blah, a typical Taurus. So, seriously, are we going to see you Saturday?",1
3854,Leonard,16," Oh, I don‰Ûªt think so.",1
3855,Penny,16, Why not?,1
3856,Leonard,16, I don‰Ûªt celebrate my birthday.,1
3857,Penny,16," Shuddup, yeah you do. ",1
3858,Leonard,16," No, it‰Ûªs no big deal, it‰Ûªs just the way I was raised. My parents focussed on celebrating achievements, and being expelled from a birth canal was not considered one of them.",1
3859,Penny,16," Uh, that‰Ûªs so silly.",1
3860,Sheldon,16," It‰Ûªs actually based on very sound theories, his mother published a paper on it. ",1
3861,Penny,16," What was it called, ‰ÛÏI hate my son and that‰Ûªs why he can‰Ûªt have cake?‰Û ",1
3862,Sheldon,16," It was obviously effective, Leonard grew up to be an experimental physicist. Perhaps if she‰Ûªd also denied him Christmas he‰Ûªd be a little better at it. ",1
3863,Leonard,16, Thank you.,1
3864,Howard,16," Well I love birthdays, waking up to Mom‰Ûªs special French Toast breakfast, wearing the birthday king crown, playing laser tag with all my friends.",1
3865,Penny,16," Yeah, see, that‰Ûªs what kids should have. ",1
3866,Howard,16, Actually that was last year. ,1
3867,Penny,16, So you‰Ûªve really never had a birthday party? ,1
3868,Leonard,16," No. But it was okay. I mean, when I was little I‰Ûªd think maybe my parents would change their mind, and surprise me with a party, like this one birthday I came home from my Cello lesson, and I saw a lot of strange cars parked out front, and when I got to the door I could hear people whispering, and I could smell German chocolate cake, which is my favourite.",1
3869,Penny,16, And?,1
3870,Leonard,16," Uh, it turns out my grandfather had died. åÊ",1
3871,Penny,16," Oh my God, that‰Ûªs terrible. ",1
3872,Leonard,16," Oh, it was kind of like a birthday party. I got to see all my cousins and there was cake, so‰Û_7",1
3873,Penny,16, That‰Ûªs the saddest thing I‰Ûªve ever heard. ,1
3874,Howard,16," You think? Go ahead, tell her about your senior prom. ",1
3875,Scene,16, Leonard is exiting the apartment. ,1
3876,Howard (voice from inside),16, Make sure they remember no peanuts.,1
3877,Leonard,16," Howard, every Thai restaurant in town knows you can‰Ûªt eat peanuts. They see me coming they go ‰ÛÏah, no peanut boy!‰Û",1
3878,Sheldon (answering),16, Hello Penny. Leonard just left.,1
3879,Penny,16, I know. I want to talk to you. ,1
3880,Sheldon,16," What would we talk about? We‰Ûªve no overlapping areas of interest I‰Ûªm aware of, and you know I don‰Ûªt care for chit-chat. ",1
3881,Penny,16," Okay, can you just let me in.",1
3882,Sheldon,16," Well alright, but I don‰Ûªt see this as a promising endeavour.",1
3883,Penny,16," Okay, here‰Ûªs the deal, we are going to throw Leonard a kick-ass surprise party for his birthday on Saturday.",1
3884,Sheldon,16," I hardly think so, Leonard made it very clear he doesn‰Ûªt want a party.",1
3885,Howard,16, Did someone say party? ,1
3886,Penny,16, He just doesn‰Ûªt know he wants one because he‰Ûªs never had one. ,1
3887,Howard,16," I suppose that‰Ûªs possible, but for the record, I‰Ûªve never had a threesome and yet I still know I want one.",1
3888,Penny,16," Howard, here‰Ûªs the difference. The possibility exists that Leonard could have a birthday party before hell freezes over. ",1
3889,Howard,16," Fine. If I do have a threesome, you can‰Ûªt be part of it. I‰Ûªm just kidding, yes you can. Can you bring a friend? ",1
3890,Sheldon,16, I think a birthday party is a terrible idea. I envy Leonard for growing up without that anguish. ,1
3891,Penny,16, Anguish?,1
3892,Sheldon,16," Year after year, I had to endure wearing conical hats while being forced into the crowded sweaty hell of bouncy castles, not to mention being blindfolded and spun towards a grotesque tailless donkey as the other children mocked my disorientation. ",1
3893,Penny,16," Okay, sweetie, I understand you have scars that no non-professional can heal, but nevertheless we are going to throw Leonard a birthday party. ",1
3894,Sheldon,16," Have I pointed out that I am extremely uncomfortable with dancing, loud music and most other forms of alcohol induced frivolity. ",1
3895,Penny,16, Nevertheless we are‰Û_.,1
3896,Sheldon,16, In addition I really don‰Ûªt think that Leonard wants a‰Û_,1
3897,Penny,16," Okay, here‰Ûªs the deal, you either help me throw Leonard a birthday party or, so help me God, I will go into your bedroom and I will unbag all of your most valuable mint condition comic books. And on one of them, you won‰Ûªt know which, I‰Ûªll draw a tiny happy face in ink. ",1
3898,Sheldon,16," You can‰Ûªt do that, if you make a mark on a mint comic book it‰Ûªs no longer mint.",1
3899,Penny,16," Sheldon, do you understand the concept of blackmail?",1
3900,Sheldon,16," Well of course I‰Û_ oh! Yeah, I have an idea, let‰Ûªs throw Leonard a kick ass birthday party.",1
3901,Scene,16," Howard and Raj sneak up the stairwell carrying presents. Howard knocks on Penny‰Ûªs door, a combination of two knocks, two knocks, one knock. Nothing happens. He tries again. Sheldon opens the door. ",1
3902,Sheldon,16," That‰Ûªs not the secret knock. This is the secret knock. (He knocks two, one, two.)",1
3903,Howard,16, What difference does it make?,1
3904,Sheldon,16, The whole point of a secret knock is to establish a non-verbal signal to verify the identity of one‰Ûªs co-conspirators. ,1
3905,Penny,16, Is that Raj and Howard?,1
3906,Howard,16, Can you just let us in.,1
3907,Sheldon,16, Luckily for you this is not a nuclear reactor. ,1
3908,Penny,16," So, what did you get the birthday boy?",1
3909,Howard,16," Well, Raj got him an awesome limited edition Dark Knight sculpture based on Alex Ross‰Ûªs definitive Batman, and I got him this amazing autographed copy of the Feynman lectures on physics.",1
3910,Penny,16, Nice. I got him a sweater. ,1
3911,Howard,16," Okay, well, he might like that, I‰Ûªve seen him‰Û_ chilly. ",1
3912,Penny,16," Uh, Sheldon, I didn‰Ûªt see your present.",1
3913,Sheldon,16, That‰Ûªs because I didn‰Ûªt bring one.,1
3914,Penny,16, Well why not? ,1
3915,Howard,16, Don‰Ûªt ask.,1
3916,Sheldon,16, The entire institution of gift giving makes no sense.,1
3917,Howard,16, Too late.,1
3918,Sheldon,16," Let‰Ûªs say that I go out and I spend fifty dollars on you, it‰Ûªs a laborious activity, because I have to imagine what you need, whereas you know what you need. Now I can simplify things, just give you the fifty dollars directly and, you could give me fifty dollars on my birthday, and so on until one of us dies leaving the other one old and fifty dollars richer. And I ask you, is it worth it? ",1
3919,Howard,16, Told you not to ask. ,1
3920,Penny,16," Well, Sheldon, you‰Ûªre his friend. Friends give each other presents.",1
3921,Sheldon,16," I accept your premise, I reject your conclusion.",1
3922,Howard,16, Try telling him it‰Ûªs a non-optional social convention. ,1
3923,Penny,16, What?,1
3924,Howard,16, Just do it. ,1
3925,Penny,16, It‰Ûªs a non-optional social convention.,1
3926,Sheldon,16, Oh. Fair enough. ,1
3927,Howard,16, He came with a manual. ,1
3928,Sheldon,16," Question, how am I going to get Leonard a present before the party? I don‰Ûªt drive, and the only things available within walking distance are a Thai restaurant and a gas station. I suppose I could wrap up an order of mee krob and a couple of lottery scratchers. ",1
3929,Penny,16," Okay, let‰Ûªs do this, um, I will drive Sheldon to get a present, and Howard, you need to get rid of Leonard for about two hours. ",1
3930,Howard,16, No problem.,1
3931,Penny,16," And then Raj, you bring the stuff across the hall and start setting up.",1
3932,Howard (after Raj whispers in his ear),16, What if guests show up?,1
3933,Penny,16, Entertain them.,1
3934,Howard,16, What if they‰Ûªre women?,1
3935,Penny,16, Stare at them and make them feel uncomfortable. ,1
3936,Scene,16, The apartment. Leonard is playing an X-Box game. ,1
3937,Howard (entering),16, Hey!,1
3938,Leonard,16, Hey. ,1
3939,Howard,16, How‰Ûªs it going?,1
3940,Leonard,16, Fine. ,1
3941,Howard,16," So, listen, the New Art is showing the revised definitive cut of Blade Runner.",1
3942,Leonard,16, Seen it.,1
3943,Howard,16," No, you‰Ûªve seen the 25th anniversary final cut. This one has eight seconds of previously unseen footage. They say it completely changes the tone of the film. ",1
3944,Leonard,16, Oh. Pass. ,1
3945,Howard,16," Come on, afterwards there‰Ûªs a Q & A with Harrison Ford‰Ûªs body double. ",1
3946,Leonard,16," Look, I am in the Halo battle of my life here, there‰Ûªs this kid in Copenhagen, he has no immune system so all he does is sit in his bubble and play Halo 24/7.",1
3947,Howard,16, Can‰Ûªt you play him some other time?,1
3948,Leonard,16, Not if you believe his doctors. ,1
3949,Howard,16," Oh my God, do you smell gas.",1
3950,Leonard,16, No.,1
3951,Howard,16," Yeah, no. ",1
3952,Scene,16, An electrical store.,1
3953,Penny,16," Alright, you know they have DVDs over there.",1
3954,Sheldon,16," Yes, but they have DVD burners over here. Leonard needs a DVD burner. ",1
3955,Penny,16," Sheldon, a gift shouldn‰Ûªt be something someone needs, it should be something fun, you know, something they wouldn‰Ûªt buy for themselves.",1
3956,Sheldon,16," You mean, like a sweater? ",1
3957,Penny,16," Well, it‰Ûªs a fun sweater, it‰Ûªs got a bold geometric print. ",1
3958,Sheldon,16, Is it the geometry that makes it fun.,1
3959,Penny,16," Okay, the point is, one of the ways we show we care about people is by putting thought and imagination into the gifts we give them. ",1
3960,Sheldon,16," Okay, I see, so not a DVD burner.",1
3961,Penny,16, Exactly.,1
3962,Sheldon,16," Something he wouldn‰Ûªt buy for himself. Something fun. Something like‰Û_ oh, an 802.11n wireless router. ",1
3963,Scene,16, The apartment.,1
3964,Leonard,16," Here you go, Copenhagen boy, how about a taste of Hans Christian Hand Grenade. (Raj enters carrying party supplies. Howard waves him away while in the background Leonard is heard saying ‰ÛÏoh, that did not feel good.‰Û) Come on, come on, oh you clever little‰Û_. Come on, come on, take that! ",1
3965,"Howard (picks up a granola bar from the table, breaks off half and puts it in his back pocket.)",16, Oh-oh. (Louder) Oh-oh! ,1
3966,Leonard,16, What‰Ûªs the matter?,1
3967,Howard,16," This granola bar, there‰Ûªs peanuts in it.",1
3968,Leonard,16," Oh my God, why did you eat it?",1
3969,Howard,16," I don‰Ûªt know, it was just there.",1
3970,Leonard,16," Well if I had a gun there, would you have shot yourself? ",1
3971,Howard,16," Don‰Ûªt yell at me, I‰Ûªve got to go to the emergency room. ",1
3972,Leonard,16, Now?,1
3973,Howard,16," No, after my tongue has swollen to the size of a brisket. ",1
3974,Leonard,16," Alright, um, just, uh, let me get my keys.",1
3975,Howard,16," Oh God, oh God, oh God, oh‰Û_. (into phone after Leonard leaves room) The laundry is out of the hamper. (Looks exasperated) Okay Sheldon, what was it supposed to be? Fine, it‰Ûªs out of the washer. I‰Ûªll call you when it‰Ûªs in the dryer. ",1
3976,Leonard (running in),16," Alright, let‰Ûªs go. (They exit, with Howard making croaking noises.) ",1
3977,Scene,16, The store. Sheldon is looking at two routers.,1
3978,Sheldon,16, What do you think.,1
3979,Penny (pointing randomly),16," Um, that one. ",1
3980,Sheldon,16, Because of the two additional Ethernet ports.,1
3981,Penny,16, Sure.,1
3982,Sheldon,16," He doesn‰Ûªt need them, he‰Ûªs already got a 640 connect switch ",1
3983,Penny,16," Oh, okay then this one. ",1
3984,Sheldon,16, Why? ,1
3985,Penny,16," I don‰Ûªt know, the man on the box looks so happy. ",1
3986,Sheldon,16," Penny! If I‰Ûªm going to buy Leonard a gift, I‰Ûªm going to do it right. I refuse to let him experience the same childhood trauma I did. ",1
3987,Penny,16," Oh, I know I‰Ûªm going to regret this but, what trauma? ",1
3988,Sheldon,16," On my twelfth birthday I really wanted a titanium centrifuge, so, you know, I could separate radioactive isotopes. ",1
3989,Penny,16, Of course.,1
3990,Sheldon,16," Instead of a titanium centrifuge, my parents bought me‰Û_ wow, this is hard. They got me‰Û_ a motorised dirt bike. ",1
3991,Penny,16, No? ,1
3992,Sheldon,16, What twelve year old boy wants a motorised dirt bike? ,1
3993,Penny,16, All of them.,1
3994,Sheldon,16, Really?,1
3995,Penny,16, Yeah.,1
3996,Sheldon,16, Huh? ,1
3997,Penny,16," Okay, so we‰Ûªre getting this one?",1
3998,Sheldon,16," Yeah, I suppose. ",1
3999,Penny,16," Okay, let‰Ûªs go.",1
4000,Random woman,16," Excuse me, do you know anything about this stuff? ",1
4001,Sheldon,16, I know everything about this stuff.,1
4002,Woman,16," Okay, I have my own wholesale flower business, and I want to hook up my computer in the front entrance with the one in my refrigerated warehouse. ",1
4003,Penny,16," Here, buy this one. Look, it‰Ûªs the one we‰Ûªre getting, see, happy guy available. ",1
4004,Sheldon,16," No, no, no, no, she doesn‰Ûªt want that, she needs a point to point peer network with a range extender.",1
4005,Woman,16, Thank you. ,1
4006,Random guy,16," Which hard drive do I want, firewire or USB?",1
4007,Sheldon,16, It depends on what Bus you have.,1
4008,Guy,16, I drive a Chevy Cavalier.,1
4009,Sheldon,16," Oh, dear lord.",1
4010,Penny,16," Sheldon, we have to go.",1
4011,Sheldon,16," Not now, Penny, this poor man needs me. (To woman approaching) You hold on, I‰Ûªll be right with you. What computer do you have, and please don‰Ûªt say a white one?",1
4012,Scene,16, The hospital. Howard runs in and up to the counter.,1
4013,Howard,16, Excuse me.,1
4014,Nurse,16," Fill this out, have a seat. ",1
4015,Howard,16," No, listen, see we‰Ûªre throwing my friend a surprise party and I‰Ûªm supposed to keep him out of his apartment for two hours.",1
4016,Nurse,16," Uh-huh, fill this out and have a seat. ",1
4017,Howard,16," No, see, the only way I could get him to leave is to tell him I ate a peanut. Because I‰Ûªm allergic to peanuts. ",1
4018,Nurse,16," Oh, well in that case fill this out and have a seat. ",1
4019,Howard,16," Look, all I need from you is to take me in the back and give me a band-aid so I can pretend I had a shot of epinephrine and they you tell my friend you need to keep me under observation for about an hour, hour and a half. ",1
4020,Nurse,16, Is that all you need?,1
4021,Howard,16, Yes.,1
4022,Nurse,16, Get out of my ER. ,1
4023,Howard,16," No, you don‰Ûªt understand.",1
4024,Nurse,16," Oh, I understand, but unfortunately this hospital is not equipped to treat stupid. ",1
4025,Howard,16," Okay, I get it, I know how the world works, how about if I were to introduce you (holding up a five dollar bill) to the man who freed your people. ",1
4026,Leonard (running in),16," Hey, sorry I couldn‰Ûªt find a parking spot, how are you doing.",1
4027,Howard,16," Bad, very bad. ",1
4028,Leonard,16," Really, ‰Û÷cos you don‰Ûªt look like you‰Ûªre swelling up at all, maybe we should just pick up some benedryl at the drug store and go home. ",1
4029,Howard,16, We can‰Ûªt go home. ,1
4030,Leonard,16, Why not?,1
4031,Howard,16," Becauth (pretends tongue has swollen up) Becauth-th-th. Brissket, Brissket! Water, need water. ",1
4032,Leonard,16," Alright, I‰Ûªll be right back. ",1
4033,Howard (into phone),16," Penny, look, I‰Ûªve got a problem.",1
4034,Penny (with Sheldon in background at the head of a large queue of customers),16," Yeah, well so do I, look you‰Ûªve got to stall Leonard a little longer.",1
4035,Howard,16, I don‰Ûªt think I can. ,1
4036,Penny,16," You have to, we all have to be there at the same time to yell ‰ÛÏsurprise!‰Û ",1
4037,Howard,16," Okay, you have to understand something, we‰Ûªre in a hospital right now. ",1
4038,Penny,16," Why, is Leonard okay.",1
4039,Howard,16," Leonard‰Ûªs fine. I‰Ûªm fine, thanks for asking, by the way. ",1
4040,Penny,16," Okay, I don‰Ûªt need your attitude, just hold him there a little longer. ",1
4041,Howard,16," Look, I‰Ûªve done my best but he wants to go home and I don‰Ûªt know how to stop him. ",1
4042,Penny,16," Okay, how about this. You keep him there a little longer and when you get to the party I‰Ûªll point out which of my friends are easy. ",1
4043,Howard,16," Don‰Ûªt toy with me, woman. ",1
4044,Penny,16," I‰Ûªve got a hot former fat girl with no self-esteem, I‰Ûªve got a girl who punishes her father by sleeping around and an alcoholic who‰Ûªs two tequila shots away from letting you wear her like a hat. ",1
4045,Howard,16," Thy will be done. (Thinks. Reaches into back pocket, finds the half a granola bar from earlier. Looks down.) I‰Ûªm doing this for you, little buddy. (Takes a bite.)",1
4046,Scene,16, The store. Sheldon is on the in-store computer. ,1
4047,Sheldon,16," Okay, we don‰Ûªt have that in stock, but I can special order it for you.",1
4048,"Penny (with shop assistant, points at Sheldon)",16, Him.,1
4049,Assistant,16," Excuse me, sir, you don‰Ûªt work here. ",1
4050,Sheldon,16," Yes, well, apparently neither does anyone else. ",1
4051,Penny,16," Sheldon, we have to go.",1
4052,Sheldon,16, Why? ,1
4053,Penny,16," Well, for one thing, we‰Ûªre late for Leonard‰Ûªs birthday party. And for another, I told him to call security. ",1
4054,Sheldon (to customer),16," Good luck. (To assistant) By the way, a six year-old could hack your computer system. ",1
4055,Penny,16, Keep walking.,1
4056,Sheldon,16," Yeah, 1-2-3-4 is not a secure password. ",1
4057,Scene,16, The hospital.,1
4058,Leonard,16," Excuse me, my friend is having an allergic reaction to peanuts.",1
4059,Nurse,16, No he‰Ûªs not.,1
4060,Leonard,16, Yes he is.,1
4061,Nurse,16," Look, sir we are very busy here and I just don‰Ûªt‰Û_ (sees Leonard whose face has swollen all over) holy crap! ",1
4062,Howard,16, Pees hep me! ,1
4063,Nurse,16," Code 4, I need a gurney, right away, right away.",1
4064,Howard,16, Fank-u. ,1
4065,Scene,16, The stairwell. ,1
4066,Leonard,16," Say what you will about the healthcare system in this country, but when they‰Ûªre afraid of lawsuits they sure test everything. ",1
4067,Howard,16, I really don‰Ûªt think the colonoscopy was necessary. ,1
4068,Leonard,16," You know, before you got all swollen up, I actually thought you were trying to keep me out of the apartment so you could throw me a surprise party. ",1
4069,Howard,16," Oh, right, it‰Ûªs your birthday, I had no idea it was your birthday, I completely forgot, wow, what a lousy way to spend a birthday, well it‰Ûªs all over now.",1
4070,Leonard,16," There is a party, isn‰Ûªt there.",1
4071,Howard,16, Maybe.,1
4072,Leonard,16, Howard. ,1
4073,Howard,16, Are you mad?,1
4074,Leonard,16, how could I be mad? You actually risked your life because you cared about me.,1
4075,Howard,16," Yeah, that‰Ûªs why I did it. ",1
4076,Leonard,16, Alright. Here we go. My first birthday party. ,1
4077,Raj,16, Dude! Everybody left an hour ago! Surprise! ,1
4078,Raj,16," Okay Leonard, here I am at your birthday party, I don‰Ûªt know where you are dude, but it‰Ûªs really kick-ass. Everyone is very very drunk, and uh‰Û_ (girl pours booze into his mouth) Oh look, there‰Ûªs a girl taking her shirt off. ",1
4079,Penny,16," That‰Ûªs my friend Carol. Remind me, I‰Ûªve got to introduce her to Howard. ",1
4080,Raj,16," Oh sweet Krishna, shake it, that-a rupee maker.",1
4081,Penny,16, I‰Ûªm so sorry you didn‰Ûªt get your party.,1
4082,Leonard,16," Oh, it‰Ûªs okay.",1
4083,Penny,16, Happy birthday anyways. (She kisses him full on the lips.),1
4084,Leonard,16," Hey Penny, when, uh, when‰Ûªs your birthday?",1
4085,Scene,17, The apartment living room,1
4086,Sheldon,17, Wo de zhing shi Sheldon.,1
4087,Howard,17," No, it‰Ûªs Wo de ming zi shi Sheldon. (Makes a hand movement with every syllable.)",1
4088,Sheldon,17, Wo de ming zi shi Sheldon. (Copies hand movements.),1
4089,Howard,17, What‰Ûªs this? (Repeats hand movements.),1
4090,Sheldon,17, That‰Ûªs what you did. I assumed as in a number of languages that the gesture was part of the phrase.,1
4091,Howard,17, Well it‰Ûªs not.,1
4092,Sheldon,17, How am I supposed to know that? As the teacher it‰Ûªs your obligation to separate your personal idiosyncrasies from the subject matter. ,1
4093,Howard,17," You know, I‰Ûªm really glad you decided to learn Mandarin.",1
4094,Sheldon,17, Why?,1
4095,Howard,17, Once you‰Ûªre fluent you‰Ûªll have a billion more people to annoy instead of me. ,1
4096,Leonard (entering),17, Hey! ,1
4097,Sheldon,17, Mai du lui tsa.,1
4098,Howard,17, You just called Leonard a syphilitic donkey. ,1
4099,Sheldon,17," My apologies Leonard, I‰Ûªm only as good as my teacher. ",1
4100,Leonard,17, Why are you learning Chinese?,1
4101,Sheldon,17, I believe the Szechuan Palace has been passing off orange chicken as tangerine chicken and I intend to confront them. ,1
4102,Leonard,17," If I were you, I‰Ûªd be more concerned by what they‰Ûªre passing off as chicken. ",1
4103,Penny (storming in),17, I need to use your window.,1
4104,Leonard,17," Oh, yeah, no, sure, go ahead. ",1
4105,Penny (opening window),17," Hey Jerkface, you forgot your iPod! (Throws it out.)",1
4106,Leonard,17, What‰Ûªs going on?,1
4107,Penny,17," Oh, I‰Ûªll tell you what‰Ûªs going on, that stupid self-centred bastard wrote about our sex life in his blog. (Out of window) Drop dead, you stupid self-centred bastard! (To Leonard) Thank you. (exit)",1
4108,Sheldon,17," Okay, where were we? ",1
4109,Howard,17," Not now, I have a blog to find. ",1
4110,Scene,17, Leonard approaches Penny‰Ûªs door and knocks. ,1
4111,Leonard,17," Penny, are you okay?",1
4112,Penny (voice off),17," I‰Ûªm fine, Leonard, just go away.",1
4113,Leonard,17," Look, I understand that breaking up with someone can be very painful‰Û_.",1
4114,Penny,17, GO AWAY!,1
4115,Leonard,17," Okay, feel better, bye. (Goes back to apartment) She doesn‰Ûªt want to talk. ",1
4116,Sheldon,17," Not surprising. Penny‰Ûªs emotional responses originate from the primitive portion of the brain known as the Amygdala, while speech is centred in the much more recently developed Neocortex. The former can easily overpower the latter giving scientific credence to the notion of being rendered speechless. (Leonard stares at him.) Or maybe she just doesn‰Ûªt want to talk. ",1
4117,Raj (entering),17," Hey, look, I found an iPod. ",1
4118,Howard,17," It‰Ûªs smashed beyond repair, what are you going to do with it?",1
4119,Raj,17, What else? Sell it on ebay as slightly used. ,1
4120,Leonard,17," It was Penny‰Ûªs boyfriend‰Ûªs, they broke up.",1
4121,Howard,17," Apparently he posted intimate details of their physical relationship on his blog, which I cannot find anywhere. ",1
4122,Leonard,17," You know what, I‰Ûªm going to go back and try talking to her again.",1
4123,Howard,17," Good idea. Sit with her, hold her, comfort her, and if the moment feels right, see if you can cop a feel. ",1
4124,Leonard,17," I‰Ûªm not going to do that, Howard.",1
4125,Sheldon,17, I‰Ûªm not aware of any social convention that requires you to intervene at all.,1
4126,Leonard,17, What about ‰ÛÏdamsel in distress?‰Û,1
4127,Sheldon,17," Twelfth century code of chivalry, not exactly current. You‰Ûªd also have to be knighted for that to apply. ",1
4128,Leonard,17," I don‰Ûªt care. She‰Ûªs upset, I‰Ûªm going over there. ",1
4129,Howard,17, Remember to sit on your hands a bit so they‰Ûªre warm. ,1
4130,Leonard,17," I‰Ûªm her friend, I‰Ûªm not going to take advantage of her vulnerability.",1
4131,Howard,17," What, so you‰Ûªre saying that if in the depths of despair she throws herself at you and demands you take her, right there, right now, you‰Ûªll just walk away?",1
4132,Leonard,17, I said I‰Ûªm her friend. Not her gay friend. ,1
4133,Scene,17, Penny‰Ûªs flat. Penny is eating ice cream from the tub. ,1
4134,Leonard (knocking and entering),17," Hey, listen, I know you said that you didn‰Ûªt want to talk‰Û_",1
4135,Penny,17, I don‰Ûªt. ,1
4136,Leonard (leaving),17, Sorry.,1
4137,Penny,17, Wait. ,1
4138,Leonard,17," Wait, did you say wait?",1
4139,Penny,17, Tell me the truth. Am I just an idiot who picks giant losers? ,1
4140,Leonard,17, No. No. ,1
4141,Penny,17," Okay, so I pick good guys, but turn them into losers. ",1
4142,Leonard,17, Of course not.,1
4143,Penny,17," Well, it‰Ûªs got to be one or the other, which is it?",1
4144,Leonard,17," I‰Ûªm sorry, what were the choices again? ",1
4145,Penny,17," I really thought Mike was different, I thought he was sensitive and smart. I mean, not you smart, normal non-freaky smart. ",1
4146,Leonard,17," Yeah, no, sure.",1
4147,Penny,17," You know, and then he just goes and has to humiliate me by writing about me on his blog so the entire world can read it.",1
4148,Leonard,17, Actually it‰Ûªs not all that easy to find. ,1
4149,Penny,17," Yeah, really, well my friends at work found it, my sister found it, judging by my email a number of prisoners at the Michigan State Penitentiary found it. ",1
4150,Leonard,17," Okay, well, what exactly did this guy write, not that I need to know the details of your sex life, I just thought‰Û_. never mind. ",1
4151,Penny,17," Nope, you know what, you might as well read it, everybody else has, go ahead. Oh God, I just feel so betrayed and embarrassed. I just want to crawl into a hole and die.",1
4152,Leonard,17," Okay, well, you know, this isn‰Ûªt that bad. It just paints the picture of a very affectionate woman who‰Ûªs open to expressing her affection in non traditional locales. ",1
4153,Penny,17, Oh God!,1
4154,Leonard,17," Elevators, parks, movie theatres, out of curiosity, is this subway the transportation system or subway the sandwich shop? ",1
4155,Penny,17, Sandwich shop.,1
4156,Leonard,17, Doesn‰Ûªt that violate the health code?,1
4157,Penny,17," No, at the sub shop we were only making out. ",1
4158,Leonard,17, Huh. Okay. But my point is that you have absolutely no reason to be embarrassed. ,1
4159,Penny,17," Really, do you think I overreacted?",1
4160,Leonard,17, Maybe a little.,1
4161,Penny,17," ‰Û÷Cause I do that, I do overreact. Maybe I should call Mike and apologise.",1
4162,Leonard,17," No. No, no, that, that would be underreacting. He did break the implied confidentiality of the bedroom and, in your case, the elevator, parks and fast food franchise.",1
4163,Penny,17, Yes. You‰Ûªre right. I should just say I‰Ûªm done with him. ,1
4164,Leonard,17," Yes, you should, go ahead, say it. ",1
4165,Penny,17, But I never gave the man a chance to explain. ,1
4166,Leonard,17," What is there to explain, it‰Ûªs all right here, it‰Ûªs a betrayal. ",1
4167,Penny,17," No, you were right the first time, this is a man who loves me, but in his own stupid way he was just trying to show people how he feels. ",1
4168,Leonard,17, I‰Ûªm pretty sure I never said that. ,1
4169,Penny,17," No, you did better than that, you helped me see it on my own. ",1
4170,Leonard,17," Aw, good for me. Where are you going?",1
4171,Penny,17," I‰Ûªm going over to Mike‰Ûªs. Leonard, thank you so much.",1
4172,Leonard,17," Oh, sure. Huh, maybe I am her gay friend. ",1
4173,Scene,17, The apartment. The guys are playing a board game and eating Chinese food.,1
4174,Sheldon,17," Howard, I‰Ûªm going to need another Mandarin lesson. I obviously didn‰Ûªt make my point with those people. ",1
4175,Howard,17," For God‰Ûªs sake, Sheldon, if you don‰Ûªt like the tangerine chicken, don‰Ûªt order the tangerine chicken.",1
4176,Sheldon,17," I like tangerine chicken, I‰Ûªm not getting tangerine chicken.",1
4177,Leonard,17, Can we please change the subject.,1
4178,Raj,17, Sure. Tell us again how you screwed up and got Penny back together with her old boyfriend.,1
4179,Leonard,17, Just roll the dice. ,1
4180,Raj (rolls and moves),17," Enslaved by warlocks, stay here till you roll 2, 4 or 6‰Û_7",1
4181,Leonard,17," She was mad at him. She was done with him, the relationship was broken beyond repair and I walked over there and I fixed it!",1
4182,Howard,17," Boy, that story gets better every time you hear it. ",1
4183,Sheldon,17," Actually, I thought the first two renditions were far more compelling. Previously I felt sympathy for the Leonard character, now I just find him to be whiny and annoying. ",1
4184,Leonard,17, Just eat your tangerine chicken. ,1
4185,Sheldon,17," I‰Ûªd love to, but I don‰Ûªt have tangerine chicken. ",1
4186,Penny (storming in),17, Thank you so much for your stupid advice. (Slams door again.) ,1
4187,Raj,17, Incredible. You managed to screw up the screw-up. ,1
4188,Scene,17, Penny‰Ûªs apartment.,1
4189,Leonard (knocking and entering),17, I‰Ûªm back. ,1
4190,Penny,17, I‰Ûªm sorry I yelled at you. It‰Ûªs not your fault. ,1
4191,Leonard,17, What happened?,1
4192,Penny,17," Well, I went over to Mike‰Ûªs to make up with him.",1
4193,Leonard,17," Yeah, I know, I know that part. ",1
4194,Penny,17, But he had already moved on.,1
4195,Leonard,17," Already, that was quick.",1
4196,Penny,17, That‰Ûªs what I said to the woman who had her legs wrapped around his neck. ,1
4197,Leonard,17," Oh, Penny, I am so sorry.",1
4198,Penny,17, How could he do that.,1
4199,Leonard,17," Oh, well, you know, you did throw an 8 gig iPod‰Û_ yeah, no, how could he do that. ",1
4200,Penny,17," I swear to God, I am done with guys like that. You know, macho, with the perfect body and the hair, and the money.",1
4201,Leonard,17," Yeah, that must get old quick. ",1
4202,Penny,17," You know, just once, I would like to go out with someone who is nice, and honest, and who actually cares about me. ",1
4203,Leonard,17, What about me?,1
4204,Penny,17, What about you what?,1
4205,Leonard,17, What about if you went out with me?,1
4206,Penny,17, Are you asking me out?,1
4207,Leonard,17, Um‰Û_ yes‰Û_ I am‰Û_ asking you out. ,1
4208,Penny,17, Wow.,1
4209,Leonard,17, I was just going off your comment about the nice guy‰Û_,1
4210,Penny,17," No, I know, I got that. Yeah, totally.",1
4211,Leonard (continuing through Penny),17," ‰Û_thing and honest but, it‰Ûªs no big deal‰Û_",1
4212,Penny,17, Yes. ,1
4213,Leonard,17, Yes what? ,1
4214,Penny,17," Yes, I will go out with you. ",1
4215,Leonard,17, Really?,1
4216,Penny,17," Yeah. Why not, I mean, what do I have to lose?",1
4217,Leonard,17, Yeah. That‰Ûªs the spirit. ,1
4218,Scene,17, The lobby. Sheldon is listening to an iPod.,1
4219,Sheldon,17," Show me your citrus peels. Gei wo kan, ni jud di zi pei. Show me your citrus peels. Gei wo kan, ni jud di zi pei. Show me your‰Û_",1
4220,Penny (tapping him on the shoulder),17, Sheldon.,1
4221,Sheldon (jumping in panic),17, Aieee ya! Xia si wo le. ,1
4222,Penny,17," I‰Ûªm sorry. Look, do you have a second.",1
4223,Sheldon,17, A second what? Pair of underwear? ,1
4224,Penny,17, I was just wondering if I could talk to you? It‰Ûªs about Leonard.,1
4225,Sheldon,17, Why me? Why not Koothrappali or Wolowitz?,1
4226,Penny,17," Well, Raj can‰Ûªt talk to me unless he‰Ûªs drunk, and Wolowitz is, you know, disgusting. ",1
4227,Sheldon,17," Yes, I suppose he is. ",1
4228,Penny,17," All I‰Ûªm saying is, you know Leonard the best. ",1
4229,Sheldon,17," Not necessarily. I‰Ûªm often surprised by my lack of familiarity with Leonard. Just the other day I discovered, he not only has a loofah, he hides it. Why do you suppose a man would be ashamed of having a loofah? I myself prefer to have my excess epithelial cells slough off naturally, but I don‰Ûªt condemn those who seek to accelerate the process. åÊ(Time shift) And until recently I had no idea that despite his lactose intolerance, he can tolerate small amounts of non-fat ice cream without producing a noxious gas that I maintain in the right concentration could be weaponised. (Begins to unlock apartment door.)",1
4230,Penny,17," Leonard might come home, can we talk in my apartment. ",1
4231,Sheldon,17, We‰Ûªre not done? ,1
4232,Penny,17, No.,1
4233,Sheldon,17," Ach, why not? We‰Ûªre already through the looking glass anyway. ",1
4234,Penny,17," Okay, so, here‰Ûªs the thing. I guess you‰Ûªre aware that Leonard asked me out. ",1
4235,Sheldon,17," Well, he didn‰Ûªt actually say anything, but when he came back to the apartment he was doing a dance that brought to mind the happy hippos in Fantasia. ",1
4236,Penny,17," Oh, that‰Ûªs nice. Anyhow, the thing I wanted to talk to you about is, you know, since Leonard and I have become friends, I was just‰Û_ want to sit down? ",1
4237,Sheldon,17," Oh, I wish it were that simple. You see, I don‰Ûªt spend much time here and so I‰Ûªve never really chosen a place to sit. ",1
4238,Penny,17," Well, choose.",1
4239,Sheldon,17," There are a number of options and, I‰Ûªm really not familiar enough with the cushion densities, air flow patterns and dispersion of sunlight to make an informed choice.",1
4240,Penny,17," Alright, why don‰Ûªt you just pick one at random, and then if you don‰Ûªt like it you can sit somewhere else next time. ",1
4241,Sheldon,17," No, no, that‰Ûªs crazy. You go ahead and talk while I figure it out. ",1
4242,Penny,17," Okay. Um, here‰Ûªs the thing. So, I‰Ûªve known for a while now that Leonard has had a little crush on me‰Û_",1
4243,Sheldon,17," A little crush? Well I suppose so, in the same way Menelaus had a little crush on Helen of Troy. ",1
4244,Penny,17," Alright, yeah, I don‰Ûªt really know who they are‰Û_",1
4245,Sheldon,17, Well Menelaus was the brother of Agamemnon‰Û_,1
4246,Penny,17," Yeah, I don‰Ûªt care, I don‰Ûªt care. The point is Leonard isn‰Ûªt the kind of guy I usually go out with.",1
4247,Sheldon,17, Leonard isn‰Ûªt the kind of guy anyone usually goes out with. Would you be open to rotating the couch clockwise thirty degrees? ,1
4248,Penny,17," No. What I‰Ûªm saying is, Leonard might be different in a good way. Obviously my usual choices have not worked out so well. ",1
4249,Sheldon,17," The last one worked out well for Koothrappali. He got a free iPod. Oh, glare! ",1
4250,Penny,17," But on the other hand, if things don‰Ûªt go well with Leonard, I risk losing a really good friend. I mean, I guess he‰Ûªs not looking for a fling, he‰Ûªs the kind of guy that gets into a relationship for, I don‰Ûªt know, like you would say light years. ",1
4251,Sheldon,17," I would not say that. No-one would say that, a light year is a unit of distance, not time. ",1
4252,Penny,17, Thank you for the clarification. ,1
4253,Sheldon,17," Draft. You see people hear the word year and they think duration. Foot pound has the same problem, that‰Ûªs a unit of work, not of weight.",1
4254,Penny,17," Right, thanks.",1
4255,Sheldon,17, It‰Ûªs a common mistake.,1
4256,Penny,17, Not the first one I‰Ûªve made today. ,1
4257,Sheldon,17, Okay. I think this will be my seat. ,1
4258,Penny,17," Sheldon, do you have anything to say that has anything to do with, you know, what I‰Ûªm talking about. ",1
4259,Sheldon,17," Well, let‰Ûªs see. We might consider Schrodinger‰Ûªs Cat. ",1
4260,Penny,17, Schrodinger? Is that the woman in 2A?,1
4261,Sheldon,17," No. That‰Ûªs Mrs Grossinger. And she doesn‰Ûªt have a cat, she has a Mexican hairless, annoying little animal, yip yip yip yip‰Û_",1
4262,Penny,17, Sheldon! ,1
4263,Sheldon,17," Sorry, you diverted me. Anyway, in 1935, Erwin Schrodinger, in an attempt to explain the Copenhagen interpretation of quantum physics, he proposed an experiment where a cat is placed in a box with a sealed vial of poison that will break open at a random time. Now, since no-one knows when or if the poison has been released, until the box is opened, the cat can be thought of as both alive and dead. ",1
4264,Penny,17," I‰Ûªm sorry, I don‰Ûªt get the point. ",1
4265,Sheldon,17," Well of course you don‰Ûªt get it, I haven‰Ûªt made it yet. You‰Ûªd have to be psychic to get it, and there‰Ûªs no such thing as psychic.",1
4266,Penny,17," Sheldon, what‰Ûªs the point? ",1
4267,Sheldon,17," Just like Schrodinger‰Ûªs Cat, your potential relationship with Leonard right now can be thought of as both good and bad. It is only by opening the box that you‰Ûªll find out which it is. ",1
4268,Penny,17," Okay, so you‰Ûªre saying I should go out with Leonard. ",1
4269,Sheldon,17," No, no, no, no, no, no. Let me start again. In 1935, Erwin Schrodinger‰Û_",1
4270,Scene,17, The University cafeteria.,1
4271,Leonard (pointing),17, Two seats right there. ,1
4272,Sheldon (to two oriental-looking people occupying the other seats),17, Chong sho sha pwe. (Caption translates to ‰ÛÏLong Live Concrete‰Û.) Xie xie. (Thank you) ,1
4273,Leonard,17," Sheldon, I think I‰Ûªve made a mistake. ",1
4274,Sheldon,17," I can see that. Unless you‰Ûªre planning on running a marathon, choosing both stuffing and mashed potatoes is a starch filled redundancy.",1
4275,Leonard,17," No, it‰Ûªs about Penny.",1
4276,Sheldon,17," A mistake involving Penny? Okay, you‰Ûªll have to narrow it down. ",1
4277,Leonard,17, I don‰Ûªt think I can go out with her tonight. ,1
4278,Sheldon,17, Then don‰Ûªt.,1
4279,Leonard,17, Other people would say ‰ÛÏwhy not?‰Û ,1
4280,Sheldon,17, Other people might be interested. ,1
4281,Leonard,17, I‰Ûªm going to talk anyway.,1
4282,Sheldon,17, I assumed you would. ,1
4283,Leonard,17," Now that I‰Ûªm actually about to go out with Penny, I‰Ûªm not excited, I‰Ûªm nauseous. ",1
4284,Sheldon,17," Ah, then your meal choice is appropriate. Starch absorbs fluid which reduces the amount of vomit available for violent expulsion. ",1
4285,Leonard,17, Right.,1
4286,Sheldon,17," You also made a common grammatical mistake, you said nauseous when you meant nauseated. But go on. ",1
4287,Leonard,17," Sheldon, this date is probably my one chance with Penny, what happens if I blow it. ",1
4288,Sheldon,17," Well, if we accept your premise, and also accept the highly improbable assumption that Penny is the only woman in the world for you then we can logically conclude that the result of blowing it would be that you end up a lonely, bitter old man with no progeny. The image of any number of evil lighthouse keepers from Scooby Doo cartoons comes to mind. ",1
4289,Leonard,17, You‰Ûªre not helping. ,1
4290,Sheldon,17," Alright, what response on my part would bring this conversation to a speedy conclusion?",1
4291,Leonard,17, Tell me whether or not to go through with the date.,1
4292,Sheldon,17, Schrodinger‰Ûªs Cat.,1
4293,Leonard,17," Wow, that‰Ûªs brilliant.",1
4294,Sheldon,17," You sound surprised. Mmm, hou zi shui zai li du. (Your monkey sleeps inside me.) ",1
4295,Scene,17, Leonard approaches Penny‰Ûªs door. He is wearing a suit. He knocks. Penny answers.,1
4296,Penny,17, Hi.,1
4297,Leonard,17, Hi. ,1
4298,Penny,17, come on in.,1
4299,Leonard,17, Thank you. You look very nice.,1
4300,Penny,17, Thank you. So do you. ,1
4301,Leonard,17, I made an eight o‰Ûªclock reservation.,1
4302,Penny,17," Okay, great, listen, um, maybe we should talk first. ",1
4303,Leonard,17," Oh. Okay. But before you say anything, have you ever heard of Schrodinger‰Ûªs Cat? ",1
4304,Penny,17," Actually, I‰Ûªve heard far too much about Schrodinger‰Ûªs Cat. ",1
4305,Leonard,17, Good. (He grabs her and kisses her.) ,1
4306,Penny,17," Alright, the cat‰Ûªs alive, let‰Ûªs go to dinner. ",1
4307,Scene,17, The Szechuan Palace. ,1
4308,Sheldon (in Mandarin),17, Show me your mucus! Your mucus! ,1
4309,Owner (in Mandarin),17, Blow your own nose and go away. ,1
4310,Sheldon (in Mandarin),17, This is not a tangerine bicycle. ,1
4311,Owner (in English),17, Crazy man. Call the police. ,1
4312,Sheldon (in Mandarin),17," No. Don‰Ûªt call the library. Show me your mucus. (Leonard and Penny are seen entering, and then leaving again quickly.) Oxen are in my bed! Many, many oxen! Oy Vey!",1
4313,Scene,1, The stairwell.,2
4314,Leonard,1," So you see, what you‰Ûªre eating is not technically yoghurt, because it doesn‰Ûªt have enough live acidophilus cultures. It‰Ûªs really just iced milk with carragenin added for thickness. ",2
4315,Penny,1," Oh, that‰Ûªs very interesting.",2
4316,Leonard,1, It‰Ûªs also not pink and has no berries.,2
4317,Penny,1," Yeah, but it doesn‰Ûªt really answer my question.",2
4318,Leonard,1, What was your question again?,2
4319,Penny,1, Do you want some.,2
4320,Leonard,1," Oh, right, no, I‰Ûªm lactose intolerant.",2
4321,Penny,1, Right.,2
4322,Leonard,1," So, gas.",2
4323,Penny,1, Got it. ,2
4324,Leonard,1," Well, good night. (They kiss. Camera cuts away to a wall mounted security cam above the lift. Leonard spots its movement and shuffles Penny away.)",2
4325,Penny,1, What are you doing?,2
4326,Leonard,1, There was a draft.,2
4327,Penny,1, I didn‰Ûªt feel a draft. ,2
4328,Leonard,1, Why don‰Ûªt we just go into your‰Û_.,2
4329,Penny,1," Oh, yeah, you know what, maybe we should just slow things down a little.",2
4330,Leonard,1," No, no, I didn‰Ûªt mean to go into your apartment to‰Û_ go fast. ",2
4331,Penny,1," No, I know, I‰Û_ I know what you meant, it‰Ûªs just‰Û_ it‰Ûªs only our first date.",2
4332,Leonard,1," Yeah, okay, sure, no problem, why don‰Ûªt we just figure out where we‰Ûªre going, and when we want to get there, and then rate of speed equals distance over time. Solve for R.",2
4333,Penny,1, Or we could just wing it. ,2
4334,Leonard,1, That might work too. ,2
4335,Penny,1, Goodnight Leonard.,2
4336,Leonard,1, Goodnight. (He throws the camera a dirty look.) ,2
4337,Raj,1, He‰Ûªs coming. Screen saver. ,2
4338,Howard,1," Oh, hey, Leonard, how was your date?",2
4339,Leonard,1," Bite me. Sheldon, how could you just sit there and let them spy on me?",2
4340,Sheldon,1," They were clever, Leonard. They exploited my complete lack of interest in what you were doing. ",2
4341,Howard,1," You should thank us. When future generations try to determine why your relationship with Penny crashed and burned, this right here is the black box. ",2
4342,Leonard,1," What are you talking about, the date went fine. ",2
4343,Raj,1," Dude, she said she wants to slow things down.",2
4344,Leonard,1," Okay, so, she said she wants to slow things down. It‰Ûªs like saying ‰ÛÏI‰Ûªm really enjoying this meal, I‰Ûªm going to slow down and savour it.‰Û ",2
4345,Howard,1," No, it‰Ûªs like ‰ÛÏthis fish tastes bad, so I‰Ûªm going to slow down and spit it out.‰Û",2
4346,Raj,1, You being the fish.,2
4347,Leonard,1, I‰Ûªm not the fish. ,2
4348,Howard,1," Oh really, did you make a second date.",2
4349,Leonard,1," Well, we sort of decided to wing it. ",2
4350,Sheldon,1," Oh, even I know that‰Ûªs lame. ",2
4351,Leonard,1," Okay, alright, let‰Ûªs assume your hypothesis. We went to dinner, we talked, we laughed, we kissed, where could I have possibly gone wrong. ",2
4352,åÊHoward,1," Think back, Leonard, the littlest things can set women off. Like, hey, the waitress is hot, I bet we could get her to come home with us. Or, how much does your mom weigh, I want to know what I‰Ûªm getting into.",2
4353,Leonard,1, I didn‰Ûªt say anything like that.,2
4354,Howard,1," Good, ‰Û÷cos they don‰Ûªt work. ",2
4355,Raj,1," They also don‰Ûªt care for it if you stare at them and hyperventilate. Sadly, that‰Ûªs my home run swing. ",2
4356,Leonard,1," Look, everything went fine. I didn‰Ûªt even have to refer to my impromptu conversation starters. The woman across the hall is into me. ",2
4357,Howard,1," Let‰Ûªs go to the tape. Look at her reaction to the goodnight kiss, no change in respiration, pupils un-dilated, no flushing of the chest.",2
4358,Raj,1," Nice close up, by the way. ",2
4359,Sheldon,1," Interesting, her jaws are clenched, no tongue access, clearly a bad sign amongst mating humans. ",2
4360,Leonard,1, That‰Ûªs not a bad sign.,2
4361,Sheldon,1," Please, you might as well have been two iguana with no dewlap enlargement. ",2
4362,Raj,1," And the worst sign of all is, you‰Ûªre here and not there. ",2
4363,Leonard,1," I‰Ûªm not there because I‰Ûªm taking things slow. Which, by the way, compared to you guys approaches warp speed. And take down that camera. ",2
4364,Raj,1, He was a lot more fun when he had no hope. ,2
4365,Howard,1, Give him time.,2
4366,Scene,1, The laundry room. Sheldon is folding shirts. ,2
4367,Penny (entering),1, Hi.,2
4368,Sheldon,1," Oh, hi Penny. FYI, the hot water is inadequate on machine 2 so colours only, and 4 is still releasing the fabric softener too early in the cycle so I‰Ûªd avoid using that for your delicates. ",2
4369,Penny (tipping all her laundry into one machine at once),1, Thanks. ,2
4370,Sheldon,1," Oh, good Lord. Why don‰Ûªt you just take your clothes down to the river and beat them with a rock? ",2
4371,Penny,1," Sheldon, may I ask you a question? ",2
4372,Sheldon,1," I would prefer that you not, but I won‰Ûªt go so far as to forbid it. ",2
4373,Penny,1," Alright, I heard yes, so‰Û_ okay, here‰Ûªs my question, has Leonard ever dated, you know, a regular girl. ",2
4374,Sheldon,1, Well I assume you‰Ûªre not referring to digestive regularity? Because I‰Ûªve come to learn that such inquiries are inappropriate. ,2
4375,Penny,1," No, I meant has he ever been involved with someone who wasn‰Ûªt a braniac? ",2
4376,Sheldon,1," Oh. Well, a few years ago he did go out with a woman who had a PhD in French Literature. ",2
4377,Penny,1, How is that not a braniac? ,2
4378,Sheldon,1," Well, for one thing, she was French. For another, it was literature. ",2
4379,Penny,1," So, do you think that if Leonard and I keep dating he‰Ûªll eventually get bored with me. ",2
4380,Sheldon,1, That depends.,2
4381,Penny,1, On what? ,2
4382,Sheldon,1, Do you have a working knowledge of quantum physics? ,2
4383,Penny,1, No.,2
4384,Sheldon,1, Do you speak Klingon? ,2
4385,Penny,1, No.,2
4386,Sheldon,1, Do you know any card tricks?,2
4387,Penny,1," Okay, okay, you know, I get it, Leonard has no business being involved with a waitress slash actress who felt so insecure that she lied to him about finishing community college. ",2
4388,Sheldon,1, Why would you lie about that?,2
4389,Penny,1," Well, he was going on and on about this college and that grad school and I didn‰Ûªt want him to think I was some stupid loser. ",2
4390,Sheldon,1, You thought the opposite of stupid loser was community college graduate? ,2
4391,Penny,1," You know, there are a lot of successful people in this country who are community college graduates. ",2
4392,Sheldon,1," Yeah, but you were neither. ",2
4393,Penny,1," Right, okay look, this is between you and me, you cannot tell Leonard any of this. ",2
4394,Sheldon,1, You‰Ûªre asking me to keep a secret?,2
4395,Penny,1, Yeah. ,2
4396,Sheldon,1," Well I‰Ûªm sorry, but you would have had to express that desire before revealing the secret, so that I could choose whether or not I wanted to accept the covenant of secret keeping. You can‰Ûªt impose a secret on an ex post facto basis. ",2
4397,Penny,1, What? ,2
4398,Sheldon,1," Secret keeping is a complicated endeavour. One has to be concerned not only about what one says, but about facial expression, autonomic reflexes, when I try to deceive, I myself have more nervous tics than a lyme disease research facility. (Long pause.) It‰Ûªs a joke. It relies on the hominymic relationship between tick the blood-sucking arachnid, and tic the involuntary muscular contraction. I made it up myself. ",2
4399,Penny,1," Okay, look, if Leonard finds out that I lied, I will absolutely die of embarrassment. ",2
4400,Sheldon,1, Physiologically impossible.,2
4401,Penny,1," Oh Sheldon, please, look, I‰Ûªm asking you as a friend. ",2
4402,Sheldon,1, So you‰Ûªre saying that friendship contains within it an inherent obligation to maintain confidences?,2
4403,Penny,1," Well, yeah. ",2
4404,Sheldon,1," Interesting. See, one more question, and perhaps I should have led with this, when did we become friends? ",2
4405,Scene,1, The stairwell.,2
4406,Sheldon,1," I.e, I couldn‰Ûªt become Green Lantern unless I was chosen by the guardians of Oa, but given enough start-up capital and an adequate research facility, I could be Batman.",2
4407,Leonard,1, You could be Batman?,2
4408,Sheldon,1, Sure. (In a gravelly voice) I‰Ûªm Batman. See.,2
4409,Penny (arriving),1, Hi guys.,2
4410,Leonard,1, Hey.,2
4411,Sheldon (looking the other way uncomfortably),1, Hi Penny.,2
4412,Leonard,1," Hey, Penny, if you‰Ûªre not doing anything Friday night I thought maybe we could go and see a movie. ",2
4413,Penny,1," Oh, um, you know, I think I have the dinner shift on Friday.",2
4414,Leonard,1, What about Saturday?,2
4415,Penny,1," You know, I‰Ûªm not sure, the manager hasn‰Ûªt posted the schedule yet, how about I let you know.",2
4416,Leonard,1," Great. So you just let me know when you know. So‰Û_ (she leaves) Oh God, I am the bad fish! What did I do wrong?",2
4417,Sheldon,1," Why are you asking me, I have no information about your interactions with Penny other than what you provided me, nor do I have any method of learning such things. (Runs away.) ",2
4418,Leonard (chasing him),1, What does that mean?,2
4419,Sheldon,1, Nothing. You seem to be implying an informational back channel between me and Penny where obviously none exists.,2
4420,Leonard,1, No I didn‰Ûªt.,2
4421,Sheldon,1," I just think you need to be careful how you phrase things, sir. ",2
4422,Leonard,1, What‰Ûªs going on with you?,2
4423,Sheldon,1, Well I might ask you the same question. Why do you insist on attempting to drag me into matters which have nothing to do with me? But exist between you and Penny. A person to whom I barely speak. (His eye begins to twitch.) ,2
4424,Leonard,1, What‰Ûªs wrong with your face? ,2
4425,Sheldon,1," There‰Ûªs no reason to bring my looks into this. Good day, Leonard.",2
4426,Leonard,1, What? ,2
4427,Sheldon,1, I said Good Day! (He leaves),2
4428,Leonard,1, Good day? ,2
4429,Scene,1, The Cheesecake Factory,2
4430,Penny,1," Also today we have a fresh caught Alaska salmon, and that‰Ûªs served with a teriyaki glaze and sticky rice. Our soup of the day‰Û_",2
4431,Sheldon (appearing behind her),1, You must release me from my oath. ,2
4432,Penny,1," Sheldon, I‰Ûªm working.",2
4433,Sheldon,1, Why don‰Ûªt you take a minute to decide (leads her away) I can‰Ûªt keep your secret Penny. I‰Ûªm going to fold like an energy based anobo protein in conformational space. Like a renaissance triptych. Like a cheap suit.,2
4434,Penny,1," Oh, look, why is it so hard for you to keep one little secret?",2
4435,Sheldon,1," I‰Ûªm constitutionally incapable. That‰Ûªs why I was refused clearance for a very prestigious government research fellowship at a secret military supercollider, located beneath a fake agricultural station 12.5 miles south east of Travers City, Michigan. Which you did not hear about from me. ",2
4436,Penny,1," Look, just forget I told you about me not graduating from community college. Okay?",2
4437,Sheldon,1, Forget! You want me to forget? This mind does not forget. I haven‰Ûªt forgotten a single thing since the day my mother stopped breast feeding me. It was a drizzly Tuesday.,2
4438,Penny,1," Okay, look, you promised me you would keep my secret so you‰Ûªre just going to have to figure out a way to do it.",2
4439,Scene,1, The apartment.,2
4440,Sheldon (entering),1," Leonard, I‰Ûªm moving out. ",2
4441,Leonard,1," What do you mean, you‰Ûªre moving out? Why? ",2
4442,Sheldon,1, There doesn‰Ûªt have to be a reason. ,2
4443,Leonard,1," Yeah, there kind of does.",2
4444,Sheldon,1," Not necessarily. This is a classic example of munchausen‰Ûªs trilemma. Either the reason is predicated on a series of sub-reasons leading to an infinite regression, or it tracks back to arbitrary axiomatic statements, or it‰Ûªs ultimately circular, i.e., I‰Ûªm moving out because I‰Ûªm moving out. ",2
4445,Leonard,1, I‰Ûªm still confused.,2
4446,Sheldon,1," Leonard, I don‰Ûªt see how I could have made it any simpler. ",2
4447,Howard (entering),1," Hey, qu‰Ûªest q‰Ûªwass up?",2
4448,Raj,1, We just got back from that exhibit of those plasticised human cadavers.,2
4449,Howard,1, And some of those skinless chicks were hot. ,2
4450,Sheldon,1," If you‰Ûªll excuse me, I‰Ûªm going to pack. ",2
4451,Howard,1, That‰Ûªs kind of an overreaction to a little harmless necrophilia. ,2
4452,Leonard,1," It‰Ûªs not you, Howard, he says he‰Ûªs moving out. ",2
4453,Raj,1, What did you do? Did you change the contrast or brightness settings on the television?,2
4454,Leonard,1, No.,2
4455,Raj,1, Did you take a band aid off in front of him? ,2
4456,Leonard,1, No.,2
4457,Howard,1," Did you buy generic ketchup, forget to rinse the sink, talk to him through the bathroom door? ",2
4458,Raj,1," Adjust the thermostat, cook with cilantro, pronounce the T in often? ",2
4459,Leonard,1, No. ,2
4460,Howard,1, Did you make fun of trains? ,2
4461,Leonard,1," I didn‰Ûªt do anything, he‰Ûªs just gone insane.",2
4462,Raj,1," Well, we all knew this day was coming. ",2
4463,Leonard,1, That was fast. ,2
4464,Sheldon,1, It‰Ûªs my pre-packed disaster evacuation bag. Recommended by the department of homeland security. And Sarah Connor. ,2
4465,Leonard,1, Where are you gonna live? ,2
4466,Sheldon,1, Until I find a permanent place I will stay with friends. ,2
4467,Howard,1, Bye (runs out.) ,2
4468,Raj,1," Well you can‰Ûªt stay with me, I have a teeny tiny apartment. ",2
4469,Sheldon,1," Excuse me, but isn‰Ûªt hosting guests an aspect of Menushya Yajna, one of the five central religious duties or sacrifices of the Hindu householder? ",2
4470,Raj,1, I hate trains. ,2
4471,Sheldon,1," Don‰Ûªt be ridiculous, you love trains. ",2
4472,Raj,1," Yes I do, come on. See you later Leonard. (Sheldon drops keys in bowl and leaves without a word.)",2
4473,Leonard,1, This could work. ,2
4474,Scene,1, Raj‰Ûªs apartment. ,2
4475,Sheldon,1, This is a very old building. ,2
4476,Raj,1, Sixty years. Used to be a watch factory. ,2
4477,Sheldon,1, Uh-oh.,2
4478,Raj,1, What? ,2
4479,Sheldon,1, Don‰Ûªt you worry about the residual radium from the luminous dials?,2
4480,Raj,1, Not until now. ,2
4481,Sheldon,1," I can‰Ûªt believe I didn‰Ûªt bring my gieger counter. You know, I had it on my bed and I didn‰Ûªt pack it. ",2
4482,Raj,1," Well, if you‰Ûªre not comfortable staying here, Sheldon‰Û_",2
4483,Sheldon,1," I‰Ûªm kidding, I packed it. It was a joke, I was subverting the conversational expectations. I believe they call that the, um, old switcheroo. ",2
4484,Raj,1, Terrific. ,2
4485,Sheldon (referring to Bollywood singing on television),1, Is that woman Aishwarya Rai?,2
4486,Raj,1," Yes, isn‰Ûªt she an amazing actress.",2
4487,Sheldon,1," Actually, I‰Ûªd say she‰Ûªs a poor man‰Ûªs Madhuri Dixit. ",2
4488,Raj,1, How dare you. Aishwarya Rai is a Goddess. By comparison Madhuri Dixit is a leprous prostitute.,2
4489,Sheldon,1," Sorry, I didn‰Ûªt mean to offend you. Obviously you‰Ûªre not that familiar with Indian cinema. ",2
4490,Scene,1, Howard‰Ûªs house. The door rings. ,2
4491,Howard,1, Who is it?,2
4492,Voice,1, Strippergram. (Howard opens door. Outside are Raj and Sheldon.),2
4493,Raj,1, Tag. You‰Ûªre it. (Runs away.) ,2
4494,Howard,1, Shouldn‰Ûªt you have put him in a brown paper bag and set him on fire? ,2
4495,Scene,1," Howard‰Ûªs bedroom. Howard is in bed, Sheldon is on a blow up mattress on the floor.",2
4496,Sheldon,1, I‰Ûªve never slept on an air mattress before. No lumbar support whatsoever. ,2
4497,Howard,1, Maybe you‰Ûªd be happier on a park bench? ,2
4498,Sheldon,1, I don‰Ûªt see any way to get a park bench in here.,2
4499,Howard,1, Do you want to switch?,2
4500,Sheldon,1," No, that‰Ûªs fine. I‰Ûªm perfectly comfortable sleeping on a bouncy castle. ",2
4501,Howard,1," Get out of bed, we‰Ûªre switching.",2
4502,Sheldon,1," Now, only if you want to.",2
4503,Howard,1, Just get in the bed!,2
4504,Howard‰Ûªs mother (off),1, What‰Ûªs going on? Are you boys roughhousing? ,2
4505,Howard,1, We‰Ûªre just talking ma. ,2
4506,Howard‰Ûªs mother,1," If you don‰Ûªt settle down right now, I‰Ûªm not going to let you have any more sleepovers. ",2
4507,Howard,1," For God‰Ûªs sake, ma, I‰Ûªm 27 years old. It‰Ûªs not even a school night! (To Sheldon) Comfy now?",2
4508,Sheldon,1, Meh. That poster of Halle Berry‰Ûªs a little unnerving. ,2
4509,Howard,1, So don‰Ûªt look at it.,2
4510,Sheldon,1, She‰Ûªs like my fourth favourite catwoman.,2
4511,Howard,1, No kidding?,2
4512,Sheldon,1," Yeah, Julie Newmar, Michelle Pfieffer, Eartha Kitt and then her. ",2
4513,Howard,1, What about Lee Meriwether?,2
4514,Sheldon,1," Oh, I forgot about Lee Meriwether.",2
4515,Howard,1, Well I‰Ûªm glad that‰Ûªs settled. ,2
4516,Sheldon,1," That makes Halle Berry my fifth favourite catwoman. There‰Ûªs Julie Newmar, Michelle Pfieffer, Eartha Kitt, Lee Meriwether‰Û_",2
4517,Howard,1," Please, I‰Ûªm begging you, go to sleep.",2
4518,Sheldon,1," I‰Ûªm trying, I‰Ûªm counting catwomen. She did make a fine mutant in the X-Men movies though.",2
4519,Howard,1, Oh for God‰Ûªs sake.,2
4520,Sheldon,1," But she‰Ûªs not my favourite of the X-Men, in order that would be Wolverine, Cyclops, oh wait, I forgot Professor X. Professor X, Wolverine, Cyclops, Iceman, then Storm, Angel, the Beast, oh wait, Nightcrawler. Professor X, Nightcrawler, Wolverine, Cyclops, Iceman, then Storm, Angel‰Û_.",2
4521,Scene,1, Sheldon and Leonard‰Ûªs apartment. There is an urgent rapping at the door.,2
4522,Leonard,1," I‰Ûªm coming! (Opens the door. Sheldon falls inside, wearing his pyjamas. Howard is outside.)",2
4523,Sheldon,1," Hey, there he is, there‰Ûªs my old buddy-bud-bud. ",2
4524,Leonard,1, What‰Ûªs with him?,2
4525,Howard,1," Koothrappali dumped him on me, and he couldn‰Ûªt get to sleep, so I gave him a glass of warm milk with a handful of my mom‰Ûªs valium in it. But he still wouldn‰Ûªt shut up, so, tag, you‰Ûªre it. ",2
4526,Sheldon,1, I‰Ûªm ba-ack!,2
4527,Leonard,1, I still don‰Ûªt know why you left.,2
4528,Sheldon,1, I can‰Ûªt tell you.,2
4529,Leonard,1, Why not.,2
4530,Sheldon,1, I promised Penny. ,2
4531,Leonard,1, You promised Penny what? ,2
4532,Sheldon,1, That I wouldn‰Ûªt tell you the secret. Shhhhh!,2
4533,Leonard,1, What secret. Tell me the secret. ,2
4534,Sheldon,1," Mom smokes in the car. Jesus is okay with it, but we can‰Ûªt tell Dad. ",2
4535,Leonard,1," Not that secret, the other secret.",2
4536,Sheldon,1, I‰Ûªm Batman. Shhhhh!,2
4537,Leonard,1," Dammit, Sheldon! You said Penny told you a secret, what was the secret.",2
4538,Sheldon,1," Okay, I‰Ûªll tell you, but you can‰Ûªt tell Leonard. ",2
4539,Leonard,1, I promise. ,2
4540,Sheldon,1, Penny lied about graduating from community college because she is afraid she‰Ûªs not smart enough for Leonard. ,2
4541,Leonard,1, So it‰Ûªs nothing I did? It‰Ûªs her problem? ,2
4542,Sheldon,1, I drank milk that tasted funny. ,2
4543,Leonard,1," Penny thinks I‰Ûªm too smart for her, that‰Ûªs ridiculous. ",2
4544,Sheldon,1," I know, most of your work is extremely derivative. Don‰Ûªt worry, that‰Ûªs not a secret. Everybody knows. ",2
4545,Scene,1, The hallway. Leonard is outside Penny‰Ûªs door.,2
4546,Penny (opening door),1, Hi.,2
4547,Leonard,1," Yeah, hi, listen, I know what‰Ûªs been bothering you about us, and I have the answer. ",2
4548,Penny,1, What are you talking about.,2
4549,Leonard,1," First I want to say that it‰Ûªs not Sheldon‰Ûªs fault, he tried very hard to keep your secret, if Howard hadn‰Ûªt drugged him he would have taken it to his grave. ",2
4550,Penny,1, He told you?,2
4551,Leonard,1," Yes, but it‰Ûªs okay. Now that we know what the problem is, there‰Ûªs a simple solution. (Hands her a brochure.) ",2
4552,Penny,1, Pasadena city college? ,2
4553,Leonard,1," A place for fun, a place for knowledge. See, this man here‰Ûªs playing hacky sack, and this girl‰Ûªs going to be a paralegal. ",2
4554,Penny,1," Wow, I get it, because Dr Leonard Hofstadter can‰Ûªt date a girl without a fancy college degree. ",2
4555,Leonard,1," Well, it‰Ûªs really not that fancy, it‰Ûªs just a city college. ",2
4556,Penny,1," Right, but I have to have some sort of degree to date you? ",2
4557,Leonard,1, That doesn‰Ûªt matter to me at all.,2
4558,Penny,1," So, it‰Ûªs fine with you if I‰Ûªm not smart. ",2
4559,Leonard,1," Absolutely. (She slams the door in his face.) Okay, this time I know where I went wrong. (Looking up and seeing the camera) Oh bite me! ",2
4560,Scene,2," The building entrance lobby. The guys enter. Sheldon is dressed as a medieval monk, Howard is a court jester, Raj is a medieval gentleman and Leonard is a knight.",2
4561,Sheldon,2, Worst Renaissance Fair ever.,2
4562,Leonard,2," Please let it go, Sheldon.",2
4563,Sheldon,2," It was rife with historical inaccuracies. For example, the tavern girl serving flagons of mead, now her costume was obviously Germanic, but in 1487 the Bavarian purity laws or Rhineheitsgebot severely limited the availability of mead. At best they would have had some sort of spiced wine.",2
4564,Leonard,2, You‰Ûªre nitpicking.,2
4565,Sheldon,2, Oh-ho! Really? Well here‰Ûªs another nit for you. The flagons would not have been made of polypropylene.,2
4566,Howard,2, Renaissance fairs aren‰Ûªt about historical accuracy. They‰Ûªre about taking chubby girls who work at Kinko‰Ûªs and lacing them up in corsets so tight their bosom jumps out and says howdy.,2
4567,Sheldon,2, Bosoms would not have said howdy in the fifteenth century. If anything they would have said ‰ÛÏhuzzah!‰Û,2
4568,Howard,2," I don‰Ûªt care what the bosoms say, Sheldon, I just want to be part of the conversation.",2
4569,Penny (arriving with a man in tow),2, Hi guys. Looks like you‰Ûªve been to the Renaissance fair. I‰Ûªm hoping.,2
4570,Sheldon,2, Renaissance fair? More of a medieval slash age of enlightenment slash any excuse to wear a codpiece fair.,2
4571,Penny,2," Okay, fine, whatever, um, you guys, this is my friend Eric.",2
4572,Howard,2, Hello.,2
4573,Leonard,2, Hi.,2
4574,Eric,2, Hey.,2
4575,Leonard,2," So, yeah, good to see you.",2
4576,Penny,2," Yeah, yeah, it‰Ûªs good to see you too. We should really go.",2
4577,Eric,2, Yeah.,2
4578,Penny(leaving),2, Bye guys.,2
4579,"Eric (leaving, to Howard)",2, Like your hat.,2
4580,Howard,2," Thanks, my mom made it. Penny with a new guy, tres awkward.",2
4581,Leonard,2," It wasn‰Ûªt awkward. It wasn‰Ûªt fun. Besides, what‰Ûªs the big deal, we dated, we stopped dating, and now we‰Ûªre both moving on.",2
4582,Raj,2," By moving on, do you mean, she‰Ûªs going out with other men and you spent the afternoon making fifteenth century soap with Wolowitz?",2
4583,Sheldon,2," That was not fifteenth century soap, my God those people need to learn you can‰Ûªt just put ‰ÛÏye olde‰Û in front of anything and expect to get away with it.",2
4584,Leonard,2," Can we please just go in, my chain mail is stuck in my underwear.",2
4585,Sheldon,2, You‰Ûªre wearing modern underwear?,2
4586,Leonard,2," Relatively modern. Why, what are you wearing?",2
4587,Sheldon,2, I fashioned historically accurate undergarments out of linen.,2
4588,Leonard,2, You went out and bought linen?,2
4589,Sheldon,2," Don‰Ûªt be silly, I borrowed one of your pillow cases.",2
4590,Leonard,2, Borrowed?,2
4591,Scene,2, The apartment.,2
4592,Leonard,2," You know what, I‰Ûªm happy that Penny‰Ûªs moving on. It gives me the freedom to move on myself.",2
4593,Howard,2, Are you saying that you‰Ûªve been holding back?,2
4594,Leonard,2, Of course. Out of respect.,2
4595,Howard,2," So, how do you explain the ten years before Penny?",2
4596,Raj,2, Who were you respecting then?,2
4597,Leonard,2," What? I‰Ûªve dated plenty of women. There was Joyce Kim, Leslie Winkle.",2
4598,Sheldon,2," Notify the editors of the Oxford English Dictionary, the word plenty has been redefined to mean two.",2
4599,Leonard,2," Uh, what about that girl last year at Comic-con?",2
4600,Raj,2, Doesn‰Ûªt count.,2
4601,Leonard,2, Why not?,2
4602,Raj,2," What happens in costume at Comic-con, stays at Comic-con.",2
4603,Howard,2, You‰Ûªre only saying that because of what happened to you.,2
4604,Leonard,2, What happened to you?,2
4605,Raj,2, N-n-n-nothing happened to me.,2
4606,Howard,2," It wasn‰Ûªt your fault, Raj, he was dressed as a green Orion slave girl.",2
4607,Raj,2," H-h-h-how did we get on me, we were mocking Leonard for not moving on. Dude, you have totally not moved on.",2
4608,Leonard,2," Yes I have, it‰Ûªs just a matter of actually making a date with someone.",2
4609,Howard,2, Like who?,2
4610,Leonard,2," Well, there‰Ûªs Joyce Kim, but she defected back to North Korea so it‰Ûªs a little geographically undesireable.",2
4611,Raj,2, What about Leslie Winkle.,2
4612,Sheldon,2, Oh no.,2
4613,Raj,2, Why?,2
4614,Sheldon,2," Her research methodology is sloppy, she‰Ûªs unjustifiably arrogant about loop quantum gravity, and to make matters worse she‰Ûªs often mean to me.",2
4615,Raj,2, I think she‰Ûªs smoking hot.,2
4616,Howard,2, I‰Ûªd hit that.,2
4617,Sheldon,2, You‰Ûªd hit particulate soil on a colloidal suspension. Mud.,2
4618,Leonard,2," Look, I like Leslie, but she‰Ûªs not interested in dating as much as using men as tools for stress release.",2
4619,Howard,2," Yeah, so, be a tool. Go get yourself a little rebound stress release.",2
4620,Raj,2, Technically it would only be rebound if he and Penny had actually engaged in physical intimacy.,2
4621,Howard,2, You mean like you and Richard the slave girl?,2
4622,Raj,2," I bought him dinner and we kissed once, that was it. (Leaving) And he told me his name was Kimberley!",2
4623,Scene,2, The university cafeteria.,2
4624,Sheldon,2, You know how I know we‰Ûªre not in The Matrix?,2
4625,Leonard,2, How?,2
4626,Sheldon,2," If we were, the food would be better.",2
4627,Leslie (arriving),2," Hey, Leonard.",2
4628,Leonard,2," Hey, Leslie.",2
4629,Leslie,2," Hey, dummy.",2
4630,Sheldon,2," Hello to you, insufficiently intelligent person.",2
4631,Leslie,2," Ooh, rush me to the burn unit. Hey, Leonard, do you have a second, I need to ask you something.",2
4632,Leonard,2," Uh, sure.",2
4633,Sheldon,2," Well, if you‰Ûªll excuse me, I‰Ûªm going to go do work that promises significant results, as opposed to what you do, which does not. Yeah, you heard me.",2
4634,Leslie,2," Wow. So, I heard your relationship with Penny crashed to the ground like blue ice falling out of an airplane lavatory.",2
4635,Leonard,2, Where did you hear that?,2
4636,Leslie,2, Actually I read it. Wolowitz texted me. (Shows him text.) ,2
4637,Leonard,2, Like blue ice falling out of an airplane lavatory. Yep.,2
4638,Leslie,2," I thought it was a pretty good one, I gave him an L-O-L. Anyway, it got me thinking, now that you‰Ûªre unattached maybe we can revisit our previous attachment.",2
4639,Leonard,2, Are you suggesting another bout of stress release.,2
4640,Leslie,2," No, I‰Ûªm all done with casual sex. From now on I‰Ûªm fully committed to the traditional relationship paradigm.",2
4641,Leonard,2," Really, what changed?",2
4642,Leslie,2," It‰Ûªs hard to say, I guess there‰Ûªs just a time in every woman‰Ûªs life when she gets tired of waking up on a strange futon with a bunch of people she doesn‰Ûªt know.",2
4643,Leonard,2," Yeah, I can see how that would‰Û_ a bunch of people?",2
4644,Leslie,2," Anyway, I just figure it‰Ûªs time to slow things down and who better to slow things down with than you?",2
4645,Leonard,2," Oh, I‰Ûªm flattered. So, how do you suggest we proceed?",2
4646,Leslie,2," Your place, we‰Ûªll order Chinese, you‰Ûªll rent a movie, artsy but accessible, then light petting, no coitus.",2
4647,Leonard,2, Sounds fun.,2
4648,Leslie,2," I‰Ûªll leave the details up to you, I think it‰Ûªs better if you assume the male role.",2
4649,Leonard,2," Thank you, that‰Ûªs very thoughtful.",2
4650,Leslie,2, Great. Call me.,2
4651,Scene,2, The apartment. Leonard is dressed smartly and placing wine on the table. Sheldon enters.,2
4652,Sheldon,2, Great news. My mom sent me my old Nintendo 64.,2
4653,Leonard,2, Terrific.,2
4654,Sheldon,2," You know what this means, don‰Ûªt you? Break out the Red Bull, it‰Ûªs time to rock Mario old school.",2
4655,Leonard,2, I kind of have other plans tonight.,2
4656,Sheldon,2," But it‰Ûªs Friday. Friday‰Ûªs always vintage game night. Look, mom included the memory card, we can pick up where I left off in 1999 when I had pernicious anaemia.",2
4657,Leonard,2," Well, the thing is, someone‰Ûªs coming over.",2
4658,Sheldon,2," Well then, no problem, I have three controllers, the more the merrier.",2
4659,Leonard,2," Sheldon, it‰Ûªs a date, I have a date coming over.",2
4660,Sheldon,2," Oh, well you can‰Ûªt blame me for not jumping to that conclusion.",2
4661,Leonard,2," Why, what‰Ûªs so unusual about me having a date?",2
4662,Sheldon,2," Well, statistically speaking‰Û_",2
4663,Leonard,2," Alright, alright. Well, uh, nevertheless, I have one now and I would appreciate it if you would, you know, make yourself scarce.",2
4664,Sheldon,2," Leonard, I am a published theoretical physicist with two doctorates and an IQ which can‰Ûªt be accurately measured by normal tests, how much scarcer could I be?",2
4665,Leonard,2," You know what I mean, could you just give us a little privacy?",2
4666,Sheldon,2, You want me to leave the apartment?,2
4667,Leonard,2, Yes.,2
4668,Sheldon,2, You mean just go someplace else and be‰Û_ someplace else?,2
4669,Leonard,2, Yes.,2
4670,Sheldon,2," Well, why should I leave, this is my apartment too.",2
4671,Leonard,2," I know it is, and if science ever discovers a second member of your species and you two would like some privacy I would be more than happy to get out of your way.",2
4672,Sheldon,2, Well alright then.,2
4673,Scene,2, The entrance lobby. Sheldon is sitting on the bottom step using his laptop. Penny comes down the stairs.,2
4674,Penny,2, Sheldon? What are you doing?,2
4675,Sheldon,2, Playing Super Mario on a poorly coded Nintendo 64 emulator.,2
4676,Penny,2," Yeah, but why are you doing it on the stairs?",2
4677,Sheldon,2," I‰Ûªm a modern day Napoleon exiled to the Elba of the staircase because Leonard, get this, has a date.",2
4678,Penny,2," Oh. Oh, well, good for him. Yeah but, why are you sitting here, why don‰Ûªt you just go to a movie or something?",2
4679,Sheldon,2, Alone?,2
4680,Penny,2," Yeah, why not?",2
4681,Sheldon,2," What if I choke on my popcorn, who will administer the Heimlich manoeuvre.",2
4682,Penny,2, Well then don‰Ûªt order popcorn.,2
4683,Sheldon,2, No popcorn at the mo‰Û_ listen to yourself.,2
4684,Penny,2, Well why don‰Ûªt you go to a coffee shop.,2
4685,Sheldon,2, I don‰Ûªt drink coffee.,2
4686,Penny,2, They have other things.,2
4687,Sheldon,2, What do they have?,2
4688,Penny,2," I don‰Ûªt know, you know, cookies, pastries‰Û_",2
4689,Sheldon,2, Pastries such as bearclaws?,2
4690,Penny,2," Yeah, sure.",2
4691,Sheldon,2, I don‰Ûªt like bearclaws.,2
4692,Leslie (entering),2, Heya Penny. Dumbass.,2
4693,Sheldon,2," Leslie Winkle. Of all the overrated physicists in all the labs in all the world, why does it have to be Leslie Winkle?",2
4694,Penny,2," Well, they have a lot in common. I mean they‰Ûªre both scientists.",2
4695,Sheldon,2, Oh please. The only way she could make a contribution to science would be if they resume sending chimps into space.,2
4696,Penny,2," Okay, well I have a date too, so see ya.",2
4697,Sheldon,2," Everybody has a date. Even you, Mario, going after Princess Peach. And what am I doing, I‰Ûªm just enabling you.",2
4698,Scene,2, The apartment.,2
4699,Leslie,2, This is pretty good Orange Chicken.,2
4700,Leonard,2," Yeah, it‰Ûªs from Changs.",2
4701,Leslie,2, Not Chows?,2
4702,Leonard,2," No, Changs.",2
4703,Leslie,2, What happened to Chows?,2
4704,Leonard,2, It changed.,2
4705,Leslie,2," Oh. So, how many children do you think we should have? (Leonard splutters and coughs) I‰Ûªm sorry, that was a little abrupt.",2
4706,Leonard,2, A little.,2
4707,Leslie,2, I mean there are so many things to talk about before we discuss reproduction.,2
4708,Leonard,2, I sure hope so.,2
4709,Leslie,2," Besides shortness, what genetic weaknesses run in your family?",2
4710,Sheldon (entering),2," I‰Ûªm sorry to interrupt, batteries dying continue.",2
4711,Leslie,2," Uh, genetic weaknesses, right, um, there‰Ûªs the lactose intolerance.",2
4712,Sheldon (preparing an extension cord),2, Don‰Ûªt forget the male pattern baldness. When his uncles sit around the dinner table they look like a half carton of eggs. (Exits. Extension cord trails after him. Eventually goes tight a couple of times then falls loose.),2
4713,Leonard,2," Okay, now my uncles are bald, but my Aunt Edna is one of the hairiest women you will ever meet. So‰Û_ Sweet lady. It always tickles when she hugs me. (Sheldon knocks and enters again.) What now?",2
4714,Sheldon,2, I have to make pee-pee.,2
4715,Leonard,2," Listen, I‰Ûªm sorry about all of Sheldon‰Ûªs interruptions, he can be a bit of an eccentric.",2
4716,Leslie,2," If by eccentric you mean passive-aggressive East Texas blowhole, I agree.",2
4717,Leonard,2," Well, I think tonight was a very good start.",2
4718,Leslie,2, Me too. You‰Ûªre sure you‰Ûªre okay postponing intercourse until our relationship is past the initial viability test?,2
4719,Leonard,2," No problem, I‰Ûªm very skilled at postponing intercourse. So I guess I‰Ûªll call you and we‰Ûªll arrange another evening.",2
4720,Leslie,2, Yes. I believe protocol dictates that you wait a minimum of 18 hours before you call so I‰Ûªm not repulsed by your cloying eagerness.,2
4721,Leonard,2, Sure.,2
4722,Leslie,2," Again, it‰Ûªs your decision, you‰Ûªre the man.",2
4723,"Penny (voice off, ascending the stairs)",2," No, it wasn‰Ûªt my cat, it was an experiment designed by this guy named Schrodinger.",2
4724,Eric (appearing round corner with Penny),2, From the Charlie Brown cartoons?,2
4725,Penny,2," No, he was some kind of scientist, let me start again. Oh, hey Leonard.",2
4726,Leonard,2, Hello.,2
4727,Penny,2, Leslie.,2
4728,Leslie,2, Hi.,2
4729,Leonard,2," Okay, well, goodnight. (Leans in to kiss Leslie.)",2
4730,Penny,2," Okay, well, goodnight. (Grabs Eric and kisses him more passionately.) ",2
4731,Leslie (whispering),2," That ain‰Ûªt going to make your point. (Grabs him and tries to out-passion Penny. The two couples get more passionate trying to outdo each other until Leonard grabs Leslie‰Ûªs ass.) Okay, that‰Ûªs enough. (Sweetly) Call me (exits.)",2
4732,Leonard,2, Right (goes back inside flat. Closes door.),2
4733,Penny (breaking off kiss),2," Okay, goodnight.",2
4734,Eric,2, What?,2
4735,Penny,2," Had a great time, ciao (closes door.)",2
4736,Scene,2, The university lunch room.,2
4737,Sheldon,2," I‰Ûªm sorry, I am not going back to the Renaissance Fair.",2
4738,Howard,2," Come on, Sheldon, there‰Ûªs so few places I can wear my jester costume.",2
4739,Sheldon,2, I don‰Ûªt care. There are far too many historical anomalies for my comfort.,2
4740,Raj,2," Oh, okay, how about this. You can go dressed as a Star Trek science officer exploring a planet similar to Earth in the 1500s.",2
4741,Sheldon,2, You mean like Spock?,2
4742,Raj,2, Sure.,2
4743,Sheldon,2, Fascinating.,2
4744,Leslie (arriving),2, Hey fellow scientists. Sheldon.,2
4745,Leonard,2," Hey, why don‰Ûªt we all move over there so Leslie can join us.",2
4746,Howard,2," Hmm, let‰Ûªs do it. (Sheldon does not move. Leonard looks confused.)",2
4747,Sheldon,2," If you‰Ûªre having trouble deciding where to sit may I suggest one potato two potato, or as I call it the Leslie Winkle experimental methodology.",2
4748,Leonard,2, Don‰Ûªt make this hard for me.,2
4749,Sheldon,2," It‰Ûªs not hard. It‰Ûªs simple. You can either sit with me, your friend, colleague and roommate, or you can sit with an overrated scientist you might have sex with.",2
4750,Leonard,2," You‰Ûªre right, it is simple. (Sits with Leslie.)",2
4751,Scene,2, The stairs. Sheldon is playing on his computer at the end of the long extension cord.,2
4752,Penny,2," Hey, Sheldon.",2
4753,Sheldon,2, Penny.,2
4754,Penny,2," Third floor tonight. Mixing it up? (Sheldon indicates extension cord.) Oh. You know, I still don‰Ûªt understand why you just don‰Ûªt go to dinner or something.",2
4755,Sheldon,2," Alright, let‰Ûªs say I go to dinner alone. And during the meal I have to use the rest room. How do I know someone‰Ûªs not touching my food?",2
4756,Penny,2, Goodnight Sheldon.,2
4757,Sheldon,2," Penny, hold on. Are you sure things can‰Ûªt work out with you and Leonard?",2
4758,Penny,2, Excuse me?,2
4759,Sheldon,2, I‰Ûªm just wondering if you really gave it the old college try? Or in your case the old community college try?,2
4760,Penny,2," Okay, where is this coming from?",2
4761,Sheldon,2, Leonard is upstairs right now with my arch enemy.,2
4762,Penny,2, Your arch enemy?,2
4763,Sheldon,2," Yes, the Doctor Doom to my Mr Fantastic. The Doctor Octopus to my Spiderman. The Doctor Sivana to my Captain Marvel.",2
4764,Penny,2," Okay, I get it, I get it, I get it.",2
4765,Sheldon,2," Do you know, it‰Ûªs amazing how many supervillains have advanced degrees. Graduate school should probably do a better job of screening those people out.",2
4766,Penny,2," Sheldon, come back, you‰Ûªre losing me.",2
4767,Sheldon,2," Leslie Winkle, Penny. She belittles my research.",2
4768,Penny,2," Oh, sweetie, I‰Ûªm sorry.",2
4769,Sheldon,2, She called me dumbass.,2
4770,Penny,2, I know. I heard.,2
4771,Sheldon,2," Given this situation, I have no choice but to withdraw my previous objections to your ill considered relationship with Leonard.",2
4772,Penny,2," Oh, gee, well, thankyou for that. But, um, I think for now Leonard and I are just going to stay friends.",2
4773,Sheldon,2," No, that response is unacceptable to me.",2
4774,Penny,2," Sheldon, you are a smart guy, you must know‰Û_",2
4775,Sheldon,2, Smart? I‰Ûªd have to lose 60 IQ points to be classified as smart.,2
4776,Penny,2, Are you going to let me talk?,2
4777,Sheldon,2, I‰Ûªm sorry.,2
4778,Penny,2," You must know that if Leonard and Leslie want to be together, nothing you can do is going to stop it.",2
4779,Sheldon,2, You continue to underestimate my abilities madam.,2
4780,Penny,2," Okay, let me put it this way, if you‰Ûªre really Leonard‰Ûªs friend you will support him no matter who he wants to be with.",2
4781,Sheldon,2," Wait a minute, why am I doing all the giving here? If Leonard‰Ûªs really my friend, why doesn‰Ûªt he have to support me in my hatred of Leslie Winkle?",2
4782,Penny,2, Because love trumps hate.,2
4783,Sheldon,2, Oh now you‰Ûªre just making stuff up.,2
4784,Penny,2, Okay. Goodnight Sheldon.,2
4785,Sheldon,2," Oh Mario. If only I could control everyone the way I control you. Hop, you little plumber, hop, hop, hop.",2
4786,Scene,2, The apartment. Leonard and Leslie are kissing. ,2
4787,Sheldon (entering),2, When the two of you reach a natural stopping point I‰Ûªd like to have a word.,2
4788,Leonard,2," If the word is pee-pee, just do it.",2
4789,Sheldon,2," Leonard, you are my friend. And friends support their friends, apparently. So I am withdrawing my objection to your desire to have a relationship with Leslie.",2
4790,Leonard,2, Thank you.,2
4791,Sheldon,2," I will graciously overlook the fact that she is an arrogant sub-par scientist, who actually believes loop quantum gravity better unites quantum mechanics with general relativity than does string theory. You kids have fun.",2
4792,Leslie,2, Hang on a second. Loop quantum gravity clearly offers more testable predictions than string theory.,2
4793,Sheldon,2," I‰Ûªm listening, amuse me.",2
4794,Leslie,2," Okay, well, for one thing we expect quantii space-time to manifest itself as minute differences in the speed of light for different colours.",2
4795,Sheldon,2, Balderdash. Matter clearly consists of tiny strings.,2
4796,Leslie,2, Are you going to let him talk to me like that?,2
4797,Leonard,2," Okay, well, there is a lot of merit to both theories.",2
4798,Leslie,2," No there isn‰Ûªt, only loop quantum gravity calculates the entropy of black holes. (Sheldon grunts.)",2
4799,Leonard,2," Sheldon, don‰Ûªt make that noise, it‰Ûªs disrespectful.",2
4800,Sheldon,2," I hope so, it was a snort of derision.",2
4801,Leslie,2," You agree with me, right, loop quantum gravity is the future of physics.",2
4802,Leonard,2," Sorry Leslie, I guess I prefer my space stringy not loopy.",2
4803,Leslie,2," Well, I‰Ûªm glad I found out the truth about you before this went any further.",2
4804,Leonard,2," Truth, what truth? We‰Ûªre talking about untested hypotheses, uh, it‰Ûªs no big deal.",2
4805,Leslie,2," Oh, it isn‰Ûªt, really? Tell me Leonard, how would we raise the children?",2
4806,Leonard,2, I guess we let them wait until they‰Ûªre old enough and let them choose their own theory.,2
4807,Leslie,2," We can‰Ûªt let them choose, Leonard, they‰Ûªre children. (Storms off.)",2
4808,Leonard,2," Wait, where are you going?",2
4809,Leslie,2," I‰Ûªm sorry, I could have accepted our kids being genetically unable to eat ice-cream or ever get a good view of a parade, but this? This is a deal breaker. (Leaves.)",2
4810,Sheldon,2, Look on the bright side.,2
4811,Leonard,2, What‰Ûªs the bright side?,2
4812,Sheldon,2, Only nine more months to comic-con.,2
4813,Leonard,2, Oh yeah.,2
4814,Scene,2, The Renaissance Fair. The guys are in costume. Sheldon is Spock and has a tri-corder.,2
4815,Sheldon,2," Captain, I‰Ûªm getting an unusual reading.",2
4816,Leonard,2," Yeah, that‰Ûªs great, you guys want corn dogs?",2
4817,Howard,2, Yeah.,2
4818,Sheldon,2, That‰Ûªs a temporal anomaly. Corn dogs didn‰Ûªt come into existence until the first half of the twentieth century.,2
4819,Scene,3," The apartment. Sheldon is on the sofa, using his laptop. He is wearing a headset.",2
4820,Sheldon,3," Fellow warriors, this is Sheldor the Conqueror. We are about to enter Axel‰Ûªs fortress. Now this is a long run, so let‰Ûªs do another bladder check. Alright Barry, we‰Ûªll wait for you again, but you really should see a doctor. (There is banging at the door.) Sheldor is AFK. (Goes out to find Penny having trouble getting into her apartment.) Penny, are you experiencing some sort of difficulty?",2
4821,Penny,3," Yes, I can‰Ûªt get my stupid door open.",2
4822,Sheldon,3," You appear to have put your car key in the door lock, are you aware of that?",2
4823,Penny,3, Yeah!,2
4824,Sheldon,3, Alright then. (Turns to return inside. One of the grocery bags Penny is holding falls to the floor spilling groceries.) ,2
4825,Penny,3," Dammit, dammit, dammit, dammit, dammit, dammit.",2
4826,Sheldon,3, Would it be possible for you to do this a little more quietly?,2
4827,Penny,3, I can‰Ûªt get the damned key out.,2
4828,Sheldon,3," Well that‰Ûªs not surprising. That Baldwin lock on your door uses traditional edge mounted cylinders, whereas the key for your Volkswagon uses a centre cylinder system.",2
4829,Penny,3," Thankyou, Sheldon.",2
4830,Sheldon,3," You‰Ûªre welcome. Point of inquiry, why did you put your car key in the door lock?",2
4831,Penny,3," Why? I‰Ûªll tell you why. Because today I had an audition, it took me two hours to get there, I waited an hour for my turn, and before I could even start they told me I looked too Midwest for the part. Too Midwest? What the hell does that even mean?",2
4832,Sheldon,3," Well, the American Midwest was mostly settled by Scandinavian and Germanic peoples who, well they have a characteristic facial bone structure‰Û_.",2
4833,Penny,3," I know what it means, Sheldon! God, you know, I have been in L.A. for almost two years now, and I haven‰Ûªt got a single acting job, I have accomplished nothing, haven‰Ûªt gotten a raise at work, haven‰Ûªt even had sex in six months, and just now when I was walking up those stairs a fly flew in my mouth and I ate it.",2
4834,Sheldon,3," Well, actually, insects are a dietary staple in many cultures, they‰Ûªre almost pure protein.",2
4835,"Penny (picking up the bag she has just repacked, whereupon the bottom falls out and the groceries fall to the floor again)",3," Oh, sonofabitch!",2
4836,Sheldon,3," I believe the condensation on your frozen foods weakened the structural integrity of the bag. But returning to your key conundrum, perhaps you should call a locksmith and have him open the door for you.",2
4837,Penny,3," I did, and he said he‰Ûªll get here when he gets here.",2
4838,Sheldon,3, And you‰Ûªre frustrated because he phrased his reply in the form of a meaningless tautology?,2
4839,Penny,3, No! I am frustrated because I am a failure at everything and my breath smells like fly. (Bursts into tears.),2
4840,Sheldon,3, There there. (Reluctantly) Would you prefer to wait in our apartment?,2
4841,Penny,3," No Sheldon, I‰Ûªd rather sit on this freezing cold floor sobbing like a three year-old.",2
4842,Sheldon,3, Alright then. (Turns to go inside again.) ,2
4843,Penny,3, For God‰Ûªs sake! (Stomps into apartment.),2
4844,Sheldon,3, Just when I think I‰Ûªve gotten the hang of sarcasm.,2
4845,Scene,3, Inside the apartment.,2
4846,Sheldon,3, Make yourself comfortable. (Sits in Sheldon‰Ûªs place.) Not there. (Sits on other end of sofa. Puts feet on table. Sheldon looks disapprovingly. Removes feet from table. Sheldon sits and replaces headset.) Sheldor is back online.,2
4847,Penny,3, Sheldor?,2
4848,Sheldon,3, The Conqueror.,2
4849,Penny,3, What are you doing?,2
4850,Sheldon,3," AFK. I‰Ûªm playing Age of Conan, an online multiplayer game set in the universe of Robert E. Howard‰Ûªs Conan the Barbarian.",2
4851,Penny,3, Oh.,2
4852,Sheldon,3," Sheldor, back online.",2
4853,Penny,3, What‰Ûªs AFK?,2
4854,Sheldon,3, AFK. Away from keyboard.,2
4855,Penny,3, OIC.,2
4856,Sheldon,3, What does that stand for?,2
4857,Penny,3," Oh, I see?",2
4858,Sheldon,3," Yes, but what does it stand for?",2
4859,Scene,3," The stairwell. Leonard arrives and sees the spilled groceries. A cat is lapping at a spilled pot of ice-cream. Cut to inside. Penny now has the laptop, Sheldon is instructing her.",2
4860,Sheldon,3, Now just click on the enchanted boots to put them on.,2
4861,Penny,3," Oh, I don‰Ûªt know. Can I see them in another colour?",2
4862,Sheldon,3," Just click on them. Congratulations, you are now a level three warrior.",2
4863,Leonard,3, What‰Ûªs going on?,2
4864,Penny,3," Leonard, guess what, I‰Ûªm a level three warrior.",2
4865,Leonard,3," Great, you know there are groceries outside of your apartment?",2
4866,Penny,3," Yeah yeah yeah, shhh!",2
4867,Leonard,3, I only bring it up because your ice-cream is melting and it‰Ûªs starting to attract wildlife.,2
4868,Penny,3," Uh-huh, yeah, do I stay in the jungle or go towards the beach?",2
4869,Sheldon,3," It doesn‰Ûªt matter, right now you‰Ûªre looking for treasure.",2
4870,Penny,3," Okay. (Leonard motions for Sheldon to talk in the kitchen.) Wait, wait, where are you going?",2
4871,Sheldon,3," You‰Ûªre okay, if you run into crocodiles just kick them with your boots.",2
4872,Leonard,3, Want to catch me up?,2
4873,Sheldon,3," Well let‰Ûªs see, uh, she attempted to open her apartment with her car key, because her face is overly Midwestern, um, she hasn‰Ûªt had sex in six months, and she ate a fly.",2
4874,Leonard,3," Uh-huh. Seriously, six months?",2
4875,Penny,3," Oh my God, a treasure chest, I‰Ûªm rich!",2
4876,Sheldon,3, Level three and she thinks she‰Ûªs rich! What a noob.,2
4877,Scene,3, The apartment. Raj is pouring a white liquid into the main dish of a stereo speaker covered in cling film.,2
4878,Raj,3," Okay, we‰Ûªre all set.",2
4879,Howard,3, Let her rip.,2
4880,"Penny (entering, carrying a laptop)",3, Hi!,2
4881,Leonard,3," Hey, check it out, it‰Ûªs just corn starch and water.",2
4882,Sheldon,3," They make up a non-Newtonian fluid which is liquid, but solid under the percussive action of the speaker.",2
4883,Howard,3, That‰Ûªs what makes it get all funky.,2
4884,Penny,3," Yeah, okay. Listen, I need to talk to Sheldon.",2
4885,Howard (after Raj whispers in his ear),3," No, that‰Ûªs what she said, Sheldon.",2
4886,Penny,3," Okay, look, I bought the game, and I‰Ûªve been exploring the Island of Tordage but I can‰Ûªt figure out how to get past the guard captain.",2
4887,Sheldon,3, Do you have the enchanted sword?,2
4888,Penny,3," No, no, I‰Ûªve a bronze dagger.",2
4889,Sheldon,3," You can‰Ûªt slay the guard captain with a bronze dagger, my Lord it‰Ûªs like the car key in your apartment door all over again.",2
4890,Penny,3," Alright, alright, how do I get the sword?",2
4891,Sheldon,3," Well, have you been to the Temple of Mithra?",2
4892,Penny,3, Is that the place on the hill with the weird priests in front of it?,2
4893,Sheldon,3," No, no, no, it‰Ûªs‰Û_ oh for God‰Ûªs sakes, gimme. (Takes laptop.)",2
4894,Penny,3," Thank you, I really appreciate this.",2
4895,Sheldon,3," You‰Ûªre going to have to learn to do these things for yourself, Penny.",2
4896,Penny,3," Don‰Ûªt patronise me, just get the sword.",2
4897,Howard,3, What the frak?,2
4898,Leonard,3, Beats me. They were playing all last night too.,2
4899,Raj,3, It‰Ûªs like some kind of weird comic book crossover.,2
4900,Howard,3, Like if Hulk were dating Peppermint Patty.,2
4901,Raj,3, I always thought Peppermint Patty was a lesbian?,2
4902,Leonard,3," No, that‰Ûªs Marcie. Peppermint Patty‰Ûªs just athletic.",2
4903,Sheldon,3," There you go, one enchanted sword.",2
4904,Penny,3," Right, gimme, gimme, gimme, I want to kill the guard captain. (Leaves).",2
4905,Sheldon,3, That girl needs to get a life.,2
4906,Scene,3, Sheldon‰Ûªs bedroom. There is a knock on the door. Penny enters.,2
4907,Penny (whispering),3, Sheldon. (Sing-song) Shel-don.,2
4908,Sheldon,3," Danger, danger.",2
4909,Penny,3," No danger, look, it‰Ûªs just me, Penny, look, I got to level 25 and reached Purple Lotus Swamp, right?",2
4910,Sheldon,3, You‰Ûªre in my bedroom.,2
4911,Penny,3, Yeah. Leonard gave me an emergency key.,2
4912,Sheldon,3, People can‰Ûªt be in my bedroom.,2
4913,Penny,3," Okay, well can we go talk in the living room?",2
4914,Sheldon,3, I‰Ûªm not wearing pyjama bottoms.,2
4915,Penny,3, Why not?,2
4916,Sheldon,3, I spilled grape juice.,2
4917,Penny,3," Well, wear different pyjamas.",2
4918,Sheldon,3," I can‰Ûªt wear different pyjamas, these are my Monday pyjamas. Penny, people cannot be in my bedroom.",2
4919,Penny,3," Okay, just tell me, is it too soon to join a quest to the Black Castle?",2
4920,Sheldon,3, You were invited on a quest to the Black Castle?,2
4921,Penny,3," Yeah, yeah, by some guys in Budapest, I‰Ûªm just not sure it‰Ûªs the right move for my character.",2
4922,Sheldon,3," Of course it‰Ûªs not, you‰Ûªre only a level 25, the Hungarians are just using you for dragon fodder.",2
4923,Penny,3," Really? Boy, you‰Ûªd think you could trust a horde of Hungarian barbarians.",2
4924,Sheldon (off),3," Please Penny, enough, I have to sleep.",2
4925,Penny (off),3," Okay, well you were great, thanks. (Comes out door) Oh, hey Leonard, listen, don‰Ûªt got in Sheldon‰Ûªs room, he‰Ûªs not wearing bottoms.",2
4926,Leonard (knocking on door),3," Sheldon, you want to catch me up again?",2
4927,Scene,3, Dr Gablehauser‰Ûªs office. Sheldon and Leslie are standing across the desk. ,2
4928,Gablehauser,3," People, I am very busy today.",2
4929,Sheldon,3," I realise that Dr Gablehauser but it is your job, as head of the department, to mediate all inter-departmental disputes. University policy manual chapter four, subsection two, mediation of inter-departmental disputes.",2
4930,Gablehauser,3," Fine. Dr Winkle, what colourful name did you call Dr Cooper this time?",2
4931,Leslie,3, Dr Dumbass.,2
4932,Gablehauser,3," Dr Cooper, Dr Winkle apologises.",2
4933,Sheldon,3, No she doesn‰Ûªt.,2
4934,Leslie,3, No I don‰Ûªt.,2
4935,Sheldon,3," Here‰Ûªs the problem. I was clearly signed up to use the mainframe in Buckman 204, and Dr Winkle just wantonly ripped the sign-up sheet off the wall.",2
4936,Leslie,3, It wasn‰Ûªt even an official sign-up sheet. He printed it himself and he put his name down in every slot for the next six months.,2
4937,Sheldon,3," If it is a crime to ensure that the universities resources are not being squandered chasing sub-atomic wild geese then I plead guilty. (His phone rings.) Oh, Penny!",2
4938,Gablehauser,3, You need to get that Dr Cooper?,2
4939,Sheldon,3," God, no.",2
4940,Leslie,3," Well don‰Ûªt turn it off, you might miss your call from the Nobel committee letting you know you‰Ûªve been nominated as dumbass laureate of the year.",2
4941,Sheldon,3," Oh yeah, well, you wouldn‰Ûªt even be nominated. Dr Gablehauser, I have a series of important multi-bit calculations and simulations to run. All she‰Ûªs doing is reducing irrelevant data and making a mock‰Û_",2
4942,Gablehauser (as phone rings),3, Excuse me. Gablehauser. (Holding phone out to Sheldon) It‰Ûªs for you.,2
4943,Sheldon,3," Hello. Penny, this is not a good time. No, I told you, you‰Ûªre not prepared for the Sanctum of Burning Souls. You need to be in a group of at least five for that quest, and one should be a level 35 healer. Penny, I can‰Ûªt log on and help you. We‰Ûªll talk when I get home. (Puts phone down) I‰Ûªm not getting the computing time, am I?",2
4944,Leslie,3, Dumbass.,2
4945,Scene,3, The apartment. Sheldon enters.,2
4946,Sheldon,3," Leonard, you have to do something about Penny. She is interfering with my sleep, she‰Ûªs interfering with my work, and if I had another significant aspect of my life, I‰Ûªm sure she‰Ûªd be interfering with that too.",2
4947,Leonard,3," Why should I do something, you‰Ûªre the one who introduced her to online gaming.",2
4948,Sheldon,3," Well, yes, but you‰Ûªre the one who said hello to her when she moved in. If you‰Ûªd simply restrained yourself none of this would be happening.",2
4949,Leonard,3, Why don‰Ûªt you just tell her to leave you alone.,2
4950,Sheldon,3," I did. I told her, I texted her, I sent out a very emphatic twitter. I even changed my facebook status to Sheldon Cooper wishes Penny would leave him alone. I don‰Ûªt know what else to do.",2
4951,Leonard,3," Well, what am I supposed to do?",2
4952,Sheldon,3," I don‰Ûªt know, but if you don‰Ûªt figure something out, I warn you I shall become very difficult to live with.",2
4953,Leonard,3," You mean, up until now we‰Ûªve been experiencing the happy funtime Sheldon?",2
4954,Sheldon,3, Yes.,2
4955,Leonard,3, I‰Ûªll go talk to her.,2
4956,Scene,3, Penny‰Ûªs apartment. She is on her laptop and talking into a headset.,2
4957,Penny,3," No, Fritz, I need you on my flank. No, I don‰Ûªt know German. Flankenzie, flankenzie!",2
4958,Leonard (knocking and entering),3, Hey Penny.,2
4959,Penny,3, Busy.,2
4960,Leonard,3," Yeah, I see that. Shouldn‰Ûªt you be at work?",2
4961,Penny,3, I don‰Ûªt work on Mondays.,2
4962,Leonard,3," It‰Ûªs Thursday. Listen, Penny.",2
4963,Penny,3," Uh, Queen Penelope AFK. What?",2
4964,Leonard,3," Okay, um, here‰Ûªs the thing, um, sometimes people, good people, you know, they start playing these games and they find themselves through no fault of their own, you know, kind of, addicted.",2
4965,Penny,3," Yeah, get to the point, I‰Ûªm about to level up here.",2
4966,Leonard,3," Well, i-i-i-it‰Ûªs just if a person doesn‰Ûªt have a sense of achievement in their real life it‰Ûªs easy to lose themselves in a virtual world where they get a false sense of accomplishment.",2
4967,Penny,3," Yeah, jabber jabber jabber, okay boys, Queen Penelope‰Ûªs back online.",2
4968,Leonard,3," Penny, you‰Ûªve got cheetos in your hair.",2
4969,Penny (pulling cheeto out of hair),3," Oh, thanks. (Eats it.)",2
4970,Leonard,3, Wow.,2
4971,Scene,3, Same ‰ÛÒ later. Penny is attacking a multi-headed monster with a sword on the screen.A muscular warrior in a cape walks onto the screen.,2
4972,Warrior,3," Hey Penny, it‰Ûªs me again, Leonard.",2
4973,Penny- warrior,3," Leonard, I said not now.",2
4974,Leonard-warrior,3," Yeah, I know, I‰Ûªm just a little concerned about you.",2
4975,Penny-warrior,3, I said not now. (Chops off his head.),2
4976,Leonard-warrior‰Ûªs head,3," Okay, maybe later.",2
4977,Scene,3, The university lunch room.,2
4978,Raj,3, Hey guys.,2
4979,Leonard and Howard,3, Hey.,2
4980,Raj (indicating Sheldon),3," Hey, what‰Ûªs with him?",2
4981,Leonard,3, Penny‰Ûªs been keeping him up at night.,2
4982,Howard,3, Me too. But probably in a different way.,2
4983,Leonard,3," She‰Ûªs gotten really hooked on Age of Conan, she‰Ûªs playing non-stop.",2
4984,Raj,3," Ah, yes, online gaming addiction. There‰Ûªs nothing worse than having that multi-player monkey on your back.",2
4985,Leonard,3," Sheldon, wake up.",2
4986,Sheldon,3," Danger, danger.",2
4987,Leslie (arriving),3, Afternoon men. Sheldon.,2
4988,Sheldon,3," Oh yeah, well your attempt at juvenilizing me by excluding me from the set of adult males‰Û_. oh, I‰Ûªm too tired to do this.",2
4989,Leslie,3," Right, I heard you‰Ûªve been pulling all nighters with middle-earth Barbie.",2
4990,Sheldon,3, She comes into my room. No-one‰Ûªs supposed to be in my room.,2
4991,Leslie,3," Well, I would postulate that she‰Ûªs escaping into the online world to compensate for her sexual frustration.",2
4992,Howard,3, I do that too. But probably in a different way.,2
4993,Leonard,3," That‰Ûªs not what she‰Ûªs doing, Leslie, she‰Ûªs just trying to shore up her self esteem, it has nothing to do with sex.",2
4994,Leslie,3, Everything has to do with sex.,2
4995,Howard,3," Mmmm, testify. (Puts up hand for a handslap.)",2
4996,Leslie,3, I‰Ûªm not touching that.,2
4997,Leonard,3," Leslie, you are way off base here.",2
4998,Sheldon,3," Hang on, Leonard, while I have no respect for Leslie as a scientist, or a human being for that matter, we have to concede her undeniable expertise in the interrelated fields of promiscuity and general sluttiness.",2
4999,Leslie,3, Thank you. My point is that Tinkerbell just needs to get her some.,2
5000,Sheldon,3," Some what? Oh, yes, some sexual intercourse.",2
5001,Howard,3, I‰Ûªll take the bullet.,2
5002,Leonard,3," Excuse me, this whole idea is insane.",2
5003,Sheldon,3," Yeah, yeah, enough debate, I‰Ûªm going to take action. (Leans over to a good looking man on a nearby table.) Excuse me, are you currently involved in a sexual relationship?",2
5004,Man,3, No.,2
5005,Sheldon,3, Would you like to be?,2
5006,Man,3," Uh, sure, why not?",2
5007,Leonard,3, Sheldon‰Û_,2
5008,Sheldon,3, Zip it pip it. Can I have your phone number?,2
5009,Man,3," Uh‰Û_ (checks out Sheldon‰Ûªs package) Yeah, yeah. (Pulls out pen and writes it on Sheldon‰Ûªs hand.)",2
5010,Sheldon,3," There, problem solved.",2
5011,Leslie,3, Dumbass.,2
5012,Scene,3, Penny‰Ûªs flat. Penny is on her laptop. Everything around her is littered with empty food packaging and red bull cans. She burps loudly. Sheldon is sitting on the sofa.,2
5013,Penny,3," Okay, I‰Ûªm at the gate to the Treasury of the Ancients, I‰Ûªm going in.",2
5014,Sheldon,3, Stay close to the wall. Avoid the mummies.,2
5015,Penny,3, Got it.,2
5016,Sheldon,3," I must say, you‰Ûªre playing very well for a woman of 23?",2
5017,Penny,3,22,2
5018,Sheldon,3," Right. 22. (Cut to his screen, he is filling in an online dating profile.)",2
5019,Penny,3," Oh, here come the mummies, which spell do I use? The hateful strike, or the frenzy stance?",2
5020,Sheldon,3, What happened to the rest of your group?,2
5021,Penny,3," I dumped them, they‰Ûªre a bunch of wussies.",2
5022,Sheldon,3, Frenzy stance.,2
5023,Penny,3," Frenzy, frenzy, frenzy, frenzy, frenzy!",2
5024,Sheldon,3," So listen, would you describe your ideal vacation as a wild adventure to unknown lands, or staying at home curled up with a good book?",2
5025,Penny,3, What?,2
5026,Sheldon,3, These are market research questions. I‰Ûªm filling out the online registration for your game.,2
5027,Penny,3," Oh, okay, wild adventure. Oh, frenzy stance isn‰Ûªt working, die you undead mummy, die!",2
5028,Sheldon,3, Drink a healing potion.,2
5029,Penny,3, Thank you.,2
5030,Sheldon,3," You‰Ûªre welcome. Anyhow, on a scale of 1 to 5, with 1 being always initiated by him, and 5 being always initiated by you, how do you prefer your sexual encounters to begin?",2
5031,Penny,3, That‰Ûªs on the registration?,2
5032,Sheldon,3," Oh yes, it‰Ûªs quite extensive. But if we complete it, we get a free expansion pack, 75 additional quests.",2
5033,Penny,3," Ooh, awesome, okay, I totally like to initiate I‰Ûªm a big old five.",2
5034,Sheldon,3, Good to know. Big old five.,2
5035,Scene,3, The apartment. Leonard enters. There is a strange man sitting on the sofa.,2
5036,Leonard,3, Hello.,2
5037,Man,3, Hi.,2
5038,Sheldon,3," Leonard, this is Tom.",2
5039,Leonard,3, Hi Tom. Sheldon? Didn‰Ûªt I explain to you about your little mistake in the cafeteria?,2
5040,Sheldon,3," Yes, you were very clear, as was everyone else at the table. Tom, however, has been chosen by science as a suitable mate for Penny.",2
5041,Leonard,3, Chosen by science?,2
5042,Sheldon,3," Well, what passes for science on dating sites. They claim to use heuristic algorithms, but it may well be hokum.",2
5043,Leonard,3, You got Penny to sign up for online dating?,2
5044,Sheldon,3," No, of course not. No, I used trickery and deceit.",2
5045,Leonard,3, This is bad.,2
5046,Sheldon,3," Tom is a paramedic with the fire department, but he‰Ûªs going to med school at night, uh, he likes the outdoors, and, uh, strong women who initiate sex.",2
5047,Leonard,3," Really, really bad.",2
5048,Sheldon,3, I‰Ûªm surprised you struck out with Penny. Apparently she‰Ûªs a big old five.,2
5049,"Penny (entering, looking ratty in baggy clothes and with her hair unwashed)",3," Sheldon, what do you want.",2
5050,Sheldon,3," Oh, good, you got my note. Penny, I‰Ûªd like you to meet Tom, uh, Penny, this is Tom, Tom, may I present Penny.",2
5051,Tom,3, Hi Penny.,2
5052,Penny,3," Yeah, Hi, listen, as long as I‰Ûªm here, I‰Ûªm on a quest with a bunch of noobs, they don‰Ûªt know what they‰Ûªre doing, we‰Ûªve got one assassin, three spellcasters and no tank.",2
5053,Sheldon,3, Can we talk about this later.,2
5054,Penny,3," No, no, no, no, I need you now.",2
5055,Sheldon,3," But wouldn‰Ûªt you prefer to socialise with Tom, who is a sexually passive outdoorsman.",2
5056,Penny,3," Whatever, I‰Ûªll figure it out myself.",2
5057,Tom,3," Bye, Penny. I‰Ûªm sorry, dude, she didn‰Ûªt look anything like her picture.",2
5058,Leonard,3, They never do.,2
5059,Scene,3, Inside the game. Penny-warrior is standing next to a battle horse. ,2
5060,Warrior,3," Hello, fair Penny.",2
5061,Penny-warrior,3, Who are you?,2
5062,Warrior,3," It is I, Sir Howard of Wolowitz. Can I interest you in an afternoon of spirited questing, followed by a flagon of ale at yon virtual tavern?",2
5063,Penny-warrior,3," Yeah, sure, why not?",2
5064,Penny,3," Oh my God, I need help. (Closes laptop and throws it away.) ",2
5065,Scene,4, The apartment. Leonard is sorting out Chinese food.,2
5066,Leonard,4," Let‰Ûªs see, Raj was the Kung Palo Chicken.",2
5067,Penny,4, I‰Ûªm the dumplings.,2
5068,Howard,4," Yes, you are.",2
5069,Penny,4," Creepy, Howard.",2
5070,Howard,4, Creepy good or creepy bad?,2
5071,Leonard,4, Who was the Shrimp with Lobster Sauce?,2
5072,Howard,4," That would be me. Come to Poppa, you un-kosher delight. (To Penny) I‰Ûªm not necessarily talking to the food.",2
5073,Penny,4, Sit over there.,2
5074,"Sheldon (entering, to Penny who is in his spot)",4, Sit over there. Baby wipe?,2
5075,Penny,4, What do you have‰Û_.,2
5076,Leonard and Howard together,4, Don‰Ûªt! Don‰Ûªt! Don‰Ûªt!,2
5077,Sheldon,4, I‰Ûªll tell you why.,2
5078,Leonard and Howard,4, O-o-o-oh!,2
5079,Sheldon,4, I had to sanitize my hands because the university replaced the paper towels in the rest rooms with hot air blowers.,2
5080,Penny,4, I thought the blowers were more sanitary?,2
5081,Leonard and Howard,4, Why? Don‰Ûªt!,2
5082,Sheldon,4, Hot air blowers are incubators and spewers of bacteria and pestilence. Frankly it would be more hygienic if they just had a plague infested gibbon sneeze my hands dry.,2
5083,Raj (entering excitedly),4," Hey guys, I just got the most amazing new‰Û_ (spots Penny) ew-ew-ew",2
5084,Penny,4," Gosh, Raj, do you think you‰Ûªll ever be able to talk in front of me without being drunk? (Shakes head.) Okay, well, I‰Ûªll just, um, go eat by myself.",2
5085,Leonard,4," Penny, you don‰Ûªt have to do that.",2
5086,Penny,4," No, it‰Ûªs okay, between (indicates Raj) him not talking, (indicates Sheldon) him talking and‰Û_ (indicates Howard) him, I‰Ûªm better off alone, so, (to Raj) goodbye you poor strange little man (gives him a kiss and exits.) ",2
5087,Raj,4, She‰Ûªs so considerate.,2
5088,Howard,4, So what‰Ûªs your news?,2
5089,Raj,4, Remember that little planetary object I spotted beyond the Kuiper belt?,2
5090,Leonard,4," Oh yeah, two zero zero eight NQ sub seventeen.",2
5091,Raj,4," Or as I called it, Planet Bollywood. Anyway, because of my discovery, People magazine is naming me one of their thirty under-30 to watch.",2
5092,Leonard and Howard together,4," Well, wow, that‰Ûªs incredible.",2
5093,Sheldon,4," Excuse me. Thirty what, under thirty what, to watch what?",2
5094,Raj,4, Thirty visionaries under thirty years of age to watch as they challenge the preconceptions of their fields.,2
5095,Sheldon,4, If I had a million guesses I never would have gotten that.,2
5096,Raj,4," It‰Ûªs pretty cool, they‰Ûªve got me in with a guy who‰Ûªs doing something about hunger in Indonesia, and a psychotherapist who‰Ûªs using dolphins to rehabilitate prisoners, and Ellen Page, star of the charming independent film Juno.",2
5097,Howard,4," Oh, I‰Ûªd so do her.",2
5098,Leonard,4, You‰Ûªd do the dolphins.,2
5099,Howard,4, Do I get an honourable mention for designing the telescope camera mounting bracket you used.,2
5100,Raj,4," Sorry, it‰Ûªs not part of my heartwarming and personal narrative, in which a humble boy from New Delhi overcame poverty and prejudice and journeyed to America to reach for the stars.",2
5101,Howard,4," Poverty? Your father‰Ûªs a gynaecologist, he drives a Bentley.",2
5102,Raj,4, It‰Ûªs a lease.,2
5103,Sheldon,4, I‰Ûªm confused. Was there some sort of peer review committee to determine which scientists would be included?,2
5104,Raj,4, Peer review? It‰Ûªs People magazine. People picked me.,2
5105,Sheldon,4, What people?,2
5106,Raj,4, The people from People.,2
5107,Sheldon,4," Yeah, but exactly who are these people? What are their credentials, how are they qualified, what makes accidentally noticing a hunk of rock that‰Ûªs been traipsing around the solar system for billions of years more noteworthy than any other scientific accomplishment made by someone under thirty?",2
5108,Raj,4," Boy, I bet Ellen Pages friends aren‰Ûªt giving her this kind of crap.",2
5109,Leonard,4, Are you proud of yourself?,2
5110,Sheldon,4," In general, yes.",2
5111,Scene,4, Sheldon‰Ûªs office. He is making annotations on his board.,2
5112,Sheldon,4," Oh, there‰Ûªs my missing neutrino. You were hiding from me as an unbalanced charge, weren‰Ûªt you, you little subatomic Dickens?",2
5113,Leonard (entering with Howard),4, Hi Sheldon.,2
5114,Sheldon,4," Here, look, look, I found my missing neutrino.",2
5115,Howard,4," Oh, good, we can take it off the milk cartons.",2
5116,Leonard,4," Well, we‰Ûªre going to go apologise to Raj and invite him out to dinner.",2
5117,Sheldon,4," Apologise, for what?",2
5118,Leonard,4," Well, he came over last night with some pretty good news, and we weren‰Ûªt very supportive.",2
5119,Sheldon,4, I sense you‰Ûªre trying to tell me something.,2
5120,Howard,4, You were a colossal ass-hat.,2
5121,Sheldon,4," Oh! No, I beg to differ. Of the three of us, I was by far the most supportive.",2
5122,Leonard,4," Really, do tell.",2
5123,Sheldon,4," How will Raj ever reach true greatness if his friends lower the bar for him? When I was eleven, my sister bought our father a ‰ÛÏworld‰Ûªs greatest dad‰Û coffee mug, and frankly the man coasted until the day he died.",2
5124,Leonard,4," Okay, let‰Ûªs try it this way, what if the People magazine thing is the best Raj is ever going to achieve?",2
5125,Sheldon,4, I had not considered that.,2
5126,Leonard,4, Come on.,2
5127,Sheldon,4, I often forget other people have limitations. It‰Ûªs so sad.,2
5128,Howard,4, He can feel sadness?,2
5129,Leonard,4," Not really, it‰Ûªs what you and I would call condescension.",2
5130,Scene,4, Outside Raj‰Ûªs office.,2
5131,Leonard,4," And when we go in there, let‰Ûªs show Raj that we‰Ûªre happy for him.",2
5132,Sheldon,4, But I‰Ûªm not.,2
5133,Howard,4," Well then fake it. Look at me, I could be grinding on the fact that without my stabilizing telescope mount he never would have found that stupid little clump of cosmic schmutz, but I‰Ûªm bigger than that.",2
5134,Sheldon,4," Fine, what do you want me to do?",2
5135,Leonard,4," Smile. (He does, exaggeratedly.)",2
5136,Howard,4," Oh crap, that‰Ûªs terrifying.",2
5137,Leonard,4," We‰Ûªre here to see Koothrappali, not kill Batman.",2
5138,Howard,4, Try less teeth. (Does. It isn‰Ûªt much better.),2
5139,Leonard,4," Close enough, come on. (Knocking and entering.) Hi Raj.",2
5140,Raj,4," Hey guys, what‰Ûªs up?",2
5141,Howard,4, We just wanted to invite you out to dinner tonight.,2
5142,Leonard,4, Celebrate your thirty under thirty thing. Right Sheldon? (He smiles.) ,2
5143,Raj,4," It‰Ûªs very nice of you, I would like that.",2
5144,Gablehauser (entering),4, Hello boys.,2
5145,Raj,4, Dr Gablehouser.,2
5146,Gablehauser,4, Dr Koothrappali.,2
5147,Leonard,4, Dr Gablehauser.,2
5148,Gablehauser,4, Dr Hoffstadter.,2
5149,Sheldon,4, Dr Gablehauser.,2
5150,Gablehauser,4, Dr Cooper.,2
5151,Howard,4, Dr Gablehauser.,2
5152,Gablehauser,4," Mister Wolowitz. Boys, I‰Ûªve got a question for you. Who in this room discovered a star?",2
5153,Raj,4," Actually, 2008 NQ sub 17 is a planetary body.",2
5154,Gablehauser,4," I‰Ûªm not talking about you, I‰Ûªm talking about me. You, my exotic young friend are my star.",2
5155,Sheldon,4," Well, you didn‰Ûªt discover him, you merely noticed he was here, much like he did with 2008 NQ sub 17.",2
5156,Leonard,4, Sheldon!,2
5157,Sheldon,4," Oh, sorry. (Smiles)",2
5158,Gablehauser,4," Well, we‰Ûªve got to get you into a better office, something more suited to your status.",2
5159,Raj,4," Really, you don‰Ûªt have to go to any trouble.",2
5160,Gablehauser,4, How about if I put you in Von Gerlick‰Ûªs old office?,2
5161,Raj,4," I‰Ûªd rather have Fishbine‰Ûªs, it‰Ûªs bigger.",2
5162,Gablehauser,4, Done.,2
5163,Howard,4," Wait a minute, I called dibs on Fishbine‰Ûªs office the day he started showing up at work in his bathrobe.",2
5164,Sheldon,4," He gets a new office, I can‰Ûªt even get paper towels in the men‰Ûªs room?",2
5165,Leonard,4, Sheldon.,2
5166,Sheldon,4," Damn, this is hard. (Smiles) ",2
5167,Gablehauser,4," Let me ask you something, what do you think the business of this place is?",2
5168,"Leonard (after he, Sheldon and Howard whisper to each other)",4, Science?,2
5169,Gablehauser,4, Money.,2
5170,Howard,4, Told you.,2
5171,Gablehauser,4," And this boy‰Ûªs picture in People magazine is going to raise us a pile of money taller than‰Û_ well, taller than you (ruffling Howard‰Ûªs hair.) ",2
5172,Howard,4, I have a master‰Ûªs degree.,2
5173,Gablehauser,4," Who doesn‰Ûªt? Dr Koothrappali, have you ever had lunch in the President‰Ûªs dining room?",2
5174,Raj,4, I didn‰Ûªt even know there was a President‰Ûªs dining room.,2
5175,Gablehauser,4," It‰Ûªs the same food as the Cafeteria, only fresh. Come on little buddy.",2
5176,Raj,4," Okay, big buddy. See you tonight guys. (They leave.)",2
5177,Leonard,4, You can stop smiling now.,2
5178,Sheldon,4, Aaaah!,2
5179,Scene,4, A restaurant.,2
5180,Raj,4," So anyway, after a fantastic lunch I was whisked off to the People magazine photo shoot‰Û_ have any of you boys ever been to a photo shoot?",2
5181,Leonard,4, No.,2
5182,Raj,4," It‰Ûªs fantastic, apparently the camera loves me and I it. They shot me in front of a starry background where I posed like this. (Stares into space.) They‰Ûªre going to digitally add a supernova, they say it‰Ûªs the perfect metaphor for my incandescent talent.",2
5183,Sheldon,4," Right, a ball of hot flaming gas that collapses in on itself. (Leonard nudges him. He smiles. Phone rings.) ",2
5184,Raj,4," Excuse me. Oh, it‰Ûªs my assistant Trevor. Go for Koothrappali. Uh-huh.",2
5185,Howard,4, They gave him an assistant? If I want a new pen I have to go to the bank with wire cutters.,2
5186,Sheldon (still smiling),4, Have we at this point met our social obligations?,2
5187,Leonard,4, Not yet.,2
5188,Raj,4," Okay, just put it on my calendar but start thinking of a reason why I can‰Ûªt go, alrighty? Koothrappali out. God bless that boy, I don‰Ûªt know what I‰Ûªd do without him.",2
5189,Leonard,4, You just got him this afternoon.,2
5190,Raj,4," Yes, but I‰Ûªm finding that having a lackey suits me.",2
5191,Leonard,4, A lackey?,2
5192,Raj,4," Oh, I‰Ûªm sorry, is that politically incorrect? In India we just call them untouchables.",2
5193,Sheldon,4, Now?,2
5194,Leonard,4, Almost.,2
5195,Raj,4," Speaking of untouchables, I‰Ûªve got great news for you guys. People magazine is having a reception this Saturday, and I managed to get you invited.",2
5196,Howard,4," Oh, gee, thanks.",2
5197,Raj,4," Oh, you‰Ûªre welcome. Of course, I couldn‰Ûªt get you into the VIP section, because, you know, that‰Ûªs for VIPs, and you guys are just, you know, Ps.",2
5198,Sheldon,4," There‰Ûªs a tribe in Papua New Guinea where, when a hunter flaunts his success to the rest of the village they kill him, and drive away evil spirits with a drum made of his skin. Superstitious nonsense of course, but one can see their point. (Smiles)",2
5199,Penny (bringing another grasshopper),4," Here you go, Raj, you might want to drink this one slowly.",2
5200,Raj,4," Okay, so, Saturday night, can I count on my posse?",2
5201,Howard,4," Gee, I‰Ûªd love to Raj, but I can‰Ûªt make it.",2
5202,Raj,4," Oh, okay, Leonard?",2
5203,Leonard,4," Well, uh, no I‰Û_ the‰Û_ no.",2
5204,Raj,4, Sheldon?,2
5205,Sheldon,4," I can make it, but I won‰Ûªt.",2
5206,Penny,4, What are you guys talking about?,2
5207,Raj,4," Well, there‰Ûªs a reception for my magazine article on Saturday.",2
5208,Penny,4," And you guys aren‰Ûªt going? I can‰Ûªt believe you, Raj is celebrating a tremendous accomplishment and you‰Ûªre not even going to be there to support him?",2
5209,Sheldon,4, A tremendous accomplishment would be if the planetary body he discovered were plummeting toward Earth and he exploded it with his mind.,2
5210,Howard,4, That would be cool. I‰Ûªd go to that reception.,2
5211,Penny,4," Come on, this is huge, Raj is going to be in People magazine. And he didn‰Ûªt even have to knock up one of the Spears sisters.",2
5212,Raj,4, Would you like to go with me?,2
5213,Penny,4," Of course I would, I would be honoured.",2
5214,Raj,4, Really? Cool.,2
5215,Penny,4, Shame on you guys. (Leaves),2
5216,Raj,4, Look at that. I got a date with Penny. I can‰Ûªt believe it took you a whole year.,2
5217,Sheldon,4, Now?,2
5218,Leonard,4," Now. (They all get up and leave. Raj looks around himself, then leans over to the next table.)",2
5219,Raj,4," Hey, buddy. I‰Ûªm going to be in people magazine.",2
5220,Charlie Sheen (turning round),4," Yeah, call me when you‰Ûªre on the cover.",2
5221,Scene,4," Outside Penny‰Ûªs door. Raj in a suit knocks on the door with his foot as he has a glass of champagne in both hands. He drinks one. Penny opens door, she is dressed up also.",2
5222,Penny,4," Oh, Raj, look at you!",2
5223,Raj,4," I know, I am resplendent like the noonday sun, am I not?",2
5224,Penny,4," Um, yeah, starting with the champagne a little early aren‰Ûªt you?",2
5225,Raj,4," It was in the limo. They sent a limo. I have a limo. I just love saying limo. Here, sip on this while you‰Ûªre getting ready.",2
5226,Penny,4," Oh, I‰Ûªm ready.",2
5227,Raj,4, That‰Ûªs what you‰Ûªre wearing.,2
5228,Penny,4," Um, yeah, why what‰Ûªs wrong with it?",2
5229,Raj,4," Nothing, I was just hoping for something a little more, you know, redonkulous.",2
5230,Penny,4," Yeah, well, this is all the donkulous you‰Ûªre gonna get.",2
5231,Raj,4," Okey dokey, let‰Ûªs roll. Alright, it‰Ûªs time to raise the roof. Oo-ooh, oo-ooh.",2
5232,Penny (to Leonard who is just coming up the stairs),4, Hey Leonard.,2
5233,Leonard,4, Hey.,2
5234,Raj,4, Dude.,2
5235,Leonard,4, You look very nice.,2
5236,Raj and Penny together,4, Thank you.,2
5237,Penny,4," Uh, come on, good night Leonard.",2
5238,Leonard,4, Good night.,2
5239,Raj,4," Hey, Leonard, did you see my limo downstairs.",2
5240,Leonard,4, Yeah.,2
5241,Raj,4, It‰Ûªs bigger than the house my grandfather grew up in.,2
5242,Leonard,4, Terrific.,2
5243,Raj,4, It has more food too.,2
5244,Penny,4," Alright, come on, come on.",2
5245,"Raj (leaving, singing)",4, I‰Ûªm coming up so you better get this party started.,2
5246,Leonard (entering apartment),4, Hey.,2
5247,Howard,4," Hey, good news, you don‰Ûªt have to sulk about Penny any more, look, there are hundreds of Croatian women just waiting for you to contact them.",2
5248,Leonard,4, Anythingforagreencard.com?,2
5249,Howard,4," I‰Ûªll lend you my user name, it‰Ûªs wealthybigpenis.",2
5250,Leonard,4, You‰Ûªre joking.,2
5251,Howard,4," Well, you gotta make it easy for them, they‰Ûªre just learning English.",2
5252,Leonard,4, Pass.,2
5253,Howard,4, So you‰Ûªre just going to sit around here and mope while Penny is out with Doctor Apu from the Kwik-e-Mart?,2
5254,Leonard,4," It‰Ûªs not a date, and that‰Ûªs racist.",2
5255,Howard,4," It can‰Ûªt be racist, he‰Ûªs a beloved character on the Simpsons.",2
5256,Leonard,4, Let‰Ûªs just eat so I can get to bed. With any luck tonight will be the night my sleep apnoea kills me.,2
5257,Sheldon,4, Did you remember to ask for the chicken with broccoli to be diced not shredded?,2
5258,Leonard,4, Yes.,2
5259,Sheldon,4, Even though the menu description specifies shredded?,2
5260,Leonard,4, Yes.,2
5261,Sheldon,4," Brown rice, not white?",2
5262,Leonard,4, Yes.,2
5263,Sheldon,4, Did you stop at the Korean grocery and get the good hot mustard.,2
5264,Leonard,4, Yes.,2
5265,Sheldon,4, Did you pick up the low sodium soy sauce from the market?,2
5266,Leonard,4, Yes.,2
5267,Sheldon,4, Thank you.,2
5268,Leonard,4, You‰Ûªre welcome.,2
5269,Sheldon,4, What took you so long?,2
5270,Leonard,4, Just sit down and eat.,2
5271,Sheldon,4, Fine. (Opens carton. Shows it to Leonard in disgust.),2
5272,Leonard,4," Alright, it‰Ûªs shredded, what do you want me to do?",2
5273,Sheldon,4, I want you to check before you accept the order.,2
5274,Leonard,4, Sorry.,2
5275,Sheldon,4, Were you distracted by the possibility that Koothrappali might have intercourse with Penny tonight?,2
5276,Leonard,4, He‰Ûªs not going to have intercourse with Penny.,2
5277,Sheldon,4," Then there‰Ûªs no excuse for this chicken. You know, this situation with Koothrapali brings to mind a story from my childhood.",2
5278,Howard,4," Oh goody, more tales from the panhandle.",2
5279,Sheldon,4," That‰Ûªs Northwest Texas, I‰Ûªm from East Texas, the Gulf region, home to many Vietnamese shrimpers.",2
5280,Leonard,4, Do the shrimpers feature in your story?,2
5281,Sheldon,4," No. Anyway, when I was eight, a Montgomery-Ward delivery van ran over our cat, Lucky.",2
5282,Howard,4, Lucky?,2
5283,Sheldon,4," Yes, Lucky.",2
5284,Leonard,4," He‰Ûªs irony impaired, just move on.",2
5285,Howard,4," Okay, dead cat named Lucky, continue.",2
5286,Sheldon,4," While others mourned Lucky, I realised his untimely demise provided me with the opportunity to replace him with something more suited to my pet needs. A faithful companion that I could snuggle with at night, and yet would be capable of killing upon telepathic command.",2
5287,Howard,4," So, not a puppy?",2
5288,Sheldon,4," Please, no, nothing so pedestrian. I wanted a griffin.",2
5289,Leonard,4, A griffin?,2
5290,Sheldon,4," Yes, half eagle, half lion.",2
5291,Leonard,4, And mythological.,2
5292,Sheldon,4," Irrelevant. See, I was studying recombinant DNA technology and I was confident I could create one, but my parents were unwilling to secure the necessary eagle eggs and lion semen. Course my sister got swimming lessons when she wanted them.",2
5293,Howard,4," Sheldon, not that we don‰Ûªt all enjoy a good lion semen story, what‰Ûªs your point.",2
5294,Sheldon,4," My point is, if Koothrappali is moving on to a new life of shallow, undeserved fame, perhaps this is an opportunity to create a better cohort.",2
5295,Leonard,4, You want to breed a new friend?,2
5296,Sheldon,4," That‰Ûªs one option, but who has the time? But consider this, the Japanese, they‰Ûªre doing some wonderful work with artificial intelligence, now, you combine that with some animatronics from the imagineers over at Disney, next thing you know, we‰Ûªre playing Halo with a multi-lingual Abraham Lincoln.",2
5297,Howard,4," Sheldon, don‰Ûªt take this the wrong way, but, you‰Ûªre insane.",2
5298,Leonard,4," That may well be, but the fact is, it wouldn‰Ûªt kill us to meet some new people.",2
5299,Sheldon,4," Uh, for the record, it could kill us to meet new people. They could be murderers, or the carriers of unusual pathogens, and I‰Ûªm not insane, my mother had me tested.",2
5300,Leonard,4," If we do get a new friend, he should be a guy you can trust. A guy who has your back.",2
5301,Howard,4," And he should have a lot of money, and live in a cool place down by the beach where we could throw parties.",2
5302,Sheldon,4, He should share our love of technology.,2
5303,Howard,4, And he should know a lot of women.,2
5304,Leonard,4," Yeah, let‰Ûªs see, money, women, technology, okay we‰Ûªre agreed, our new friend is going to be Iron Man.",2
5305,Scene,4, Raj‰Ûªs apartment. Raj is heard singing in a drunk voice through the door. He enters with his arm around Penny.,2
5306,Raj,4, Welcome to the Raj Mahal.,2
5307,Penny,4," Yes, it‰Ûªs very nice, goodnight Raj.",2
5308,Raj,4," No, wait, the evening‰Ûªs not over.",2
5309,Penny,4, Yes it is.,2
5310,Raj,4," No, it‰Ûªs time to put on some R. Kelly and suck face.",2
5311,Penny,4," Oh, wow, is the evening over.",2
5312,Raj (as a ringing noise is heard),4," Wait, wait, that‰Ûªs my mummy and daddy calling from India. I want you to meet my parents.",2
5313,Penny,4," Wait, meet them.",2
5314,"Raj (inhales deeply, picks up laptop, presses a button. His mother and father appear on the screen)",4," Hello mummy and daddy, good to see you. I‰Ûªm not drunk.",2
5315,Mrs Koothrappali,4, Why would you say that?,2
5316,Raj,4," Just making conversation. Mummy, daddy, I want you to meet my new squeeze, Penny.",2
5317,Penny,4, I am not your squeeze. There is no squeezing.,2
5318,Dr Koothrappali,4," I can‰Ûªt see her, centre her in the frame.",2
5319,Raj,4," Here you go, cute huh?",2
5320,Mrs Koothrappali,4, She‰Ûªs not Indian.,2
5321,Dr Koothrappali,4," So, she‰Ûªs not Indian, the boy‰Ûªs just sowing some wild oats.",2
5322,Penny,4," No, no, there‰Ûªs no sowing, no squeezing, and no sucking face.",2
5323,Mrs Koothrappali,4, What if he gets her pregnant. Is this little hotsy-totsy who you want as the mother of your grandchildren.,2
5324,Raj,4, What right do you have to pick who I can have children with?,2
5325,Dr Koothrappali,4," Look, Rajesh, I understand, you‰Ûªre in America, you want to try the local cuisine. But trust me, you don‰Ûªt want it for a steady diet.",2
5326,Raj,4," Now you listen to me, I am no longer a child, and I will not be spoken to like one. Now if you‰Ûªd excuse me, I have to go throw up.",2
5327,Mrs Koothrappali,4, What‰Ûªs wrong with him?,2
5328,Penny,4," I don‰Ûªt know, maybe it‰Ûªs the local cuisine. Okay, well, it‰Ûªs nice to meet you, just gonna set you on down over here, and I‰Ûªm going to leave so, Namaste. (Leaves, then almost immediately returns) And FYI, you‰Ûªd be lucky to have me as a daughter-in-law.",2
5329,Dr Koothrappali,4, She‰Ûªs feisty. I like that.,2
5330,Scene,4, Penny‰Ûªs apartment. She is in her bathrobe. A note slides under the door. ,2
5331,Penny (opening door to find Raj outside),4," Raj, what are you doing. (He hands her the note). No. No notes. If you have something to say to me, say it.",2
5332,"Raj (tries several times. Finally, in a high pitched squeak)",4, Sorry.,2
5333,Penny,4," Oh, sweetie, it‰Ûªs okay. (She hugs him. As she does, Leonard exits his apartment to see Penny, in bathrobe, hugging Raj who is apparently about to leave. As she goes back inside, Raj turns, smiles, and puts both thumbs up. Leonard turns, with an upset look, to Sheldon who is standing behind him. Sheldon gives him his exaggerated smile.)",2
5334,Scene,5," The apartment. Leonard enters, drops his keys in the bowl by the door, then collapses onto the settee. Sheldon enters from the bedroom area.",2
5335,Sheldon,5," Good morning, Leonard.",2
5336,Leonard,5, Uh-huh.,2
5337,Sheldon,5," Yeah, we‰Ûªre going to have to stop by Pottery Barn on the way to work, I bought these Star Wars sheets but they turned out to be much too stimulating to be compatible with a good night‰Ûªs sleep. I don‰Ûªt like the way Darth Vader stares at me.",2
5338,Leonard,5, I‰Ûªm not going to work.,2
5339,Sheldon,5," Oh, just because your career‰Ûªs been stagnant for a few years, that‰Ûªs no reason to give up.",2
5340,Leonard,5," Sheldon, I was up all night using the new free-electron laser for my X-ray diffraction experiment.",2
5341,Sheldon,5, Did the laser accidentally burn out your retinas?,2
5342,Leonard,5, No.,2
5343,Sheldon,5, Then you can drive. Let‰Ûªs go.,2
5344,Leonard,5," Didn‰Ûªt I tell you I‰Ûªd be working nights, and that you‰Ûªd have to make other arrangements.",2
5345,Sheldon,5, You did.,2
5346,Leonard,5, And?,2
5347,Sheldon,5, I didn‰Ûªt. Let‰Ûªs go.,2
5348,Leonard,5," Goodnight, Sheldon.",2
5349,Sheldon,5, But how am I going to get to work?,2
5350,Leonard,5, Take the bus.,2
5351,Sheldon,5, I can‰Ûªt take the bus any more. They don‰Ûªt have seatbelts. And they won‰Ûªt let you lash yourself to the seat with bungee cords.,2
5352,Leonard,5, You tried to lash yourself to the seat with bungee cords?,2
5353,Sheldon,5," I didn‰Ûªt try, I succeeded. For some reason it alarmed the other passengers and I was asked to de-bus.",2
5354,Leonard,5," Oh, you‰Ûªre a big boy, you‰Ûªll figure it out.",2
5355,Sheldon,5," Don‰Ûªt talk to me like I‰Ûªm a child. Now, take me to return my star wars sheets!",2
5356,Scene,5, Outside Penny‰Ûªs apartment.,2
5357,Sheldon,5," (Knock, knock, knock) Penny, (knock, knock, knock) Penny, (knock, knock, knock) Penny‰Û_",2
5358,Penny (opening door),5," Sheldon, what is it?",2
5359,Sheldon,5, Leonard‰Ûªs asleep.,2
5360,Penny,5, Thanks for the update (begins to close door.),2
5361,Sheldon,5," No, wait. You have to drive me to work.",2
5362,Penny,5," Yeah, uh, I really don‰Ûªt think I do.",2
5363,Sheldon,5," But I don‰Ûªt drive, and I can‰Ûªt take the bus.",2
5364,Penny,5," Yeah, honey, you‰Ûªll be fine as long as you don‰Ûªt do that bungee cord thing, okay?",2
5365,Sheldon,5, Penny. Didn‰Ûªt you recently state that you and I are friends?,2
5366,Penny,5," Yes, Sheldon, we are friends.",2
5367,Sheldon,5, Then I hereby invoke what I‰Ûªm given to understand is an integral part of the implied covenant of friendship. The favour.,2
5368,Penny,5," Oh, dear God.",2
5369,Sheldon,5," I‰Ûªm sorry, I didn‰Ûªt realize I was interrupting your morning prayers. When you‰Ûªre done, we‰Ûªll go.",2
5370,Scene,5, Inside Penny‰Ûªs car.,2
5371,Sheldon,5, Thank you for driving me to work.,2
5372,Penny,5," You know this is my day off, Sheldon.",2
5373,Sheldon,5," Oh, good. I‰Ûªm not keeping you from anything. Your check engine light is on.",2
5374,Penny,5, Mm-hmm.,2
5375,Sheldon,5," Typically that‰Ûªs an indicator. To, you know, check your engine.",2
5376,Penny,5," It‰Ûªs fine, it‰Ûªs been on for, like, a month.",2
5377,Sheldon,5," Well, actually, that would be all the more reason to, you know, check your engine.",2
5378,Penny,5," Sheldon, it‰Ûªs fine.",2
5379,Sheldon,5," If it were fine, the light wouldn‰Ûªt be on. That‰Ûªs why the manufacturer installed that light, to let you know it‰Ûªs not fine.",2
5380,Penny,5," Uh, maybe the light‰Ûªs broken.",2
5381,Sheldon,5, Is there a ‰ÛÏcheck the check engine light light‰Û? (Penny takes a drink of coffee) O-o-o-oh!,2
5382,Penny,5, What?,2
5383,Sheldon,5," Studies have shown that performing tasks such as eating, talking on a cell phone or drinking coffee while driving reduces one‰Ûªs reaction time by the same factor as an ounce of alcohol.",2
5384,Penny,5, Do you have any alcohol?,2
5385,Sheldon,5, Of course not.,2
5386,Penny,5, Too bad.,2
5387,Sheldon,5, You‰Ûªre going up Euclid Avenue?,2
5388,Penny,5, Mm-hmm.,2
5389,Sheldon,5, Leonard takes Los Robles Avenue.,2
5390,Penny,5," Well, good for Leonard.",2
5391,Sheldon,5," Euclid Avenue is shorter as the crow flies, but it has speed bumps, which appreciably increase point-to-point drive time, making it the less efficient choice. But you have the conn. Of course, if you‰Ûªre not going to slow down for the speed bumps, I withdraw my previous objection. Here‰Ûªs a fun question. Do you know what the most common street name is?",2
5392,Penny,5, No.,2
5393,Sheldon,5," The answer‰Ûªs tricky. It‰Ûªs Second Street. You see, you‰Ûªd think it would be First Street, but in most towns, First Street eventually gets renamed to something else, you know, like Main Street, Broad Street, Michigan Avenue. Leonard and I often use our commute time to exercise our mindsåÊ with brain-teasers like that. We also play games. Would you like to play one?",2
5394,Penny,5, No.,2
5395,Sheldon,5," Oh, come on, it‰Ûªs fun. Ooh! Another bump. Okay. I‰Ûªll say an element, and uh, you say an element whose name starts with the last letter of the one I said, okay? I‰Ûªll start. Helium. Now, you could say Mercury. That would give me a Y. Ooh. åÊVery clever, that‰Ûªs a tough one. So I go Ytterbium, which gets you back to M. So you go Molybdenum, and I say Magnesium, you say Manganese, andåÊ I say Europium, and, and you‰Ûªre left with Mendelevium, and åÊthere are no more M‰Ûªs because I believe that Meitnerium should still be called Ekairidium, so congratulations, you win. Do you wanna go again?",2
5396,Penny,5, How about we just have a little quiet time now?,2
5397,Sheldon,5," All right. Hmm, huh, I‰Ûªm sorry, I‰Ûªm finding your reckless nonchalance regarding the check-engine light to be very troubling.",2
5398,Penny (Pulling over),5, Get out.,2
5399,Sheldon,5," Well, I have to tell you that while I do have a theoretical understanding of the workings of an internal combustion engine, I‰Ûªm not sure I‰Ûªm capable of performing diagnostics.",2
5400,Penny,5," I said, get out.",2
5401,Sheldon,5, Okay. I‰Ûªll give it a shot. (Gets out. Penny drives away.),2
5402,Scene,5, The university cafeteria. Sheldon enters. ,2
5403,Sheldon,5," Oh, Leonard, there you are, I‰Ûªm ready to go home.",2
5404,Leonard,5, I just got here.,2
5405,Sheldon,5," Good, perfect timing.",2
5406,Leonard,5," Sheldon, I told you, I only have access to the free-electron laser at night. I can‰Ûªt drive you for the next few weeks.",2
5407,Sheldon,5," No, you said you couldn‰Ûªt drive me to work, this is from work.",2
5408,Leonard,5," Howard, help me out here.",2
5409,Howard,5," No, just for the fun of it, I‰Ûªm gonna take his side.",2
5410,Sheldon,5," Now, how do you propose I get home?",2
5411,Leonard,5, How did you get here in the first place?,2
5412,Sheldon,5, Penny. But I sense that‰Ûªs no longer an option.,2
5413,Leonard,5," Look, I need to get to the laser lab, you‰Ûªre just going to have to find someone else to take you home.",2
5414,Howard,5," Oh damn, I picked the wrong side.",2
5415,Scene,5," Howard‰Ûªs motor scooter. Howard is driving, Sheldon is on the back clutching him for dear life and screaming. ",2
5416,Sheldon,5," Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa! Oh God, not Euclid Avenue! Aaaaaaaaaaaaaa!",2
5417,Scene,5, Raj‰Ûªs car. ,2
5418,Raj,5, Why did Howard leave you in the middle of the road anyway?,2
5419,Sheldon,5, We had a difference of opinion.,2
5420,Raj,5, Over what?,2
5421,Sheldon,5," Whether or not he was trying to kill me. For the record, I maintain he was. Where are you going?",2
5422,Raj,5, I‰Ûªm taking you home.,2
5423,Sheldon,5," Oh, but I‰Ûªm not going home. It‰Ûªs Wednesday, Wednesday is new comic book day, we have to go to the comic book store. And then we have to stop at Soup Plantation, it‰Ûªs creamy tomato soup day, and Radio Shack, there‰Ûªs a sale on triple-a batteries. Plus, we have to go to Pottery Barn and return my Star Wars sheets.",2
5424,Raj,5, I have a better idea.,2
5425,Sheldon,5, You want to go to pottery barn first?,2
5426,Scene,5," Penny‰Ûªs apartment, she opens the door, Sheldon is stood outside with his Star Wars sheets.",2
5427,Sheldon,5," Can you drive me to Pottery Barn? (She closes the door) Maybe if I turn off the night-light, I can keep the sheets.",2
5428,Scene,5, The apartment. Sheldon enters from the bedroom area. Everyone else is present.,2
5429,Sheldon,5, Good morning.,2
5430,All,5, Good morning.,2
5431,Leonard,5," Sheldon, sit down.",2
5432,Sheldon,5," She‰Ûªs in my spot. Don‰Ûªt look at me like that, everybody knows that my spot.",2
5433,Penny,5," Sheldon, you knowåÊ that we care about you.",2
5434,Howard,5, And it‰Ûªs because we care about you that we‰Ûªve decided we have to speak up.,2
5435,Penny,5," You‰Ûªre hurting the people around you, sweetie.",2
5436,Leonard,5," So we made you an appointment, and we want you to keep it.",2
5437,Sheldon,5, Department of motor vehicles new driver handbook? But I don‰Ûªt have a problem.,2
5438,Leonard,5," Sheldon, you need to learn how to drive.",2
5439,Howard,5, This madness has to stop.,2
5440,Leonard,5," Penny‰Ûªs taking you to the DMV, I‰Ûªm going to bed.",2
5441,Sheldon,5, Why Penny?,2
5442,Leonard,5," Because rock breaks scissors, goodnight.",2
5443,Penny,5," All right, come on Sheldon.",2
5444,Sheldon,5," Hold on, I have one condition.",2
5445,Penny,5, What?,2
5446,Sheldon,5, We have to stop at Pottery Barn.,2
5447,Penny,5, Okay.,2
5448,Sheldon,5, And Radio Shack.,2
5449,Penny,5, Fine.,2
5450,Sheldon,5, And the comic book store.,2
5451,Penny,5, All right! (They leave.),2
5452,Howard,5," Ooh, I want to go to the comic book store. (He leaves.)",2
5453,Raj,5, I like comic books.,2
5454,Scene,5, The DMV.,2
5455,Sheldon,5," I just don‰Ûªt see why I need a driver‰Ûªs license, Albert Einstein never had a driver‰Ûªs license.",2
5456,Howard,5," Yeah, but Albert Einstein didn‰Ûªt make me wet myself at 40 miles an hour.",2
5457,Penny,5," Yeah, and I never wanted to kick Albert Einstein in the nuts. You know, I gotta ask, why didn‰Ûªt you just get a license at 16 like everybody else?",2
5458,Sheldon,5, I was otherwise engaged.,2
5459,Penny,5, Doing what?,2
5460,Sheldon,5, Examining perturbative amplitudes in n=4 supersymmetric theories leading to a re-examination of the ultraviolet properties of multi-loop n=8 supergravity using modern twistor theory.,2
5461,Penny,5," Well, how ‰Ûªbout when you were 17?",2
5462,DMV Lady (to the person ahead of Sheldon in the queue),5," Take this to the testing area, put your name at the top, sign the bottom, answer the questions, bring it back, next! (Sheldon moves forward) Application?",2
5463,Sheldon,5, I‰Ûªm actually more of a theorist.,2
5464,Howard,5," The application in your hand, give it to her.",2
5465,Sheldon,5, Oh.,2
5466,DMV Lady,5," Take this to the testing area, put your name at the top, sign the bottom, answer the questions, bring it back, next!",2
5467,Sheldon,5," Excuse me, but I have some concerns about these questions.",2
5468,DMV Lady,5, Look at that sign up there.,2
5469,Sheldon,5, Yes?,2
5470,DMV Lady,5, Does it say I give a damn?,2
5471,Sheldon,5, No.,2
5472,DMV Lady,5, That‰Ûªs because I don‰Ûªt.,2
5473,Sheldon,5," Just, look, see, this first question makes no sense, how many car lengths should you leave in front of you when driving? There‰Ûªs no possible way to answer that, a car length is not a standardized unit of measure.",2
5474,DMV Lady,5, Look at the sign.,2
5475,Penny,5," Sheldon, it‰Ûªs C, just put down C.",2
5476,Sheldon,5," I don‰Ûªt need your help, Penny.",2
5477,DMV Lady,5," Listen to that little girl, honey, put C. Next!",2
5478,Sheldon,5," No, no, wait, no, hang on, look at this next question.",2
5479,Howard,5," Sheldon, why are you arguing with the DMV?",2
5480,Sheldon,5," How else are they going to learn? Look, question 2, when are roadways most slippery? Now, okay, there are three answers, none of which are correct. The correct answer is, when covered by a film of liquid sufficient to reduce the coefficient of static friction between the tire and the road to essentially zero, but not so deep as to introduce a new source of friction.",2
5481,DMV Lady,5, Here‰Ûªs your learner‰Ûªs permit. Go away.,2
5482,Sheldon,5, But I‰Ûªm not done. I have many additional concerns about these questions.,2
5483,DMV Lady,5, Don‰Ûªt make me climb over this counter.,2
5484,Penny,5," Come on, let‰Ûªs go.",2
5485,DMV Lady,5, Next!,2
5486,Sheldon,5, Aced it.,2
5487,Scene,5, The apartment. Howard is setting up a large kit of high tech equipment.,2
5488,Howard,5," Okay, that‰Ûªs it, let‰Ûªs boot it up.",2
5489,Leonard,5, Booting.,2
5490,Howard,5, This is a state-of-the-art simulator. I adapted it from something a friend of mine designed for the army.,2
5491,Sheldon,5," Is that why I appear to be in downtown Fallujah, behind the wheel of an up-armored Humvee?",2
5492,Howard,5, I haven‰Ûªt configured it yet. Let‰Ûªs see‰Û_ Bradley tank‰Û_ transport truck‰Û_åÊ Batmobile‰Û_,2
5493,Sheldon,5, Ooh!,2
5494,Leonard,5, No.,2
5495,Howard,5," Here we go, red 2006 Ford Taurus on the streets of Pasadena.",2
5496,Sheldon (sucking in breath),5, Hmmmm?,2
5497,Howard,5, What?,2
5498,Sheldon,5," Statistically, red cars are stopped by police far more often than any other colour. I don‰Ûªt want any hassles with the fuzz.",2
5499,Howard,5," Fine, what colour do you want?",2
5500,Sheldon,5," You know the pale blue of Luke Skywalker‰Ûªs lightsaber, before it was digitally remastered?",2
5501,Howard,5, Black it is.,2
5502,Leonard,5," Okay, now, what you want to do first is turn on the ignition and shift into drive.",2
5503,Sheldon,5, I haven‰Ûªt fastened my seat belt yet.,2
5504,Leonard,5," Okay, fasten your seat belt.",2
5505,Sheldon,5," Click. Now, are there air bags?",2
5506,Leonard,5, You don‰Ûªt need air bags.,2
5507,Sheldon,5, What if a simulated van rear-ends me?,2
5508,Penny,5, I‰Ûªll hit you in the face with a pillow.,2
5509,Leonard,5," Okay, now shift into drive, pull out slowly into traffic.",2
5510,Penny,5, Oh.,2
5511,Leonard,5, Oh.,2
5512,Howard,5, Oh.,2
5513,Leonard,5, Watch out.,2
5514,Howard,5, Oh God!,2
5515,Leonard,5," Watch, watch out, watch out for pedestrians!",2
5516,Penny,5," Oh God, wait, slow, hit the brakes, hit the brakes!",2
5517,Sheldon,5, Thank you.,2
5518,Scene,5," The same, only Sheldon and Leonard are present. Sheldon is practicing. There are sounds of squealing tyres and brakes and general panic and mayhem.",2
5519,Sheldon,5, Sorry‰Û_ excuse me‰Û_ my bad‰Û_ student driver‰Û_,2
5520,Leonard,5, How did you manage to get on the second floor of the Glendale galleria?,2
5521,Sheldon,5," I don‰Ûªt know. I was on the Pasadena freeway, I missed my exit, flew off the overpass, and one thing led to another.",2
5522,Leonard,5, Maybe you want to give it a rest and try again tomorrow.,2
5523,Sheldon,5," No. I quit. (Stands up. There is more sound of crashing and panic, then animal noises.)",2
5524,Leonard,5," Aw, the pet store?",2
5525,Sheldon,5," Remind me to compliment Wolowitz on the software, it‰Ûªs amazingly detailed.",2
5526,Leonard,5," So wait,you‰Ûªre just gonna give up?",2
5527,Sheldon,5," No, I‰Ûªm not giving up, I never give up.",2
5528,Leonard,5, So what is it you‰Ûªre doing?,2
5529,Sheldon,5, I‰Ûªm transcending the situation. I‰Ûªm clearly too evolved for driving.,2
5530,Leonard,5, What does that mean?,2
5531,Sheldon,5," Leonard, have you ever wondered why my little toes and lateral incisors are significantly smaller than the average for someone of my size?",2
5532,Leonard,5," I wonder a lot of things about you, Sheldon, but not‰Û_ not that.",2
5533,Sheldon,5," Well, those are indicators that I‰Ûªm farther along the evolutionary scale than the average human.",2
5534,Leonard,5, No kidding.,2
5535,Sheldon,5," Well, no, no, I‰Ûªm not going to go so far as to say that I represent a distinct new stage in humankind, you know, a Homo Novus, if you will, no, that‰Ûªs for anthropologists to decide. But I am convinced that the reason I cannot master the plebeian task of driving is because I‰Ûªm not meant to.",2
5536,Leonard,5," Yes, you are, you‰Ûªre meant to learn how to drive. Please learn how to drive!",2
5537,Sheldon,5," No, no. Leonard, I‰Ûªm meant for greater things, like unraveling the mysteries of the universe, not determining when it‰Ûªs safe to pass a stopped school bus on a country road.",2
5538,Leonard,5, It‰Ûªs never safe.,2
5539,Sheldon,5," Yeah, well, I know that now.",2
5540,Leonard,5," Fine. Assuming that everything you say is true, how does the biologically superior Homo Novus get to work tomorrow morning?",2
5541,Sheldon,5, Homo Novus doesn‰Ûªt know.,2
5542,Leonard,5," Well, hang in there, maybe you‰Ûªll evolve into something with wings.",2
5543,Scene,5, A corridor in the university. Sheldon emerges from his office in a shower cap and bathrobe. The others are turning the corner. ,2
5544,Sheldon,5," Good morning, gentlemen.",2
5545,Leonard,5, Hey.,2
5546,Raj,5, Good morning. Is there some new kind of casual Friday I don‰Ûªt know about?,2
5547,Leonard,5," No, he lives here now.",2
5548,Howard,5, Really? Why?,2
5549,Leonard,5," Well, since he won‰Ûªt take the bus and he‰Ûªs too evolved to drive, he decided it would be easier to just sleep in his office and shower in the radiation lab until I‰Ûªm finished with my experiment.",2
5550,Raj,5, But you finished your experiment a week ago.,2
5551,Leonard,5, Yep,2
5552,Scene,5," The cafeteria, late at night. Two cleaning ladies enter and find a plate with toast crusts.",2
5553,"Cleaning Lady 1 (in Spanish, subtitles)",5," Oh my God, again?",2
5554,Cleaning Lady 2,5, It must be rats.,2
5555,Cleaning Lady 1,5, Rats don‰Ûªt make toast and cut off the crust.,2
5556,Sheldon,5, You saw nothing! (Sweeps hood around himself and vanishes through cafeteria door.),2
5557,Scene,6, A lecture room at the university.,2
5558,Leonard,6," So, if any of you are considering going into experimental physics, my door is always open. Once again, I‰Ûªm sorry that the demonstration didn‰Ûªt quite work out, but now we know what happens when you accidentally spill peach Snapple into a helium neon laser. Short answer is‰Û_ don‰Ûªt. And now to tell you about the theoretical physics department is Dr. Sheldon Cooper. Dr. Cooper?",2
5559,Sheldon (off),6, Forget it.,2
5560,Leonard,6," Excuse me. Sheldon, we both agreed to do this.",2
5561,Sheldon (off),6, It‰Ûªs a waste of time. I might as well explain the laws of thermodynamics to a bunch of labradoodles.,2
5562,Leonard,6," If you don‰Ûªt do this, I won‰Ûªt take you to the comic book store.",2
5563,Sheldon (entering),6," Hello. Nice work with the laser, by the way. Looking out at your fresh young faces, I remember when I too was deciding my academic future as a lowly graduate student. Of course, I was 14, and I‰Ûªd already achieved more than most of you could ever hope to, despite my 9 o‰Ûªclock bedtime. Now, there may be one or two of you in this room who has what it takes to succeed in theoretical physics, although, it‰Ûªs more likely that you‰Ûªll spend your scientific careers teaching fifth graders how to make paper mache volcanoes with baking soda lava.",2
5564,Leonard,6," Oh, good God.",2
5565,Sheldon,6," In short, anyone who told you that you would someday be able to make any significant contribution to physics played a cruel trick on you, a cruel trick indeed. Any questions? Of course not. I weep for the future of science. Now if you‰Ûªll excuse me, the latest issue of Batman is out. Come, Leonard.",2
5566,Leonard,6," Laser demonstration‰Ûªs looking pretty good now, huh?",2
5567,Scene,6, The university cafeteria.,2
5568,Raj,6," I love this time of the year. The leaves are turning, there‰Ûªs a bracing chill in the air.",2
5569,Howard,6," Plus there‰Ûªs a whole new crop of female grad students about to put on just enough winter weight to make them needy and vulnerable. That‰Ûªs right, honey, have another calzone, Daddy can wait.",2
5570,Raj,6, Isn‰Ûªt there a university policy against dating graduate students?,2
5571,Leonard,6," No, if you can talk to them, you can ask them out.",2
5572,Raj,6," Damn, there‰Ûªs always a catch.",2
5573,Leslie Winkle (entering),6," Hey, guys.",2
5574,Leonard,6," Hey, Leslie.",2
5575,Leslie,6," So, dumbass, I heard you made a grad student throw up last night.",2
5576,Sheldon,6, The truth can indeed be a finger down the throat of those unprepared to hear it. But why should I cater to second-rate minds?,2
5577,Leslie,6, Because first-rate minds call you ‰ÛÏdumbass‰Û?,2
5578,Sheldon,6," Oh, yeah? Well‰Û_ you‰Ûªre a mean person.",2
5579,Girl (arriving),6," Excuse me, Dr. Cooper, I‰Ûªm Ramona Nowitzki, I was at your talk last night. I think you‰Ûªre just brilliant.",2
5580,Sheldon,6, That is the prevailing opinion.,2
5581,Leslie,6," Oh, now I‰Ûªm gonna throw up.",2
5582,Howard,6," Howard Wolowitz, department of engineering, co-designer of the International Space Station‰Ûªs Liquid Waste Disposal System.",2
5583,Ramona,6," Ew. Dr. Cooper, I‰Ûªve read everything you‰Ûªve published. I especially liked your paper on grand unification using string-network condensates and was wondering how you determined that three-dimensional string-nets provided a unified picture of fermions and gauge bosons?",2
5584,Sheldon,6," Amazing, an intelligent labradoodle.",2
5585,Howard,6, Woof.,2
5586,Sheldon,6, The fact is I‰Ûªm quite close to a breakthrough in showing how neutrinos emerge from a string-net condensate.,2
5587,Ramona,6," Oh, my God, that would change the way we view the entire physical universe.",2
5588,Sheldon,6, It‰Ûªs what I do.,2
5589,Howard,6," You know, the Pishkin-Wolowitz Liquid Waste Disposal System is turning a few heads as well.",2
5590,Ramona,6," Again, ew. You know, I‰Ûªd love to hear more about how you intend to add neutrinos. Could we get a cup of coffee sometime?",2
5591,Sheldon,6, I don‰Ûªt drink coffee.,2
5592,Howard,6, I do. I love me a cup of joe.,2
5593,Ramona,6," Well, it doesn‰Ûªt have to be coffee. How about dinner?",2
5594,Sheldon,6, I do eat dinner.,2
5595,Ramona,6, Great. I know a terrific little Italian place.,2
5596,Sheldon,6, I never eat in strange restaurants. One runs the risk of non-standard cutlery.,2
5597,Ramona,6, Excuse me?,2
5598,Leonard,6, Sheldon lives in fear of the three-tined fork.,2
5599,Sheldon,6," Three tines is not a fork, three tines is a trident. Forks are for eating, tridents are for ruling the seven seas.",2
5600,Ramona,6, What if I brought food to your place?,2
5601,Sheldon,6," That would be acceptable. On Mondays, I eat Thai food. Mee krob and chicken sate with extra peanut sauce from Siam Palace.",2
5602,Ramona,6, You got it. I already have your address.,2
5603,Sheldon,6, What a nice girl.,2
5604,Howard,6," Sheldon, do you have any idea what just happened?",2
5605,Sheldon,6, Yes. Apparently I‰Ûªm getting a free dinner.,2
5606,Scene,6, The apartment building lobby. Ramona is waiting by the lift. Penny enters. ,2
5607,Penny,6," Oh, yeah, no, this thing‰Ûªs majorly out of order. (Picking up out of order sign) See? Sorry.",2
5608,Ramona,6, That‰Ûªs okay. Guess I‰Ûªm taking the stairs.,2
5609,Penny,6, Where you going?,2
5610,Ramona,6, 4-A.,2
5611,Penny,6," Oh, are you here to see Leonard?",2
5612,Ramona,6," No, Dr. Cooper.",2
5613,Penny,6, Dr. Sheldon Cooper?,2
5614,Ramona,6, We‰Ûªre having dinner.,2
5615,Penny,6," Sheldon Cooper? Tall, thin, looks a little like a giant praying mantis?",2
5616,Ramona,6," He is cute, isn‰Ûªt he?",2
5617,Penny,6, Sheldon Cooper?,2
5618,Scene,6," The apartment. Leonard opens the door, Ramona and Penny are outside. ",2
5619,Ramona,6," Hi, Leonard.",2
5620,Leonard,6," Hey, Ramona. Come on in.",2
5621,Ramona,6, Thanks. Where should I put this?,2
5622,Leonard,6," Uh, the kitchen‰Ûªs fine. (To Penny) Hey, what are you doing?",2
5623,Penny,6, I need to see this.,2
5624,Leonard,6," Uh-huh. The viewing area‰Ûªs right over there. Sheldon, your girl‰Û_ date‰Û_ person‰Û_ Ramona‰Ûªs here.",2
5625,Sheldon,6," Oh, hello.",2
5626,Ramona,6," Oh, sorry I‰Ûªm late. I just got so caught up reading the draft of your latest paper.",2
5627,Sheldon,6, Did you enjoy the humorous footnote where I illustrate mirror-symmetry by likening it to the Flash playing tennis with himself?,2
5628,Ramona,6," So funny. But the idea that you might be able to incorporate gravity, I have to tell you, I found it physically exhilarating.",2
5629,Sheldon,6, My hypotheses tend to have that effect.,2
5630,Ramona,6, I‰Ûªm sorry I didn‰Ûªt bring enough for your friends. I assumed we were going to be alone.,2
5631,Leonard,6," Oh, yeah. No, we were just going.",2
5632,Howard,6," To watch, right?",2
5633,Leonard,6," No, come on, now, we‰Ûªre going out.",2
5634,Penny,6," Oh, come on, we‰Ûªll be quiet.",2
5635,Leonard,6," Let‰Ûªs go. Okay, you two, just, have a nice‰Û_ whatever this is.",2
5636,Penny (in hallway),6," Okay, you guys, look, I know this is none of my business, but I just, I have to ask, what‰Ûªs Sheldon‰Ûªs deal?",2
5637,Leonard,6, What do you mean ‰ÛÏdeal‰Û?,2
5638,Penny,6," You know, like what‰Ûªs his deal? Is it girls? Guys? Sock puppets?",2
5639,Leonard,6," Honestly, we‰Ûªve been operating under the assumption that he has no deal.",2
5640,Penny,6," Come on, everybody has a deal.",2
5641,Howard,6," Not Sheldon. Over the years, we‰Ûªve formulated many theories about how he might reproduce. I‰Ûªm an advocate of mytosis.",2
5642,Penny,6, I‰Ûªm sorry?,2
5643,Howard,6, I believe one day Sheldon will eat an enormous amount of Thai food and split into two Sheldons.,2
5644,Leonard,6," On the other hand, I think Sheldon might be the larval form of his species, and someday he‰Ûªll spin a cocoon and emerge two months later with moth wings and an exoskeleton.",2
5645,Penny,6," Okay, well, thanks for the nightmares.",2
5646,Leonard,6," Hey, do you want to hang out with us?",2
5647,Penny,6, What are you guys gonna do?,2
5648,Leonard,6, Uh‰Û_,2
5649,Howard,6, My mom‰Ûªs making a brisket tonight.,2
5650,Leonard,6, The one with the little onions? Mmm.,2
5651,Penny,6," Yeah, I‰Ûªm busy, so, goodnight.",2
5652,Howard,6, Her loss. Let‰Ûªs go.,2
5653,Raj,6, Brisket party! B-to-the-R-to-the-I-S-K‰Û_ To-the-E-to-the-T‰Û_ Ooh‰Û_,2
5654,Leonard,6, Don‰Ûªt.,2
5655,Scene,6, The cafeteria.,2
5656,Leonard,6," Hey, aren‰Ûªt you having breakfast?",2
5657,Sheldon,6, Yes.,2
5658,Leonard,6, Are you experimenting with nutritional suppositories again?,2
5659,Sheldon,6, Not in these pants.,2
5660,Leonard,6," So, how‰Ûªd it go with Ramona last night?",2
5661,Sheldon,6," Oh, great. She‰Ûªs smart, insightful and she has a very unique way of, you know, revering me.",2
5662,Ramona (arriving),6, Here‰Ûªs your spinach mushroom omelette .,2
5663,Sheldon,6, Thank you. Did anyone touch it?,2
5664,Ramona,6, Gloves were worn by everyone involved. I was vigilant.,2
5665,Sheldon,6, Ramona pointed out that I‰Ûªve been wasting 20 minutes a day standing on cafeteria lines.,2
5666,Ramona,6, Time which would be better spent tackling the great physics problems of our day.,2
5667,Sheldon,6," You don‰Ûªt tackle the big issues, Ramona. You fence with them. En garde. Riposte.",2
5668,Leonard,6, Touche.,2
5669,Leslie (arriving),6, Morning.,2
5670,Leonard,6," Ah, hey Leslie.",2
5671,Leslie,6," So, Sheldon, I see you‰Ûªre organizing your papers for the Smithsonian Museum of Dumbassery.",2
5672,Ramona,6, There won‰Ûªt be any room until they get rid of the permanent Leslie Winkle exhibit.,2
5673,Sheldon,6," Oh, good one.",2
5674,Leslie,6, I see you got a grad student to fight your battles for you. I‰Ûªll let you keep your lunch money today.,2
5675,Ramona,6," Okay, Dr. Cooper is on the verge of a breakthrough. If you‰Ûªre going to stay, you‰Ûªll have to be respectful and quiet. (Leslie leaves. Ramona looks pointedly at Leonard) ",2
5676,Leonard,6, Wait for me.,2
5677,Ramona,6, So have you worked out the neutrino issue?,2
5678,Sheldon,6," Well, to paraphrase Mozart, all the subatomic particles are there, I just have to put them in the right order.",2
5679,Ramona,6, You‰Ûªre so witty.,2
5680,Sheldon,6, Aren‰Ûªt I?,2
5681,Scene,6, The apartment. There is a knock on the door which then opens and Penny enters.,2
5682,Penny,6," Hey, guys, this package came for y‰Û_",2
5683,Ramona,6, Dr. Cooper is working.,2
5684,Sheldon,6," Yes, I‰Ûªm close to a breakthrough. Ooh, it tickles",2
5685,Penny,6," Sorry. (Puts package down and leaves. In hallway, shudders)  Holy crap on a cracker.",2
5686,Leonard,6," Hey, Penny.",2
5687,Penny,6," Hi. You know, you probably don‰Ûªt want to go in there.",2
5688,Leonard,6, Why? What are they doing?,2
5689,Penny,6," You know, the only way I could explain it would be in a therapist‰Ûªs office with dolls.",2
5690,Leonard (enters),6, Hoo-boy.,2
5691,Ramona,6, Dr. Cooper‰Ûªs working.,2
5692,Leonard,6," Yeah, I can see that. Sheldon, Halo night, Koothrappali‰Ûªs. You coming?",2
5693,Sheldon,6," Oh, yes, it‰Ûªs Halo night. Let me just dry my tootsies.",2

5703,Ramona,6," Dr. Cooper, I have to tell you, your friends are holding you back.",2
5704,Sheldon,6, I prefer to think of it as I‰Ûªm pulling them forward.,2
5705,Ramona,6, Halo night? A man with your intellectual gifts doesn‰Ûªt waste an evening playing video games.,2
5706,Sheldon,6, He does on Wednesdays.,2
5707,Ramona,6, Not if he wants a Nobel Prize.,2
5708,Sheldon,6, He does want that. Does a man with my intellectual gifts play paintball on weekends?,2
5709,Ramona,6, What do you think?,2
5710,Sheldon,6, Drat.,2
5711,Ramona,6, Now shall we get back to work?,2
5712,Sheldon,6, I suppose. Battlestar Galactica comes on tonight. (Pause) I guess I can wait for the DVD. (Pause) And then never ever watch it.,2

5718,Penny,6, Get rid of her how?,2
5719,Sheldon,6," I don‰Ûªt know, but apparently I‰Ûªm in some kind of relationship, and you seem to be an expert at ending them.",2
5720,Penny,6, Excuse me?,2
5721,Sheldon,6, I see man after man leaving this apartment never to return.,2
5722,Penny,6," Okay, first of all, it is not man after man.",2
5723,Ramona (off),6, Dr. Cooper?!,2
5724,Sheldon,6, Hide me.,2
5725,Penny,6, Hide you?,2
5726,Sheldon,6, I formally request sanctuary.,2
5727,Ramona,6, Why aren‰Ûªt you working?,2

5746,Sheldon,6," Yes, but the communication is not encrypted.",2
5747,Leonard,6, I don‰Ûªt know Morse code.,2

5754,Sheldon,6," Never, that‰Ûªs the problem. I need your help.",2
5755,Leonard,6, What are you talking about?,2
5756,Sheldon,6, I‰Ûªm invoking the Skynet clause of our friendship agreement.,2

5772,Sheldon,6, And I could not have done it without you.,2
5773,Ramona,6," Oh, please, I just offered a little encouragement.",2
5774,Sheldon,6," It was a lot more than that. You helped me work out the masses of all the fermions, and you pumiced my hammer toe. How can I ever repay you?",2
5775,Ramona,6," Well, would you consider naming it the Cooper-Nowitzki Theorem?",2
5776,Sheldon,6, Who‰Ûªs Nowitzki?,2
5777,Ramona,6, I‰Ûªm Nowitzki.,2

5788,Kathy,6, Would you possibly have any time for me to pick your brain?,2

5847,Howard,7," A house, where?",2
5848,Penny,7, I don‰Ûªt know. Somewhere in L.A.,2
5849,Howard,7," Wait a minute, you‰Ûªre telling me that I‰Ûªm within driving distance of a house filled with aspiring supermodels?",2
5850,Penny,7," Yeah, I guess.",2
5851,Howard,7, And they live together and shower together and have naked pillow fights?,2

5889,Sheldon,7," Oh, do we have to suffer through this transparently manipulative pseudo-reality again?",2
5890,All,7, Yes.,2
5891,Sheldon,7, You and I have a standing TV schedule which is the result of extensive debate and compromise. Any alterations except for breaking news have to be pre-approved at the weekly roommate meeting.,2
5892,Leonard,7, Put it on the agenda.,2
5893,Sheldon,7, But you have to make a motion to put it on agenda.,2
5894,Leonard,7," Oh, I‰Ûªll make a motion, but you‰Ûªre not going to like it.",2
5895,Sheldon,7, Fine. Mock Parliamentary procedure. At least put it on mute.,2
5896,Penny,7," Oh, Giselle‰Ûªs not getting kicked off. It‰Ûªs totally going to be Summer. (She picks up one of Sheldon‰Ûªs onion rings. Raj lets out a high pitched squeak and points.) What?",2

5908,Sheldon,7," Well, I‰Ûªm sorry, but that is your second strike.",2
5909,Penny,7, What?,2
5910,Sheldon,7, You have two strikes. Three strikes and you‰Ûªre out. It‰Ûªs a sports metaphor.,2
5911,Penny,7, A sports metaphor?,2
5912,Sheldon,7," Yes, baseball.",2
5913,Penny,7," All right, yeah, I‰Ûªll play along. What was my first strike?",2
5914,Sheldon,7, March 18th. You violated my rule about forwarding email humour.,2
5915,Penny,7, I did?,2
5916,Sheldon,7, The photo of the cat who wants to ‰ÛÏhas cheezburger‰Û?,2
5917,Penny,7," Oh, come on, everybody loves LOLcats. They‰Ûªre cute and they can‰Ûªt spell ‰Ûªcause they‰Ûªre cats.",2

5919,Leonard,7, Don‰Ûªt worry. They only stay on your record for a year.,2
5920,Howard,7," You can get them removed early, but you have to take his class.",2
5921,Penny,7," Come on, I touched one onion ring.",2
5922,Sheldon,7," And then you put it back, compromising the integrity of all the other onion rings.",2
5923,Penny,7," Oh, honey, the buses don‰Ûªt go where you live, do they?",2
5924,Sheldon,7," Look, Penny, I wish I could be more lenient with you, but since you‰Ûªve become a permanent member of our social group I have to hold you to the same standards as everybody else.",2
5925,Leonard,7, Congratulations. You‰Ûªre officially one of us.,2
5926,Howard,7," One of us, one of us.",2
5927,Penny,7," Well, what a thrill.",2

5931,Leonard,7," Yeah, yeah. Uh, see, here‰Ûªs the thing, after you leave, I still have to live with him.",2
5932,Penny,7, I don‰Ûªt care. I‰Ûªm taking a stand. Metaphorically.,2

5938,Penny,7," Yeah, you do that.",2
5939,Leonard,7," Just so I know, would you be open to taking his class? You can do it online!",2
5940,Scene,7, The Cheesecake Factory.,2
5941,Howard,7, So based on our triangulation we‰Ûªve narrowed down the location of the top model house to three square miles in the Hollywood Hills.,2
5942,Raj,7," Or possibly Durham, North Carolina.",2
5943,Howard,7," When we find it, you want to go with us?",2
5944,Leonard,7, To do what?,2
5945,Raj,7," Party with the pretty girls, dude!",2
5946,Leonard,7," Are you insane? You‰Ûªre not going to party with them, you‰Ûªre not even going to get anywhere near that place.",2
5947,Howard,7, That‰Ûªs what they said to Neil Armstrong about the moon.,2
5948,Sheldon,7," No one said anything of the kind to Neil Armstrong, the entire nation dedicated a decade of effort and treasure to put a man on the moon.",2
5949,Howard,7," Well, my fellow Americans, before this year is out we will put a Wolowitz on one of America‰Ûªs top models.",2
5950,Raj,7, And a large number of people will believe it never happened.,2

5952,Leonard,7, Thank you.,2

5954,Sheldon,7," Wait. Excuse me. You forgot my barbecue bacon cheeseburger, barbecue sauce, bacon and cheese on the side.",2
5955,Penny,7," Oh, I didn‰Ûªt tell you? You‰Ûªre banished from the Cheesecake Factory.",2
5956,Sheldon,7, Why?,2
5957,Penny,7," Well, you have three strikes. One, coming in. Two, sitting down. And three, I don‰Ûªt like your attitude.",2
5958,Sheldon,7," You can‰Ûªt do that. Not only is it a violation of California state law, it flies directly in the face of Cheesecake Factory policy.",2
5959,Penny,7," Yeah, no, there‰Ûªs a new policy. No shoes, no shirt, no Sheldon.",2
5960,Howard,7, I bet we could sell that sign all over Pasadena.,2
5961,Leonard,7," Penny, can I talk to you for a minute? Hi.",2
5962,Penny,7, Hi.,2
5963,Leonard,7," Look, here‰Ûªs the thing, um, I talked to Sheldon and he feels terrible and he agrees that he was unreasonable and out of line.",2
5964,Penny,7," Really? Well, that‰Ûªs great.",2
5965,Leonard,7," Yeah, so just apologize to him, okay?",2
5966,Penny,7, What? I‰Ûªm not going to apologize to that nutcase.,2
5967,Leonard,7," Oh, come on, it‰Ûªs easy, he‰Ûªll even tell you what to say.",2
5968,Penny,7," Leonard, don‰Ûªt you get it? If you guys keep going along with his insanity, you‰Ûªre just encouraging him.",2
5969,Leonard,7, We‰Ûªre not encouraging. It‰Ûªs more like knuckling under.,2
5970,Penny,7," Look, I like hanging out with you guys, but I‰Ûªm not going to apologize for something I didn‰Ûªt do.",2
5971,Leonard,7," Well, actually, technically, you did do it.",2
5972,Penny,7," That‰Ûªs strike one, Leonard.",2
5973,Scene,7," The same, some minutes later.",2
5974,Penny,7," There you go, quesadilla, salad, there‰Ûªs your pizza, and thanks to Sheldon‰Ûªs heated discussion with my manager one barbecue bacon cheeseburger, barbecue sauce, bacon and cheese on the side.",2
5975,Sheldon,7, Thank you.,2
5976,Penny,7," Go ahead, eat it. I dare you",2
5977,Scene,7, The living room. Howard on his laptop.,2

5980,Howard,7," Look, on the roof, Anais and Giselle are sunbathing. European-style.",2
5981,Leonard,7, You can recognize people on Google Earth?,2
5982,Howard,7," Of course not, I got a buddy of mine at NORAD to have a spy drone fly over.",2
5983,Leonard,7, NORAD? You‰Ûªre using military aircraft?,2
5984,Howard,7," It was already targeted to poke around a nuclear reactor in Siberia, I took it an hour out of its way, tops.",2
5985,"Penny (entering, angry)",7," Okay, where is he?",2
5986,Leonard,7, Sheldon? I just dropped him off at the comic book store. Why?,2
5987,Penny,7, Here. Try and go online.,2
5988,Leonard,7, Problem with the WiFi?,2
5989,Penny,7," No, just try.",2
5990,Sheldon (on screen),7," Greetings, hamburger toucher. You are probably wondering why you cannot IM with your little friends about how much you heart various things. Well, this recorded message is alerting you that I am putting an end to your parasitic piggybacking upon our WiFi. If you want to remedy the situation you can contact the phone company, set up your own WiFi and pay for it, or you may apologize to me.",2
5991,Penny,7, Well?,2
5992,Leonard,7," I reiterate, knuckle under.",2
5993,Penny,7," No, no, no, no, no. It is on. I am gonna introduce your friend to a world of hurt.",2
5994,Leonard,7," Oh, Penny, you don‰Ûªt want to get into it with Sheldon. The guy is one lab accident away from being a supervillain.",2
5995,Penny,7," I don‰Ûªt care, I was in junior rodeo, I can hogtie and castrate him in 60 seconds.",2
5996,Howard,7," No need to neuter the nerd, I can get you back online.",2
5997,Leonard,7," There, see? Problem solved.",2
5998,Howard,7, Voila!,2
5999,Sheldon (voice from Howards laptop),7," Hello, puny insects. As a consequence of your efforts to circumvent my will, everyone is awarded one additional strike.",2
6000,Leonard,7," Thanks a lot, Howard.",2
6001,Howard,7, What are you complaining about? I‰Ûªm the one who has to take the class again.,2
6002,Scene,7, The hallway. Sheldon is backing out of the apartment. Penny is waiting outside.,2
6003,Sheldon,7, Oh! Hello.,2
6004,Penny,7," Time to do your laundry, huh?",2
6005,Sheldon,7, It‰Ûªs Saturday night. Saturday is laundry night.,2
6006,Sheldon,7, What are you implying?,2
6007,Scene,7," The laundry room. Sheldon, holding his laundry, is looking at the machines in dismay.",2
6008,Penny,7," Oh, no, are all the machines taken? What are you gonna do?",2
6009,Sheldon,7," No problem, I‰Ûªll just do my laundry another night.",2
6010,Penny,7," Another night? Well, I guess you can try, but deep inside your heart you‰Ûªll know that laundry night is always Saturday night.",2
6011,Sheldon,7," Woman, you are playing with forces beyond your ken.",2
6012,Penny,7," Yeah, well, your ken can kiss my Barbie.",2
6013,Scene,7," The hallway, Penny comes storming up the stairs to the guys door.",2
6014,"Penny (Knock, knock, knock)",7," Sheldon (knock, knock, knock) Sheldon (knock, knock, knock) Sheldon.",2
6015,Sheldon,7, Yes?,2
6016,Penny,7, Where are my clothes?,2
6017,Sheldon,7, Your clothes?,2
6018,Penny,7," Yes, I left them in the washers and when I went down to get them, they were gone.",2
6019,Sheldon,7, Really? Despite the sign that says ‰ÛÏDo not leave laundry unattended‰Û?,2
6020,Penny,7," Sheldon, where are my clothes?",2
6021,Sheldon,7," You know, I do recall seeing some female undergarments. Where was that? Oh, yes, earlier this evening I happened to gaze out the window and a brassiere caught my eye. Do those look familiar?",2
6022,Penny,7, How the hell did you get them up on that telephone wire?,2
6023,Sheldon,7," When you understand the laws of physics, Penny, anything is possible. And may I add, mwah-ha-ha!",2
6024,Penny,7, Get them down.,2
6025,Sheldon,7, Apologize.,2
6026,Penny,7, Never.,2
6027,Sheldon,7," Well, then may I suggest you get a very long stick and play panty pinata.",2
6028,Penny,7," Look, wait, Sheldon, this has gotten out of hand, okay? I‰Ûªve done some stupid things, you‰Ûªve done some stupid things, how about we just call it even and move on with our lives?",2
6029,Sheldon,7, I‰Ûªve done no stupid things.,2
6030,Penny,7," Look, you‰Ûªve got to meet me halfway here.",2
6031,Sheldon,7," I am meeting you halfway, I‰Ûªm willing to concede that you‰Ûªve done some stupid things.",2
6032,Leonard,7," Hey, you guys are talking again. Good. What happened?",2
6033,Penny,7," Leonard, remember when I said it was on? Well, now it‰Ûªs junior rodeo on.",2
6034,Leonard,7," Oh, not junior rodeo. What did you do?",2
6035,Sheldon,7," I had no choice, Leonard, she ruined laundry night.",2
6036,Leonard (looking out of window),7, A-a-a-aw!,2
6037,Sheldon,7, Mwah-ha-ha.,2
6038,Scene,7, Penny‰Ûªs apartment. Leonard enters. Penny is taping together a number of long sticks.,2
6039,Penny,7," Telephone wires can‰Ûªt electrocute you, can they?",2
6040,Leonard,7," No. Look, this has to stop.",2
6041,Penny,7," Oh, no, no, no. It is just beginning.",2
6042,Leonard,7," All right, I really didn‰Ûªt want to do this, but‰Û_ here.",2
6043,Penny,7, What‰Ûªs this?,2
6044,Leonard,7, Sheldon‰Ûªs Kryptonite.,2
6045,Penny,7," Oh, my God.",2
6046,Leonard,7, He can never know that I gave that to you.,2
6047,Penny,7," Look, I said I wanted to hurt him, but, but this?",2
6048,Leonard,7, It‰Ûªll shorten the war by five years and save millions of lives.,2
6049,Scene,7, The living room.,2
6050,Raj,7," Oh, pause it. That‰Ûªs it. Confirmed. We now have the address of the top model house.",2
6051,Howard,7," God bless you, Google Street View registered trademark.",2
6052,Leonard,7," Okay, for the record what you‰Ûªre doing is really creepy.",2
6053,Howard,7," You know what? If it‰Ûªs creepy to use the Internet, military satellites, and robot aircraft to find a house full of gorgeous young models so that I can drop in on them unexpectedly, then fine, I‰Ûªm creepy.",2
6054,"Leonard (into phone, which has just rung)",7," Hello. Oh, hi. Yeah, hold on a second. I‰Ûªll get him. Sheldon, it‰Ûªs for you.",2
6055,Sheldon,7, Who is it?,2
6056,Leonard,7, Your mother.,2
6057,Sheldon,7," Oh, good. Hi, Mom. How are you? But, Mom, she keeps sitting in my spot. And, and she touched my food. Okay, yes, I took her clothes, but she started it. No, that‰Ûªs not fair. Why should I have to apologize? Yeah, I really don‰Ûªt think this is the kind of thing Jesus concerns himself with. No, you‰Ûªre right, I don‰Ûªt really know what Jesus thinks about. All right, good-bye. Did you tell on me?",2
6058,Leonard,7, Are you kidding me? I already have two strikes.,2
6059,Scene,7, Outside Penny‰Ûªs door.,2
6060,Sheldon,7," (Knock, knock, knock) Penny, (knock, knock, knock) Penny, (knock, knock, knock) Penny‰Û_ (door opens) I am very, very sorry for what I have done. Here‰Ûªs your laundry, I rescind your strikes and you are no longer banished.",2
6061,Penny,7," Can I sit wherever I want? No, no, never mind, never mind, that‰Ûªs, that‰Ûªs not important. Sheldon, this was big of you. Thank you. I really appreciate it.",2
6062,Sheldon,7, Thank you.,2
6063,Penny,7," Good night, Sheldon.",2
6064,Sheldon,7, Penny.,2
6065,Penny,7, Yes?,2
6066,Sheldon,7, Well played.,2
6067,Penny,7, Thank you.,2
6068,Penny,7, Understood.,2
6069,Scene,7, The top model house. The doorbell rings. One of the models answers. Howard and Raj are outside wearing blue jumpsuits.,2
6070,Model,7, Can I help you,2
6071,Howard,7," Yes, we here to fix the cable.",2
6072,Model,7, I think we have satellite.,2
6073,Howard,7, That‰Ûªs what I meant.,2
6074,Model,7," Oh. Okay, come on in.",2
6075,Howard,7, She‰Ûªs taller than all the women in my family combined.,2
6076,Raj,7, What do we do now?,2
6077,Howard,7, Follow Mrs. Wolowitz.,2
6078,Scene,8, The apartment. ,2
6079,Sheldon,8," Oh look, Saturn 3 is on.",2
6080,Raj,8, I don‰Ûªt want to watch Saturn 3. Deep Space Nine is better.,2
6081,Sheldon,8, How is Deep Space Nine better than Saturn 3?,2
6082,Raj,8, Simple subtraction will tell you it‰Ûªs six better.,2
6083,Leonard,8, Compromise. Watch Babylon 5.,2
6084,Sheldon,8, In what sense is that a compromise?,2
6085,Leonard,8," Well, five is partway between three‰Û_ Never mind.",2
6086,Raj,8," I‰Ûªll tell you what, how about we go rock-paper-scissors?",2
6087,Sheldon,8," Ooh, I don‰Ûªt think so. No, anecdotal evidence suggests that in the game of rock-paper-scissors, players familiar with each other will tie 75 to 80% of the time due to the limited number of outcomes. I suggest rock-paper-scissors- lizard-Spock.",2
6088,Raj,8, What?,2
6089,Sheldon,8," It‰Ûªs very simple. Look, scissors cuts paper. Paper covers rock. Rock crushes lizard. Lizard poisons Spock. Spock smashes scissors. Scissors decapitates lizard. Lizard eats paper. Paper disproves Spock. Spock vaporizes rock. And as it always has, rock crushes scissors.",2
6090,Raj,8," Okay, I think I got it. (They prepare)",2
6091,Together,8, Rock-paper-scissors- lizard-Spock! (Both hold up the symbol for Spock) Oh!,2
6092,"Howard (entering, wearing an eye patch)",8," Hello, boys.",2
6093,Leonard,8," Ahoy, matey.",2
6094,Howard,8," Noticed the eye patch, did you? It‰Ûªs all part of a technique I‰Ûªve been studying for picking up women. You employ a visual display designed to make yourself distinctive and memorable.",2
6095,Sheldon,8," Oh yes, like the male peacock with brilliant plumage or the rutting baboon with engorged hindquarters.",2
6096,Leonard,8," Or in this case, the bar mitzvah boy with pinkeye.",2
6097,Howard,8," Mock me if you will, but it works. You show up at a club in something distinctive, scope out your target and toss out some negs.",2
6098,Raj,8, What are negs?,2
6099,Howard,8," A neg is a negative compliment that throws a pretty woman off her game, like ‰ÛÏNormally, I‰Ûªm not turned on by big teeth, but on you, they work.‰Û I‰Ûªve got a whole list of ‰Ûªem. Who wants to be my wingman?",2
6100,Leonard,8," You‰Ûªre not gonna need wingman, you‰Ûªre gonna need a paramedic.",2
6101,Penny (entering),8," Howard, your scooter‰Ûªs blocking my car. Aw, did you get pinkeye again?",2
6102,Howard,8," Step one, she notices the eye patch. May I say, Penny, not a lot of women could look as hot as you do with such greasy hair? (She reaches out, pulls his eye patch away from his face, then lets go allowing the elastic to spring it back into place.)",2
6103,Penny,8," Yeah, just move your stupid scooter before I pick it up and throw it in the dumpster.",2
6104,Howard,8, Ow.,2
6105,Scene,8, The same.,2
6106,Sheldon,8," I‰Ûªm sorry, but I‰Ûªm not going to watch the Clone Wars TV series until I‰Ûªve seen the Clone Wars movie. I prefer to let George Lucas disappoint me in the order he intended.",2
6107,Leonard,8," Well, I want to watch it now.",2
6108,Sheldon,8, Then I believe we‰Ûªve arrived at another quintessential rock-paper-scissors- lizard-Spock moment.,2
6109,Leonard,8, Watch whatever you want.,2
6110,Raj,8, I saw what you did there.,2
6111,Sheldon,8, What did I do?,2
6112,Leonard (answering phone),8," Hello. Hey, Howard. What‰Ûªs wrong? Okay. Okay, we‰Ûªll be right there.",2
6113,Sheldon,8, What happened?,2
6114,Leonard,8, Howard‰Ûªs at the Mars Rover lab. He says he‰Ûªs in trouble. Defcon 5.,2
6115,Sheldon,8," Defcon 5? Well, there‰Ûªs no need to rush.",2
6116,Leonard,8, What?,2
6117,Sheldon,8, Defcon 5 means no danger. Defcon 1 is a crisis.,2
6118,Leonard,8, How can 5 not be worse than 1?,2
6119,Raj,8," Yeah, Star Trek V, worse than I.",2
6120,Sheldon,8," Okay, first of all, that‰Ûªs a comparison of quality, not intensity. Secondly, Star Trek I is orders-of-magnitude worse than Star Trek V.",2
6121,Raj,8, Are you joking? Star Trek V is the standard against which all badness is measured.,2
6122,Sheldon,8," No, no, no. Star Trek V has specific failures in writing and direction, while Star Trek I fails across the board, art direction, costuming, music, sound editing.",2
6123,Leonard,8, Can we just forget I said Defcon and go?,2
6124,Raj,8, Star Trek V!,2
6125,Scene,8, A corridor at the university,2
6126,Raj,8, I have three words for you. Wrath of Khan.,2
6127,Howard,8," Oh, thank God, you‰Ûªre here.",2
6128,Leonard,8, What‰Ûªs the emergency?,2
6129,Howard,8, I got the Mars Rover stuck in a ditch.,2
6130,Sheldon,8, Where?,2
6131,Howard,8, On a dusty highway just outside Bakersfield. Where do you think? On Mars!,2
6132,Woman (peering out of door),8," Howard, is everything okay?",2
6133,Howard,8," Yeah, baby, I‰Ûªll be right in.",2
6134,Sheldon,8, You brought a girl to the Mars Rover control room?,2
6135,Howard,8," Yeah, I picked her up in the bar. She‰Ûªs a doctor. One free barium enema and my mother won‰Ûªt care she‰Ûªs not Jewish.",2
6136,Leonard,8," Wait a minute, so the eye patch and the insults worked?",2
6137,Howard,8," No, there were three other guys with eye patches, iIt was a fiasco. What did work was, ‰ÛÏHow‰Ûªd you like to visit a secret government facility?‰Û",2
6138,Sheldon,8, So what exactly do you want us to do?,2
6139,Howard,8," I need you and Raj to help me get the Rover out of the ditch, and I need you to get Stephanie out before somebody notices she‰Ûªs here. She doesn‰Ûªt exactly have clearance.",2
6140,Sheldon,8, Really? They don‰Ûªt let strange women from honky-tonks come in and play with $200million government projects on distant planets?,2
6141,Howard,8," Yes, I was bad. Maybe she‰Ûªll spank me. Can we please move on?",2
6142,Girl,8," Hey, Howard, you know, it‰Ûªs getting late, so do I get to drive this thing or what?",2
6143,Howard,8," Yeah. No. I‰Ûªm sorry, but something‰Ûªs come up. Kind of a Mars Rover, Mars Rover, can Howard come over, situation. So my friend Leonard is gonna take you home.",2
6144,Girl,8," Oh, okay. Let‰Ûªs go, friend Leonard.",2
6145,Leonard,8, Okay.,2
6146,Howard,8, I‰Ûªll call ya.,2
6147,Girl,8, Yeah. So are you a scientist like Howard?,2
6148,Leonard,8, No one‰Ûªs a scientist like Howard.,2
6149,Howard,8, My mother is so gonna love her.,2
6150,Sheldon,8," Oh, how nice. Maybe they can carpool when they visit you in federal prison.",2
6151,Scene,8, Leonard‰Ûªs car. Leonard and the girl are kissing.,2
6152,Girl,8," I‰Ûªm sorry. I totally interrupted you. What, what, what were you saying?",2
6153,Leonard,8," Just said Howard‰Ûªs a terrific guy. He‰Ûªs got a great sense of humour, he loves his mother, a lot, some people say too much.",2
6154,Girl,8, I really like that you‰Ûªre such a loyal friend.,2
6155,Leonard,8," Yeah, I am loyal. You know, if you look at the big picture. Just, out of curiosity, did he ever have a shot with you?",2
6156,Girl,8, Are you insane? The guy was wearing an eye patch.,2
6157,Leonard,8, Then why did you?,2
6158,Girl,8, He said that I could drive a car on Mars.,2
6159,Leonard,8," Got it. So, can I see you again?",2
6160,Girl,8, You‰Ûªre not gonna see me now.,2
6161,Leonard,8, Ooh. Cool.,2
6162,Scene,8, The Mars Rover control room.,2
6163,Howard,8, Anything?,2
6164,Raj,8," Actually, I was just checking my e-mail. But, uh, no, the Rover is not responding.",2
6165,Sheldon,8, I believe the appropriate metaphor here involves a river of excrement and a Native American water vessel without any means of propulsion.,2
6166,Howard,8," Hang on, there‰Ûªs got to be other options.",2
6167,Raj,8," You could try calling Triple-A, but based on NASA‰Ûªs latest timetable, they won‰Ûªt get there for 35 years.",2
6168,Sheldon,8, Plus I understand you have to be standing next to the vehicle with your card when they arrive.,2
6169,Raj,8," Oh, snap.",2
6170,Sheldon,8, Snap what?,2
6171,Howard,8," OK, I guess we have to turn to Plan B.",2
6172,Raj,8, What‰Ûªs Plan B?,2
6173,Howard,8," Erase all the hard drives, scrap the surveillance tapes, wipe our fingerprints off every surface and run.",2
6174,Sheldon,8, Why wasn‰Ûªt that Plan A?,2
6175,Scene,8, The apartment.,2
6176,Howard,8, Thank God for Plan B.,2
6177,Penny,8," Howard, didn‰Ûªt you say you worked on the Mars Rover?",2
6178,Howard,8," No, you‰Ûªre mistaken.",2
6179,Penny,8," Yeah, when we first met, you said that if I went out with you, I could drive a car on Mars.",2
6180,Howard,8, I don‰Ûªt know what you‰Ûªre talking about.,2
6181,Leonard,8, Psst! Psst!,2
6182,Sheldon,8, Will you all excuse me? Leonard is subtly signalling that he‰Ûªd like to talk to me in private.,2
6183,Penny,8," No. Yeah, I remember specifically. You started by asking if I was from Mars because my ass was out of this world.",2
6184,Howard,8," Well, that does sound like me, but no.",2
6185,Sheldon,8, Is there some problem?,2
6186,Leonard,8," Yeah. Listen, I have to kinda sneak out for a while.",2
6187,Sheldon,8," All right, goodbye.",2
6188,Leonard,8," No, wait! If anyone asks you where I went, you don‰Ûªt know.",2
6189,Sheldon,8, Where are you going?,2
6190,Leonard,8, I can‰Ûªt tell you that.,2
6191,Sheldon,8, Who would ask me?,2
6192,Leonard,8," I can‰Ûªt tell you that, either.",2
6193,Sheldon,8, So you brought me in here to inform me that you can‰Ûªt tell me where you‰Ûªre going and you can‰Ûªt tell me who might ask?,2
6194,Leonard,8," Yeah, I really didn‰Ûªt think this through.",2
6195,Sheldon,8," Leonard, a moment.",2
6196,Leonard,8, What?,2
6197,Sheldon,8," If someone, and of course, we don‰Ûªt know who this would be, does ask where you‰Ûªve gone, what should I say?",2
6198,Leonard,8, I don‰Ûªt know. Just tell them I went to the office.,2
6199,Sheldon,8, Are you going to the office?,2
6200,Leonard,8, No.,2
6201,Sheldon,8, Then how can I say it convincingly?,2
6202,Leonard,8," Just say, Leonard went to the office.",2
6203,Sheldon,8, All right. Leonard went to (exaggerated) the office.,2
6204,Leonard,8," What is? No, not like that! Just, Leonard went to the office.",2
6205,Sheldon,8, This would have worked out a lot better if you‰Ûªd just told me you were going the office.,2
6206,Leonard,8, I‰Ûªm going to the office.,2
6207,Sheldon,8, See? Why don‰Ûªt I believe you?,2
6208,Leonard,8, I‰Ûªm going out for a while.,2
6209,Howard,8, Okay.,2
6210,Sheldon,8, Doesn‰Ûªt anyone want to know where he‰Ûªs going?,2
6211,Penny,8," Okay, where is he going?",2
6212,Sheldon,8, Leonard is going to (exaggerated) the office.,2
6213,Scene,8, The girl‰Ûªs apartment.,2
6214,Leonard,8, So how was work today?,2
6215,Girl,8," Busy. I removed an appendix, a gall bladder and about a foot and a half of bowel.",2
6216,Leonard,8, I‰Ûªm hoping that‰Ûªs three different guys.,2
6217,Girl,8," No, just the one. He didn‰Ûªt make it. So, how was your day?",2
6218,Leonard,8," Oh, you know, I‰Ûªm a physicist, so, I thought about stuff.",2
6219,Girl,8, That‰Ûªs it?,2
6220,Leonard,8," Well, I wrote some of it down.",2
6221,Girl,8, Are you done eating?,2
6222,Leonard,8," Uh, yeah.",2
6223,Girl,8," Oh, good. (Kisses him)",2
6224,Leonard,8," If I knew you were waiting, I would‰Ûªve swallowed that lasagna whole.",2
6225,Phone rings. Answering machine,8, You‰Ûªve reached Dr. Stephanie Barnett. Leave a message. Beep.,2
6226,Howard (voice),8," Hey, Steph, it‰Ûªs me again, Howard. Listen, if you‰Ûªre free Friday, maybe we could have a little something to eat at my place. My mom cooks a hell of a brisket. Let me know. It‰Ûªs Howard.",2
6227,Leonard,8, I‰Ûªve had her brisket. Melts in your mouth.,2
6228,Steph,8, Maybe we should think about going to the bedroom.,2
6229,Leonard,8," That‰Ûªs a good idea. There‰Ûªs a bed in there, and I‰Ûªm very, very, very pro-bed.",2
6230,Phone rings. Answering machine,8, You‰Ûªve reached Dr. Stephanie Barnett. Leave a message. Beep.,2
6231,Howard (voice),8," Hey, it‰Ûªs me again. Just want to let you know the head count for dinner Friday has gone up. My Aunt Betty and Uncle Elliot are coming in from Palm Springs. Oh, and if anybody should ask, you‰Ûªre half-Jewish on your mother‰Ûªs side. Okay, call me. It‰Ûªs Howard.",2
6232,Leonard,8, Don‰Ûªt you think we should tell him you‰Ûªre not interested?,2
6233,Steph,8, Do you want me to stop and call him back right now?,2
6234,Leonard,8," Dear God, no!",2
6235,Steph (from bedroom door),8," Oh, Leonard‰Û_",2
6236,Phone rings. Answering machine,8, You‰Ûªve reached Dr. Stephanie Barnett. Leave a message. Beep.,2
6237,Howard (voice),8," Hey, it‰Ûªs me again. Howard. Listen, my cousins from Fort Lauderdale are flying in to meet you so that means we‰Ûªre gonna have to move the dinner to a restaurant.",2
6238,Howard‰Ûªs Mother (voice),8, Tell her we‰Ûªre going to the Olive Garden! I have a coupon from the paper.,2
6239,Howard (voice),8," We‰Ûªre not going to the Olive Garden, Mom!",2
6240,Howard‰Ûªs Mother (voice),8," Oh, Mr. Bigshot with his Red Lobster.",2
6241,Howard (voice),8, I‰Ûªll call you back when we firm up the details. It‰Ûªs Howard.,2
6242,Scene,8, The laundry room,2
6243,Penny,8," Oh, hey.",2
6244,Leonard,8, Hey.,2
6245,Penny,8, New shirts?,2
6246,Leonard,8," Yeah, a couple.",2
6247,Penny,8, Nice.,2
6248,Leonard,8, åÊThank you.,2
6249,Penny,8," So, who‰Ûªs the girl?",2
6250,Leonard,8, I‰Ûªm sorry?,2
6251,Penny,8," Well, last time you bought a new shirt was when we were dating.",2
6252,Leonard,8," So, uh, what we did was in fact dating?",2
6253,Penny,8," Well, yeah, we did have a date.",2
6254,Leonard,8," Exactly. Thank you. Do me a favour, tell Koothrappali that next time you see him.",2
6255,Penny,8," So, who is she?",2
6256,Leonard,8," Oh, she‰Ûªs a doctor.",2
6257,Penny,8," Oh, nice. A doctor doctor, or a you kind of doctor?",2
6258,Leonard,8," Doctor doctor. Surgical resident. Smart, pretty. Let me ask you something. If your friend thinks he‰Ûªs dating someone, but he‰Ûªs not because, in fact, you‰Ûªre dating her, does that make you a bad person?",2
6259,Penny,8," Well, that depends.",2
6260,Leonard,8, On what?,2
6261,Penny,8, Is that friend Wolowitz?,2
6262,Leonard,8, Yeah.,2
6263,Penny,8, Screw him. You‰Ûªre fine.,2
6264,Leonard,8, Are you sure?,2
6265,Penny,8," Well, have you slept with her yet? You dog! Good for you.",2
6266,Leonard,8, Does that change things?,2
6267,Penny,8, No.,2
6268,Leonard,8, So why‰Ûªd you ask?,2
6269,Penny,8, I‰Ûªm nosy. See ya.,2
6270,Scene,8, Outside Howard‰Ûªs front door.,2
6271,Howard‰Ûªs Mother (voice),8," Howard, get the door!",2
6272,Howard (voice),8," Really? Is that what you do when someone knocks? Thank you. I had no idea! (opening door) Hey, buddy. What brings you to my little slice of hell?",2
6273,Howard‰Ûªs Mother (voice),8, Who is it?!,2
6274,Howard,8, It‰Ûªs Leonard!,2
6275,Howard‰Ûªs Mother (voice),8, You‰Ûªre gonna have to play outside! I‰Ûªm not dressed to receive!,2
6276,Howard,8," No one cares, Ma! So, what‰Ûªs up?",2
6277,Leonard,8," Listen, I need to talk to you about something.",2
6278,Howard (his phone rings),8," Momentito. Yello. Oh, Stephanie, thanks for calling me back. I was worried‰Û_ Oh‰Û_ Uh-huh‰Û_ Uh-huh‰Û_ Uh-huh‰Û_ No, I understand‰Û_ Sure, we can be friends. Absolutely. Thanks for calling. Yeah, you have a nice day, too. (To Leonard) You are dead to me.",2
6279,Scene,8, The apartment,2
6280,Raj,8," Okay, who gets the extra dumpling?",2
6281,All,8, Rock-paper-scissors- lizard-Spock.,2
6282,Sheldon,8," Okay, one of us is going to have to stop putting up Spock.",2
6283,Howard,8, How do we decide that?,2
6284,All,8, Rock-paper-scissors-lizard-Spock. Oh!,2
6285,Leonard,8," Oh, hey, guys.",2
6286,Sheldon,8, Hello.,2
6287,Raj,8, Hey.,2
6288,Leonard,8," Hi, Howard. Howard?",2
6289,Howard,8, Sheldon.,2
6290,Sheldon,8," Howard is employing a schoolyard paradigm in which you are, for all intents and purposes, deceased. He intends to act on this by not speaking to you, feigning an inability to hear you when you speak and otherwise refusing to acknowledge your existence.",2
6291,Leonard,8, That‰Ûªs just ridiculous. Why are you cooperating with him?,2
6292,Sheldon,8," I don‰Ûªt make the rules, Leonard.",2
6293,Leonard,8," Howard, come on, I didn‰Ûªt plan on this. These things just happen. Usually not to me, but they do happen.",2
6294,Howard,8, Did someone just feel a cold breeze?,2
6295,Sheldon,8, I believe this is an extension of the death metaphor. The cold breeze is the so-called ectoplasmic issue of a disembodied soul passing by.,2
6296,Raj,8," You know, screw it, I‰Ûªm just gonna eat the dumpling.",2
6297,Leonard (answering door),8," Oh, hi, Steph, come on in.",2
6298,Steph,8, åÊIs this a bad time?,2
6299,Leonard,8," Yeah, but I don‰Ûªt see a better one on the horizon, so‰Û_",2
6300,Howard,8," Oh, if it isn‰Ûªt Mrs. Dead to Me.",2
6301,Steph,8," Hello, Howard.",2
6302,Howard,8, Sheldon?,2
6303,Sheldon,8," Look I‰Ûªm sorry, you violated the terms of your metaphor by acknowledging her existence. I‰Ûªm out.",2
6304,Leonard,8, He just won‰Ûªt listen to me.,2
6305,Steph,8," Okay, I guess it‰Ûªll just be the three of us then.",2
6306,Leonard,8, Hmm. Lisa‰Ûªs gonna be disappointed.,2
6307,Steph,8, Yeah.,2
6308,Howard,8, Lisa?,2
6309,Steph,8," Yeah, my roommate. She just went through a really bad breakup and I thought she might like to meet somebody fun like you.",2
6310,Howard,8," Leonard, Stephanie, you‰Ûªre alive, it‰Ûªs a miracle!",2
6311,Scene,8, The apartment kitchen. Howard is on the phone.,2
6312,Howard,8," So, anyway, Lisa, I just wanted to tell you again how much I enjoyed the other night, and again, I‰Ûªm sorry for how it ended. But again, if you could let me know about Friday. My mother needs a head count so she can know how big a brisket to get.",2
6313,Leonard,8," Howard, Howard, look at this.",2
6314,Howard,8," Anyway, call me. It‰Ûªs Howard.",2
6315,Voice from TV,8," The possibility of life on Mars has long fascinated scientists and laypersons alike. It‰Ûªs unclear how the Mars Rover got into the crevice, but one thing‰Ûªs certain, the data which it has sent back contain the first clear indications that there may have been life on Mars. It‰Ûªs a scientific discovery that has staggering implications for all mankind. Unfortunately, we‰Ûªll never know who‰Ûªs responsible.",2
6316,Howard,8, Son of a bitch.,2
6317,Scene,9, The lobby. ,2
6318,Sheldon,9," Penny, hello.",2
6319,Penny,9," Hey, Sheldon.",2
6320,Sheldon,9, What is shaking?,2
6321,Penny,9, I‰Ûªm sorry?,2
6322,Sheldon,9," It‰Ûªs colloquial, a conversation opener. So, do you find the weather satisfying? Are you currently sharing in the triumph of some local sports team?",2
6323,Penny,9, What‰Ûªs wrong with you? you‰Ûªre freaking me out.,2
6324,Sheldon,9, I‰Ûªm striking up a casual conversation with you. S‰Ûªu‰Ûªup?,2
6325,Penny,9, Please don‰Ûªt do that.,2
6326,Sheldon,9," All right, But I‰Ûªm given to understand that when you have something awkward to discuss with someone, it‰Ûªs more palatable to preface it with banal chit chat.",2
6327,Penny,9," So, this wasn‰Ûªt the awkward part?",2
6328,Sheldon,9, No.,2
6329,Penny,9," Oh, all right. S‰Ûªu‰Ûªup?",2
6330,Sheldon,9," Oh, good, I used that right. Anyway, you‰Ûªre aware that Leonard has entered into a new romantic relationship which includes a sexual component?",2
6331,Penny,9," Okay, feeling the awkward now.",2
6332,Sheldon,9, Her name is Dr. Stephanie Barnett and she is a highly distinguished surgical resident at Freemont Memorial.,2
6333,Penny,9," Yeah, Leonard told me.",2
6334,Sheldon,9, Good. What he may have left out is how important this relationship is to me.,2
6335,Penny,9, To you?,2
6336,Sheldon,9," Yes, see, of the handful of women Leonard‰Ûªs been involved with, she‰Ûªs the only one I have ever found tolerable.",2
6337,Penny,9," Well, what about me?",2
6338,Sheldon,9, The statement stands for itself.,2
6339,Penny,9," Well, aren‰Ûªt you sweet?",2
6340,Sheldon,9," Anyway, should you have any interaction with her, it would be most helpful that she not see you as a sexual rival.",2
6341,Penny,9," Yeah, I think she‰Ûªs pretty safe.",2
6342,Sheldon,9," You say that now, but consider the following scenario, you‰Ûªre sitting in your apartment, it‰Ûªs late, you‰Ûªre alone, your hypothalamus is swimming in a soup of estrogen and progesterone and suddenly even Leonard seems like a viable sexual candidate, or a, uh, hookup as it‰Ûªs referred to by today‰Ûªs urban youth.",2
6343,Penny,9, Really?,2
6344,Sheldon,9," Yes. Now, should that happen, I would ask you to find some way to suppress your libido.",2
6345,Penny,9, I could think about you.,2
6346,Sheldon,9," Fine, whatever works.",2
6347,Penny,9," Always nice talking to you, Sheldon.",2
6348,Sheldon,9," Uh, peace out!",2
6349,Scene,9, The apartment.,2
6350,Sheldon,9," Well, this is very pleasant.",2
6351,Leonard,9, I‰Ûªm glad you‰Ûªre enjoying yourself.,2
6352,Sheldon,9, And you said there‰Ûªd never be enough pasta for the three of us.,2
6353,Leonard,9, I stand corrected.,2
6354,Sheldon,9," You know, Italian housewives have a rule of thumb. A handful of dry pasta about an inch in diameter is sufficient for each person as it doubles in volume when cooked.",2
6355,Steph,9, That‰Ûªs very interesting.,2
6356,Sheldon,9, Thank you.,2
6357,Leonard,9, She doesn‰Ûªt mean it. She‰Ûªs just being nice.,2
6358,Sheldon,9," Well, Stephanie, since Leonard seems to be dropping the conversational ball, I guess I‰Ûªll just have to pick it up. Have you ever witnessed a violent crime?",2
6359,Steph,9, No.,2
6360,Sheldon,9, Good. What‰Ûªs your favourite fruit?,2
6361,Steph,9," Ih-uh, strawberries.",2
6362,Sheldon,9," Hmm, technically not a fruit, but all right. Where did you do your medical internship?",2
6363,Steph,9," Uh, Lawrence Memorial in Galveston, Texas.",2
6364,Sheldon,9, Really? That‰Ûªs where I was born!,2
6365,Steph,9, You‰Ûªre kidding!,2
6366,Sheldon,9," I spent so much of my childhood at that hospital. When I was 12, I got to ride there in a helicopter.",2
6367,Steph,9," Why, what-what-what happened?",2
6368,Sheldon,9, Radiation burns. A little mishap while I was building my own cat scanner.,2
6369,Steph,9," I‰Ûªm sorry, you tried to build your own cat scanner?",2
6370,Sheldon,9," No, I didn‰Ûªt try, I succeeded. In fact, I was briefly able to see the inside of my sister‰Ûªs guinea pig, Snowball, before he caught fire. It led to an interesting expression in our house, not a snowball‰Ûªs chance in a cat scanner.",2
6371,Leonard,9," Uh, Sheldon?",2
6372,Sheldon,9," Excuse me. When I come back, just for fun, the subject will be alternative history. Specifically, how would the civil war have gone differently if Lincoln had been a robot sent from the future? (To Leonard) Look at that, there‰Ûªs even pasta left over.",2
6373,Leonard,9, Do you understand that this was supposed to be a date?,2
6374,Sheldon,9," I do. Do you? Because frankly, you‰Ûªve been in a foul mood since I sat down.",2
6375,Leonard,9," Okay, here‰Ûªs my question, why did you sit down?",2
6376,Sheldon,9," To help. Look, if you fail at this relationship, and history suggests you will, then we risk losing the medical officer that our landing party has always needed.",2
6377,Leonard,9, What landing party?,2
6378,Sheldon,9," You‰Ûªre Kirk, I‰Ûªm Spock, Wolowitz is Scotty, Koothrappali is the guy who always gets killed, and now we‰Ûªve got McCoy.",2
6379,Scene,9, A cinema.,2
6380,Steph,9," So, we‰Ûªre all standing around looking at the post-op x ray and there it is, clear as day, right in the guy‰Ûªs chest cavity, one of my earrings.",2
6381,Leonard,9," Oh, my god, what did you do?",2
6382,Steph,9," What do you think I did? I discreetly slipped off the other earring, put it in my pocket and then got the hell out of there!",2
6383,Sheldon (arriving),9," I have a bone to pick with you, sir.",2
6384,Leonard,9, Oo-oo-oh!,2
6385,Steph,9," Hi, Sheldon.",2
6386,Sheldon,9," Hi, Stephanie. I‰Ûªm sorry I‰Ûªm late, but your companion left the most indecipherable invitation.",2
6387,Leonard,9, What invitation?,2
6388,Sheldon,9," We‰Ûªre going to the movies. What movie? What theatre? What time? If you were trying to make it impossible to locate you, you couldn‰Ûªt have done a better job.",2
6389,Leonard,9," Oh, clearly I could have.",2
6390,Sheldon,9," It took me nearly 20 minutes to go through the browser history on your computer to see what movie times you looked up. Wait here, I‰Ûªll find us seats.",2
6391,Steph,9," No, no, we have seats.",2
6392,Leonard,9, Not the right seats. (Sheldon moves around the theatre sitting in various seats and shouting ‰ÛÏHa!‰Û),2
6393,Steph,9, What is he doing?,2
6394,Leonard,9, He‰Ûªs finding the acoustic sweet spot.,2
6395,Steph,9, Does he always do this?,2
6396,Leonard,9, Sometimes he brings a toy xylophone. I am really sorry about this.,2
6397,Steph,9," No, it‰Ûªs fine. you know, he‰Ûªs sweet.",2
6398,Sheldon,9," My apologies, you‰Ûªve been sitting in it all along. Leonard, you want to slide over one?",2
6399,Leonard,9," No, just sit here.",2
6400,Sheldon,9," Oh, yeah, this is it.",2
6401,Scene,9, Outside Leonard‰Ûªs bedroom. ,2
6402,"Sheldon (Knock, knock, knock) ",9," Leonard (knock, knock, knock)  Leonard (knock, knock, knock)  Leonard.",2
6403,Leonard,9," What, Sheldon? What, Sheldon? What, Sheldon?",2
6404,Sheldon (showing him laptop),9, Tell me what you see here.,2
6405,Leonard,9, The blunt instrument that will be the focus of my murder trial?,2
6406,Sheldon,9," This is Stephanie‰Ûªs facebook page. Now, where it should say in a relationship, what does it say?",2
6407,Leonard,9, Stephanie Barnett is single.,2
6408,Sheldon,9," Yeah, furthermore, earlier this evening, she threw a digital sheep at some guy named Mike. Who‰Ûªs Mike? Why does he get a digital sheep and not you?",2
6409,Leonard,9, It‰Ûªs just her facebook page and we‰Ûªve only been going out a couple of weeks.,2
6410,Sheldon,9," You don‰Ûªt see it, do you? We‰Ûªre losing her.",2
6411,Leonard,9," Okay, I‰Ûªm going to make this very simple for you. You are not in this relationship, I am. Ergo, you have no say in anything that happens between me and Stephanie.",2
6412,Sheldon,9," I‰Ûªm afraid I can‰Ûªt allow that. Pursuant to Starfleet General Order 104 Section A, you are deemed unfit and I hereby relieve you of your command.",2
6413,Leonard,9," General Order 104, Section A does not apply in this situation.",2
6414,Sheldon,9, Give me one good reason why not.,2
6415,Leonard,9, Because this is not Star Trek,2
6416,Scene,9, Outside Penny‰Ûªs door.,2
6417,"Sheldon (Knock, knock, knock) ",9," Penny (knock, knock, knock)  Penny (knock, knock, knock)  Penny.",2
6418,Penny,9, What?,2
6419,Sheldon,9, This is banana bread.,2
6420,Penny,9, This is a door knob.,2
6421,Sheldon,9, It‰Ûªs my understanding that an unsolicited gift of food can be a precursor to an impromptu invitation to come in and chat.,2
6422,Penny,9," Sheldon, would you like to come in?",2
6423,Sheldon,9, I suppose I could spare a few minutes. Were you robbed?,2
6424,Penny,9, No.,2
6425,Sheldon,9, How can you be sure?,2
6426,Penny,9," Sheldon, what do you want?",2
6427,Sheldon,9," I‰Ûªm certain this will come as no surprise to you, but Leonard is failing in yet another relationship.",2
6428,Penny,9, He‰Ûªs having problems with Stephanie?,2
6429,Sheldon,9," She‰Ûªs sending virtual livestock to random men on the internet. If I have any hope of keeping them together, I need data. Specifically, I need to know exactly what Leonard did that caused you to pop an emotional cap in his buttocks.",2
6430,Penny,9, What?,2
6431,Sheldon,9," Again, urban slang. In which, I believe I‰Ûªm gaining remarkable fluency. So, what is the down and the low? And don‰Ûªt worry, this is all entirely confidential, so, you feel free to include any and all shortcomings in the bedroom.",2
6432,Penny,9, We never got to the bedroom.,2
6433,Sheldon,9, Because?,2
6434,Penny,9," Oh, okay, all right, you know what? I‰Ûªll tell you what happened. We were young, we were very much in love, but we could only communicate through a time-traveling mailbox at my lake house.",2
6435,Sheldon,9," It‰Ûªs not enough that you made me watch that movie, but now you mock me with it?",2
6436,Scene,9, The university cafeteria.,2
6437,Sheldon,9," Gentlemen, I have a question about dating and relationships.",2
6438,Raj,9, You told me you were going to have the talk with him.,2
6439,Howard,9, I‰Ûªve been waiting for someone to have the talk with me.,2
6440,Sheldon,9," More to the point, it‰Ûªs about finding a way to keep Leonard and Stephanie together.",2
6441,Howard,9," Oh, I don‰Ûªt think you can.",2
6442,Sheldon,9," Well, why not?",2
6443,Howard,9, Look at Leonard‰Ûªs record. 27 days with Joyce Kim.,2
6444,Raj,9, During which she defected to North Korea.,2
6445,Howard,9, Two booty calls with Leslie Winkle.,2
6446,Raj,9, For which she awarded him the nickname ‰ÛÏspeed of light Leonard.‰Û,2
6447,Howard,9, And a three hour dinner with Penny.,2
6448,Raj,9, Which would have been two and a half if they ordered the souffle when they sat down.,2
6449,Howard,9," Based on the geometric progression, his relationship with Stephanie should have ended after 20 minutes.",2
6450,Sheldon,9," Yes, I‰Ûªm aware of the math, Y equals 27 days over 12 to the nth, the issue remains, how do we circumvent his inevitable rejection?",2
6451,Raj,9," Well, if you want to guarantee his appeal to Stephanie, your best bet would be to kill all the other men on the planet.",2
6452,Howard,9," I‰Ûªll tell you what you shouldn‰Ûªt do. Don‰Ûªt spritz him with that body spray from the commercial where the women undress when they smell it, that doesn‰Ûªt work at all, no matter how much you put on.",2
6453,Sheldon,9," So, that‰Ûªs all you‰Ûªve got? Apocalyptic genocide and go easy on the cologne?",2
6454,Howard,9, Yes.,2
6455,Raj,9, Yeah.,2
6456,Scene,9, Outside Penny‰Ûªs door.,2
6457,"Sheldon (Knock, knock, knock) ",9," Penny (knock, knock, knock)  Penny.",2
6458,Penny,9, What?,2
6459,"Sheldon (Knock, knock, knock) ",9, Penny. Zucchini bread.,2
6460,Penny,9," Oh, thank you.",2
6461,Sheldon,9, May I come in?,2
6462,Penny,9, No.,2
6463,Sheldon,9, I see. Apparently my earlier inquiry regarding you and Leonard crossed some sort of line. I apologize.,2
6464,Penny,9," Well, thank you.",2
6465,Sheldon,9," So, have you and I returned to a social equilibrium?",2
6466,Penny,9, Yes.,2
6467,Sheldon,9, Great. New topic. Where are you in your menstrual cycle?,2
6468,Penny,9, What?,2
6469,Sheldon,9," I‰Ûªve been doing some research online, and apparently female primates, you know, uh, apes, chimpanzees, you, they find their mate more desirable when he‰Ûªs being courted by another female. Now, this effect is intensified when the rival female is secreting the pheromones associated with ovulation. Which brings me back to my question, where are you in (Penny slams door). Clearly, I‰Ûªm 14 days too early.",2
6470,Scene,9, The apartment. ,2
6471,Leonard,9," All I‰Ûªm saying is if they can cure yellow fever and malaria, why can‰Ûªt they do something about lactose intolerance?",2
6472,Steph,9," Leonard, you‰Ûªre going to have to let this go. You had a little cheese dip, you farted, I thought it was cute.",2
6473,Sheldon,9," Oh, hi Stephanie.",2
6474,Steph,9, Hi.,2
6475,Leonard,9, Want some more wine?,2
6476,Steph,9," Yeah, I assume I‰Ûªm not driving anywhere tonight. (Sheldon lets out a loud noise).",2
6477,Leonard,9, What are you doing?,2
6478,Sheldon,9, I have a craving for white asparagus that apparently is destined to go unsatisfied.,2
6479,Leonard,9, Excuse me. What the hell is wrong with you?,2
6480,Sheldon,9, I‰Ûªm helping you with Stephanie.,2
6481,Leonard,9, By making constipated moose sounds?,2
6482,Sheldon,9," When I fail to open this jar and you succeed it will establish you as the alpha male. You see, when a female witnesses an exhibition of physical domination she produces the hormone oxytocin. If the two of you then engage in intercourse this will create the biochemical reaction in the brain which lay people naively interpret as falling in love.",2
6483,Leonard,9, Huh? Would it work if I just punched you in the face?,2
6484,Sheldon,9," Yes, actually it would, but let‰Ûªs see how the lid goes. I‰Ûªm not strong enough, Leonard, you‰Ûªll have to do it.",2
6485,Leonard,9," Oh, for god‰Ûªs sakes.",2
6486,Sheldon,9," Go ahead, it‰Ûªs pre-loosened.",2
6487,Steph,9, Do you want some help with that?,2
6488,Leonard,9," No, no, no, I got it.",2
6489,Sheldon,9," No, yeah, yeah, he‰Ûªs got it, and that‰Ûªs not surprising. This is something I long ago came to peace with in my role as the beta male. Open it. (Leonard tries again. Then taps jar on counter. Jar breaks.)",2
6490,Steph,9," Oh my god, are you okay?",2
6491,Leonard,9," No, I‰Ûªm not. I‰Ûªm bleeding.",2
6492,Sheldon,9, Like a gladiator!,2
6493,Steph,9," Oh, honey, you‰Ûªre going to need stitches.",2
6494,Leonard,9, Stitches? With a needle?,2
6495,Steph,9," Well, yeah, I mean, just a few.",2
6496,Leonard,9," Oh, okay, yeah, hang on a sec. (Throws up in sink)",2
6497,Sheldon,9," FYI, I was defrosting a steak in there.",2
6498,Scene,9, The hospital.,2
6499,Sheldon,9," What a beautiful job Stephanie did. I might have gone with a mattress suture instead of a blanket stitch, but you can‰Ûªt argue with her results. It‰Ûªs a shame it won‰Ûªt scar, the war wound is a time-honoured badge of masculinity.",2
6500,Leonard,9, I can‰Ûªt remember a time when you weren‰Ûªt talking.,2
6501,Sheldon,9," Just for the record, my efforts to establish you as the alpha male were not aided by you bursting into tears.",2
6502,Leonard,9," I did not burst into tears, my eyes just got a little watery.",2
6503,Sheldon,9, Watery?,2
6504,Leonard,9, She stuck a needle into my hand!,2
6505,Steph,9," Hey, how‰Ûªs my big cry baby?",2
6506,Leonard,9, I didn‰Ûªt cry.,2
6507,Steph,9," Okay, I‰Ûªm just teasing you. But, yeah, you did. Alright, it‰Ûªs all good. what do you say we get you home and put you to bed?",2
6508,Leonard,9," Oh, are you still going to spend the night?",2
6509,Steph,9," Uh, no, I think that you probably need to rest.",2
6510,Sheldon,9," She‰Ûªs right, as long as you‰Ûªre vomiting, coitus is contra-indicated.",2
6511,Leonard,9," Thank you, Dr. Cooper.",2
6512,Sheldon,9," You‰Ûªre welcome, Dr. Hofstadter.",2
6513,Steph,9," Okay, I‰Ûªm going to go get your discharge papers.",2
6514,Leonard (after Sheldon tuts),9, What?,2
6515,Sheldon,9," Well, you seem like a perfectly pleasant person. I just can‰Ûªt understand why women have such a hard time loving you.",2
6516,Scene,9, The Apartment.,2
6517,Leonard,9," Hey, can you open this for me?",2
6518,Raj,9, Can I see your stitches?,2
6519,Leonard,9, Sure. (Holds out hand. Howard starts to retch).,2
6520,Raj,9, Answering the question once and for all why Wolowitz bailed out of medical school.,2
6521,Penny (entering),9," Leonard, congratulations.",2
6522,Leonard,9, What for?,2
6523,Penny,9, Your facebook status update. Leonard Hofstadter is in a relationship.,2
6524,Leonard,9," What? no. no, that‰Ûªs not right.",2
6525,Howard,9," Oh, man, did you switch your status before she did? Speaking as an expert, way to look needy.",2
6526,Penny,9," Seriously? You went first, after only two weeks? That‰Ûªs bold.",2
6527,Leonard,9," It‰Ûªs not bold, it‰Ûªs a mistake. I didn‰Ûªt change my status.",2
6528,Penny,9," Well, then who did?",2
6529,Sheldon,9," I had no choice, he cried in front of her.",2
6530,Leonard,9, You hacked my facebook account?,2
6531,Sheldon,9," Oh, it‰Ûªs hardly hacking when you use the same password for everything, Kal-el.",2
6532,Leonard,9, Are you insane? Now she‰Ûªs going to think I‰Ûªm desperate. You‰Ûªve destroyed this relationship! And you want to know what the worst part is? You don‰Ûªt even understand what you did wrong because you can‰Ûªt conceive of something that you are not an expert in!,2
6533,Sheldon,9, In which I am not an expert.,2
6534,Leonard,9, Don‰Ûªt even! I don‰Ûªt want to hear another word out of you.,2
6535,Penny (after Raj lets out a noise),9," What‰Ûªs wrong, Lassie? Timmy fall down the well? (He points) Oh, wow. She just updated her facebook status.",2
6536,Howard,9, Stephanie Barnett is in a relationship with Leonard Hofstadter.‰Û,2
6537,Leonard,9," Really? Oh, look at that, I have a girlfriend.",2
6538,Sheldon,9," If I am permitted to speak again, Dr. Sheldon Cooper for the win.",2
6539,Scene,10, The apartment. ,2
6540,Steph,10," I don‰Ûªt see anything at all, Sheldon.",2
6541,Sheldon,10," Well, you‰Ûªre the doctor, but I am constantly hearing this annoying sound.",2
6542,Leonard,10," Me, too.",2
6543,Sheldon,10, Is it a high-frequency whistle?,2
6544,Leonard,10," No, it‰Ûªs more of a relentless, narcissistic drone.",2
6545,Steph,10," Yup, there‰Ûªs no inflammation at all, Sheldon.",2
6546,Sheldon,10, Then it must be a tumour.,2
6547,Steph,10, I Seriously doubt it.,2
6548,Leonard,10, Maybe it‰Ûªs a lingering bacterial infection from all those childhood toilet swirlies.,2
6549,Sheldon,10, Is that possible? I used to get those all the time. Even in church.,2
6550,Steph,10," Well, you know, if it is from a swirly, there‰Ûªs something I can do. Okay, circle, circle, dot, dot, now you have a cootie shot! I‰Ûªm going to bed",2
6551,Leonard,10," Okay, I‰Ûªll be right in.",2
6552,Sheldon,10," It‰Ûªs not enough that she mocks me, but that isn‰Ûªt even the correct procedure for a cootie shot.",2
6553,Leonard,10, Do you understand that Stephanie‰Ûªs not here to treat your imaginary ailments?,2
6554,Sheldon,10, How is it imaginary that I keep hearing an octave above Middle C? Is that imaginary? I don‰Ûªt think so.,2
6555,Leonard,10, Good night.,2
6556,Sheldon,10," Leonard, there‰Ûªs one more thing. Under Article One, Section Three of our Roommate Agreement, I‰Ûªm calling an emergency meeting.",2
6557,Leonard,10," No, you‰Ûªre not.",2
6558,Sheldon,10," Leonard moves the meeting not occur. Is there a second? None heard, the motion fails. I‰Ûªd like to begin the meeting by congratulating you on the progress in your relationship with Dr. Stephanie.",2
6559,Leonard,10, Thank you.,2
6560,Sheldon,10," That being said, we have to discuss the implementation of the agreed upon ‰ÛÏcohabitation‰Û rider which has been activated now that the two of you are living together.",2
6561,Leonard,10, We‰Ûªre not living together.,2
6562,Leonard,10, That‰Ûªs absurd.,2
6563,Sheldon,10," You initialed it. See? L.H., L.H., L.H.",2
6564,Leonard,10," Wait, I only initialed it because I never thought it would happen! I initialed another clause naming you my sidekick in case I get superpowers.",2
6565,Sheldon,10," Hmm, yes, you did. Now, to review the following provisions are hereby activated. In the refrigerator, as opposed to us having two separate shelves and one communal shelf, the three of us now get individual shelves and the door becomes communal. Next, apartment vacuuming shall be increased from two to three times a week to accommodate the increased accumulation of dead skin cells. Third,the bathroom schedule. Now, I‰Ûªm given to understand women have different needs, so, we‰Ûªll have to discuss that.",2
6566,Leonard,10, I‰Ûªm going to bed.,2
6567,Sheldon,10," At least take this with you. Look, and have Stephanie initial here, here, here, here and here. This states that she does not now nor does she intend to play a percussive or brass instrument. Sure it sounds like a tumor pressing on the auditory nerve.",2
6568,Scene,10, The kitchen.,2
6569,Leonard,10," No, absolutely not.",2
6570,Sheldon,10, It‰Ûªs not a big deal. We have latex gloves.,2
6571,Leonard,10," I don‰Ûªt care what the symptoms are, my girlfriend is not going to give you a prostate exam.",2
6572,Steph,10," Hi, Sheldon.",2
6573,Sheldon,10," Good morning, Dr. Stephanie. I trust Leonard satisfied you sexually last night.",2
6574,Leonard,10," Oh come on! Sheldon, we don‰Ûªt ask questions like that.",2
6575,Sheldon,10, I heard you ask it over and over. How is it inappropriate for me to ask it once?,2
6576,Steph,10, He did very nicely.,2
6577,Sheldon,10, See? She‰Ûªs not offended. And now you finally have an answer.,2
6578,Penny (entering),10, Out of coffee. Need coffee.,2
6579,Steph,10," Uh, hello.",2
6580,Penny,10," Hi! Stephanie, right?",2
6581,Steph,10," Uh-huh. And, and, and you are?",2
6582,Penny,10," I‰Ûªm Penny, I live across the hall. I‰Ûªve heard a lot about you.",2
6583,Steph,10, Really?,2
6584,Penny,10, Mm-hmm.,2
6585,Steph,10, I haven‰Ûªt heard a thing about you. Leonard? Why haven‰Ûªt I heard a thing about this woman who lives across the hall and comes into your apartment in the morning in her underwear?,2
6586,Leonard,10," She‰Ûªs heard about you because we‰Ûªre, you know, involved and you haven‰Ûªt heard about her because‰Û_ I never slept with her, I swear!",2
6587,Sheldon,10," In Leonard‰Ûªs defence, it wasn‰Ûªt for lack of trying.",2
6588,Leonard,10," Thank you, Sheldon.",2
6589,Sheldon,10," You‰Ûªre welcome, Leonard.",2
6590,Leonard,10," Look, I‰Ûªm just saying, um, Penny is one of our many neighbours, you know, and in our building, neighbours come and go, it‰Ûªs very casual, no dress code. In fact, some mornings I‰Ûªll just mosey down to the third floor in my pyjamas and have cereal with Mrs. Vartabedian.",2
6591,Sheldon,10, Really? I have never once been invited to have cereal with Mrs. Vartabedian.,2
6592,Leonard,10," She doesn‰Ûªt like you. Um, well, uh, you have a gall bladder to remove and I have to get in the shower and Penny has clothes to put on, so‰Û_",2
6593,Steph,10," Well, it was very nice meeting you.",2
6594,Penny,10," Nice to finally meet you, too.",2
6595,Steph,10, åÊAnd I‰Ûªll see you tonight?,2
6596,Leonard,10," Okay, bye-bye.",2
6597,Steph,10, Bye.,2
6598,Sheldon,10, What could I possibly have done to offend Mrs. Vartabedian?,2
6599,Penny,10," So, that‰Ûªs Stephanie, huh?",2
6600,Leonard,10, Why do I feel like I‰Ûªm the one that just got the prostate exam?,2
6601,Penny,10," You know, she seems very nice.",2
6602,Sheldon,10," Oh, she is. She‰Ûªs terrific, and she‰Ûªs proving to be a valuable roommate.",2
6603,Penny,10, Roommate? You guys are living together?,2
6604,Sheldon,10, Like hippies.,2
6605,Leonard,10, We‰Ûªre not living together.,2
6606,Sheldon,10, Do I have to pull out the paperwork again?,2
6607,Leonard,10, We‰Ûªre not living together.,2
6608,Penny,10, Are you sure?,2
6609,Leonard,10, How could I not be sure?,2
6610,Penny,10," Well, let‰Ûªs find out.",2
6611,Leonard,10, Don‰Ûªt you think if a woman was living with me I‰Ûªd be the first one to know about it?,2
6612,Penny,10," Oh, sweetie, you‰Ûªd be the last one to know about it. (Looking through his wardrobe) Hmm, cute dresses. I bet this looks great on you!",2
6613,Leonard,10, We‰Ûªre not living together.,2
6614,Penny,10," Okay, hmm, scented candles, fuzzy slippers, ooh, floral bed sheets?",2
6615,Leonard,10, We‰Ûªre not living together.,2
6616,Penny,10," Okay, moving on. Now, who are these guys at Disney World?",2
6617,Leonard,10," Uh, the big dog is Goofy, and the older couple with the mouse ears , I have no idea. We‰Ûªre not living together!",2
6618,Penny,10," You‰Ûªre going to go down swinging, huh? All right, well, we got your body lotion, your InStyle Magazine, your jewellery box.",2
6619,Leonard,10, We‰Ûªre not‰Û_ Where‰Ûªs my Bat Signal?,2
6620,Penny,10, You have a Bat Signal?,2
6621,Leonard,10," I did. It was right here. She must‰Ûªve‰Û_ Oh, my God, we‰Ûªre living together.",2
6622,Penny,10, Really? What was your first clue?,2
6623,Scene,10, The university cafeteria.,2
6624,Howard,10, New pants?,2
6625,Leonard,10," Yeah, Stephanie got them for me.",2
6626,Howard,10, Nice. Cotton?,2
6627,Leonard,10," Actually, I think it‰Ûªs more of wool, fire ant blend.",2
6628,Howard,10," So, the girlfriend‰Ûªs buying clothes for you, huh? Sounds serious.",2
6629,Leonard,10," It is actually. In fact, I gave it a lot of thought and I decided it was time for us to live together.",2
6630,Howard,10," Uh, Leonard, huge mistake. There‰Ûªs a whole buffet of women out there and you‰Ûªre just standing in the corner eating the same devilled egg over and over again.",2
6631,Leonard,10, At least I have an egg. What do you have?,2
6632,Howard,10, A veritable smorgasbord of potential sexual partners. See the blonde over there? I can hit on her and you can‰Ûªt.,2
6633,Leonard,10," So, go hit on her.",2
6634,Howard,10, She‰Ûªs not my type.,2
6635,Raj,10," Too bad, ‰Ûªcause she was checking you out before.",2
6636,Howard,10, She was?,2
6637,Raj,10, Of course not. Look at her.,2
6638,Leonard,10," I don‰Ûªt care what you guys think, Stephanie and I are very happy living together. I will give either of you 20 dollars, right now to trade pants with me.",2
6639,Scene,10, The hospital.,2
6640,Steph,10," Sheldon, what are you doing here?",2
6641,Sheldon,10, Hang on. 130 over 80. A little high. We can attribute that to the stress of sneaking past the security desk.,2
6642,Steph,10, Where did you get the stethoscope and the blood pressure cuff?,2
6643,Sheldon,10," My aunt Marion gave them to me for my 12th birthday. She thought if I failed at theoretical physics that I should have a trade to fall back on. And by the way, the blood pressure cuff is called a sphygmomanometer.",2
6644,Steph,10, Thank you.,2
6645,Sheldon,10, Didn‰Ûªt they teach you that in medical school?,2
6646,Steph,10," I‰Ûªm kinda busy here, Sheldon.",2
6647,Sheldon,10, I understand. All I need is for you to authorize these tests.,2
6648,Steph,10," A cardiac stress test, a full body MRI, an electromyogram, a CBC, baseline glucose, upper GI?",2
6649,Sheldon,10," Oh, and an exploratory laparoscopy. Last time I had hiccups, it felt like my diaphragm was just going through the motions.",2
6650,Steph,10," Go home, Sheldon.",2
6651,Sheldon,10, Can I at least have the upper GI? I already drank the barium!,2
6652,Scene,10, The laundry room.,2
6653,Penny,10, Oh hey.,2
6654,Leonard,10," Oh, good. Do you have any fabric softener?",2
6655,Penny,10," Yeah, sure. What are you washing? A crocodile?",2
6656,Leonard,10," No, the pants that Stephanie got me.",2
6657,Penny,10," Oh, sweetie, you can‰Ûªt machine wash these. They‰Ûªll be ruined.",2
6658,Leonard,10, Are you sure?,2
6659,Penny,10, Absolutely.,2
6660,Leonard,10," Oh, no. I wish you‰Ûªd told me that sooner.",2
6661,Penny,10, Are you guys having problems?,2
6662,Leonard,10," No, everything‰Ûªs fine.",2
6663,Penny,10, Really?,2
6664,Leonard,10," Yeah. It‰Ûªs wonderful. Okay, maybe this whole living together happened kind of suddenly, but it‰Ûªs fine, it‰Ûªs great.",2
6665,Penny,10," Okay, Leonard, honey, you know, if you‰Ûªre uncomfortable with the way things are going, you‰Ûªre allowed to say something.",2
6666,Leonard,10, Are you sure? That doesn‰Ûªt sound right.,2
6667,Penny,10," Believe me, your feelings are just as important as hers.",2
6668,Leonard,10, No that doesn‰Ûªt sound right either.,2
6669,Penny,10, Just tell her you need the relationship to move at a pace that you both are comfortable with.,2
6670,Leonard,10," Yeah, I could say something like that to her. I‰Ûªll go do that. Thank you.",2
6671,Penny,10, Sure.,2
6672,Leonard,10, You have a really good grasp on this. Maybe you could talk to her?,2
6673,Penny,10," You‰Ûªre kidding, right?",2
6674,Leonard,10," No, but that‰Ûªs okay. I‰Ûªll go talk to her. Want to come with?",2
6675,Penny,10, Go! Wow.,2
6676,Scene,10, The apartment.,2
6677,Steph,10," Oh, no.",2
6678,Sheldon,10, Wha??,2
6679,Steph,10," You were right. Your larynx is terribly inflamed. I mean, I‰Ûªve never seen anything like it.",2
6680,Sheldon,10, I knew it! What do I do?,2
6681,Steph,10, You‰Ûªre going to need to stop talking immediately.,2
6682,Sheldon,10, For how‰Û_,2
6683,Steph,10, Du-du-du-du! Immediately.,2
6684,Leonard,10, Hey.,2
6685,Steph,10," Oh, hi, honey.",2
6686,Leonard,10, Sheldon. (He waves) What‰Ûªs going on?,2
6687,Steph,10, I just performed a Sheldonectomy.,2
6688,Leonard,10," Careful, if you don‰Ûªt get it all, it‰Ûªll only come back worse.",2
6689,Steph,10, Gotcha.,2
6690,Leonard,10," Listen, we need to talk.",2
6691,Steph,10, Oh-oh. Do we need to talk or do we ‰ÛÏneed to talk‰Û?,2
6692,Leonard,10, I don‰Ûªt know what that means.,2
6693,Steph,10," Okay, why don‰Ûªt you just tell me what it is you have to tell me?",2
6694,Leonard,10," Okay, um, well, look, it‰Ûªs just that things between you and me have been going pretty quick.",2
6695,Steph,10, And?,2
6696,Leonard,10, It‰Ûªs just a little scary.,2
6697,Steph,10," Well, yeah, but scary good, right?",2
6698,Leonard,10," Sure, when is scary not good? But, okay, um, I have feelings, right?",2
6699,Steph,10, Uh-huh.,2
6700,Leonard,10," Okay, and it‰Ûªs perfectly okay to express those feelings, right?",2
6701,Steph,10, Of course honey why don‰Ûªt you tell me what it is you‰Ûªre feeling?,2
6702,Leonard,10," Okay, well, I ju‰Û_ I think it‰Ûªs important to remember that we move at a pace that is our speed and‰Û_ oh, shoot, I had it!",2
6703,Steph,10," Okay, how about this? How about I tell you what I‰Ûªm feeling?",2
6704,Leonard,10, What‰Ûªs that? Really? Right now?,2
6705,Steph,10, Why not?,2
6706,Leonard,10," I just ate, aren‰Ûªt you supposed to wait an hour?",2
6707,Steph,10, I think that‰Ûªs for swimming.,2
6708,Leonard,10," Oh, okay. I just hope I don‰Ûªt get cramps.",2
6709,Steph,10, Yeah.,2
6710,Scene,10, The laundry room.,2
6711,Leonard,10, Hey.,2
6712,Penny,10," Hey. Oh, I put your clothes in the dryer.",2
6713,Leonard,10, Thank you.,2
6714,Penny,10, Your pants are ruined.,2
6715,Leonard,10, Good.,2
6716,Penny,10," So, how did the talk with Stephanie go?",2
6717,Leonard,10," Well, um, on one level, really, really well.",2
6718,Penny,10," So, you told her you wanted to slow things down?",2
6719,Leonard,10," Not specifically, but, uh, I did tell her that I had feelings.",2
6720,Penny,10," Good, good. And then what?",2
6721,Leonard,10," And then the, the subject got changed somehow.",2
6722,Penny,10," You had sex, didn‰Ûªt you?",2
6723,Leonard,10," Um, little bit. (She looks at her watch) What?",2
6724,Penny,10," Nothing. Okay, well, it sounds like things are going to work out.",2
6725,Leonard,10," Yeah, yeah it‰Ûªs all good. Everything‰Ûªs going to work out. One way or another.",2
6726,Penny,10," Come on, Leonard, you are entitled to try and make things go the way you want them to.",2
6727,Leonard,10, Really?,2
6728,Penny,10," Yes, you don‰Ûªt always have to go along with what the woman wants.",2
6729,Leonard,10, Huh.,2
6730,Penny,10, What?,2
6731,Leonard,10," Nothing, just rethinking my whole life. Okay, here‰Ûªs the thing, I‰Ûªm afraid that if I ask her to move out, she‰Ûªll just dump me.",2
6732,Penny,10," Well, it‰Ûªs a chance you have to take. I mean, look, if it‰Ûªs meant to be, it‰Ûªll be.",2
6733,Leonard,10," Very comforting. Okay, so what do I say to her?",2
6734,Penny,10," I don‰Ûªt know. I mean, what have women said to you when they wanted to slow a relationship down?",2
6735,Leonard,10," I really like you, but I want to see how things go with Mark?",2
6736,Penny,10," Yeah, that‰Ûªll slow it down.",2
6737,Scene,10, Leonard‰Ûªs bedroom. Leonard and Steph have just had sex. ,2
6738,Steph,10," I‰Ûªm sorry, I totally interrupted you. What were you saying?",2
6739,Leonard,10," Oh, right, yeah, um, so, Stephanie, here‰Ûªs the thing. I really like you.",2
6740,Steph,10," Oh, God, here comes the speech.",2
6741,Leonard,10, What speech?,2
6742,Steph,10," I really like you, but maybe we should spend a little less time together ‰Û÷cause I need my space but I‰Ûªll call you on Tuesday, and then you never call me so I call you, but you don‰Ûªt call me back and then when I run into you at the coffee shop you pretend like you‰Ûªve been having problems with your voice mail and I know that you‰Ûªre lying, but I pretend like I don‰Ûªt care even though I‰Ûªm dying inside!",2
6743,Leonard,10," No! No, no! I wasn‰Ûªt going to say any of that. I was just going to say, I really like you.",2
6744,Steph,10," Oh. Oh, good! ‰Û÷Cause I really like you, too.",2
6745,Leonard,10, Terrific.,2
6746,Scene,10, The university cafeteria. ,2
6747,Leonard,10, Hey.,2
6748,Raj,10, Hey.,2
6749,Howard,10, Hey. Nice sweater.,2
6750,Leonard,10," Yeah, Stephanie got it for me. It‰Ûªs kind of fun.",2
6751,Raj,10," It‰Ûªs got a big bird on it, dude.",2
6752,Leonard,10," Yeah, yeah, that‰Ûªs the fun part. We‰Ûªre also getting new curtains for my bedroom, and a dust ruffle, and a duvet, and I don‰Ûªt even know what a duvet is but I‰Ûªm pretty sure if I did I wouldn‰Ûªt want one, but every time I talk to her about moving out she cries and we have sex.",2
6753,Raj,10," You‰Ûªre lucky. With me, it‰Ûªs usually the other way around.",2
6754,Howard,10," You know, if you can‰Ûªt talk to her, why don‰Ûªt you just text her?",2
6755,Leonard,10, Isn‰Ûªt that kind of cowardly?,2
6756,Howard,10," Oh, yeah. It‰Ûªs beyond contemptible.",2
6757,Raj,10," It‰Ûªs true, but on the other hand you are wearing a bird sweater.",2
6758,Leonard,10, Sold. ‰ÛÏI think it would be better for our relationship if you moved back to your place.‰Û There. It‰Ûªs done.,2
6759,Howard,10, Good for you.,2
6760,Leonard,10," Yeah, good for me. I‰Ûªll never have sex again. (Phone buzzes) I was wrong. See ya.",2
6761,Scene,10," Outside Penny‰Ûªs apartment. Sheldon has his laptop. He knocks three times, the presses a button and an electronic voice says ‰ÛÏPenny‰Û. He does this three times. ",2
6762,Penny (opening door),10, Sheldon?,2
6763,Computer voice,10, I have an inflamed larynx.,2
6764,Penny,10, Okay?,2
6765,Computer voice,10, We‰Ûªre out of herbal tea. Do you have any?,2
6766,Penny,10," Okay, let me check.",2
6767,Computer voice,10," Some hiney would be nice, too.",2
6768,Penny,10, Hiney?,2
6769,Computer voice,10, Honey.,2
6770,Scene,11, The university cafeteria.,2
6771,Sheldon,11," Your argument is lacking in all scientific merit. It is well established Superman cleans his uniform by flying into Earth‰Ûªs yellow sun, which incinerates any contaminate matter and leaves the invulnerable Kryptonian fabric unharmed and daisy fresh.",2
6772,Howard,11, What if he gets something Kryptonian on it?,2
6773,Sheldon,11, Like what?,2
6774,Howard,11, I don‰Ûªt know. Kryptonian mustard.,2
6775,Sheldon,11, I think we can safely assume that all Kryptonian condiments were destroyed when the planet Krypton exploded.,2
6776,Raj,11," Or it turned into mustard Kryptonite, the only way to destroy a rogue Kryptonian hotdog threatening Earth.",2
6777,Leonard,11," Raj, please, let‰Ûªs stay serious here. Superman‰Ûªs body is Kryptonian, therefore his sweat is Kryptonian.",2
6778,Howard,11," Yeah, what about Kryptonian pit stains?",2
6779,Sheldon,11, Superman doesn‰Ûªt sweat on Earth.,2
6780,Howard,11," Okay, he‰Ûªs invited for dinner in the Bottle City of Kandor. He miniaturizes himself, enters the city where he loses his superpowers. Now, before dinner, his host says, ‰ÛÏwho‰Ûªs up for a little Kryptonian tetherball?‰Û Superman says ‰ÛÏsure,‰Û works up a sweat, comes back to Earth, his uniform now stained with indestructible Kryptonian perspiration.",2
6781,Raj,11, Booya.,2
6782,Sheldon,11, Superman would have taken his uniform to a Kandorian dry cleaner before he left the Bottle.,2
6783,Raj,11," ‰ÛÏKandorian dry cl‰Û_‰Û I give up, you can‰Ûªt have a rational argument with this man.",2
6784,Howard,11," Hey, isn‰Ûªt that the guy who won the MacArthur genius grant last year? No, not all at once.",2
6785,Raj,11, Then how?,2
6786,Howard,11," Leonard. Now, Raj. Now, Sheldon.",2
6787,Raj,11, I didn‰Ûªt get a good look. Can I go again?,2
6788,Howard,11, No.,2
6789,Leonard,11, It‰Ûªs David Underhill. So what?,2
6790,Sheldon,11, So what? His observation of high-energy positrons has provided the first conclusive evidence for the existence of galactic dark matter.,2
6791,Leonard,11," I have two words for you. The first is big, the other‰Ûªs whoop.",2
6792,Sheldon,11, It is a big whoop. It made almost all the work you‰Ûªve done since you‰Ûªve been here completely useless.,2
6793,Leonard,11, Did not.,2
6794,Howard,11," Did, too.",2
6795,Leonard,11," Did‰Û_ okay, maybeåÊ some of it, but, look, the guy was just in the right place, at the right time with the right paradigm-shifting reinterpretation of the universe. He got lucky.",2
6796,Raj,11, In more ways than one. He‰Ûªs a very handsome man.,2
6797,Howard,11," Doesn‰Ûªt do anything for me. If I was gonna go that way, I‰Ûªm more of a Zac Ephron kinda guy.",2
6798,Raj,11," Oh, yeah, like you have a shot with Zac Ephron.",2
6799,David (approaching),11," Excuse me, Are you Leonard Hofstadter?",2
6800,Leonard,11," Uh, yeah.",2
6801,David,11, I‰Ûªm David Underhill.,2
6802,Leonard,11," Uh, y-yeah.",2
6803,David,11," Yeah, Dr. Gablehauser said if I wanted to set something up in the photomultiplier lab, that you‰Ûªd be able to give me a hand?",2
6804,Leonard,11, You want to work with me?,2
6805,David,11," Well, if you have a little time, yeah.",2
6806,Leonard,11," Wow, y-yeah, sure. Yeah, no problem. Uh, Here‰Ûªs my home number, here‰Ûªs my cell, here‰Ûªs my office, here‰Ûªs my parents‰Ûª number up in New Jersey, they always know how to reach me. So‰Û_",2
6807,David,11, Okay.,2
6808,Leonard,11," Congratulations on the MacArthur Grant, by the way. Big fan.",2
6809,David,11, Thanks. I‰Ûªll call you.,2
6810,Leonard,11, Okay. Bye-bye! What are you looking at?You‰Ûªve never seen a hypocrite before?,2
6811,Scene,11, The apartment. The guys are playing Wii bowling.,2
6812,Raj,11," Trailing badly, Wolowitz needs a strike if he has any hopes of catching up with Sheldon Cooper, who is dominating in the ninth frame with a career-best 68.",2
6813,Leonard (entering),11," Hey, guys!",2
6814,Howard,11, That doesn‰Ûªt count. Do over! Do over!,2
6815,Sheldon,11, There are no do-overs in Wii bowling.,2
6816,Howard,11, There are always do-overs when my people play sports.,2
6817,Sheldon,11, Where were you that‰Ûªs more important than Wii bowling night?,2
6818,Leonard,11," Actually, I was‰Û_",2
6819,Sheldon,11, It‰Ûªs a rhetorical question. There is nothing more important than Wii bowling night.,2
6820,Leonard,11," Come on, it‰Ûªs just a video game. And we suck at it.",2
6821,Sheldon,11, Nice motivational speech from the team captain.,2
6822,Howard,11, Where were you?,2
6823,Leonard,11, I was working with Dave Underhill.,2
6824,Howard,11," Ooh, ‰ÛÏDave.‰Û Sounds like Leonard‰Ûªs got a new BFF.",2
6825,Leonard,11," Actually, he‰Ûªs pretty cool. I mean, not only is he a brilliant scientist, but it turns out he‰Ûªs a Black Diamond skier, he collects vintage motorcycles, he plays in a rock band.",2
6826,Howard,11, So? We‰Ûªre in a rock band.,2
6827,Leonard,11," No, we play Rock Band on our X-Box.",2
6828,Sheldon,11, Nice motivational speech from our lead guitarist.,2
6829,Leonard,11," He‰Ûªs funny, too. He does this hysterical impersonation of Stephen Hawking having phone sex. What are you wearing? That‰Ûªs not, he does it better. Anyway, he said he was gonna take me to the gym tomorrow, so I‰Ûªm gonna go practice my situps.",2
6830,Raj,11," Whoa. Humongous man crush, dude.",2
6831,Howard,11, Yep. It‰Ûªs officially a bro-mance.,2
6832,Penny (entering),11," Hey, Sheldon, are you and Leonard putting up a Christmas tree?",2
6833,Sheldon,11," No, because we don‰Ûªt celebrate the ancient pagan festival of Saturnalia.",2
6834,Penny,11, Saturnalia?,2
6835,Howard,11," Gather round, kids, it‰Ûªs time for Sheldon‰Ûªs beloved Christmas special.",2
6836,Sheldon,11," In the pre-Christian era, as the winter solstice approached and the plants died, pagans brought evergreen boughs into their homes as an act of sympathetic magic, intended to guard the life essences of the plants until spring. This custom was later appropriated by Northern Europeans and eventually it becomes the so-called Christmas tree.",2
6837,Howard,11," And that, Charlie Brown, is what boredom is all about.",2
6838,Penny,11," Okay, well, thank you for that, but I got you and Leonard a few silly neighbour gifts, so I‰Ûªll just put them under my tree.",2
6839,Sheldon,11, Wait! You bought me a present?,2
6840,Penny,11, Uh-huh.,2
6841,Sheldon,11, Why would you do such a thing?,2
6842,Penny,11, I don‰Ûªt know. ‰Û÷Cause it‰Ûªs Christmas?,2
6843,Sheldon,11," Oh, Penny. I know you think you‰Ûªre being generous, but the foundation of gift-giving is reciprocity. You haven‰Ûªt given me a gift, you‰Ûªve given me an obligation.",2
6844,Howard,11," Don‰Ûªt feel bad, Penny, it‰Ûªs a classic rookie mistake. My first Hanukkah with Sheldon, he yelled at me for eight nights.",2
6845,Penny,11," Now, honey, it‰Ûªs okay.You don‰Ûªt have to get me anything in return.",2
6846,Sheldon,11, Of course I do. The essence of the custom is that I now have to go out and purchase for you a gift of commensurate value and representing the same perceived level of friendship as that represented by the gift you‰Ûªve given me. It‰Ûªs no wonder suicide rates skyrocket this time of year.,2
6847,Penny,11," Okay, you know what? Forget it. I‰Ûªm not giving you a present.",2
6848,Sheldon,11," No, it‰Ûªs too late. I see it. That elf sticker says to Sheldon. The die has been cast, the moving finger has writ, Hannibal has crossed the Alps.",2
6849,Howard (to Raj who is whispering in his ear),11, I know. It‰Ûªs funny when it‰Ûªs not happening to us.,2
6850,Penny,11," Sheldon, I am very, very sorry.",2
6851,Sheldon,11," No. No, I brought this on myself by being such an endearing and important part of your life. I‰Ûªm going to need a ride to the mall.",2
6852,Howard,11, It‰Ûªs happening to us.,2
6853,Scene,11, The stairwell.,2
6854,Leonard,11, Ow! Ow!,2
6855,David,11, Are you gonna make it?,2
6856,Leonard,11," Yeah, I guess.",2
6857,David,11, All right.,2
6858,Leonard,11, Thanks for letting me try out your motorcycle.,2
6859,David,11, No problem.,2
6860,Leonard,11," I had no idea it was so heavy. The thing just fell right over on me, didn‰Ûªt it?",2
6861,David,11, Yeah. Lucky for you it wasn‰Ûªt moving.,2
6862,Penny,11," Oh, hey, Leonard. Ooh, are you okay?",2
6863,Leonard,11," Oh, yeah. It‰Ûªs just a little motorcycle accident.",2
6864,Penny,11," My God, how fast were you going?",2
6865,Leonard,11, I don‰Ûªt know. It‰Ûªs all such a blur.,2
6866,David,11, Ha ha ha. Good one. He couldn‰Ûªt even get it started. Hi. Dave.,2
6867,Penny,11, Hi. Penny. So it‰Ûªs your motorcycle?,2
6868,David,11, Uh-huh.,2
6869,Penny,11," Oh, is it okay?",2
6870,David,11, It‰Ûªs fine.,2
6871,Leonard,11," Yeah, lucky for the bike it landed on my leg.",2
6872,David,11, You mind giving me a hand with speed racer here?,2
6873,Penny,11," Oh, yeah. Yeah, sure. So, um, Dave, how do you know Leonard?",2
6874,David,11, I‰Ûªm a physicist.,2
6875,Penny,11," Ha-ha. No, you‰Ûªre not.",2
6876,David,11, Why is that so surprising?,2
6877,Penny,11," Uh, well, it‰Ûªs just that the physicists I know are indoorsy and pale.",2
6878,Leonard,11, I‰Ûªm not indoorsy. I just wear the appropriate sun block because I don‰Ûªt take melanoma lightly.,2
6879,Penny,11," So, are you and Leonard working on an experiment together?",2
6880,David,11," Yeah, actually we are.",2
6881,Leonard,11," Yeah, we‰Ûªre examining the radiation levels of photomultiplier tubes for a new dark matter detector.",2
6882,Penny,11," Uh, sweetie, sweetie, Dave was talking. You know, I love science.",2
6883,Leonard,11, Since when?,2
6884,Penny,11," Since always. Call me a geek, but I am just nuts for the whole subatomic particle thing.",2
6885,David,11, The last thing I would ever call you is a geek.,2
6886,Penny,11," Ha. Well, that‰Ûªs what I am, queen of the nerds.",2
6887,David,11," Well, if you like, I could show you the lab we‰Ûªre working in. We‰Ûªve got some cool toys, you know, lasers and stuff.",2
6888,Penny,11," You know, I have always wanted to see a big science lab.",2
6889,Leonard,11, Since when?,2
6890,Penny,11, Since always.,2
6891,David,11," Leonard, are you okay here?",2
6892,Leonard,11," Uh, yeah. I guess.",2
6893,David,11," How ‰Ûªbout we go see it now? Maybe afterwards we take the bike up the coast, we grab a little bite to eat‰Û_",2
6894,Penny,11," Um,yeah, yeah, that sounds great, let me just get my jacket.",2
6895,David,11," Boy, she‰Ûªll do, huh?",2
6896,Leonard,11," Yeah, if you like that type.",2
6897,David,11," So, you and her?",2
6898,Leonard,11," No, just neighbours.",2
6899,David,11, Really. I don‰Ûªt know how you live next door to that without doing something about it.,2
6900,Leonard,11," Actually, science is my lady.",2
6901,Penny,11, Okay. Let‰Ûªs go.,2
6902,David,11," All right. See you tomorrow, Leonard.",2
6903,Leonard,11," See ya. ‰Û÷Bye, Penny. Have fun. (Bangs head on door. Sheldon opens it.)",2
6904,Sheldon,11, Yes? (Leonard falls through) Did you forget your key?,2
6905,Scene,11, A gift shop.,2
6906,Sheldon,11, I don‰Ûªt see anything in here a woman would want.,2
6907,Howard,11," You‰Ûªre kidding. You‰Ûªve got lotions and bath oils and soaps, that‰Ûªs the estrogen hat trick.",2
6908,Leonard,11," What it is is a cacophonous assault of eucalyptus, bayberry, cinnamon and vanilla. It‰Ûªs as if my head were trapped in the pyjamas of a sultan.",2
6909,Raj,11," Sheldon, if you don‰Ûªt like this stuff, let‰Ûªs just go next door and build her a bear.",2
6910,Sheldon,11," I told you before, bears are terrifying.",2
6911,Howard,11," Come on, bath stuff, it‰Ûªs perfect! You got a scented candle, a cleansing buff, spearmint and green tea scented bath oil, promotes relaxation.",2
6912,Sheldon,11, That presupposes Penny is tense.,2
6913,Raj,11, She knows you. She‰Ûªs tense. We all are. Buy a basket!,2
6914,Howard,11," Excuse me, we‰Ûªre ready.",2
6915,Sheldon,11," No, we‰Ûªre not. Let‰Ûªs say for a moment that I accept the bath item gift hypothesis, I now lay the following conundrum at your feet, which size?",2
6916,Howard,11, This one. Let‰Ûªs go.,2
6917,Sheldon,11, You put no thought into that.,2
6918,Howard,11," I‰Ûªm sorry. Uh, this one. Let‰Ûªs go!",2
6919,Sheldon,11," I have insufficient data to proceed. Excuse me, miss?",2
6920,Assistant,11, Yes?,2
6921,Sheldon,11," If I were to give you this gift basket, based on that action alone and no other data, infer and describe the hypothetical relationship that exists between us.",2
6922,Assistant,11, Excuse me?,2
6923,Sheldon,11," Here. Now, are we friends? Colleagues? Lovers? Are you my grandmother?",2
6924,Assistant,11, I don‰Ûªt understand what you‰Ûªre talking about and you‰Ûªre making me a little uncomfortable.,2
6925,Howard,11, See? Sounds just like you and Penny. We‰Ûªll take it.,2
6926,Scene,11, The university cafeteria.,2
6927,David,11," Hey, Leonard. Come, join us.",2
6928,Leonard,11," Oh, hey, Dave. And Penny, what a surprise.",2
6929,Penny,11," Hey, Leonard. Dave was just showing me around the university. You know, this place is unbelievable!",2
6930,Leonard,11," Yeah, I know. I‰Ûªve been offering to show you around for a year and a half. You always said you had yoga.",2
6931,Penny,11, I never said that.,2
6932,Leonard,11, Maybe I heard you wrong. A lot of words sound like yoga.,2
6933,David,11," This is an amazing woman, Leonard. She has a curious and agile mind, not to mention being curious and agile in other respects.",2
6934,Penny,11," Oh, shut up!",2
6935,Leonard,11," Yes, please shut up. So, um, Dave, don‰Ûªt you think you and I should get back to the lab? You know, that dark matter isn‰Ûªt going to detect itself.",2
6936,David,11," Actually, I was thinking about taking the afternoon off so I could work on another experiment with Penny.",2
6937,Penny,11, Really? We‰Ûªre going to do an experiment?,2
6938,David,11, Uh-huh. We‰Ûªre going to explore the effects of tequila shots on a gorgeous 22-year-old woman.,2
6939,Penny,11, It‰Ûªs not an experiment! You saw what happened last night.,2
6940,David,11, You ready to go?,2
6941,Penny,11," Yeah. Oh, can I drive the motorcycle?",2
6942,David,11," Yeah, why not? You can‰Ûªt do any worse than Leonard.",2
6943,Leonard,11," That‰Ûªs funny. By the way, my leg is killing me. Thanks for asking.",2
6944,Scene,11, The apartment.,2
6945,Sheldon,11," Mmm, great news, Leonard, I‰Ûªve solved my Penny gift dilemma.",2
6946,Leonard,11, Yippee.,2
6947,Sheldon,11," You see, the danger was that I might under or over-reciprocate, but I have devised a foolproof plan. See, I will open her gift to me first and then excuse myself, feigning digestive distress.",2
6948,Leonard,11, Brilliant.,2
6949,Sheldon,11," It is, isn‰Ûªt it? Is it okay if I hide them in your room? The smell makes me nauseated.",2
6950,Leonard,11, Do whatever you want.,2
6951,Sheldon,11," Thank you, that‰Ûªs very gracious.åÊåÊåÊåÊ Gentlemen.",2
6952,Howard,11, Why couldn‰Ûªt you have just done what Leonard did and get Penny a new boyfriend?,2
6953,Leonard,11, My leg is killing me. Thanks for asking.,2
6954,Scene,11, Penny‰Ûªs apartment.,2
6955,Leonard,11," Okay, I have just one question for you. While I am perfectly happy with the way things are between us, you said that you didn‰Ûªt want to go out with me because I was too smart for you! Well, news flash, lady, David Underhill is ten times smarter than me! You‰Ûªd have to drive a railroad spike into his brain for me to beat him at checkers! Next to him, I‰Ûªm like one of those sign-language gorillas who knows how to ask for grapes! So, my question is, what‰Ûªs up with that?",2
6956,Penny,11, Why are you yelling at me?,2
6957,Leonard,11," Sorry, I‰Ûªm sorry, I‰Ûªm sorry! Never mind, we‰Ûªre cool.",2
6958,Penny,11, Dave is not smarter than you. He‰Ûªs an idiot.,2
6959,Leonard,11, Really? Why would you say that?,2
6960,Penny,11, Because a smart guy takes the nude photos of his wife off his cell phone before he tries to take nude photos of his girlfriend.,2
6961,Leonard,11, He tried to take nude photos of you?,2
6962,Penny,11, That‰Ûªs what you took from that? The guy is married!,2
6963,Leonard,11," Oh, yeah. I‰Ûªm so‰Û_ oh, that‰Ûªs terrible.",2
6964,Penny,11," And you, if you are so okay with the way things are between us, why are you so jealous?",2
6965,Leonard,11," Well, uh, the important thing is he‰Ûªs married and that‰Ûªs terrible!",2
6966,Penny,11," Nice save, genius. Eggnog?",2
6967,Leonard,11, Lactose.,2
6968,Penny,11, It‰Ûªs just rum. It stopped being eggnog like half an hour ago.,2
6969,Leonard,11, Smooth.,2
6970,Penny,11, Smoother than you.,2
6971,Leonard,11," Come on, it‰Ûªs Christmas, just give me this one.",2
6972,Penny,11," Okay, Merry Christmas.",2
6973,Leonard,11," By the way, my leg is killing me. Thanks for asking.",2
6974,Scene,11, The apartment. Leonard opens the door to Penny.,2
6975,Penny,11, Merry Christmas.,2
6976,Leonard,11, Merry Christmas.,2
6977,Penny,11, How‰Ûªs your leg?,2
6978,Leonard,11," Very good, thanks for asking. Come on in.",2
6979,Sheldon,11," Ah, good, Penny, you‰Ûªre here to exchange gifts. You‰Ûªll be pleased to know I‰Ûªm prepared for whatever you have to offer.",2
6980,Penny,11," Okay, here.",2
6981,Sheldon,11," I should note I‰Ûªm having some digestive distress, so, if I excuse myself abruptly, don‰Ûªt be alarmed. Oh, a napkin.",2
6982,Penny,11, Turn it over.,2
6983,Sheldon,11," To Sheldon, live long and prosper. Leonard Nimoy.",2
6984,Penny,11," Yeah, he came into the restaurant. Sorry the napkin‰Ûªs dirty. He wiped his mouth with it.",2
6985,Sheldon,11, I possess the DNA of Leonard Nimoy?!,2
6986,Penny,11," Well, yeah, yeah, I guess. But look, he signed it.",2
6987,Sheldon,11, Do you realize what this means? All I need is a healthy ovum and I can grow my own Leonard Nimoy!,2
6988,Penny,11," Okay, all I‰Ûªm giving you is the napkin, Sheldon.",2
6989,Sheldon,11, Be right back.,2
6990,Penny,11, Here. Open it.,2
6991,Leonard,11," Oh, a gift certificate for motorcycle lessons. Very thoughtful.",2
6992,Penny,11," Yeah, and I checked. Not letting the bike fall on you while standing still is lesson one.",2
6993,Leonard,11," Oh, then, I think you‰Ûªll appreciate what I got you.",2
6994,Penny,11, Okay. 101 Totally Cool Science Experiments for Kids.,2
6995,Leonard,11," You know, ‰Ûªcause you‰Ûªre so into science.",2
6996,Penny,11, Sheldon! What did you do?!,2
6997,Sheldon,11," I know! It‰Ûªs not enough, is it? Here.",2
6998,Penny,11," Leonard, look! Sheldon‰Ûªs hugging me.",2
6999,Leonard,11, It‰Ûªs a Saturnalia miracle.,2
7000,Scene,12, The apartment.,2
7001,Howard,12," All right, that‰Ûªs the last servo. Behold the Mobile Omnidirectional Neutralization and Termination Eradicator. Or‰Û_",2
7002,All,12, MONTE.,2
7003,Howard,12," Featuring one articulated razor-sharp killing saw, one polycarbonate grinding and flipping wheel, steel armour plate exoskeleton top and bottom, and enough horsepower to drive a 110 pounds of mechanized death from zero to holy crap in 4.8 seconds.",2
7004,Sheldon,12, Is it wrong to say I love our killer robot?,2
7005,Raj,12," As with my father, I both love and fear it.",2
7006,Howard,12," All right, enough chitchat, let‰Ûªs destroy something.",2
7007,Together (lifting),12," One, two, three, go.",2
7008,Raj,12, Okay. What shall be first to taste the wrath of Monte?,2
7009,Leonard,12, Maybe we should start small.,2
7010,Raj,12," Okay. Ooh, perhaps today is the day we finally find out what‰Ûªs inside the Magic Eight Ball.",2
7011,Sheldon,12, Did it when I was four. It‰Ûªs an icosahedral dye floating in tinted blue water.,2
7012,Raj,12," Man, call spoiler alert before you say things like that.",2
7013,Leonard,12, How about the toaster oven?,2
7014,Sheldon,12, What did the toaster oven ever do to you?,2
7015,Leonard,12," What did I ever do to Jimmy Mullins in the third grade? He still punched me in the face with my own fists. Sorry, you little nerd, you were just in the wrong boys‰Ûª room at the wrong time.",2
7016,Howard,12," Gentlemen, goggles.",2
7017,Sheldon,12," Yeah, this is an auspicious moment. Yeah, like Robert Oppenheimer or Neil Armstrong, we need the appropriate words to mark this historic scientific event.",2
7018,Raj,12," How about ‰ÛÏDie, toaster, die‰Û?",2
7019,Leonard,12, That‰Ûªll do it.,2
7020,Raj (after watching complete destruction of toaster oven),12," All right, what‰Ûªs next?",2
7021,Scene,12, The stairwell.,2
7022,Penny,12," No, I think I‰Ûªm just going to stay in tonight and do laundry. (Monte bursts through boys door. Penny screams and runs down the stairs.)",2
7023,Scene,12, Outside in stairwell,2
7024,Howard,12," Oh yeah, they still got the full Monte.",2
7025,Penny,12, Leonard?,2
7026,Leonard,12, Uh-huh?,2
7027,Penny,12, What the hell?,2
7028,Leonard,12, Killer robot. We built it.,2
7029,Penny,12," Yeah, well, it almost killed me.",2
7030,Sheldon,12," If it wanted to kill you, you‰Ûªd be dead.",2
7031,Penny,12," So, who exactly does it want to kill?",2
7032,Sheldon,12," I‰Ûªm sorry, are you unaware of the upcoming Southern California Robot Fighting League Round Robin Invitational?",2
7033,Penny,12," You know, since I moved last year, not all my mail has been forwarded.",2
7034,Howard,12, It‰Ûªs a big deal. There‰Ûªs an awards banquet and a dance afterward. Perhaps you‰Ûªd like to come with me. I know the other fellas would be really excited to see a girl there.,2
7035,Penny,12, How is it supposed to be a dance if I‰Ûªm the only girl?,2
7036,Howard,12," Well, that may be a slight exaggeration. You‰Ûªd be the only doable girl.",2
7037,Penny,12," You‰Ûªre a pig, Howard.",2
7038,Howard,12, How is doable anything but a compliment?,2
7039,Leonard,12," Howard, why don‰Ûªt we just work on the robot?",2
7040,Howard,12," Please, Leonard, not now. Once again, Penny and I have begun our little tango.",2
7041,Penny,12, Our tango?,2
7042,Howard,12," The carnal repartee, the erotic to and fro. But as delicious as the appetizer might be, at some point we will have to succumb and eat the entree while it‰Ûªs still‰Û_ hot.",2
7043,Leonard,12," I‰Ûªm begging you, stop talking.",2
7044,Penny,12," Look, normally I can just ignore you. I mean, I get it, you‰Ûªre a little peculiar. You know, like Sheldon.",2
7045,Sheldon,12," Yeah, excuse me, Penny, but in this room, you‰Ûªre the one who‰Ûªs peculiar.",2
7046,Penny,12," Yeah, you might be right. But back to you. I know you think you‰Ûªre some sort of smooth-talking ladies‰Ûª man, but the truth is, you are just pathetic and creepy.",2
7047,Howard,12," Um, so what are you saying?",2
7048,Penny,12," I am saying it is not a compliment to call me doable. It‰Ûªs not sexy to stare at my ass and say, ‰ÛÏOoh, it must be jelly ‰Ûªcause jam don‰Ûªt shake like that.‰Û And most important, we are not dancing a tango, we‰Ûªre not to‰Ûªing and fro‰Ûªing. Nothing is ever going to happen between us. Ever.",2
7049,Howard,12," Wait a minute. This isn‰Ûªt flirting, you‰Ûªre serious.",2
7050,Penny,12," Flirting? You think I‰Ûªm flirting with you? I am not flirting with you, no woman is ever gonna flirt with you, you‰Ûªre just gonna grow old and die alone.",2
7051,Howard,12, Thanks for the heads up.,2
7052,Leonard,12," Howard, where you going?",2
7053,Howard,12," I‰Ûªm going home to live my creepy, pathetic life.",2
7054,Leonard,12, Wow.,2
7055,Penny,12," Well, someone had to say it. (Raj whispers in Leonard‰Ûªs ear) What?",2
7056,Leonard,12, He said maybe we should enter you in the killer robot competition.,2
7057,Scene,12, Howard‰Ûªs bedroom.,2
7058,Howard‰Ûªs Mother (voice),12," Howard, the phone is ringing!",2
7059,Howard,12," Here‰Ûªs a crazy idea, Ma, answer it!",2
7060,Howard‰Ûªs Mother (voice),12," Hello? All right, hold on. It‰Ûªs your friend, Leonard! He wants to know why you‰Ûªre not at school today!",2
7061,Howard,12," I don‰Ûªt go to school, Ma. I work at a university.",2
7062,Howard‰Ûªs Mother (voice),12, That‰Ûªs a school! Now pick up the phone!,2
7063,Howard,12, I don‰Ûªt want to talk to anybody.,2
7064,Howard‰Ûªs Mother (voice),12, Should I ask Leonard to bring over your homework?!,2
7065,Howard,12, I don‰Ûªt have homework. I‰Ûªm a grown man with a master‰Ûªs degree in engineering!,2
7066,Howard‰Ûªs Mother (voice),12," Excuse me, Mr. Fancy-Pants. Want me to get you a Popsicle?",2
7067,Howard,12," Cherry, please!",2
7068,Howard‰Ûªs Mother (voice),12, I ate the cherry. All that‰Ûªs left is green.,2
7069,Howard,12, You make me want to kill myself.,2
7070,Scene,12, The university cafeteria. Other end of the phone call.,2
7071,Raj,12, What‰Ûªs going on?,2
7072,Leonard,12," I don‰Ûªt know, now they‰Ûªre just yelling about Popsicles. Sounds like Penny really got to him.",2
7073,Raj,12," I‰Ûªm not surprised. Despite his hard and crusty shell, Howard is a very sensitive man. Do you know he writes poetry? Mostly about men from Nantucket and hermits named Dave, but he does it with real sensitivity.",2
7074,Kripke (arriving),12," Hey, Hofstadter. Word around the pwasma wab is you built a wobot?",2
7075,Leonard,12," Yes, we did, Kripke.",2
7076,Sheldon,12, His name is Monte.,2
7077,Kripke,12," Well, if you have any dewusions about entewing him against my wobot, the Kwipke Kwippler in the Southern California Wobot Fighting League Wound Wobin Invitational, aka the S.C.aw.F.L.aw.aw.I., his name is gonna be Swrap Metal.",2
7078,Leonard,12," Come on, is that really necessary?",2
7079,Sheldon,12," Leonard, I believe it is. This is trash talk, and trash talk is a traditional component in all sporting events. Kripke, your robot is inferior and it will be defeated by ours because ours exceeds yours in both design and execution. Also, I‰Ûªm given to understand that your mother is overweight.",2
7080,Raj,12," Oh, snap.",2
7081,Sheldon,12," Now, of course, if that is the result of a glandular condition and not sloth and gluttony, I withdraw that comment.",2
7082,Raj,12, What difference does it make? Fat is fat.,2
7083,Sheldon,12, There are boundaries.,2
7084,Kripke,12," Tell you what, forget the S.C.aw.F.L.aw.aw.I., let‰Ûªs settle this woboto a woboto.",2
7085,Sheldon,12, What do you mean?,2
7086,Kripke,12," There‰Ûªs no guawantee we‰Ûªve gotta go against each other in the Wound Wobin, so let‰Ûªs thwow down. You know, unless you‰Ûªre afwaid.",2
7087,Sheldon,12, We accept your challenge. Name a time and place.,2
7088,Kripke,12," Tomowow, thwee o‰Ûªclock, the kinetics wab.",2
7089,Sheldon,12, Make it so.,2
7090,Leonard,12," No, don‰Ûªt make it so. Barry, we can‰Ûªt fight you tomorrow, our engineer is incapacitated.",2
7091,Kripke,12, What‰Ûªs wrong with him?,2
7092,Raj,12, He‰Ûªs depressed because he‰Ûªs pathetic and creepy and he can‰Ûªt get girls.,2
7093,Kripke,12," We‰Ûªre all pathetic and cweepy and can‰Ûªt get girls, that‰Ûªs why we fight wobots. If you‰Ûªre not there, you‰Ûªll be exposed to widicule.",2
7094,Raj,12," I‰Ûªm curious, what part of America is that accent from?",2
7095,Scene,12, Outside Penny‰Ûªs door.,2
7096,Penny,12, Hey.,2
7097,Leonard,12," Hey, you got a minute?",2
7098,Penny,12," Yeah, come on in. What‰Ûªs up?",2
7099,Leonard,12, I need you to apologize to How‰Û_,2
7100,Penny,12, Get out.,2
7101,Leonard,12, Come on. Wolowitz won‰Ûªt come out of his house and we need him for a robot battle.,2
7102,Penny,12," Well, then have the robot go and get him.",2
7103,Leonard,12, The robot didn‰Ûªt hurt his feelings.,2
7104,Penny,12, His feelings needed to be hurt.,2
7105,Leonard,12, He‰Ûªs been in bed for two days.,2
7106,Penny,12," Yeah, probably with a blow-up doll.",2
7107,Leonard,12, He‰Ûªs not with a‰Û_ does it really matter who or what he‰Ûªs with? The guy is devastated.,2
7108,Penny,12," Oh, please, how could I possibly devastate Howard?",2
7109,Leonard,12," Okay, don‰Ûªt take this as a criticism, but you kind of have that overexposed-to-gamma-rays thing going on.",2
7110,Penny,12, What does that mean?,2
7111,Leonard,12," You know, like, most of the time, you‰Ûªre the easygoing Bruce Banner, but then, when you get angry, you kind of turn into, like, you know, grrrrr!",2
7112,Penny,12, I turn into a bear?,2
7113,Leonard,12," Seriously? Gamma rays? Bruce Banner? You didn‰Ûªt get The Incredible Hulk from that? Never mind, just, please go talk to him.",2
7114,Penny,12," And say what? That I didn‰Ûªt mean it, because I meant it.",2
7115,Leonard,12," Well, maybe you can go at it from a different angle, like, um, you see a glimmer of goodness in him and you only said what you said because you want to nurture it and make it shine.",2
7116,Penny,12," Oh, pthththth.",2
7117,Leonard,12," Okay, let‰Ûªs try it this way. Remember the day that we first met and you asked me to go to your boyfriend‰Ûªs apartment to get your TV back and he was nine feet tall and he took my pants off and you said‰Û_ what was that? What did you say? Oh, yes, you said you owed me one.",2
7118,Penny,12," Okay, come on, that‰Ûªs not fair.",2
7119,Leonard,12, I came home with no pants.,2
7120,Penny,12," Fine, I‰Ûªll go over there tomorrow.",2
7121,Leonard,12, Thank you. I should probably give you a heads up about his mother.,2
7122,Penny,12, What about her?,2
7123,Leonard,12, She‰Ûªs a delightful woman. You‰Ûªll love her.,2
7124,Scene,12, Howard‰Ûªs bedroom.,2
7125,Howard‰Ûªs Mother (voice),12," Howard, there‰Ûªs a blonde girl, Patsy, here to see you!",2
7126,Howard,12, Who?,2
7127,Howard‰Ûªs Mother (voice),12," Okay, now she‰Ûªs saying it‰Ûªs Penny.",2
7128,Howard,12, I don‰Ûªt want to talk to her.,2
7129,Penny (entering),12, Hey.,2
7130,Howard,12, Ma!,2
7131,Howard‰Ûªs Mother (voice),12, She ran past me. Was I supposed to tackle her?,2
7132,Penny,12," So, I just came by to see how you were doing.",2
7133,Howard,12, I‰Ûªm fine.,2
7134,Penny,12, Good. Your mom seems nice.,2
7135,Howard,12, People move away from her on the bus. What do you want?,2
7136,Penny,12," Okay, look. Howard, I just want to apologize for some things that I have said. About you. I‰Ûªve been informed that you have feelings. And apparently, I have hurt them. So, I‰Ûªm sorry. Howard.",2
7137,Howard,12," Fine, you‰Ûªre sorry. Good-bye.",2
7138,Penny,12," So, you‰Ûªre okay?",2
7139,Howard,12," Hey, I‰Ûªm a big boy. I‰Ûªm not traumatized by some random comment from some random woman. I mean, get over yourself.",2
7140,Penny,12," Okay. Well, bye. (Penny leaves room. Sound of Howard crying through door.) So close (goes back in.)",2
7141,Scene,12, The apartment. The guys are watching footage on a laptop screen.,2
7142,Leonard,12," Oh, my God. That‰Ûªs Kripke‰Ûªs robot?",2
7143,Kripke (voice),12," As you can see, the Kwippler is weducing the Chevy Cavawier to wubble.",2
7144,Raj,12, I can‰Ûªt watch anymore.,2
7145,Leonard,12," Sheldon, we have to call it off.",2
7146,Sheldon,12," We don‰Ûªt have that option, we‰Ûªve accepted the challenge. We can‰Ûªt run away from a fight.",2
7147,Leonard,12," Oh, please, we‰Ûªve spent our whole lives running away from fights. Personally, I can squeeze through a hole in a fence half my size.",2
7148,Sheldon,12," Impressive as that may be, Monte is not us. Monte has no fear.",2
7149,Raj,12," Sheldon, did we all not just watch the same video? Kripke‰Ûªs robot just had angry sex with a mid-sized automobile.",2
7150,Sheldon,12, You are overlooking the fact that we now know what we‰Ûªre up against and we can modify Monte so that he‰Ûªs prepared.,2
7151,Leonard,12, You want to prepare him? Install a bladder and a pair of shorts so he can wet himself.,2
7152,Raj,12," Excuse me, but how are we going to make any modifications without Wolowitz? Have you heard from Penny yet?",2
7153,Leonard,12, Not yet.,2
7154,Sheldon,12," Have faith, gentlemen. We don‰Ûªt need Wolowitz, engineering is merely the slow younger brother of physics. Watch and learn. Do either of you know how to open the toolbox?",2
7155,Scene,12, Howard‰Ûªs bedroom. ,2
7156,Howard,12," And then, when I was 14, I met Marcy Grossman. She was so beautiful. She just got her braces off but they left a little of the overbite. It was so hot, like a sexy little chipmunk. I didn‰Ûªt have the courage to ask her out, but I dedicated a song to her at the ninth grade talent show.",2
7157,Penny,12," Aw, that sounds sweet.",2
7158,Howard,12," Marcy Grossman is sunshine, on a cloudy day, when it‰Ûªs cold outside, Marcy Grossman is the month of May‰Û_",2
7159,Penny,12," Oh, it‰Ûªs cute.",2
7160,Howard,12," I guess you‰Ûªd say, what can make me feel this way, Marcy Grossman, Marcy Grossman, Marcy Grossman, Talkin‰Ûª ‰Ûªbout Marcy‰Û_",2
7161,Penny,12, That‰Ûªs great.,2
7162,Howard,12, Grossman.,2
7163,Penny,12," Oh, it‰Ûªs fun.",2
7164,Howard,12, And then she came up with that sexy little chipmunk mouth and spit in my hair. Which brings us to tenth grade.,2
7165,Penny,12," Howard, do you think maybe sometimes you try too hard?",2
7166,Howard,12, Look at me. What chance do I have if I don‰Ûªt try too hard?,2
7167,Penny,12," Well, you‰Ûªd have a terrific chance. I mean, you‰Ûªre smart, you‰Ûªre funny, you have a cool job. You build stuff that goes into outer space.",2
7168,Howard,12, I guess.,2
7169,Penny,12," Look, I‰Ûªm telling you, I‰Ûªve known you for, like, a year and a half and this is the first time I feel like I‰Ûªm talking to a real person. And you know what? I like him, he‰Ûªs a nice guy.",2
7170,Howard,12, You really think so?,2
7171,Penny,12, Yes.,2
7172,Howard,12, I don‰Ûªt know.,2
7173,Penny,12, I do. (Howard tries to kiss her. She punches him.),2
7174,Scene,12, The lab. ,2
7175,Leonard,12, Nice little bot you‰Ûªve got here.,2
7176,Kripke,12, I‰Ûªm aware.,2
7177,Leonard,12," What‰Ûªs this do, spin?",2
7178,Kripke,12, Yep. At 3400 RPM. It can cut through steel like it was wubber.,2
7179,Leonard,12," Neat. Good work. Sheldon, we‰Ûªve got to call this off.",2
7180,Sheldon,12," No, Leonard. For years, merciless thugs like Kripke have made my life a series of painful noogies and humiliating wedgies and the insensitively named Indian burns. That stops now.",2
7181,Raj,12," But, Sheldon, we don‰Ûªt have a chance. The only improvement you were able to make on the robot was to put fresh batteries in the remote.",2
7182,Sheldon,12," What you fail to realize is Kripke suffers from a fatal flaw, overconfidence from his robot‰Ûªs massive size and its overwhelming power.",2
7183,Raj,12," That‰Ûªs not overconfidence, that‰Ûªs observation.",2
7184,Sheldon,12," Trust me, Kripke will fall easy prey to my psychological warfare. Observe. Kripke! I would ask if your robot is prepared to meet its maker, but as you are its maker, clearly the two of you have met.",2
7185,Kripke,12, What is his pwoblem?,2
7186,Raj,12," Way to bust out the Jedi mind tricks, dude.",2
7187,Leonard,12," I just want to make sure that we‰Ûªre all clear, standard robotic fighting league rules apply.",2
7188,Kripke,12," Are you cwazy? This is a stweet fight, the stweet has no rules.",2
7189,Sheldon,12," He‰Ûªs right, Leonard. The paradigm is to the death.",2
7190,Kripke,12," I will, however, give you the opportunity to concede my supewiowity now and offer me your wobot as the spoils of war.",2
7191,Sheldon,12, Never. I‰Ûªd rather see Monte dead than in your hands.,2
7192,Kripke,12," That could be easily awanged. Weady, set, go?",2
7193,Sheldon,12, Do it.,2
7194,Kripke,12, Alwight then. Weady. Set. Go.,2
7195,Raj,12," Come on, Sheldon, you got this.",2
7196,Sheldon,12, Indeed. We are prepared for anything he can throw at us. (A flame begins to jet out of Kripke‰Ûªs robot.) That‰Ûªs new.,2
7197,Leonard,12," Run, Monte, run!",2
7198,Raj,12," Go, Monte! Go Monte!",2
7199,Leonard,12," Go, go, go, go!",2
7200,Sheldon,12," Don‰Ûªt hurt us, don‰Ûªt hurt us,",2
7201,Scene,12, The apartment. Monte is in pieces on the table.,2
7202,Leonard,12," Well, so much for making up for the emotional wounds of childhood.",2
7203,Sheldon,12," I did this. Monte was killed by my hubris and my pride. No matter what anybody says, this is my fault.",2
7204,Raj,12," No one‰Ûªs arguing with you, dude.",2
7205,Howard (arriving),12, I got your text. How bad is‰Û_ Oy.,2
7206,Leonard,12, Forget the robot. What happened to you?,2
7207,Penny,12, He slipped and fell.,2
7208,Howard,12," Yes, I slipped and fell. In the bathroom. Bounced right off the tub.",2
7209,Penny,12," Yes, now he knows what bathtubs are capable of doing when you don‰Ûªt treat them with respect.",2
7210,Howard,12, Yeah. They sucker punch you when your eyes are closed.,2
7211,Sheldon,12," So what do you think, Howard? It‰Ûªs not that bad, right?",2
7212,Howard,12," Oh, no. A little electrical tape, some solder. Are you insane? I‰Ûªve seen space probes that crashed into the desert that were in better shape than this.",2
7213,Sheldon,12," You‰Ûªre right. Monte‰Ûªs gone. We‰Ûªll bury him in the morning. A simple ceremony. I‰Ûªll speak. Leonard, you‰Ûªll play your cello.",2
7214,Penny,12," Sheldon, honey, aren‰Ûªt you getting a little carried away? I mean, it‰Ûªs just a toy robot.",2
7215,Sheldon,12, Just a toy robot?,2
7216,Leonard,12, Penny.,2
7217,Penny,12," I know, I got it. Sheldon, I‰Ûªm sorry.",2
7218,Howard,12," Well, don‰Ûªt get the wrong idea. The way I see it, I‰Ûªm halfway to pity sex.",2
7219,Scene,13, The university cafeteria,2
7220,Raj,13," Mmm, gentlemen, I put it to you, the worst tapioca pudding is better than the best pudding of any other flavour.",2
7221,Sheldon,13," First off, that is axiomatically wrong, because the best pudding is chocolate. Secondly, the organic structure of tapioca makes it a jiggling bowl of potential death. It is extracted from the plant‰Û_",2
7222,Howard,13," Hey, I‰Ûªm thinking of growing a mustache.",2
7223,Leonard,13," Ah, no kidding! A Fu Man Chu? A handlebar pencil?",2
7224,Sheldon,13, It is extracted from the plant‰Û_,2
7225,Howard,13," I‰Ûªm not sure yet. You know, George Clooney has one now!",2
7226,Raj,13, Really? I once saw him shopping at Ralph‰Ûªs. He was buying tequila.,2
7227,Howard,13," Oh, you‰Ûªd think a guy like that would have some kind of booze lackey.",2
7228,Leonard,13," Alright this is cruel, we better let him finish before his head explodes.",2
7229,Howard,13," Alright Sheldon, why is tapioca‰Û_",2
7230,Sheldon,13, Tapioca is extracted from the root of the plant Manihot Esculenta. Due to a high concentration of cyanide it is poisonous in its raw form and lethal if prepared improperly.,2
7231,Raj,13, Feel better now?,2
7232,Sheldon,13," It is also indigenous to Brazil, as is the Cocoa Bean, from which we get chocolate, the best pudding. And you promised you wouldn‰Ûªt do that anymore!",2
7233,Kripke (arriving),13, Hey Hofstadter!,2
7234,Leonard,13, Hey Kripke.,2
7235,Kripke,13," Heard about your watest pwoton decay expewiment, twenty thousand data wuns and no statistically significant wesults. Vewy impwessive!",2
7236,Howard,13, What a jerk.,2
7237,Raj,13," Don‰Ûªt feel bad Leonard, negative results are still results.",2
7238,Howard,13, Even twenty thousand of ‰Ûªem.,2
7239,Leonard,13," Alright, please don‰Ûªt cheer me up anymore.",2
7240,Howard,13," C‰Ûªmon, don‰Ûªt let him get to you. It‰Ûªs Kripke.",2
7241,Raj,13," Yeah, he‰Ûªs a ginormous knob.",2
7242,Howard,13," That‰Ûªs why he eats by himself, instead of sitting here at the cool table.",2
7243,Raj,13, Fo‰Ûª shizzle.,2
7244,Sheldon,13," Hey it‰Ûªs true, Kripke lacks the basic social skills that we take for granted, but he also controls the new open science grid computer that I need to use to run some simulations of structure formation in the early universe.",2
7245,Leonard,13, Good luck getting time on it. The only people he lets use it are his friends.,2
7246,Sheldon,13," Well then, the solution is simple. I shall befriend him. Kripke!",2
7247,Kripke,13, Yeah?,2
7248,Sheldon,13, What‰Ûªd you say of the idea of you and I becoming friends?,2
7249,Kripke,13," I would say, I have no intewest in becoming your fwiend.",2
7250,Sheldon,13," Really? That seems rather short sighted, coming from someone who is generally considered altogether unlikable. Why don‰Ûªt you take some time to reconsider?",2
7251,Kripke,13," Yeah, I‰Ûªll do that.",2
7252,Sheldon,13, Well I think we‰Ûªre off to a terrific start.,2
7253,Scene,13, The apartment.,2
7254,Leonard,13, There you go. Now any e-mail from Wolowitz will go right into your spam folder.,2
7255,Penny,13, Thanks! I mean the e-mail doesn‰Ûªt bother me as much as the vacation pictures of him in a bathing suit.,2
7256,Leonard,13," Yeah, I got the same one. And that‰Ûªs not a bathing suit, it‰Ûªs a tan line.",2
7257,Sheldon (on phone),13," Hello. This is Sheldon Cooper. I‰Ûªm leaving a message for Barry Kripke. Barry, It was pleasant seeing you today in the cafeteria. I saw that you purchased the chef‰Ûªs salad. Apparently, you did not know that the chef‰Ûªs salad is kitchen trickery, to utilize scrap meat. Nevertheless, I hope you enjoyed it. I‰Ûªm following up on our pending friendship, and I look forward to hearing from you regarding its status. Sheldon Cooper.",2
7258,Penny,13, What‰Ûªs up with Ichabod?,2
7259,Leonard,13, Oh he‰Ûªs trying to make a new friend.,2
7260,Penny,13," Oh really? Well, good for him.",2
7261,Leonard,13," Well, unless he‰Ûªs makes one out of wood like Gepetto, I don‰Ûªt think it‰Ûªs gonna happen.",2
7262,Penny,13," Well, how did you guys become friends?",2
7263,Leonard,13, There was a flier on the bulletin board at the university. Roommate wanted. Whistlers need not apply.,2
7264,Penny,13, And you moved in anyway?,2
7265,Leonard,13, I assumed he was joking. You‰Ûªd be surprised how many particle physicists have a whimsical side.,2
7266,Penny,13," Well, what about Howard and Raj, I mean how did you become friends with them?",2
7267,Leonard,13," I don‰Ûªt know, how do carbon atoms form a benzene ring? Proximity and valence electrons.",2
7268,Penny,13," Well yeah, sure. When you put it that way. But it all worked out, right?",2
7269,Leonard,13, I suppose. I do miss whistling though.,2
7270,Penny,13," Oh come on, really? (Leonard whistles)",2
7271,Sheldon,13, First warning.,2
7272,Scene,13, Outside Penny‰Ûªs door.,2
7273,"Sheldon (Knock, knock, knock) ",13," Penny (knock, knock, knock)  Penny (knock, knock, knock)  Penny.This is for you.",2
7274,Penny,13, Hello Sheldon.,2
7275,Sheldon,13, Hi.,2
7276,Penny,13, What is this?,2
7277,Sheldon,13," It‰Ûªs a questionnaire I devised. I‰Ûªm having some difficulty bonding with a colleague at work, so I‰Ûªm doing a little research to better understand why my current friends like me.",2
7278,Penny,13," Yes. Well, that is a good question. But is this really the best way to figure it out?",2
7279,Sheldon,13," Yeah, I agree, the social sciences are largely hokum. But, short of putting electrodes in your brain and monitoring your response to my companionship, this is the best I can do.",2
7280,Penny,13," Okay, question 1. Rank the following aspects of Sheldon Cooper in order of appeal. Intelligence. Ruthless attention to hygiene. Playfulness. Java applet writing?",2
7281,Sheldon,13," I know, I may have started off with a fairly obvious one. You did an aspect of my most appealing trait, playfulness. Why don‰Ûªt you just go ahead and write that number 1. I‰Ûªm afraid you‰Ûªre on your own for the rest. It should take you no more than 3 hours.",2
7282,Penny,13, Wait! How many questions are on this thing?,2
7283,Sheldon,13," Only 211. Don‰Ûªt worry, in deference to you, I‰Ûªve kept them on a high school graduate reading level.",2
7284,Penny,13, Thanks pal.,2
7285,Sheldon,13," You got it, buddy.",2
7286,Penny,13," Sheldon honey, did you ever consider making friends by being, I don‰Ûªt know, pleasant?",2
7287,Sheldon,13, Well that‰Ûªs certainly a thought-provoking hypothesis. May I suggest it as the topic for your essay.,2
7288,Scene,13, The apartment. Sheldon is reading one of the questionnaires. He tuts.,2
7289,Sheldon,13," Your questionnaire, very disappointing.",2
7290,Leonard,13, I answered every question Sheldon.,2
7291,Sheldon,13, You answered the multiple choice questions in a pattern. A B B A C. A B B A C.,2
7292,Leonard,13," Aw, you picked up on that huh?",2
7293,Sheldon,13, How could I not?,2
7294,Leonard,13," Come on! There‰Ûªs over 200 questions. And look at some of these things. Sheldon is to camaraderie, as the space shuttle is to blank?",2
7295,Leonard,13, Hold on. I put some real work into that!,2
7296,Sheldon,13," Yes, well it‰Ûªs better than what Wolowitz did. He drew a raccoon with what appears to be, a distended scrotum.",2
7297,Leonard,13," It‰Ûªs kinda cute, until you get to the scrotum.",2
7298,Sheldon,13, What hope do I have for establishing new relationships given that my current friends apparently cannot take a few hours out of their lives to help me?,2
7299,Leonard,13," Sheldon, I‰Ûªm not going to defend a big-balled raccoon.",2
7300,Sheldon,13, I don‰Ûªt see how you could.,2
7301,Leonard,13," What I‰Ûªm trying to say is that, maybe you can‰Ûªt approach this as a purely intellectual exercise.",2
7302,Sheldon,13, What do you mean!?,2
7303,Leonard,13," Well, remember when you tried to learn how to swim using the internet?",2
7304,Sheldon,13, I did learn how to swim.,2
7305,Leonard,13, On the floor.,2
7306,Sheldon,13, The skills are transferrable. I just have no interest in going in the water.,2
7307,Leonard,13, Then why learn how to swim?,2
7308,Sheldon,13," The ice caps are melting Leonard. In the future, swimming isn‰Ûªt going to be optional. But you do bring up an interesting point. I don‰Ûªt have to break new ground here, I‰Ûªm sure much of the research already exists.",2
7309,Leonard,13," No! no, my point is, if you want to learn how to make friends, then just go out to a coffee shop or a museum. Meet people. Talk to them. Take an interest in their lives.",2
7310,Sheldon,13, That‰Ûªs insane on the face of it. Come on.,2
7311,Leonard,13, Where are we going?,2
7312,Sheldon,13, You‰Ûªre driving me to the mall. I‰Ûªm going to acquire a book that summarizes the current theories in the field of friendmaking.,2
7313,Leonard,13, Why don‰Ûªt you just lie down on the floor and swim there?,2
7314,Scene,13, A bookshop.,2
7315,Sheldon,13, Coping with the death of a loved one. My condolences.,2
7316,Woman in queue,13, Thank you.,2
7317,Sheldon,13, Family or friend?,2
7318,Woman,13, Family.,2
7319,Sheldon,13," Too bad. If it‰Ûªd been a friend, I‰Ûªm available to fill the void. (Woman moves away) It‰Ûªs just as well, she smelled like moth balls.",2
7320,Leonard,13," Okay, if you‰Ûªre gonna start sniffing people, I‰Ûªm gonna go get a hot pretzel.",2
7321,Sheldon,13, Excuse me. Do you have any books about making friends?,2
7322,Bookstore employee,13," Um, yeah but they‰Ûªre all for little kids.",2
7323,Sheldon,13, I assume the skills can be extrapolated and transferred.,2
7324,Employee,13," Uh, I guess. They‰Ûªre right over there by the wooden train set.",2
7325,Sheldon,13, Oh! I love trains!,2
7326,Employee,13, I bet you do.,2
7327,Sheldon (picks up train),13," Oh my! That‰Ûªs awfully sticky. Alright, let‰Ûªs see. Bernie Bunny has Two Daddies Now. It‰Ûªs probably about homosexual rabbits. Jerry the Gerbil and the Bullies on the Bus. Read it, not helpful. Oh! Here we go. Stu the Cockatoo is New at the Zoo. Author Sarah Carpenter lives in Fort Wayne, Indiana, with her husband and best friend Mark, and their cockatoos too. Hardly makes her an expert in making friends, wouldn‰Ûªt you agree?",2
7328,Little girl,13," I don‰Ûªt like birds, they scare me.",2
7329,Sheldon,13, Me too! Most people don‰Ûªt see it. What are you reading?,2
7330,Girl,13, Curious George.,2
7331,Sheldon,13, Oh I do like monkeys!,2
7332,Girl,13, Curious George is a monkey.,2
7333,Sheldon,13," Somewhat anthropomorphized but yes. Say, maybe sometime you and I can go see monkeys together. Would you like that?",2
7334,Girl,13, Okay.,2
7335,Leonard,13," Sheldon, what are you doing?",2
7336,Sheldon,13, I‰Ûªm making friends with this little girl. What‰Ûªs your name?,2
7337,Girl,13, Rebecca.,2
7338,Sheldon,13," Hi Rebecca, I‰Ûªm your new friend, Sheldon.",2
7339,Leonard,13," No you‰Ûªre not, let‰Ûªs go.",2
7340,Sheldon,13, We were really hitting it off.,2
7341,Leonard,13," Don‰Ûªt look up, there‰Ûªs cameras.",2
7342,Scene,13, The stairwell.,2
7343,Raj,13," I‰Ûªm curious. In the ‰ÛÏHow Well Do You Know Sheldon‰Û section, what do you put for his favourite amino acid?",2
7344,Leonard and Howard,13, Lysine.,2
7345,Raj,13, Damn it. I had Lysine and changed it.,2
7346,Sheldon,13, Oh good! You‰Ûªre just in time. I believe I‰Ûªve isolated the algorithm for making friends.,2
7347,Leonard,13," Sheldon, there is no algorithm for making friends!",2
7348,Howard,13," Hear him out. If he‰Ûªs really on to something, we can open a booth at Comic-Con, make a fortune.",2
7349,Sheldon,13," See, my initial approach to Kripke, had the same deficiencies as those that plagued Stu the Cockatoo, when he was new at the zoo.",2
7350,Raj,13, Stu the cockatoo?,2
7351,Leonard,13," Yes, he‰Ûªs new at the zoo.",2
7352,Sheldon,13, It‰Ûªs a terrific book. I‰Ûªve distilled its essence into a simple flowchart that would guide me through the process.,2
7353,Howard,13, Have you thought about putting him in a crate while you‰Ûªre out of the apartment?,2
7354,Sheldon (on phone),13," Hello, Kripke. Yes, Sheldon Cooper here. It occurred to me you hadn‰Ûªt returned any of my calls because I hadn‰Ûªt offered any concrete suggestions for pursuing our friendship. Perhaps the two of us might share a meal together‰Û_ I see. Well then perhaps you‰Ûªd have time for a hot beverage. Popular choices include tea, coffee, cocoa‰Û_ I see. No, no, no, wait. Don‰Ûªt hang up yet. What about a recreational activity? I bet we share some common interests. Tell me an interest of yours. Really? On actual horses? Tell me another interest of yours. Oh no, I‰Ûªm sorry, I have no desire to get in the water until I absolutely have to. Tell me another interest of yours.",2
7355,Leonard,13," Uh-oh, he‰Ûªs stuck in an infinite loop.",2
7356,Howard,13, I can fix it.,2
7357,Sheldon,13," Mmhmm. Mmhmm. It‰Ûªs interesting. But isn‰Ûªt ventriloquism, by definition, a solo activity? Yeah? Tell me another interest of yours. Hmmm. Is there any chance you like monkeys? What is wrong with you? Everybody likes monkeys. Hang on, Kripke. (Checking changes Howard has made to his flowchart) A loop counter? And an escape to the least objectionable activity! Howard, that‰Ûªs brilliant! I‰Ûªm surprised you saw that.",2
7358,Howard,13, Gee. Why can‰Ûªt Sheldon make friends?,2
7359,Sheldon,13," Alright Kripke, that last interest strikes me as the least objectionable and I would like to propose that we do that together. Tomorrow. Yes, I‰Ûªll pay. Alright, goodbye. Alright! Time to learn rock climbing.",2
7360,Scene,13, Rock climbing centre. Sheldon and Kripke are watching someone descend the practice wall.,2
7361,Sheldon,13," You know, I am a fan of ventriloquism. Maybe you, me and your dummy could go get a hot beverage. He could talk while you drink.",2
7362,Kripke,13," Nope, I wanna climb some wocks.",2
7363,Sheldon,13," This appears significantly more monolithic than it did on my laptop. No, one expects to see Hominids learning to use bones as weapeons.",2
7364,Kripke,13," You afwaid of heights, Cooper?",2
7365,Sheldon,13," Hardly. Fear of heights is illogical. Fear of falling, on the other hand, is prudent and evolutionary. What would you say is the minimum altitude I need to achieve to cement our new-found friendship?",2
7366,Kripke,13," Come on, they have birthday parties here. Wittle kids climb this.",2
7367,Sheldon,13," Little kid Hominids, perhaps. (To man who attaches him to ropes) Is this your entire job? Your parents must be so proud.",2
7368,Kripke,13," Let‰Ûªs go, Cooper.",2
7369,Sheldon,13," Coming, Kripke. Okay. Harness seems to be secure. Small amount of incontinence just now, but the website said that‰Ûªs to be expected. Hey, this isn‰Ûªt so bad. A bit like vertical swimming.",2
7370,Kripke,13," Hey, look at you, Cooper. You‰Ûªre almost halfway to the top.",2
7371,Sheldon,13, I am? I was wrong. It IS a fear of heights.,2
7372,Kripke,13,"You alwight there, Cooper?",2
7373,Sheldon,13, Not really. I feel somewhat like an inverse tangent function that‰Ûªs approaching an asymptote.,2
7374,Kripke,13, Are you saying you‰Ûªre stuck?,2
7375,Sheldon,13, What part of an inverse tangent function approaching an asymptote did you not understand?,2
7376,Kripke,13, Understood all that. I‰Ûªm not a mowon. Just keep going.,2
7377,Sheldon,13," Yeah, I don‰Ûªt think I can.",2
7378,Kripke,13," Well, then. Cwimb back down.",2
7379,Sheldon,13," No, that doesn‰Ûªt seem any more likely.",2
7380,Kripke,13," So what‰Ûªs the pwan, Cooper?",2
7381,Sheldon,13," Well, it‰Ûªs not exactly a plan but I think I‰Ûªm going to pass out.",2
7382,Scene,13, The apartment.,2
7383,Leonard,13, I‰Ûªm sorry. Can we please just do it one more time?,2
7384,Howard,13," Okay. 1, 2, 1, 2, 3 and‰Û_ (Leonard, Howard and Raj whistle ‰ÛÏSweet Georgia Brown‰Û together)",2
7385,Leonard,13, It‰Ûªs a little thing but you really do miss it.,2
7386,Sheldon,13," Hello, everyone. I brought my new friend, Barry Kripke, home for dinner.",2
7387,Together,13, Oh‰Û_,2
7388,Kripke,13," Hewo to you, too.",2
7389,Leonard,13, How was rock climbing?,2
7390,Kripke,13, He passed out. Just hung there like a big sawami.,2
7391,Sheldon,13, D-d-d! That‰Ûªs where I sit.,2
7392,Kripke,13," Ooh, you have a special spot. What kind of wacko are you?",2
7393,Howard,13, How much time you got?,2
7394,Leonard,13, Want some Chinese food?,2
7395,Kripke,13, Tewific. Got any dental fwoss?,2
7396,Leonard,13, In the bathroom.,2
7397,Kripke,13, Be right back. I gotta fwoss the Indian food out of my teeth if I‰Ûªm gonna eat Chinese.,2
7398,Penny,13," Sheldon, are you okay?",2
7399,Sheldon,13," Oh yes, I pass out all the time. But, it was worth it. I‰Ûªve made substantial progress in bonding with Kripke, which brings me to an awkward moment.",2
7400,Leonard,13, What‰Ûªs that?,2
7401,Sheldon,13," Maintaining five friendships promises to be a Herculean task. So, I‰Ûªm going to have to let one of you go.",2
7402,Howard,13," Me, me. Let it be me.",2
7403,Sheldon,13," Leonard, you are my roommate, my source of transportation and you help me fold my sheets when they come out of the dryer. You are safe.",2
7404,Leonard,13, Can I whistle?,2
7405,Sheldon,13," Don‰Ûªt be silly. Howard, you do not have a PhD, your cologne is an assault on the senses and you‰Ûªre not available for video games during the Jewish high holidays.",2
7406,Howard,13, Guilty as charged. I‰Ûªm out.,2
7407,Sheldon,13," No. You, too, are safe.",2
7408,Howard,13, Oh come on. What do I have to do?,2
7409,Penny,13, Okay. You know what? I see where this is going. I‰Ûªm not one of you guys. I‰Ûªm not a scientist. So just‰Û_,2
7410,Sheldon,13," Penny, Penny, Penny. Everything you‰Ûªre saying is true, but please allow me to continue. Raj, you‰Ûªre out. The good question, while you do provide a certain cultural diversity to an otherwise homogenous group, your responses to the questionnaire were truly disturbing. How could you, for a moment, think that my favourite amino acid is Glutamine?",2
7411,Leonard,13, He had Lysine but changed it.,2
7412,Sheldon,13," Yeah. Shoulda, woulda coulda, Raj.",2
7413,Kripke,13," I like to fwoss before I eat, so my gum pockets are open for new food.",2
7414,Penny,13, Eww.,2
7415,Kripke,13, Hewo. How did I walk past you? I‰Ûªm Bawy.,2
7416,Penny,13, Penny.,2
7417,Kripke,13," Yeah, it‰Ûªs not a vewy hot name. I‰Ûªm gonna call your Woxanne. Ooh, pot stickers.",2
7418,Howard,13," Suddenly I‰Ûªm looking pretty good, huh?",2
7419,Sheldon,13," So uh, Kripke, I was wondering if there‰Ûªs any chance you could get me some time on the open science grid computer.",2
7420,Kripke,13, No.,2
7421,Sheldon,13, No? But we‰Ûªre friends!,2
7422,Kripke,13," I‰Ûªm sowy. No, my fwiend?",2
7423,Sheldon,13, I‰Ûªm confused. I was given an understanding that you allow your friends time on the machine?,2
7424,Kripke,13," No, that‰Ûªs wong. There‰Ûªs an official schedule. I have no contwol over it.",2
7425,Sheldon,13," Oh. This entire endeavour seems to have been an exercise in futility. Raj, you‰Ûªre back in. He likes monkeys.",2
7426,Scene,13, The climbing centre.,2
7427,Howard,13, You gotta give him credit for sticking with it.,2
7428,Leonard,13, I didn‰Ûªt think he had it in him.,2
7429,Raj,13, He almost made it to the top this time.,2
7430,Scene,14, The apartment. The guys are studying a complex chart on the whiteboard.,2
7431,Leonard,14, Hmmm.,2
7432,Sheldon,14, The problem appears to be unsolvable.,2
7433,Raj,14, Maybe you could run some computer simulations.,2
7434,Howard,14, There are too many variables. It would take forever.,2
7435,Sheldon,14," Right, these theatres have to be eliminated.",2
7436,Leonard,14," Why? They‰Ûªre state-of-the-art digital projection, 20-channel surround sound.",2
7437,Sheldon,14," Yes, but they have no Icee machines. Despite my aggressive letter-writing campaign, I might add.",2
7438,Raj,14, What about the multiplex here? The seats are terrific.,2
7439,Sheldon,14, They have Twizzlers instead of Red Vines. No amount of lumbar support can compensate for that.,2
7440,Leonard,14," Well, it‰Ûªs gonna take at least an hour to eat, and I don‰Ûªt see a Sheldon-approved restaurant proximate to a Sheldon-approved theatre.",2
7441,Raj,14, We could eat after the movie.,2
7442,Sheldon,14," Unacceptable, the delay would result in tomorrow morning‰Ûªs bowel movement occurring at work.",2
7443,Raj,14," Hang on, hang on. There‰Ûªs a 7-Eleven here. We smuggle Slurpies, which are essentially Icees, in under our coats, after having a pleasant meal either here, here or here.",2
7444,Howard,14, Wow. I don‰Ûªt see how we missed that.,2
7445,Sheldon,14," Excuse me, in what universe are Slurpies Icees?",2
7446,Raj,14, That‰Ûªs how we missed it.,2
7447,Leonard,14," Sheldon, would you be prepared, on a non-precedential basis, to create an emergency ad-hoc Slurpie-Icee equivalency?",2
7448,Sheldon,14," Oh, Leonard, you know I can‰Ûªt do that.",2
7449,Howard,14," Okay, I guess we only have one option.",2
7450,Raj,14," Yep, I don‰Ûªt see any way around it.",2
7451,Leonard,14," Bye, Sheldon.",2
7452,Howard,14, See ya.,2
7453,Raj,14," Later, dude.",2
7454,Sheldon,14," They‰Ûªre right, it was the only option.",2
7455,Scene,14, The hallway. Sheldon is opening the apartment door. Penny comes running up stairs.,2
7456,Penny,14," Ooh, ooh, shut the door, shut the door.",2
7457,Sheldon,14, Why?,2
7458,Penny,14, Just do it! (Penny runs in. Sheldon shuts door. Penny opens door again) Get inside and shut the door.,2
7459,Sheldon,14," Well, you didn‰Ûªt specify.",2
7460,Penny,14, Is Leonard around?,2
7461,Sheldon,14," He went to the movies without me. It was the only option. I‰Ûªm sorry, I don‰Ûªt understand which social situation this is. Could you give me some guidance as to how to proceed?",2
7462,Penny,14," The building manager‰Ûªs showing an apartment downstairs, and I haven‰Ûªt paid my rent.",2
7463,Sheldon,14," Oh, I see. Penny, I‰Ûªm not sure I‰Ûªm comfortable harbouring a fugitive from the 2311 North Los Robles Corporation.",2
7464,Penny,14, It‰Ûªs no big deal. I‰Ûªm just a little behind on my bills because they cut back my hours at the restaurant and my car broke down.,2
7465,Sheldon,14," If you recall, I pointed out the ‰ÛÏcheck engine‰Û light to you several months ago.",2
7466,Penny,14, Well the ‰ÛÏcheck engine‰Û light is fine. It‰Ûªs still blinking away. It‰Ûªs the stupid engine that stopped working. It cost me like twelve hundred dollars to fix it.,2
7467,Sheldon,14," You know, it occurs to me you could solve all your problems by obtaining more money.",2
7468,Penny,14," Yes, it occurs to me, too.",2
7469,Sheldon,14, Hang on a moment. (He opens a jar. Snakes jump out. He then pulls out a large wedge of money) Here. Take some. Pay me back when you can.,2
7470,Penny,14," Wow, you got a lot of money in there.",2
7471,Sheldon,14, That‰Ûªs why it‰Ûªs guarded by snakes. Take some.,2
7472,Penny,14, Don‰Ûªt be silly.,2
7473,Sheldon,14, I‰Ûªm never silly. Here.,2
7474,Penny,14," No, I can‰Ûªt.",2
7475,Sheldon,14, Don‰Ûªt you need money?,2
7476,Penny,14," Well, yeah, but‰Û_",2
7477,Sheldon,14, This is money I‰Ûªm not using.,2
7478,Penny,14, But what if you need it?,2
7479,Sheldon,14," My expenses account for 46.9% of my after-tax income. The rest is divvied up between a small savings account, this deceptive container of peanut brittle and the hollowed-out buttocks of a superhero action figure who shall remain nameless for his own protection. Or her own protection. Take some.",2
7480,Penny,14," Really? I mean, are you sure?",2
7481,Sheldon,14, I see no large upcoming expenditures unless they develop an affordable technology to fuse my skeleton with adamantium like Wolverine.,2
7482,Penny,14, Are they working on that?,2
7483,Sheldon,14, I sincerely hope so.,2
7484,Penny,14," Okay. Well, thank you. Oh, God, no, I can‰Ûªt. Sheldon honey, I don‰Ûªt want things to be weird between us.",2
7485,Sheldon,14, Won‰Ûªt it also be weird if I have to say hello to you every morning on my way to work and you‰Ûªre living in a refrigerator box and washing your hair with rain water?,2
7486,Penny,14, I‰Ûªll pay you back as soon as I can.,2
7487,Sheldon,14, Of course you will. It‰Ûªs impossible to pay me back sooner than you can. Assuming you subscribe to a linear understanding of time and causality.,2
7488,Penny,14, I‰Ûªm regretting this already.,2
7489,Scene,14, Entering the lobby of the building.,2
7490,Sheldon,14," You know, I‰Ûªve given the matter some thought, and I think I‰Ûªd be willing to be a house pet to a race of super-intelligent aliens.",2
7491,Leonard,14, Interesting.,2
7492,Sheldon,14, Ask me why.,2
7493,Leonard,14, Do I have to?,2
7494,Sheldon,14, Of course. That‰Ûªs how you move a conversation forward.,2
7495,Leonard,14, Why?,2
7496,Sheldon,14," The learning opportunities would be abundant. Additionally, I like having my belly scratched.",2
7497,Leonard,14," Hey, Penny. How was work?",2
7498,Penny,14, Great. I hope I‰Ûªm a waitress at the Cheesecake Factory for my whole life.,2
7499,Sheldon,14, Was that sarcasm?,2
7500,Penny,14, No.,2
7501,Sheldon,14, Was that sarcasm?,2
7502,Penny,14, Yes.,2
7503,Sheldon,14, Was that sarca..,2
7504,Leonard,14, Stop it!,2
7505,Sheldon,14," Penny, you appear to have a package here.",2
7506,Penny,14," Oh, thanks. This must be the beret I ordered. A couple of months ago. It was back-ordered.",2
7507,Sheldon,14, Did you know the beret is an example of piece of women‰Ûªs fashion adapted from male military uniforms? Another fascinating example is the epaulet.,2
7508,Leonard,14," He‰Ûªs not lying, he does find that fascinating.",2
7509,Penny,14," Okay, whatever. It‰Ûªs not like I‰Ûªm running up and down the streets just buying myself berets. I bought one, like, a month ago, and it was back-ordered, look, it finally arrived, all right?",2
7510,Sheldon,14, All right.,2
7511,Penny,14," Oh, my God, would you just get off my case?",2
7512,Leonard,14, Weird.,2
7513,Sheldon,14," Oh, good, that was an unusual interaction. I wasn‰Ûªt sure.",2
7514,Leonard,14, Did you guys have an argument?,2
7515,Sheldon,14, No.,2
7516,Leonard,14," Well, you clearly did something to aggravate her.",2
7517,Sheldon,14," I‰Ûªm at a loss. If you like, you can review my daily log of social interactions and see if there‰Ûªs a blunder I overlooked.",2
7518,Scene,14, The apartment. ,2
7519,Leonard,14," Here you go. Oh, you owe me another two dollars. The price of mu-shu pork went up.",2
7520,Howard,14, It‰Ûªs getting tougher and tougher to be a bad Jew.,2
7521,Leonard,14," Here you go, Penny. Shrimp with lobster sauce.",2
7522,Penny,14," Thank you, Leonard. What‰Ûªs my share?",2
7523,Leonard,14, Don‰Ûªt worry about it. It‰Ûªs my treat.,2
7524,Penny,14," No, really, how much?",2
7525,Leonard,14," It‰Ûªs, whatever. Ten, eleven dollars.",2
7526,Penny,14," Well, which is it, ten or eleven?",2
7527,Leonard,14," Fourteen fifty, but it‰Ûªs no biggie, you‰Ûªll get the next one. (Raj whispers something to Howard)",2
7528,Penny,14, What?,2
7529,Howard,14, He was just wondering if he wore skintight jeans and a tank top if he‰Ûªd get his shrimp lo mein for free.,2
7530,Penny,14, What are you saying? That I‰Ûªm using my body to get dinner? That I‰Ûªm some kind of Chinese food prostitute?,2
7531,Howard,14," Yeah, Raj, what are you saying?",2
7532,Penny,14," ‰Û÷Cause let me tell you something, buddy, I pay my own way in this world, okay? I don‰Ûªt rely on anybody! (Raj runs out of the room) What was that about?",2
7533,Howard,14, He has a nervous bladder when he‰Ûªs stressed out. Kind of like a puppy.,2
7534,Penny,14," Here, Leonard, ten, eleven, twelve, uh, fourteen dollars.",2
7535,Leonard,14," It was fourteen fifty, but it‰Ûªs okay.",2
7536,Sheldon,14," Oh, good. Dinner‰Ûªs here.",2
7537,Penny,14," Yes, dinner‰Ûªs here, and I‰Ûªm having some. I‰Ûªm having takeout food.",2
7538,Sheldon,14, Okay.,2
7539,Penny,14," You‰Ûªre damn right it‰Ûªs okay. I‰Ûªve been having leftovers at the restaurant for like four days, and I wanted something different. So sue me.",2
7540,Sheldon,14," Forgive me, Penny, but that would be the very definition of a frivolous lawsuit.",2
7541,Penny,14," Sheldon, look, I will pay you back as soon as I can. You just have to give me more time.",2
7542,Leonard,14," Oh, wait, you lent her money?",2
7543,Penny,14, She needed money. You seem under pressure. Did I not lend you a sufficient amount? Because I can give you more.,2
7544,Penny,14," Oh, you know, you would just love that, wouldn‰Ûªt you? Yeah. You would just love to open up your little snake can and throw some money at the girl who can‰Ûªt pay her bills.",2
7545,Leonard,14, Where are you going?,2
7546,Penny,14," Going home, where I won‰Ûªt be interrogated like a criminal. I forgot my fortune cookie.",2
7547,Sheldon,14," In case either of you have larceny in your heart, you should know that I‰Ûªve moved my money out of the snake can.",2
7548,Leonard,14," But if you‰Ûªre ever short, there‰Ûªs always a couple of fifties in Green Lantern‰Ûªs ass.",2
7549,Scene,14, Penny‰Ûªs apartment. ,2
7550,Leonard,14, Hey.,2
7551,Penny,14, Hey.,2
7552,Leonard,14," A little mood lighting, huh?",2
7553,Penny,14," Yeah. When I didn‰Ûªt pay my bill, the Department of Water and Power thought I would enjoy the ambience.",2
7554,Leonard,14," Yeah, they‰Ûªre very considerate that way.",2
7555,Penny,14," I used Sheldon‰Ûªs money to pay my rent, then I had like fourteen dollars left over.",2
7556,Leonard,14," Fourteen dollars, huh?",2
7557,Penny,14," Put it back in your pocket, or I‰Ûªll find some other place to put it.",2
7558,Leonard,14," Back in the pocket it goes. Look, you do understand that Sheldon really doesn‰Ûªt care when he gets the money back. It‰Ûªs actually one of the few idiosyncrasies that doesn‰Ûªt make you want to, you know, kill him.",2
7559,Penny,14," Yeah, well, that‰Ûªs not really my big problem.",2
7560,Leonard,14, So you‰Ûªre a little behind on your bills. Everybody gets behind on their bills.,2
7561,Penny,14," Yeah, I know, it‰Ûªs just, this wasn‰Ûªt the plan, it wasn‰Ûªt supposed to go this way.",2
7562,Leonard,14," Well, what was the plan?",2
7563,Penny,14," Um, waitress for six months and then become a movie star.",2
7564,Leonard,14, Was there a plan B?,2
7565,Penny,14, TV star.,2
7566,Leonard,14," It‰Ûªs probably not as bad as you think. Let‰Ûªs take a look. Maybe we can find some corners to cut. Oh, here‰Ûªs something, if you don‰Ûªt have electricity, then you probably don‰Ûªt need cable. Just a suggestion. 170 dollars for acting classes?",2
7567,Penny,14," Oh, no, I can‰Ûªt give up my acting classes. I‰Ûªm a professional actress.",2
7568,Leonard,14, You‰Ûªve had an acting job where you got paid?,2
7569,Penny,14, That is not the definition of professional.,2
7570,Leonard,14," Actually, it kind of‰Û_ let‰Ûªs keep looking. Whoa, what‰Ûªs eighteen hundred dollars to the Los Angeles County Superior Court?",2
7571,Penny,14," Oh, that‰Ûªs nothing.",2
7572,Leonard,14," Nothing? It sounds like you got caught speeding going 4,000 miles an hour.",2
7573,Penny,14," Well, remember Kurt?",2
7574,Leonard,14, Your ex-boyfriend?,2
7575,Penny,14, Yeah. He got arrested for taking a whiz on a cop car.,2
7576,Leonard,14, What?,2
7577,Penny,14, He was drunk.,2
7578,Leonard,14, I would hope so.,2
7579,Penny,14," Anyway, he had a bunch of outstanding tickets and a bench warrant, so I, you know, I paid his fines.",2
7580,Leonard,14, Did he pay you back?,2
7581,Penny,14," No, but he will.",2
7582,Leonard,14, And that‰Ûªs based on the inherent credit-worthiness of people who get drunk and urinate on police vehicles?,2
7583,Penny,14," Leonard, I‰Ûªm not gonna call up Kurt and ask him for money.",2
7584,Leonard,14, Well what are you gonna do?,2
7585,Penny,14," I don‰Ûªt know, but I may have to find a cheaper place to live.",2
7586,Leonard,14," Oh, no. Oh, you don‰Ûªt want to do that.",2
7587,Penny,14, Why not?,2
7588,Leonard,14," Well, moving is a big deal. You have to go to the supermarket and get boxes, and if they‰Ûªre not clean, then your books smell like melons, and it‰Ûªs just, like‰Û_ Why don‰Ûªt you just get a roommate and stay here?",2
7589,Penny,14," Well, do you know anybody?",2
7590,Leonard,14," Well, I‰Ûªm sure the guy living with Sheldon wouldn‰Ûªt mind moving in with you.",2
7591,Penny,14," Oh, Leonard, honey, if we started living together, I wouldn‰Ûªt be able to keep my hands off you.",2
7592,Leonard,14, Really?,2
7593,Penny,14, And you thought my acting lessons were a waste of money.,2
7594,Scene,14, The apartment.,2
7595,Howard,14, Ugh. This mu-shu pork‰Ûªs burning a hole through my duodenum.,2
7596,Howard,14," Hey, do I mock you with the Bhagavad-Gita every time you scarf down a Whopper?",2
7597,Leonard,14," Hey, what‰Ûªs going on?",2
7598,Raj,14, We‰Ûªre on a quest through the Valley of Fire to acquire the sacred crown.,2
7599,Howard,14, You want the Valley of Fire? It‰Ûªs right here.,2
7600,Leonard,14," Hey, you guys want to go on a real live quest?",2
7601,Sheldon,14, Outside? I just made cocoa.,2
7602,Leonard,14, ‰ÛÒ Come on. It‰Ûªll be fun.,2
7603,Howard,14, What is it?,2
7604,Leonard,14," Do you guys remember Penny‰Ûªs ex-boyfriend Kurt? (They all hold their hands above their heads) Yeah, that‰Ûªs him. It turns out he owes Penny a lot of money, and I‰Ûªm gonna go get it from him.",2
7605,Howard,14," Ooh, double sixes.",2
7606,Leonard,14, Really? You‰Ûªre just gonna let me go by myself?,2
7607,Raj,14," Oh, cool, I got a sword.",2
7608,Leonard,14, I could use some help.,2
7609,Raj,14, Here.,2
7610,Leonard,14," You guys are unbelievable, you play a game to simulate adventure, but when there‰Ûªs real adventure out there in the real world, you just wimp out.",2
7611,Sheldon,14," Leonard, do you not recall the last time we visited this gentleman, we returned home without pants?",2
7612,Leonard,14, I do.,2
7613,Sheldon,14, Are you sure? Because your proposal suggests that you don‰Ûªt.,2
7614,Leonard,14, I‰Ûªm not afraid of him.,2
7615,Sheldon,14," All right. Leonard fairly calls the question, who is in favour of abandoning our game and confronting Penny‰Ûªs steroid-infused ex-boyfriend in a suicidal mission to extract money from him? Say hi to Kurt for us.",2
7616,Leonard,14," Excuse me. When Frodo left the Shire to take the one ring to Mordor, didn‰Ûªt Samwise, Pippin and Merry go with him?",2
7617,Sheldon,14, They did.,2
7618,Leonard,14, Well?,2
7619,Sheldon,14," They had a terrible time of it, Leonard.",2
7620,Raj,14," Plus, no one stole their pants.",2
7621,Leonard,14, Fine. Just enjoy your little game. I‰Ûªll make this quest on my own.,2
7622,Howard,14," Leonard, wait. Take a jacket, it‰Ûªs spritzing a little.",2
7623,Leonard,14," You guys suck. (Leaves. Comes back) Come on, please? He‰Ûªs so big.",2
7624,Scene,14, Outside Kurt‰Ûªs door.,2
7625,Leonard,14," Okay, is everyone clear on the plan?",2
7626,Howard,14," Yes. Koothrappali‰Ûªs going to wet himself, I‰Ûªm gonna throw up, Sheldon‰Ûªs gonna run away, and you‰Ûªre going to die. Shall we synchronize our watches?",2
7627,Leonard,14," Guys, there are four of us and one of him.",2
7628,Sheldon,14, Which means his triumph will be even larger. Minstrels will write songs about him.,2
7629,Leonard,14," Okay, how about this? I‰Ûªll do the talking, you just stand behind me and try to look formidable.",2
7630,Raj,14, I should‰Ûªve peed before we left.,2
7631,Kurt,14, Yeah?,2
7632,Leonard,14," Hi, Kurt.",2
7633,Kurt,14," Lenny, right?",2
7634,Leonard,14," I don‰Ûªt really go by Lenny, but that‰Ûªs okay. Um, you remember Sheldon, Howard and Raj.",2
7635,Kurt,14, No. What do you want?,2
7636,Sheldon,14, You don‰Ûªt remember me? How could he not remember me?,2
7637,Leonard,14," Sheldon, not now.",2
7638,Sheldon,14, I remember him.,2
7639,Leonard,14," Okay, here it is. Penny‰Ûªs in kind of a financial jam, and the money that you owe her would go a long way to solving her problems.",2
7640,Kurt,14, And she sent you to get it from me?,2
7641,Leonard,14," No, no, she‰Ûªs too proud to ask for the money. I, on the other hand, feel you should honour your debt.",2
7642,Kurt,14, You do?,2
7643,Leonard,14," Feel is a kind of a‰Û_ it‰Ûªs a strong word. Um, I just think it would be a nice gesture on your part.",2
7644,Kurt,14, She‰Ûªll get it when she gets it.,2
7645,Howard,14," Well, there you go. Problem solved.",2
7646,Raj,14, A successful quest. Now let‰Ûªs go find a gas station with a clean bathroom.,2
7647,Leonard,14," No, the problem isn‰Ûªt solved. He just blew us off.",2
7648,Sheldon,14, I‰Ûªve got it. He didn‰Ûªt remember me because the last time we met I was in a Halloween costume.,2
7649,Howard,14," Come on, Leonard, let‰Ûªs go",2
7650,Leonard,14, No. You can leave if you want to. I‰Ûªm gonna see this through.,2
7651,Howard,14, Okay. (They leave) ,2
7652,Leonard,14," I guess, technically, that was my fault. (Knocks) I‰Ûªm not leaving here without Penny‰Ûªs money.",2
7653,Kurt,14, What happened to your backup?,2
7654,Leonard,14, I don‰Ûªt need backup. I have right on my side. And I‰Ûªm wearing cargo shorts under my pants.,2
7655,Scene,14, Leonard‰Ûªs car.,2
7656,Sheldon,14," Congratulations. You may not have succeeded in getting cash, but you did secure a formal acknowledgment of the debt. (Leonard has ‰ÛÏI owe Penny $1800, Kurt‰Û written on his forehead.) ",2
7657,Howard,14, Maybe we should have your head notarized.,2
7658,Raj,14," If anybody cares, I still have to pee.",2
7659,Scene,14, Outside the apartment. Penny knocks. ,2
7660,Leonard,14, Hey.,2
7661,Penny,14," Hey, is Sheldon here?",2
7662,Leonard,14, Yeah. Hang on. Sheldon!,2
7663,Penny,14, Nice hat.,2
7664,Leonard,14, It‰Ûªs kind of a fashionable look these days.,2
7665,Penny,14, Maybe if you‰Ûªre working on a tuna boat.,2
7666,Sheldon,14," Hello, Penny.",2
7667,Penny,14," Sheldon, here is your money. Thank you very much. It helped a lot.",2
7668,Sheldon,14, Sarcasm?,2
7669,Penny,14, No.,2
7670,Sheldon,14, Darn. I can‰Ûªt seem to get the hang of that.,2
7671,Leonard,14," Hey, I know it‰Ûªs none of my business, but where did the money come from?",2
7672,Penny,14," Well, I cut back my expenses like you said and picked up a few more hours at the restaurant, but the biggest thing was, out of the blue, Kurt shows up and gives me the money he owes me.",2
7673,Leonard,14, Really? Did he say why?,2
7674,Penny,14," Yes, he said he was feeling guilty and wanted to do what was right.",2
7675,Leonard,14, That‰Ûªs it? Did he give any reason as to why he came to this moral epiphany?,2
7676,Penny,14," Nope. I just think he‰Ûªs really changed. We‰Ûªre having dinner tomorrow night, and I get to wear my new beret. Bye, guys.",2
7677,Leonard,14, Bye.,2
7678,Sheldon,14," Well done, Leonard. The true hero doesn‰Ûªt seek adulation, he fights for right and justice simply because it‰Ûªs his nature.",2
7679,Leonard,14, Penny‰Ûªs hooking up with her jerk of an ex-boyfriend and I have indelible ink on my forehead!,2
7680,Sheldon,14," That‰Ûªs your badge of honour, your warrior‰Ûªs wound, if you will. I was wrong, minstrels will write songs about you.",2
7681,Leonard,14, Great.,2
7682,Sheldon (sings),14," There once was a brave lad named Leonard, with a fi-fi-fiddle-dee-dee. He faced a fearsome giant, while Raj just wanted to pee.",2
7683,Scene,15," The apartment. The guys are playing Rock Band. Sheldon is on guitar, Howard drums and Raj singing. They are performing the Red Hot Chili Peppers ‰ÛÏUnder the Bridge‰Û. As Raj gets into the song, Penny enters and his singing turns into a squawk.",2
7684,Penny,15," Fellas, please.",2
7685,Howard,15," Penny, come on, we were just finding our sound.",2
7686,Penny,15, You found it. It‰Ûªs the sound of a cat being run over by a lawn mower.,2
7687,Leonard (entering on the phone),15," I‰Ûªm really very busy. Is there any way that we can put this off until I have more time to prepare? Of course. But, uh, you understand my trepidation.",2
7688,Penny,15, What‰Ûªs that about?,2
7689,Howard,15, Not a clue.,2
7690,Leonard,15, Can‰Ûªt we just postpone it till the spring? Maybe next summer?,2
7691,Sheldon,15," This should be fairly easy to deduce. He‰Ûªs holding the phone to his left ear. Ears do not cross hemispheres, so he‰Ûªs using the analytical rather than the emotional side of the brain, suggesting that he has no personal relationship with the caller.",2
7692,Leonard,15," No, I didn‰Ûªt realize it had been so long. Sure, I guess there‰Ûªs no other choice but to just go ahead and do it.",2
7693,Sheldon,15," He‰Ûªs referring to an activity he has done before. It‰Ûªs unpleasant and needs to be repeated. This suggests some sort of invasive medical test, like perhaps a colonoscopy.",2
7694,Leonard,15," Aren‰Ûªt there any other options? There‰Ûªs not a lot of room, it‰Ûªs gonna be uncomfortable.",2
7695,Sheldon,15," Yes, yes. Yeah, I‰Ûªm definitely going with colonoscopy.",2
7696,Leonard,15," Okay, bye. My mother‰Ûªs coming to visit.",2
7697,Howard,15," How about that, you were right.",2
7698,Scene,15, The lobby. Penny finds a woman studying the lift.,2
7699,Penny,15, It‰Ûªs out of order.,2
7700,Woman,15," Yes, I can read the sign, I‰Ûªm just pondering the implications.",2
7701,Penny,15, I think it implies that the elevator doesn‰Ûªt work.,2
7702,Woman,15," Again, I can read the sign. But the sign and the tape are covered with a layer of dust, which indicates that the elevator has been non-functional for a significant amount of time. Which suggests either a remarkable passivity among the, I assume, 24 to 36 residents of this building based on the number of mailboxes and given typical urban population density or a shared delusion of functionality.",2
7703,Penny,15, You must be Leonard‰Ûªs mother.,2
7704,Leonard‰Ûªs Mother,15," Oh, I don‰Ûªt know if I must be, but yes.",2
7705,Penny,15," Uh, I‰Ûªm Penny. I‰Ûªm his neighbour.",2
7706,Leonard‰Ûªs Mother,15," Oh, Dr. Beverley Hofstadter.",2
7707,Penny,15," Oh, nice to meet you.",2
7708,Beverley,15," Oh, you‰Ûªre a hand shaker. Interesting.",2
7709,Penny,15," Uh, why don‰Ûªt you come with me. I‰Ûªll walk you to the apartment.",2
7710,Beverley,15," Oh, all right. Would you like to exchange pleasantries on the way?",2
7711,Penny,15," Yeah, sure, I guess.",2
7712,Beverley,15," All right, you start.",2
7713,Penny,15," Okay. You know, I‰Ûªve always been curious. What was Leonard like when he was little?",2
7714,Beverley,15," Oh, I think you mean young. He‰Ûªs always been little.",2
7715,Penny,15," Right, okay. What was he like when he was young?",2
7716,Beverley,15, You‰Ûªll have to be more specific.,2
7717,Penny,15," Oh, um, okay, like, five or six. Five.",2
7718,Beverley,15," Oh, well, at that age he was well enmeshed in what Freud would call the phallic stage of psychosexual development. An outmoded theory, of course, but the boy did spend most of his waking hours with a tight grasp on his penis.",2
7719,Penny,15," Yeah, Leonard mentioned you were a psychiatrist.",2
7720,Beverley,15," Well, that is one of my degrees. My primary field is neuroscience.",2
7721,Penny,15," Oh, well, I‰Ûªm an actress.",2
7722,Beverley,15, Why?,2
7723,Penny,15, What do you mean why?,2
7724,Beverley,15," Well, there are studies that suggest that many who go into the performing arts suffer from an external locus of identity.",2
7725,Penny,15," Yeah, I don‰Ûªt know what that means.",2
7726,Beverley,15," Well, it means you value yourself only as others value you, which is often the result of unmet childhood emotional needs.",2
7727,Penny,15," Oh, well, I had a wonderful childhood.",2
7728,Beverley,15, Tell me about it.,2
7729,Penny,15," I know my dad wanted a boy. I just, I tried being good at sports, but I hated getting dirty!",2
7730,Beverley,15," And then, I‰Ûªm assuming, you entered adolescence.",2
7731,Penny,15," Uh-huh, he called me Slugger until I got my first training bra, and then he just stopped playing catch with me. I wasn‰Ûªt Slugger anymore. Your mother‰Ûªs here!",2
7732,Beverley,15," If you want to have intercourse with that girl, find out what kind of cologne her father wore.",2
7733,Leonard,15," Good to see you, Mother.",2
7734,Scene,15, The apartment.,2
7735,Leonard,15," Here‰Ûªs your tea, Mother.",2
7736,Beverley,15, Oolong?,2
7737,Leonard,15, Yes.,2
7738,Beverley,15," Loose, not bagged?",2
7739,Leonard,15, Yes.,2
7740,Beverley,15, Steeped three minutes?,2
7741,Leonard,15, Yes.,2
7742,Beverley,15, Two-percent milk?,2
7743,Leonard,15, Yes.,2
7744,Beverley,15, Warmed separately?,2
7745,Leonard,15, Yes.,2
7746,Beverley,15, One teaspoon sugar?,2
7747,Leonard,15, Yes.,2
7748,Beverley,15, Raw sugar?,2
7749,Leonard,15, Yes.,2
7750,Beverley,15, It‰Ûªs cold.,2
7751,Leonard,15, I‰Ûªll start again.,2
7752,Sheldon,15, I have the same problem with him. My theory is that his lack of focus stems from an over-developed sex drive.,2
7753,Beverley,15,"åÊ Oh, I don‰Ûªt know where he would‰Ûªve gotten that. Aside from a pro forma consummation of our marriage, his father and I only had intercourse for the purposes of reproduction.",2
7754,Sheldon,15, That seems a fairly efficient arrangement.,2
7755,Beverley,15," Yes, we think so. We‰Ûªve both done papers on it. Mine from the neuroscientific point of view and his from an anthropological. Mine, of course, was the only one worth reading.",2
7756,Sheldon,15, Of course. I would very much like to read about your sex life.,2
7757,Beverley,15," Well, it‰Ûªs all online or you can order it from the Princeton University Press.",2
7758,Leonard,15," Here‰Ûªs your tea, Mother. So, what are you guys talking about?",2
7759,Sheldon,15, The frequency with which your parents had intercourse.,2
7760,Leonard,15," Swell. If you‰Ûªre lucky, maybe she‰Ûªll show you the PowerPoint presentation.",2
7761,Beverley,15," I‰Ûªm sorry, it‰Ûªs on my other laptop.",2
7762,Sheldon,15, Aw‰Û_,2
7763,Leonard,15," So, Mother, what‰Ûªs new?",2
7764,Beverley,15, You‰Ûªll have to be more specific.,2
7765,Leonard,15," All right. Uh, what‰Ûªs new with you?",2
7766,Beverley,15," Oh, well, I‰Ûªve been having some fascinating menopausal symptoms recently.",2
7767,Leonard,15, Maybe something less personal.,2
7768,Beverley,15, Oh. Your Uncle Floyd died.,2
7769,Leonard,15," Oh, my God. What happened?",2
7770,Beverley,15, His heart stopped beating. I have to urinate.,2
7771,Sheldon,15, What a remarkable woman.,2
7772,Leonard,15," Yeah I, I thought you guys might hit it off.",2
7773,Sheldon,15, I envy you your childhood.,2
7774,Leonard,15," I hate to tell you, but the only warm memories I have of my childhood are of my Uncle Floyd.",2
7775,Sheldon,15," You‰Ûªre clearly misremembering. Your mother is brilliant, analytical, insightful, and I‰Ûªm betting she never hit you with a Bible because you wouldn‰Ûªt eat your Brussels sprouts.",2
7776,Leonard,15," Sheldon, you don‰Ûªt give your mother enough credit. She‰Ûªs warm, she‰Ûªs loving, she doesn‰Ûªt glue electrodes to your head to measure your brain waves while potty training.",2
7777,Sheldon,15," You were lucky. When I was a kid, if I wanted an EEG, I had to attach my own electrodes.",2
7778,Scene,15, The university cafeteria.,2
7779,Howard,15," So, Dr. Hofstadter, Leonard rarely talks about his incredibly successful brother and sister.",2
7780,Leonard,15," Please, don‰Ûªt go there, Howard.",2
7781,Howard,15," I understand that unlike Leonard, they‰Ûªre at the top of their respective fields.",2
7782,Leonard,15," Boy, you suck.",2
7783,Beverley,15," Well, Leonard‰Ûªs younger brother, Michael, is a tenured law professor at Harvard, and his sister just successfully grew a human pancreas in an adolescent gibbon.",2
7784,Howard,15," So, she‰Ûªs close to curing diabetes?",2
7785,Beverley,15, Why else would you grow a pancreas in a teenaged gibbon?,2
7786,Howard,15," Wow, you must be very proud.",2
7787,Beverley,15, Why? They‰Ûªre not my accomplishments. I have to urinate.,2
7788,Leonard,15, Why are you doing this?,2
7789,Howard,15," You know the rules. You brought your mom to work, you must suffer.",2
7790,Sheldon,15," Leonard, I had no idea your siblings were so much more successful than you.",2
7791,Raj,15," Yeah, you‰Ûªre like the Jar Jar Binks of the Hofstadter family.",2
7792,Howard,15," Oh, meesa think yousa lookin‰Ûª so so sad.",2
7793,Leonard,15," You know, rather than mock me, my friends might realize that this is difficult and try to help me through it.",2
7794,Raj,15," Nope, I think mocking you is more fun.",2
7795,Howard,15," Next time, don‰Ûªt yousa bring mama to work. Okee-day?",2
7796,Leonard,15, That was fast.,2
7797,Beverley,15," Oh, the middle stall was occupied. I‰Ûªll have to try again later.",2
7798,Sheldon,15," It‰Ûªs totally understandable. In bladder voiding, as in real estate, it‰Ûªs location, location, location.",2
7799,Beverley,15," So, where were we?",2
7800,Leonard,15, Howard lives with his mother and Raj can‰Ûªt speak to women unless he‰Ûªs drunk. Go.,2
7801,Beverley,15," That‰Ûªs fascinating. Selective mutism is quite rare. On the other hand, an adult Jewish male living with his mother is so common it borders on sociological clichÌ©.",2
7802,Howard,15," It‰Ûªs just temporary, I pay rent.",2
7803,Leonard,15, He lives in the same room where his bassinet was.,2
7804,Beverley,15," You know, both selective mutism and an inability to separate from one‰Ûªs mother can stem from a pathological fear of women. It might explain why the two of you have created an ersatz homosexual marriage to satisfy your need for intimacy.",2
7805,Howard,15, Say what? (Raj whispers in his ear) That‰Ûªs basically what I just said.,2
7806,Leonard,15," You brought your husband to work, you know the rules. Meesa thinking yousa looking pretty sad now too, betcha, betcha.",2
7807,Beverley,15," Leonard, it‰Ûªs one o‰Ûªclock, weren‰Ûªt you going to show me your laboratory at one o‰Ûªclock?",2
7808,Leonard,15," There‰Ûªs no hurry, Mother, tell them more about their secret love for each other.",2
7809,Beverley,15," But it‰Ûªs one o‰Ûªclock, you were going to show me your laboratory at one o‰Ûªclock.",2
7810,Sheldon,15, Her reasoning is unassailable. It is one o‰Ûªclock.,2
7811,Leonard,15, Fine. Let‰Ûªs go. I think you‰Ûªll find my work pretty interesting. I‰Ûªm attempting to replicate the dark matter signal found in sodium iodide crystals by the Italians.,2
7812,Beverley,15," So, no original research?",2
7813,Leonard,15, No.,2
7814,Beverley,15," Well, what‰Ûªs the point of my seeing it? I could just read the paper the Italians wrote.",2
7815,Howard,15," Just for the record, we‰Ûªre not in an ersatz homosexual relationship.",2
7816,Raj,15," Well, then why didn‰Ûªt you say that to her?",2
7817,Howard,15, Why is it always my responsibility?,2
7818,Raj,15," It‰Ûªs not always your responsibility. I swear, this is the same thing you did at the comic book store last week.",2
7819,Howard,15, I can‰Ûªt believe you‰Ûªre bringing that up.,2
7820,Raj,15, I didn‰Ûªt bring it up. You did.,2
7821,Howard,15, We‰Ûªll talk about this later.,2
7822,Raj,15," You always say that, but we never do.",2
7823,Sheldon,15, You went to the comic book store without me.7,2
7824,Scene,15, Outside Penny‰Ûªs door.,2
7825,Penny,15, Hey.,2
7826,Leonard,15, You got alcohol?,2
7827,Penny,15, Your mom still here?,2
7828,Leonard,15, Yep.,2
7829,Penny,15," Come on in. Wait, wait, she‰Ûªs not gonna come here looking for you, is she?",2
7830,Leonard,15," Oh, relax. She took Sheldon to the hospital to get a brain scan.",2
7831,Penny,15," Oh, my God. What happened?",2
7832,Leonard,15, Nothing. Mother likes looking at brains and Sheldon likes getting his brain scanned.,2
7833,Penny,15," Geez, what a fun couple.",2
7834,Leonard,15, She‰Ûªs only been here a day and a half and I‰Ûªm seriously considering alcoholism as a new career path.,2
7835,Penny,15," Hey, I talked to her for five minutes yesterday and I‰Ûªve been half bombed ever since.",2
7836,Leonard,15, You can‰Ûªt let her get into your head.,2
7837,Penny,15," My head, what about yours?",2
7838,Leonard,15, It‰Ûªs too late for me. My head is her summer house.,2
7839,Penny,15," She was right, you know. The locus of my identity is totally exterior to me.",2
7840,Leonard,15," Oh, yeah, there she is. Hi, Mom.",2
7841,Penny,15," I mean, do you know where I was all morning? Auditioning with 50 other blondes for some stupid antidepressant commercial. And for what? So I‰Ûªll finally get my daddy‰Ûªs approval?",2
7842,Leonard,15, Did you get the part?,2
7843,Penny,15," No, they said I was too perky.",2
7844,Leonard,15," Hey, you want to talk about not getting love from a parent. You know what I used to do when I was little to have some sensation of human contact?",2
7845,Penny,15," Yeah, you grabbed your penis and wouldn‰Ûªt let go. Your mother told me.",2
7846,Leonard,15," Of course she did. Anyway, that‰Ûªs not what I was gonna say. When I was ten years old, I built a hugging machine.",2
7847,Penny,15, A hugging machine?,2
7848,Leonard,15," Yeah. I got a dressmaker‰Ûªs mannequin, I stuffed it with an electric blanket so it would be warm, and built two radio-controlled arms that would hug me and pat my back.",2
7849,Penny,15," Oh, that is so sad.",2
7850,Leonard,15, You know what the saddest part was?,2
7851,Penny,15, What?,2
7852,Leonard,15, My father used to borrow it.,2
7853,Scene,15, The stairwell.,2
7854,Beverley,15, Your scan data will be very elpful to my research. You have a remarkable brain.,2
7855,Sheldon,15, I know. Although I‰Ûªve always hated how my right frontal lobe looks in pictures.,2
7856,Beverley,15," Common complaint among men. Nothing‰Ûªs ever big enough, except when they get a tumour. Then you never hear the end of it.",2
7857,Sheldon,15, I‰Ûªd love to see a scan of your brain sometime.,2
7858,Beverley,15," Oh, I‰Ûªll send you a link, but its physiology is fairly unimpressive.",2
7859,Sheldon,15," Oh, I can‰Ûªt believe that.",2
7860,Beverley,15, Your unwillingness to accept empirical evidence suggests an attempt at flattery.,2
7861,Sheldon,15, My apologies. I‰Ûªve been living with your son too long. Gotten into some bad habits.,2
7862,Beverley,15, Understandable.,2
7863,Sheldon,15, Can I make you a cup of tea?,2
7864,Beverley,15," I doubt it, but if anyone has a chance, it‰Ûªs probably you.",2
7865,Sheldon,15, I feel very comfortable around you.,2
7866,Beverley,15," I feel very comfortable around you, too.",2
7867,Sheldon,15," It‰Ûªs surprising because I generally don‰Ûªt feel comfortable around, well, anyone.",2
7868,Beverley,15, Nor I.,2
7869,Sheldon,15, What are the odds that two individuals as unique as ourselves would be connected by someone as comparatively workaday as your son?,2
7870,Beverley,15, Is that a rhetorical point or would you like to do the math?,2
7871,Sheldon,15, I‰Ûªd like to do the math.,2
7872,Beverley,15," I‰Ûªd like that, too.",2
7873,Scene,15, Penny‰Ûªs apartment. Penny and Leonard are doing tequila shots. ,2
7874,Penny,15," Okay, now this time‰Û_",2
7875,Leonard,15, Uh-huh.,2
7876,Penny,15," You‰Ûªre gonna lick the salt off my neck, do the shot, and then bite the lime.",2
7877,Leonard,15," I‰Ûªm sorry, I didn‰Ûªt hear anything after lick.",2
7878,Penny,15," Neck, shot, lime. (Leonard starts licking her neck. He is there a long time) Okay, shot, lime.",2
7879,Leonard,15," Right. Ah! Where‰Ûªs the lime? (Penny has the lime in her mouth) Oh, okay, we‰Ûªre sharing.",2
7880,Scene,15, The apartment.,2
7881,Sheldon,15," So, what do you think?",2
7882,Beverley,15, I‰Ûªm very tempted. I‰Ûªm just not sure it‰Ûªs appropriate with my son‰Ûªs roommate.,2
7883,Sheldon,15," Normally, I‰Ûªd feel the same way. But based on everything I‰Ûªve observed about us, I can‰Ûªt help but speculate we‰Ûªd be very good together.",2
7884,Beverley,15, True. I‰Ûªve had a similar observation. It‰Ûªs certainly something I could never do with my husband.,2
7885,Sheldon,15," I was hesitant the first time I tried it, but I experienced an unanticipated and remarkable release of endorphins. It‰Ûªs quite satisfying.",2
7886,Beverley,15, I see what you‰Ûªre doing. You‰Ûªre appealing to the neuroscientific researcher in me.,2
7887,Sheldon,15," You see right through me, don‰Ûªt you?",2
7888,Beverley,15, Only when you‰Ûªre in a CAT scanner.,2
7889,Scene,15, Penny‰Ûªs bedroom. Penny and Leonard are in bed. ,2
7890,Leonard,15, This is actually gonna happen.,2
7891,Penny,15," Honey, shush, shush, shush, shush, shush.",2
7892,Leonard,15," You shush, I‰Ûªm happy, I want to talk about it. You know what my mother would say about this? She would say because you were not loved by your father and I was not loved by my mother, that having sex is our way of making up for the intimacy we didn‰Ûªt get as children.",2
7893,Penny,15, Why would you bring that up right now?,2
7894,Leonard,15, I don‰Ûªt know. Foreplay?,2
7895,Penny,15," So you‰Ûªre saying you‰Ûªre not having sex with me, you‰Ûªre having sex with your mother?",2
7896,Leonard,15," Ummm, I‰Ûªm gonna go with ‰ÛÏno.‰Û",2
7897,Penny,15, That is the sickest thing I‰Ûªve ever heard.,2
7898,Leonard,15," Come on, you‰Ûªre trying to have sex with your father, and I‰Ûªm okay with that.",2
7899,Scene,15, Penny‰Ûªs front door. ,2
7900,Penny,15, Get out!,2
7901,Leonard,15, She said shush. I should have shushed. (Enters apartment. Sheldon and Beverley are inside duetting on Journey‰Ûªs ‰ÛÏAny Way You Want It‰Û on Rock Star.),2
7902,Scene,15, The hallway. ,2
7903,Leonard,15," All right, Mother. Um, have a nice flight.",2
7904,Beverley,15," That‰Ûªs not really in my control, is it? Oh, uh, yes (gives him a very uncomfortable hug.)",2
7905,Penny (coming out of her apartment),15," Oh, good morning.",2
7906,Leonard,15, Morning.,2
7907,Penny,15," Look, I was just coming over to talk to you.",2
7908,Leonard,15, You don‰Ûªt have to. Ever.,2
7909,Penny,15, Gotcha.,2
7910,Leonard,15," Good-bye, Mother.",2
7911,Beverley,15," Good-bye, Leonard. So, Slugger, shall we pick up where we left off last time?",2
7912,Penny (in tears),15," I mean, my mom could‰Ûªve just said, ‰ÛÏBob, get over it, she‰Ûªs a girl, move on.‰Û But she didn‰Ûªt. Not one word.",2
7913,Beverley,15, Interesting. Would you be willing to fly to New Jersey and discuss your relationship with your parents during a brain scan?,2
7914,Penny,15, Would it help?,2
7915,Beverley,15," Well, it would help me.",2
7916,Scene,16, The paintball range.,2
7917,Howard,16, That was close.,2
7918,Raj,16," God, I love the smell of paintballs in the morning.",2
7919,Howard,16," Yeah, still funny, Raj.",2
7920,Leonard,16, There‰Ûªs no way we can get to the ridge. The Chemistry Department has us completely cut off.,2
7921,Howard,16, But what about the creek bed?,2
7922,Sheldon,16," The Pharmacology Department controls that, and they‰Ûªre all hopped up on experimental steroids.",2
7923,Raj,16," Well, that‰Ûªs it then, we‰Ûªre doomed.",2
7924,Sheldon,16, I think the time has come to acknowledge that we are paying the price for some of us failing to attend my Physics Department paintball strategy meeting.,2
7925,Howard,16," I told you my mom has spider veins, I had to take her to the laser clinic.",2
7926,Sheldon,16, And I told you I wanted to see a doctor‰Ûªs note.,2
7927,Raj,16, We need a plan. How about Operation Hammer of the Gods?,2
7928,Leonard,16, I forget. Which one is Hammer of the Gods?,2
7929,Raj,16, We hide behind the Dumpsters in the parking lot and ambush people when they come to pee.,2
7930,Howard,16, No go. The Dumpsters are deep in Astronomy Department territory.,2
7931,Leonard,16," No, that shouldn‰Ûªt be a problem, Venus is up during the day. They‰Ûªre probably just all staring at the sky.",2
7932,Sheldon,16," All right, what we need now is a tactical retreat. Did you see the episode of Stargate where they found themselves on a planet with a culture based loosely on Earth‰Ûªs Athens and Sparta? Not important. Leonard, Raj and I are going to burst out the door and run away, Howard will cover us.",2
7933,Howard,16, Why don‰Ûªt I run away and you cover me?,2
7934,Sheldon,16," Because you chose your mother‰Ûªs veins over victory. On three. One, two, three, go!",2
7935,Howard,16, I had to take her! It‰Ûªs almost bathing suit weather!(Another player bursts through the door),2
7936,Leslie,16," Howard, I‰Ûªm on your team.",2
7937,Howard,16," Oh, Leslie, thank God.",2
7938,Leslie,16, Where‰Ûªs the rest of your squad?,2
7939,Howard,16," Ah, they left me here to die. What about yours?",2
7940,Leslie,16," Dead, all of them.",2
7941,Howard,16, Sorry.,2
7942,Leslie,16, Don‰Ûªt be. It was friendly fire. They just wouldn‰Ûªt listen.,2
7943,Howard,16," Well, we‰Ûªre surrounded, so I guess there‰Ûªs nothing for us to do but wait to be captured or killed.",2
7944,Leslie,16," Hmm, that‰Ûªs the worst part, the waiting.",2
7945,Howard,16, All the while knowing that there‰Ûªs a paint pellet out there with your name on it.,2
7946,Leslie,16," Yeah, the big wet ball of death. Kind of makes you feel more alive, doesn‰Ûªt it?",2
7947,Howard,16, It kind of does.,2
7948,Leslie,16, I say we make every moment count.,2
7949,Howard,16, I agree. How exactly do we do that? (Leslie kisses him),2
7950,Leonard (voice),16," Howard, why aren‰Ûªt you covering us? We‰Ûªre getting slaughtered out here!",2
7951,Howard,16, War is hell.,2
7952,Scene,16, The university cafeteria.,2
7953,Raj,16, Did you guys see the new budget memo that went out this morning?,2
7954,Leonard,16," Yeah, more cutbacks.",2
7955,Sheldon,16, Unacceptable. It baffles me why they don‰Ûªt simply let some of you go so that there‰Ûªs money available for my research.,2
7956,Leonard,16," You know what baffles me, Sheldon?",2
7957,Sheldon,16," Based on your academic record, any number of things, I would imagine.",2
7958,Leslie,16," Hey, guys.",2
7959,Leonard,16," Hey, Leslie.",2
7960,Howard,16, Hey.,2
7961,Leslie,16," Howard, I got the approval for the rapid prototyper you wanted.",2
7962,Howard,16," That‰Ûªs great, Leslie. Thanks.",2
7963,Leslie,16," You scratch my back, I scratch yours. Rawr.",2
7964,Raj,16, What was all that about?,2
7965,Howard,16," Oh, uh, no big deal. They gave Leslie control of some unrestricted grant money.",2
7966,Leonard,16," Yeah, okay, but what‰Ûªs with the back-scratching and the meow!",2
7967,Sheldon,16, I believe the back-scratching metaphor generally describes a quid pro quo situation where one party provides goods or services to the second party in compensation for a similar action.,2
7968,Leonard,16, Thank you.,2
7969,Sheldon,16," The mrow, that sounded to me like an African civet cat.",2
7970,Leonard,16, Are you done?,2
7971,Sheldon,16," No. Despite what the name suggests, the civet cat is not a true cat. Now I‰Ûªm done.",2
7972,Raj,16, You know what I‰Ûªm thinking? I‰Ûªm thinking Howard wasn‰Ûªt making a back-scratching metaphor. I‰Ûªm thinking there was some actual scratching involved.,2
7973,Leonard,16," What about it, Howard?",2
7974,Howard,16," Okay, I didn‰Ûªt want to say anything ‰Ûªcause I know you and Leslie have a little history.",2
7975,Leonard,16, I don‰Ûªt care about that.,2
7976,Howard,16," Great, ‰Ûªcause I‰Ûªve been dying to say something.",2
7977,Leonard,16, You and Leslie?,2
7978,Howard,16, In the paintball shed! Twice!,2
7979,Sheldon,16, Is that why you didn‰Ûªt cover our escape and let us get cut down like animals?,2
7980,Howard,16," Oh, yeah, sorry about that.",2
7981,Sheldon,16," My good man, dereliction of duty in the face of the enemy is a court-martial offense.",2
7982,Howard,16," Court-martial, schmort-martial, Leslie Winkle is the fifth girl I‰Ûªve ever had sex with. I mean, for free.",2
7983,Raj,16," And plus, you got a rapid prototyper. That‰Ûªs an expensive piece of equipment, dude.",2
7984,Leonard,16, And the rest of us have had our budgets cut to the bone.,2
7985,Howard,16," Okay, one way to look at this is that I‰Ûªm getting new equipment, and you‰Ûªre not, and that‰Ûªs unfair. But a better way to look at this is that I‰Ûªm getting sex and you‰Ûªre not, and that‰Ûªs delightful.",2
7986,Scene,16, The apartment. Leonard is looking at Penny‰Ûªs laptop.,2
7987,Penny,16, The whole thing froze. I don‰Ûªt know what happened.,2
7988,Leonard,16, Calm down. We‰Ûªll figure it out.,2
7989,Penny,16, How can I calm down? I‰Ûªm gonna lose my whole shopping cart. That‰Ûªs three hours of picking out shoes just shot to hell.,2
7990,Sheldon,16," Hello, Penny.",2
7991,Penny,16," Hello, Sheldon.",2
7992,Sheldon,16, You‰Ûªre in my spot.,2
7993,Penny,16, Are you planning on sitting here?,2
7994,Sheldon,16," No, I‰Ûªm going to the comic book store.",2
7995,Penny,16, Then what difference does it make?,2
7996,Sheldon,16, What difference does it make?,2
7997,Leonard,16, Here we go.,2
7998,Sheldon,16," That is my spot. In an ever-changing world, it is a single point of consistency. If my life were expressed as a function on a four-dimensional Cartesian coordinate system, that spot at the moment I first sat on it would be zero-zero-zero-zero.",2
7999,Penny,16, What?,2
8000,Leonard,16, Don‰Ûªt sit in his spot.,2
8001,Penny,16, Fine. (Moves)  Happy?,2
8002,Sheldon,16, I‰Ûªm not unhappy.,2
8003,Penny,16," Boy, I love him, but he is one serious wackadoodle.",2
8004,Leonard,16," Okay, that should do it.",2
8005,Penny,16," Oh, thank you. You are a lifesaver.",2
8006,Leonard,16, That‰Ûªs a lot of shoes you ordered.,2
8007,Penny,16," Yeah, you know the sad thing is, it‰Ûªs really not. Ooh, is this one of those paintball guns?",2
8008,Leonard,16, Yeah. You ought to come out with us sometime.,2
8009,Penny,16," Oh, no, thanks. I‰Ûªm from Nebraska. When we shoot things, it‰Ûªs because we want to eat them or make them leave our boyfriends alone. (Gun goes off and shoots three paint pellets onto Sheldon‰Ûªs spot.)",2
8010,Scene,16, Howard‰Ûªs bedroom.,2
8011,Leslie,16," Boy, your heart‰Ûªs racing. I must‰Ûªve really gotten you going.",2
8012,Howard,16," Well, it‰Ûªs partly you, partly my transient idiopathic arrhythmia.",2
8013,Leslie,16, Sexy.,2
8014,Howard,16, Can I assume that you likewise found the experience‰Û_,2
8015,Leslie,16, Satisfactory?,2
8016,Howard,16," That wasn‰Ûªt quite the word I was looking for, but sure, I‰Ûªll do this pass-fail.",2
8017,Leslie,16," Hey, are you enjoying that prototyper I got you?",2
8018,Howard,16," Oh, it‰Ûªs great. Everybody in the Engineering Department is eating their hearts out.",2
8019,Leslie,16, Isn‰Ûªt it nice when your good fortune makes others miserable?,2
8020,Howard,16," You know, most people don‰Ûªt get that.",2
8021,Howard‰Ûªs Mother (voice),16," Howard, I‰Ûªm home!",2
8022,Howard,16," Oh, great.",2
8023,Howard‰Ûªs Mother (voice),16, Book club was cancelled! That thing on Phyllis‰Ûªs neck opened up again!,2
8024,Howard,16," I‰Ûªm busy, Ma!",2
8025,Howard‰Ûªs Mother (voice),16, Too busy to help your mother with her zipper?,2
8026,Howard,16," Don‰Ûªt come in, Ma!",2
8027,Howard‰Ûªs Mother (voice),16, Why not?,2
8028,Leslie,16, He‰Ûªs got company!,2
8029,Howard,16," Oh, there‰Ûªs the arrhythmia.",2
8030,Howard‰Ûªs Mother (voice),16, Is she Jewish?,2
8031,Howard,16, Are you Jewish?,2
8032,Leslie,16, No.,2
8033,Howard,16, Yes!,2
8034,Howard‰Ûªs Mother (voice),16," Okay, then you kids have fun! Use protection!",2
8035,Scene,16, The apartment. Leonard is trying to wash the paint off Sheldon‰Ûªs seat.,2
8036,Penny,16, You think he‰Ûªll notice?,2
8037,Leonard,16, There‰Ûªs a chance.,2
8038,Penny,16," Oh, what are we gonna do?",2
8039,Leonard,16," We? No, no, no, you had your chance to be we for, like, a year and a half now. Right now, you are you, and you are screwed.",2
8040,Penny,16, Why do we have to tell him I did it?,2
8041,Leonard,16," Well, we‰Ûªre not gonna tell him I did it.",2
8042,Penny,16," Okay, okay, how about this? We tell him somebody broke in.",2
8043,Leonard,16, Just to shoot the couch with a paintball gun?,2
8044,Penny,16," I‰Ûªm sorry, I buy it. All those people are on drugs.",2
8045,Leonard,16, We could tell him they wanted the couch to stay away from their boyfriend.,2
8046,Penny,16," Okay, fine. Well, what if we just flip it over? There. Looks fine, right?",2
8047,Leonard,16," Mm, butt print. There‰Ûªs no discernible butt print.",2
8048,Penny,16," Oh, come on. (Sits and wriggles around) There, butt print.",2
8049,Leonard,16, It‰Ûªs too small and too perfect.,2
8050,Penny,16, Thank you.,2
8051,Leonard,16, You‰Ûªre welcome.,2
8052,Penny (as Sheldon enters),16, Shh! Act normal.,2
8053,Leonard,16, Sheldon! How was the comic book store?,2
8054,Sheldon,16, Fine. The new issue of Flash is out.,2
8055,Leonard,16," Great, great. Did you walk the whole way? It‰Ûªs a little chilly.",2
8056,Sheldon,16, Koothrappali picked me up.,2
8057,Leonard,16, Isn‰Ûªt that terrific? He is such a good friend. You know what the best thing about friends is?,2
8058,Sheldon,16, They don‰Ûªt talk incessantly for no particular reason.,2
8059,Leonard,16," No, no, friends forgive the little things.",2
8060,Penny,16," You know, I gotta go home and wash my hair.",2
8061,Leonard,16," Don‰Ûªt you dare, missy.",2
8062,Sheldon,16," Hello, fastest man alive. Want to see me read your entire comic book? Want to see it again? Something‰Ûªs wrong.",2
8063,Leonard,16, What do you mean?,2
8064,Sheldon,16, I‰Ûªm not sure. It doesn‰Ûªt feel right.,2
8065,Leonard,16," I don‰Ûªt know what you‰Ûªre talking about. Oh, that. Penny did that.",2
8066,Scene,16," The same. Everyone is eating. Sheldon is perched on the back of Leonard‰Ûªs chair. He keeps making moaning noises. Saying ‰ÛÏExcuse me‰Û he tries moving back to his spot, but the cushion is not there. He tries perching on the arm in various positions.",2
8067,Leonard,16, Why don‰Ûªt you just eat in your desk chair?,2
8068,Sheldon,16, Why don‰Ûªt I just eat in my desk chair?,2
8069,Penny,16, Here we go.,2
8070,Sheldon,16," That is my desk chair, that is where I work. I don‰Ûªt eat in my desk chair and I don‰Ûªt work in my spot. I work in my desk chair and eat in my spot.",2
8071,Leonard,16, Wackadoodle.,2
8072,Howard,16," You know, there‰Ûªs kind of an obvious solution here. (To Raj) Get up. (Raj does. Howard moves his cushion across to Sheldon‰Ûªs spot) There. Problem solved. (Raj whispers to him) Nobody cares where you‰Ûªre going to sit. You‰Ûªre not crazy.",2
8073,Sheldon,16," Excuse me, but the problem is not solved. If your head had been accidentally amputated, and we transplanted a dog‰Ûªs head in its place, would that be ‰ÛÏproblem solved‰Û?",2
8074,Leonard,16," If it were your head, it would be.",2
8075,Penny,16," Sheldon, I am really, really sorry, but it‰Ûªs only for a week. Can‰Ûªt you be a little bit flexible? Yeah, sorry. I didn‰Ûªt really think that through.",2
8076,Sheldon,16," You claim it‰Ûªs going to be a week, but I have no faith in your dry cleaner.",2
8077,Penny,16, Why not?,2
8078,Sheldon,16, Did you notice the sign on his counter? He‰Ûªs not a full-time dry cleaner. He also makes keys.,2
8079,Leonard,16," Oh, for God‰Ûªs sake, Sheldon.",2
8080,Sheldon,16," Focus is important. Was Michael DeBakey a wedding planner in between heart transplants? Did Alexander Fleming moonlight as a hairdresser? ‰ÛÏThanks for discovering penicillin, now how about we try a bouffant?‰Û",2
8081,Howard (after his phone rings),16," Ooh, looks like I‰Ûªm gonna have sex tonight. Hey, baby‰Û_",2
8082,Penny,16, His right hand is calling him?,2
8083,Leonard,16," No, it‰Ûªs Leslie Winkle. It‰Ûªs a long story.",2
8084,Howard,16," I‰Ûªll pick you up in ten minutes. Gentlemen, adieu.",2
8085,Leonard,16, I thought we were going to play Halo tonight.,2
8086,Howard,16," What am I supposed to do, Leonard? There‰Ûªs a woman out there anxious to have sex with me. You understand, right?",2
8087,Penny,16, No. Not at all.,2
8088,Howard,16," Nevertheless, I must depart. By the way, did I tell you? Leslie pulled some strings and got me on the research trip to Geneva to check out the CERN Supercollider.",2
8089,Leonard,16, That‰Ûªs not fair. You‰Ûªre not even a physicist.,2
8090,Howard,16," Okay, there are two ways of looking at this‰Û_",2
8091,Leonard,16, Get out.,2
8092,Howard,16, Bye.,2
8093,Scene,16, Howard‰Ûªs bedroom.,2
8094,Leslie,16, You‰Ûªre improving.,2
8095,Howard,16, Thank you. It helps when I get to practice with a real woman.,2
8096,Leslie,16," Hey, listen. Saturday my sister‰Ûªs getting married. I.. I want you to come with me. It‰Ûªs black tie.",2
8097,Howard,16," Yeah, gee, I‰Ûªd really rather not.",2
8098,Leslie,16, Why not?,2
8099,Howard,16," When I go to weddings, it‰Ûªs to scam on chunky bridesmaids. I don‰Ûªt know what I would do with a date.",2
8100,Leslie,16," Oh, all right. I understand.",2
8101,Howard,16, Thanks.,2
8102,Leslie,16," Hey, I‰Ûªm really sorry about that Geneva trip.",2
8103,Howard,16, What about it?,2
8104,Leslie,16," Oh, didn‰Ûªt you hear? I had to reduce the number of people going, and you didn‰Ûªt make the cut.",2
8105,Howard,16, When did that happen?,2
8106,Leslie,16, About 12 seconds ago.,2
8107,Howard,16," Well, hold on. Are you saying if I don‰Ûªt go to the wedding, I can‰Ûªt go to Geneva?",2
8108,Leslie,16," Actually, I‰Ûªm trying not to say it.",2
8109,Howard,16," Okay, I‰Ûªm sorry, but that makes me a little uncomfortable.",2
8110,Leslie,16, How so?,2
8111,Howard,16, Because it‰Ûªs like you‰Ûªre controlling me with new equipment and research trips.,2
8112,Leslie,16," Well, if I weren‰Ûªt controlling you with new equipment and research trips, then I‰Ûªd be uncomfortable.",2
8113,Howard,16, How so?,2
8114,Leslie,16," ‰Û÷Cause then we‰Ûªd be in, like, a real relationship with feelings and all that crap.",2
8115,Howard,16," So, bottom line, I‰Ûªm just a bought-and-paid-for sex toy.",2
8116,Leslie,16," No. No, not at all. You‰Ûªre also arm candy. So? What do you think?",2
8117,Howard,16," Hey, Ma, you got to rent me a tux!",2
8118,Howard‰Ûªs Mother (voice),16, Right now? What kind of sex are you having up there?,2
8119,Scene,16, The apartment,2
8120,Leonard,16, Why are you crouching there?,2
8121,Sheldon,16, This is my spot. Where else am I supposed to crouch?,2
8122,Leonard,16, I don‰Ûªt know. Texas?,2
8123,Penny (arriving with cushion),16," Here you go. Fresh from the cleaners, good as new.",2
8124,Leonard,16," Really? Great. Sheldon, look. Good as new.",2
8125,Sheldon,16," From that key maker, I highly doubt it.",2
8126,Penny,16," Come on, Sheldon. Just give it a try.",2
8127,Sheldon,16, All right.,2
8128,Penny,16," There, nice and comfy cosy. Zero, zero, zero.",2
8129,Sheldon,16, There‰Ûªs one more zero. You forgot the time parameter.,2
8130,Penny,16, Sit on the damn couch.,2
8131,Sheldon,16, Nope.,2
8132,Penny,16," What do you mean, nope? What‰Ûªs wrong with it?",2
8133,Leonard,16," Nothing, it‰Ûªs what‰Ûªs wrong with him.",2
8134,Penny,16, It‰Ûªs exactly the same‰Û_,2
8135,Leonard,16," Penny, Penny, I think I know what to do. Sheldon, I have some bad news.",2
8136,Sheldon,16, More?,2
8137,Leonard,16, I‰Ûªm afraid so. You know the cashew chicken I get you Monday nights?,2
8138,Sheldon,16, Yes. From Szechuan Palace.,2
8139,Leonard,16, Szechuan Palace closed two years ago.,2
8140,Sheldon,16, What? Wh-Where did my cashew chicken come from?,2
8141,Leonard,16, Golden Dragon.,2
8142,Sheldon,16," No. No, this isn‰Ûªt right. Our food always comes in Szechuan Palace containers.",2
8143,Leonard,16," Yeah, well, before they went out of business, I bought 4,000 containers. I keep them in the trunk of my car.",2
8144,Sheldon,16," But. Oh, this changes everything.",2
8145,Leonard,16, I thought that might take his mind off the cushion.,2
8146,Sheldon,16, What‰Ûªs real? What isn‰Ûªt? How can I know?,2
8147,Penny,16," You did make that up, right?",2
8148,Leonard,16," Oh, God, I wish I had.",2
8149,Sheldon,16, Leonard?,2
8150,Leonard,16," Yeah, buddy?",2
8151,Sheldon,16, I still don‰Ûªt like this cushion.,2
8152,Scene,16, The paint ball range.,2
8153,Leonard,16," Okay, first of all, Penny, thank you for coming.",2
8154,Penny,16, Thanks for the shoes.,2
8155,Leonard,16, Penny is an amazing shot. I think we have a real chance to win this week.,2
8156,Howard,16, What‰Ûªs the plan?,2
8157,Leonard,16," Okay. Now, we all run out. Sheldon and I will cut to the left behind these trees. Raj, Howard and Leslie flank to the right behind the rocks. Then we‰Ûªll all have a great view as Penny runs out and kills everyone else in sight.",2
8158,Sheldon,16," Right, just one thing before we start.",2
8159,Leonard,16," What is it, Sheldon? (Sheldon shoots Penny)",2
8160,Penny,16, What the hell?,2
8161,Sheldon,16, That was for my cushion.,2
8162,Leonard,16," Sheldon, Penny was our only hope.",2
8163,Sheldon,16," I‰Ûªm sorry, Leonard. But revenge is a dish best served cold.",2
8164,Penny,16, Screw that. (Shoots Sheldon),2
8165,Sheldon,16, She can‰Ûªt shoot me. She‰Ûªs dead.,2
8166,Leonard,16, He‰Ûªs right. You can‰Ûªt. (Shoots Sheldon),2
8167,Sheldon,16," Well, if we‰Ûªre going to descend into anarchy (Shoots Leonard)",2
8168,Howard,16," Okay, see you.",2
8169,Leonard,16, Where are you going?,2
8170,Leslie,16," Surrender, then Denny‰Ûªs.",2
8171,Scene,17," The Apartment",2
8172,Howard,17," Okay, Raj, hand me the number six torque screwdriver.",2
8173,Sheldon,17," Stop. We can‰Ûªt do this, it‰Ûªs not right.",2
8174,Raj,17," Sheldon, you have two choices. Either you let him put a bigger hard drive in the TiVo, or you delete stuff before we go out of town.",2
8175,Sheldon,17," But once you open the box, you‰Ûªve voided the warranty. The warranty is a sacred covenant we‰Ûªve entered into with the manufacturer. He offers to stand by his equipment, and we in return agree not to violate the integrity of the internal hardware. This little orange sticker is all that stands between us and anarchy.",2
8176,Leonard,17," Okay, then we won‰Ûªt touch the hard drive. We‰Ûªll just erase the first season of Battlestar.",2
8177,Sheldon (ripping off sticker),17, There. We‰Ûªre outlaws.,2
8178,Penny (entering with a pink suitcase),17," Here you go, Leonard. Is this going to be big enough?",2
8179,Leonard,17, It‰Ûªs perfect.,2
8180,Howard,17, For taking daffodils to your unicorn.,2
8181,Leonard,17," It‰Ûªs just for my notebooks. Thanks, Penny.",2
8182,Penny,17," Oh, I love San Francisco. I wish I was going with you.",2
8183,Sheldon,17," I understand your envy. This is a can‰Ûªt-miss symposium. There are going to be discussions on bioorganic cellular computer devices, the advancements in multi-threaded task completion, plus a roundtable on the nonequilibrium Green‰Ûªs function approach to the photoionization process in atoms.",2
8184,Penny,17," When I go, I usually just get hammered and ride the cable cars.",2
8185,Leonard,17, This conference is kind of a big thing. The keynote address is being delivered by George Smoot.,2
8186,Penny,17," Oh, my God, the George Smoot?",2
8187,Leonard,17, You‰Ûªve heard of him?,2
8188,Penny,17, Of course I haven‰Ûªt.,2
8189,Sheldon,17," George Smoot is a Nobel Prize-winning physicist, one of the great minds of our time. His work in black body form and anisotropy of the cosmic microwave background radiation cemented our understanding of the origin of the universe.",2
8190,Penny,17," It‰Ûªs kind of a funny name, though, Smoot.",2
8191,Sheldon,17, It‰Ûªs like talking to a chimp.,2
8192,Penny,17," Okay, now that I‰Ûªve been completely insulted, have a good flight.",2
8193,Leonard,17," Yeah, I wish.",2
8194,Sheldon,17," We‰Ûªre not flying, we‰Ûªre taking the train.",2
8195,Penny,17," Oh, cool.",2
8196,Howard,17," Yeah, cool. Seven times as long as flying, and costs almost twice as much.",2
8197,Penny,17," Well, then why are you doing it?",2
8198,Leonard,17," Well, we had a vote. Three of us voted for airplane, Sheldon voted for train, so we‰Ûªre taking the train.",2
8199,Scene,17, Sheldon‰Ûªs bedroom.,2
8200,Leonard,17," Hey, we‰Ûªre all going over to the Apple store to make fun of the guys at the Genius Bar. You want to come?",2
8201,Sheldon,17," Oh, I always enjoy that, but I‰Ûªm a little busy.",2
8202,Leonard,17, What are you doing?,2
8203,Sheldon,17," I‰Ûªm simplifying the task of packing for our trip. See, by attaching RFID tags to my clothing, it will enable my laptop to read and identify the items with this wand. I will then cross-reference them against destination, anticipated activity spectrum, weather conditions, duration of trip, et cetera.",2
8204,Leonard,17," Well, that does sound much simpler. How long is this going to take?",2
8205,Sheldon,17," Assuming I can keep up this pace, three hours, 11 minutes, and plus however long it takes to conclude this fairly pointless conversation.",2
8206,Leonard,17, Wow. Teasing the guys at the Apple store seems a little redundant now.,2
8207,Sheldon,17, I don‰Ûªt follow.,2
8208,Leonard,17, I wouldn‰Ûªt expect you to. I‰Ûªll see you later.,2
8209,Sheldon,17," Socks, one pair, cotton, argyle, blue. Socks, one pair, cotton, argyle, blue.",2
8210,Scene,17, On the train.,2
8211,Sheldon,17, What on earth are you doing?,2
8212,Raj,17," Whatever it is, I‰Ûªm guessing we‰Ûªre doing it wrong.",2
8213,Sheldon,17," Gentlemen, this is the Coast Starlight, one of the great American trains operating on one of the classic American routes. On this side, you‰Ûªll see panoramic ocean vistas inaccessible to any other form of transportation, while on your side, you‰Ûªll be treated to 350 miles of CostCos, Jiffy Lubes, and cinderblock homes with above-ground pools.",2
8214,Howard,17," Come on, Raj.",2
8215,Raj,17, What‰Ûªs wrong with Jiffy Lubes?,2
8216,Sheldon,17, No.,2
8217,Leonard,17, Why not?,2
8218,Sheldon,17, That‰Ûªs over the wheelbase. Are you completely unfamiliar with the suspension characteristics of a pre-1980 Pullman-built Superliner Deluxe passenger coach?,2
8219,Leonard,17," Sheldon, we‰Ûªve been on this train 90 seconds, and you‰Ûªve already said a thousand words. Just tell us where to sit and shut up.",2
8220,Sheldon,17," Here. I‰Ûªm hoping once you reap the endorphic rewards of the steady clickety-clack of steel wheels on polished rails, your sour disposition will abate.",2
8221,Leonard,17," Yeah, maybe. Meanwhile back in the 21st century, people are raising their tray tables and putting their seat-backs in an upright position ‰Ûªcause it‰Ûªs time to land in San Francisco.",2
8222,Raj,17," It‰Ûªs not so bad, really. At least these trains have modern plumbing. In India, you squat over a hole in the train and expose your naked buttocks to the chilly air of Rajasthan.",2
8223,Sheldon,17," He is referring, of course, to third class on Indian Railways‰Ûª magnificent Ranakpur Express and its twelve hundred kilometer journey from Maharashtra to the Bikaner Junction.",2
8224,Leonard,17," Oh, look, now he‰Ûªs boring on an international scale.",2
8225,Raj,17, Holy crap! Look!,2
8226,Leonard,17, Is that who I think it is?,2
8227,Howard,17, It can‰Ûªt be. What would Summer Glau be doing riding the train?,2
8228,Leonard,17, Maybe John Connor‰Ûªs aboard and she‰Ûªs protecting him from an evil Terminator.,2
8229,Sheldon,17," Unlikely. That‰Ûªs a television show, Leonard.",2
8230,Leonard,17, Thank you.,2
8231,Sheldon,17," Of course, if SkyNet actually did exist in the future, a perfect way to infiltrate and destroy mankind would be to send Terminators back posing as actors who have played Terminators in popular films and television series, lulling us into a false sense of security, i.e., that‰Ûªs Summer Glau from The Sarah Connor Chronicles. No, Summer, don‰Ûªt kill me! I‰Ûªm pro-robot! Ahh!",2
8232,Leonard,17, At least he‰Ûªs off the train crap.,2
8233,Sheldon,17, Whee!,2
8234,Howard,17," Sheldon, I owe you an apology. Taking the train was a stroke of brilliance! I‰Ûªve actually got a shot at a Terminator.",2
8235,Raj,17," Oh, please.When it comes to Terminators, you‰Ûªve got a better shot of scoring with Arnold Schwarzenegger.",2
8236,Howard,17," You‰Ûªre overlooking something. I have 11 hours with her in a confined space. Unless she‰Ûªs willing to jump off a moving train, tuck and roll down the side of a hill, she will eventually succumb to the acquired taste that is Howard Wolowitz.",2
8237,Leonard,17, My money‰Ûªs on tuck and roll.,2
8238,Sheldon,17, I‰Ûªm confused. I thought you were involved in some sort of socially intimate pairing with Leslie Winkle.,2
8239,Howard,17," Sheldon, let me explain to you how this works.",2
8240,Sheldon,17, All right.,2
8241,Howard,17, That‰Ûªs Summer Glau.,2
8242,Sheldon,17, Yes.,2
8243,Howard,17, That‰Ûªs it.,2
8244,Raj,17, Hang on a sec. Why do you get first crack at her?,2
8245,Howard,17," Um, well, let‰Ûªs see, couple reasons. One, I saw her first.",2
8246,Raj,17," No, you didn‰Ûªt. I did.",2
8247,Howard,17," Fair enough. But then let me move on to number two, unlike you, I can actually talk to women when I‰Ûªm sober.",2
8248,Raj,17," You fail to take into account that even mute, I am foreign and exotic, while you, on the other hand, are frail and pasty.",2
8249,Howard,17," Well, you know the old saying, pasty and frail never fail.",2
8250,Leonard,17," Excuse me, but what about me? Why don‰Ûªt I get a shot?",2
8251,Howard,17," Fine, go ahead. Take a shot.",2
8252,Leonard,17," You know, I‰Ûªve already got a gorgeous blonde back home at I can‰Ûªt score with. I think I‰Ûªll let you two take this one.",2
8253,Raj,17," Sheldon, is there a place on this train to get alcohol?",2
8254,Sheldon,17," Interesting that you ask. The Coast Starlight recently added the refurbished Pacific Parlour Car. Built in 1956 and originally known as the Santa Fe Lounge Car, the lower level is a theatre‰Û_",2
8255,Raj,17," Yeah-yeah, which way?",2
8256,Sheldon,17, and the upper level is a bar that offers wine tastings if you‰Ûªre going as far as Portland.,2
8257,Leonard,17, So aren‰Ûªt you going to go talk to her?,2
8258,Howard,17," I will, I‰Ûªm just working on my opening line.",2
8259,Leonard,17," She‰Ûªs probably heard every possible line, Howard. Why don‰Ûªt you just try hello?",2
8260,Howard,17," No, no, no, that always creeps girls out. I need to come up with something that‰Ûªs funny, smart and delicately suggests that my sexual endowment is disproportionate to my physical stature.",2
8261,Leonard,17, You‰Ûªre going to need more than 11 hours.,2
8262,Sheldon,17," Oh, no.",2
8263,Leonard,17, What‰Ûªs the matter?,2
8264,Sheldon,17, I forgot my flash drive.,2
8265,Leonard,17, So?,2
8266,Sheldon,17, So we have to go back.,2
8267,Leonard,17," Okay, Sheldon, I‰Ûªm going to say why and your answer cannot be because I forgot my flash drive.",2
8268,Sheldon,17, You don‰Ûªt understand. My flash drive has my paper on astrophysical probes of M-theory effects in the early universe that I was going to give to George Smoot at the conference.,2
8269,Leonard,17, Why do you have to give your paper to George Smoot?,2
8270,Sheldon,17, It‰Ûªs brilliant. He needs to read it.,2
8271,Leonard,17, So you‰Ûªll send him an e-mail when we get back.,2
8272,Sheldon,17, Then I won‰Ûªt get to see his face light up as he reads it.,2
8273,Leonard,17, Right. Of course.,2
8274,Sheldon,17," Oh, this is an unmitigated disaster.",2
8275,Leonard,17," Well, there‰Ûªs nothing you can do about it, so relax, sit back, enjoy the clickety-clack of the steel wheels on the polished rails.",2
8276,Sheldon,17," You forgot your flash drive, You forgot your flash drive (repeated over and over in time to the sound of the train)",2
8277,Leonard,17," Only ten hours, 55 minutes to go.",2
8278,"Howard (steeling himself to talk to Summer Glau, to himself)",17," It‰Ûªs hot in here. Must be Summer. (Walks towards her, then walks straight past. Returns, makes to talk to her, then turns to two nuns over the other side of the corridor) So, where you gals headed?",2
8279,Leonard,17, I‰Ûªve got a better idea.,2
8280,Sheldon,17, Are you going to be sarcastic?,2
8281,Leonard,17," Boy, you take all the fun out of it for me.åÊ But look, Penny‰Ûªs home. Why don‰Ûªt we just call her, have her go in the apartment, get your flash drive and e-mail you the paper?",2
8282,Sheldon,17, But the flash drive is in a locked drawer in my desk.,2
8283,Leonard,17, So?,2
8284,Sheldon,17, The key is hidden in my room.,2
8285,Leonard,17, So?,2
8286,Sheldon,17, Penny would have to go into my room.,2
8287,Leonard,17, So?,2
8288,Sheldon,17, People don‰Ûªt go in my room!,2
8289,Leonard,17," I see. Well, it seems once again, you‰Ûªre caught between a rock and a crazy place.",2
8290,Sheldon,17," Oh, I hate when that happens.",2
8291,Howard (to self),17, It‰Ûªs hot in here. It must be Summer. It‰Ûªs hot in here. Must be Summer. It‰Ûªs hot in here. Must be Summer.,2
8292,Raj (walking past and straight up to Summer Glau),17, It‰Ûªs hot in here. Must be Summer.,2
8293,Summer,17, That‰Ûªs cute.,2
8294,Raj,17, Really? I just made it up. Have you seen Slumdog Millionaire?,2
8295,Summer,17," Oh, yeah, I loved it.",2
8296,Raj,17, It‰Ûªs loosely based on my life.,2
8297,Scene,17, Penny‰Ûªs apartment. Penny is on the phone.,2
8298,Penny,17," Yeah, we‰Ûªre putting the play on for one night in this little 99-seat theatre. Can you come? Oh, great. Do you know 98 other people that might want to come? Oh, hang on. (Switches to another line) Hello?",2
8299,Sheldon (on phone),17," Listen carefully. I‰Ûªm about to give you a set of instructions, which you must follow to the letter.",2
8300,Penny,17," Just a sec. (Switches back to first line) The theatre is above a bowling alley, so it‰Ûªs a little noisy, but it might be the only chance I‰Ûªll ever get to play Anne Frank. And the director is brilliant. He uses the bowling sounds as, like, Nazi artillery. Okay, great, I‰Ûªll see you then. (Switches line again) Hello?",2
8301,Sheldon,17," Okay, step four. Do you see that small plastic case on my dresser?",2
8302,Penny,17, Your dresser? Who is this?,2
8303,Sheldon,17, It‰Ûªs Sheldon.,2
8304,Penny,17," Oh, hey, Sheldon! How is San Francisco?",2
8305,Sheldon,17, I‰Ûªm not in San Francisco. I‰Ûªm on a train. Were you even listening to me?,2
8306,Penny,17," Uh, no, I was talking to my friend, but what‰Ûªs up?",2
8307,Sheldon,17," What‰Ûªs up? I‰Ûªll tell you what‰Ûªs up. I‰Ûªm in a crisis situation, and I need you to marshal your powers of concentration, limited as they may be‰Û_",2
8308,Leonard,17," Give me the phone. Hi, Penny. It‰Ûªs Leonard.",2
8309,Penny,17," Hey, Leonard. What‰Ûªs going on with Dr. Wackadoodle?",2
8310,Leonard,17," He‰Ûªs calling to ask you a favour. You might be confused because he didn‰Ûªt use the words, Penny, Sheldon, please or favour.",2
8311,Sheldon,17," Okay. Enough chitchat. Okay, step one, locate your emergency key to our apartment. Step two, enter our apartment. Step three, enter my bedroom.",2
8312,Penny,17," Oh, hang on, Sheldon, getting another call.",2
8313,Sheldon,17," No! Leonard, let me tell you something. Personal robots cannot get here soon enough.",2
8314,Raj,17," And that bright little star peeking her head out early today, that‰Ûªs Venus.",2
8315,Summer,17, That is so cool. You really know a lot about space.,2
8316,Raj,17," Come on. When you were on TV in Firefly, you were actually in space.",2
8317,Summer,17," You‰Ûªre not one of those guys who really believe that, are you?",2
8318,Raj,17," You mean one of the hopeless geeks? No. Those are crazy people. Howard, be a dear and get me another one of these. Now, him, he‰Ûªs one of those geeks.",2
8319,Sheldon,17," All right, now, before you enter my bedroom unescorted, I need you to understand that this onetime grant of access does not create a permanent easement. Easement. It‰Ûªs a legal right",2
8320,Howard,17," Do you believe him? Normally around women, he has the personality of a boiled potato. Put one beer in him, and he‰Ûªs M. Night Charmalarmalon.",2
8321,Leonard,17, Is that what he‰Ûªs drinking? It‰Ûªs not even real beer.,2
8322,Howard,17, What?,2
8323,Leonard,17, Look at it. Non-alcoholic beer.,2
8324,Howard,17, What‰Ûªs going on?,2
8325,Leonard,17," I don‰Ûªt know. Some sort of placebo effect, I guess.",2
8326,Howard,17," Placebo, you say. Interesting.",2
8327,Sheldon,17," Yes, I‰Ûªm still here. Where am I going? I‰Ûªm on a train. Now, what you‰Ûªll be looking for is a small wooden box located between a Hoberman‰Ûªs sphere and a sample of quartz flecked with pyrite. Hoberman‰Ûªs Sphere. It‰Ûªs a collapsible icosidodecahedron. No, the thing with the time on it is my alarm clock.",2
8328,Raj,17," Actually, in India, the names of constellations are different. Where you have the Big Dipper, we have the Big Curry Pot.",2
8329,Summer,17, You‰Ûªre making that up.,2
8330,Raj,17, You got me. Now what are you going to do with me?,2
8331,Howard,17, Raj.,2
8332,Raj,17, Yes?,2
8333,Howard,17, Look.,2
8334,Raj,17, What am I looking at?,2
8335,Howard,17, You tell me.,2
8336,Raj,17, Non-alcoholic bee-ee-eeuh (Runs off),2
8337,Howard,17," Hi, I‰Ûªm the small package good things come in.",2
8338,Penny,17," Okay, I got a box, but there‰Ûªs no key in here. Just letters.",2
8339,Sheldon,17, That‰Ûªs the wrong box. Put it back.,2
8340,Penny,17," Oh, Sheldon, are these letters from your grandmother?",2
8341,Sheldon,17, Don‰Ûªt read those letters!,2
8342,Penny,17," Oh, look, she calls you Moon Pie. That is so cute.",2
8343,Sheldon,17, Put down the letters!,2
8344,Leonard,17," Hey, Penny. It‰Ûªs Leonard.",2
8345,Penny,17," Hey, Leonard. How‰Ûªs the train ride?",2
8346,Leonard,17," Delightful. Listen, I don‰Ûªt know what you‰Ûªre doing right now, but there are little bubbles forming on the corners of Sheldon‰Ûªs mouth.",2
8347,Penny,17," Okay, yeah, I kind of crossed a line. Put him back on.",2
8348,Leonard,17, Thank you.,2
8349,Sheldon,17, I‰Ûªm back.,2
8350,Penny,17," What up, Moon Pie?",2
8351,Sheldon,17, Nobody calls me Moon Pie but Meemaw!,2
8352,Leonard,17," Hey, Penny. Leonard again.",2
8353,Howard,17," So anyway, in the dream, you and I were ice skating, just the two of us. And then, I picked you up by your ankles and twirled you round and round until your legs tore off. I tried to stick them back on, but before I could, you turned into a giant loaf of pumpernickel bread. What do you think that means?",2
8354,Summer (uncomfortable),17, I really don‰Ûªt know.,2
8355,Howard,17, I‰Ûªll give you a little clue. My favourite sandwich? Salami on pumpernickel.,2
8356,Summer,17, Is that so?,2
8357,Howard,17," And did you know the word ‰ÛÏpumpernickel‰Û comes from the German words pumper and nickel, which loosely translates to fart goblin?",2
8358,Summer,17, No. I didn‰Ûªt.,2
8359,Penny,17," Okay, I found the box. Now what?",2
8360,Sheldon,17," You‰Ûªre holding a Japanese puzzle box, which takes ten precise moves to open. First, locate the panel with the diamond pattern and slide the centre portion one millimetre to the left. Then, on the opposite end of the box, slide the entire panel down two millimetres. You‰Ûªll hear a slight click.",2
8361,Penny,17," Hang on. Sheldon, do you have any emotional attachment to this box?",2
8362,Sheldon,17," No, it‰Ûªs a novelty I ordered off the Internet. Now, did you hear the click?",2
8363,Penny,17, Not yet. (Puts box on ground and stomps on it)There it is.,2
8364,Howard,17," Okay, here‰Ûªs another one. If you married the famous rock guitarist Johnny Winter, you‰Ûªd be Summer Winter.",2
8365,Summer,17, Uh-huh.,2
8366,Howard,17," Okay, I‰Ûªm going to just go for broke here and say I like you.",2
8367,Summer,17, Yeah?,2
8368,Howard,17," So here‰Ûªs my question, do you realistically see any conversational path that would take me from where we are right now to a place where I could ask you out and you‰Ûªd say yes?",2
8369,Summer,17, No.,2
8370,Howard,17, Fair enough. I‰Ûªll leave you in peace.,2
8371,Summer,17, Thank you.,2
8372,Howard,17," But before I go, would you mind if I just take one picture of us together for my Facebook page?",2
8373,Summer,17, Sure.,2
8374,Howard,17," Okay. Great. Now, can I take one where it looks like we‰Ûªre making out?",2
8375,Sheldon,17," Okay, now you‰Ûªre going to insert the flash drive into the USB port. She calls me Moon Pie because I‰Ûªm nummy-nummy and she could just eat me up, now, please put the flash drive in the USB port. The one that looks like a little duck‰Ûªs mouth.",2
8376,Leonard,17," Hey, how‰Ûªd it go?",2
8377,Howard,17, Terminator broke my phone.,2
8378,Leonard,17," Excuse me. (Goes down to Summer) Okay, I‰Ûªll be honest with you. I‰Ûªve just spent the last two hours imagining various scenarios in my head, trying to come up with some clever line to say to you. But then I finally realized you‰Ûªre a human being; I‰Ûªm a human being. I could just say to you‰Û_",2
8379,Summer,17, I‰Ûªm sorry. This is me.,2
8380,Leonard,17," Hi, my name‰Ûªs Leonard.",2
8381,Scene,17, The conference.,2
8382,Sheldon,17," So, I‰Ûªm thinking, you won the Nobel Prize what, three years ago? So you must deal with a whole lot of what has Smoot done lately? My thought is we continue my research as a team, you know, Cooper-Smoot, alphabetical, and when we win the Nobel Prize, you‰Ûªll be back on top.",2
8383,George Smoot,17," With all due respect, Dr. Cooper, are you on crack?",2
8384,Sheldon,17," Fine! Smoot-Cooper. Wow, what a diva.",2
8385,Scene,18, The apartment.,2
8386,Raj,18, Knight to queen‰Ûªs bishop-five.,2
8387,Howard,18," Oh, very nice. What‰Ûªs Leonard going to do? Does he give up the pawn or does he give up the position?",2
8388,Raj,18," Let‰Ûªs find out. Leonard, ready?",2
8389,Leonard,18, Ready.,2
8390,Raj,18, Go. (Leonard sprays an aerosol which lights up laser beams. He tries to negotiate the beams as Howard and Raj sing dramatic music. Eventually he touches one of the beams and a buzzer sounds.),2
8391,Leonard,18, Damn it. I slipped.,2
8392,Howard,18," Too bad. You know the rules of Secret Agent Laser Obstacle Chess. Uh, Leonard died again, Sheldon. You‰Ûªre up.",2
8393,Sheldon,18," Despite my deep love of chess, lasers and aerosol disinfectant, I must forfeit.",2
8394,Leonard,18, Why?,2
8395,Sheldon,18, ‰ÛÒ Because it‰Ûªs almost eleven o‰Ûªclock.,2
8396,Leonard,18, So?,2
8397,Sheldon,18," So, Penny has a don‰Ûªt knock on my door before eleven o‰ÛªclockåÊ or I punch you in the throat rule.",2
8398,All,18, Ah.,2
8399,Howard,18," Hey, you know what‰Ûªd be a great idea? We get some girls over here and play Laser Obstacle Strip Chess.",2
8400,Leonard,18," Believe me, Howard, any girl who would be willing to play that, you don‰Ûªt want to see naked.",2
8401,Howard,18, You underestimate me.,2
8402,Scene,18, Outside Penny‰Ûªs door. Sheldon stands looking at his watch with his hand poised to knock. At the right moment he starts knocking.,2
8403,Sheldon,18," (Knock, knock, knock) Penny, (knock, knock, knock) Penny, (knock, knock, knock) Penny.",2
8404,Penny,18," Hey, Sheldon.",2
8405,Sheldon,18, It‰Ûªs eleven am.,2
8406,Penny,18, I know. You‰Ûªre safe.,2
8407,Sheldon,18, This package came while you were at work.,2
8408,Penny,18," Oh, great, my rhinestones. Thank you.",2
8409,Sheldon,18, Excuse me.,2
8410,Penny,18, What?,2
8411,Sheldon,18, You have to sign this.,2
8412,Penny,18, What is it?,2
8413,Sheldon,18," When I signed for the package, I was deputized by the United Parcel Service and entrusted with its final delivery. I now need you to acknowledge receipt of the package so that I‰Ûªm fully indemnified and no longer liable.",2
8414,Penny,18," Sheldon, it‰Ûªs just a box of rhinestones.",2
8415,Sheldon,18," Well, the contents are irrelevant. A legal bailment has been created. Does that mean nothing to you?",2
8416,Penny,18," It means nothing to anybody. Come here, let me show you what I‰Ûªm doing.",2
8417,Sheldon,18," Bailment describes a relationship in common law where a physical possession of personal property, or chattels, is transferred from one person, the bailor, to another person, the bailee.",2
8418,Penny,18," Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Look, look, look! I started a business.",2
8419,Sheldon,18," Obviously, not a cleaning business.",2
8420,Penny,18," No, I‰Ûªm making flower barrettes. See? I call them Penny Blossoms. I made one for myself, then all the girls at work wanted one. Then I showed some to this lady who runs a shop in Old Town. She sells cards and homemade jewellery. She said she wanted to sell them. I said okay, and in one week, I made a $156.",2
8421,Sheldon,18, Good for you. Sign here.,2
8422,Penny,18," Sheldon, don‰Ûªt you get it? If this takes off, I won‰Ûªt have to be a waitress anymore.",2
8423,Sheldon,18, But then who will bring me my cheeseburger on Tuesday nights?,2
8424,Penny,18, Another waitress.,2
8425,Sheldon,18, What‰Ûªs her name?,2
8426,Penny,18, I don‰Ûªt know.,2
8427,Sheldon,18, And you‰Ûªre going to let her handle my food?,2
8428,Penny,18, Nancy. Her name is Nancy.,2
8429,Sheldon,18, I think you‰Ûªre just making that up.,2
8430,Penny,18," Sheldon, I‰Ûªm sorry about your hamburger, okay? I just don‰Ûªt want to be a waitress for the rest of my life.",2
8431,Leonard,18, Cheeseburger. I get a cheeseburger.,2
8432,Penny,18," Fine, cheeseburger.",2
8433,Sheldon,18, Maybe I‰Ûªd be better off with Nancy.,2
8434,Penny,18," So, what do you think? I mean, this could be a business, right?",2
8435,Sheldon,18, How many of these can you make a day?,2
8436,Penny,18, About twenty.,2
8437,Sheldon,18, And how much profit do you make per Penny Blossom?,2
8438,Penny,18," I don‰Ûªt know, like, 50 cents. I‰Ûªm not sure.",2
8439,Sheldon,18," No, Of course you‰Ûªre not. All right, ten dollars a day times five days a week times 52 weeks a year is two thousand six hundred dollars.",2
8440,Penny,18, That‰Ûªs all?,2
8441,Sheldon,18, Before taxes.,2
8442,Penny,18," Well, I don‰Ûªt have to pay taxes on this stuff.",2
8443,Sheldon,18," I believe the Internal Revenue Service would strongly disagree. But, if you took advantage of modern marketing techniques, and you optimized your manufacturing process, you might be able to make this a viable business.",2
8444,Penny,18, And you know about that stuff?,2
8445,Sheldon,18," Penny, I‰Ûªm a physicist. I have a working knowledge of the entire universe and everything it contains.",2
8446,Penny,18, Who‰Ûªs Radiohead?,2
8447,Sheldon,18, I have a working knowledge of the important things in the universe. Good luck.,2
8448,Penny,18," Sheldon, hold on. Could you maybe show me how to make more money with this?",2
8449,Sheldon,18, Of course I could.,2
8450,Penny,18," Sheldon, wait! Will you?",2
8451,Sheldon,18," Just to be clear here, you‰Ûªre asking for my assistance.",2
8452,Penny,18, Yes.,2
8453,Sheldon,18, And you understand that will involve me telling you what to do?,2
8454,Penny,18, I understand.,2
8455,Sheldon,18, And you‰Ûªre not allowed to be sarcastic or snide to me while I‰Ûªm doing so.,2
8456,Penny,18, Okay.,2
8457,Sheldon,18, Good. Let‰Ûªs begin with the premise that everything you‰Ûªve done up to this point is wrong.,2
8458,Penny,18," Oh, imagine that.",2
8459,Sheldon,18, Sarcasm. Good-bye.,2
8460,Penny,18," No, sorry. Wait! Please come back!",2
8461,Scene,18, Penny‰Ûªs apartment. Penny is making a barette. Sheldon is timing her.,2
8462,Penny,18, There. Done.,2
8463,Sheldon,18, All right. 12 minutes and 17 seconds.,2
8464,Penny,18," Pretty good, right?",2
8465,Sheldon,18," That‰Ûªs 4.9 Penny Blossoms per hour. Based on your cost of materials and your wholesale selling price, you‰Ûªll effectively be paying yourself‰Û_ $5.19 a day.",2
8466,Penny,18, A day?,2
8467,Sheldon,18, There are children in a sneaker factory in Indonesia who outearn you.,2
8468,Penny,18, That just can‰Ûªt be right.,2
8469,Sheldon,18, You‰Ûªre questioning my math?,2
8470,Penny,18," No, sorry.",2
8471,Sheldon,18, Want me to show my work?,2
8472,Penny,18," Oh, God, no, no. Just please tell me what to do about it.",2
8473,Sheldon,18," All right, are you familiar with the development that resulted from HonorÌ© Blanc‰Ûªs 1778 use of interchangeable parts? The assembly line, of course.",2
8474,Penny,18," Okay, you know what, if I‰Ûªm not allowed to be snide, you‰Ûªre not allowed to be condescending.",2
8475,Sheldon,18," That wasn‰Ûªt a part of our original agreement, and I do not agree to it now.",2
8476,Penny,18," All right, fine. How are we supposed to set up machines and conveyor belts in my apartment?",2
8477,Sheldon,18," You‰Ûªre thinking of the moving assembly line, an understandable but not excusable mistake. No. The moving assembly line, that was introduced by Henry Ford in 1908. That innovation is what made possible our modern consumer culture by enabling a low-unit cost for manufactured goods. I guess that isn‰Ûªt one of the topics discussed on your Radiohead.",2
8478,Scene,18, The apartment,2
8479,Leonard,18, Let‰Ûªs go. We‰Ûªre going to miss the coming attractions.,2
8480,Raj,18, What‰Ûªs the matter?,2
8481,Howard,18, I think I bruised a testicle capturing that last pawn.,2
8482,Leonard,18, Hello?,2
8483,Penny & Sheldon together,18, Hello. (They resume singing and working) ,2
8484,Leonard,18," W-W-Wait, what‰Ûªs going on?",2
8485,Sheldon,18, I assume you‰Ûªre referring to the sea shanty. It‰Ûªs a rhythmic work song designed to increase productivity.,2
8486,Penny,18," Yeah, it‰Ûªs crazy, but it totally works. Look, we made this Penny Blossom in under three minutes.",2
8487,Leonard,18," Terrific, but that kind of raises more questions than it answers.",2
8488,Sheldon,18," Penny‰Ûªs making hair accessories. I‰Ûªm helping her optimize her manufacturing process. All right, break‰Ûªs over. (They start singing again.)",2
8489,Howard,18, Hold on. What are you using as a bonding agent?,2
8490,Sheldon,18, Hot glue.,2
8491,Howard,18, You‰Ûªre kidding. Any of the cyanoacrylates would do a better job.,2
8492,Sheldon,18," It won‰Ûªt work, the flower‰Ûªs too porous.",2
8493,Leonard,18, What if we infused the bottom layer with silicone-RTV to provide a better mounting surface?,2
8494,Sheldon,18, Intriguing.,2
8495,Howard (after Raj whispers to him),18," Good question, what are you marketing and distribution channels?",2
8496,Penny,18," Well, there are the waitresses at my work, and this cute, little shop in Old Town.",2
8497,Sheldon,18," Hush, hush, hush, hush, hush, virtually non-existent. I‰Ûªm thinking that we set her up with a hosted turnkey e-commerce system to start.",2
8498,Howard,18, Why not eliminate the middle man? We could install a small server farm with a static IP in her bedroom.,2
8499,Leonard,18, She‰Ûªd need some kind of industrial cooling system.,2
8500,Sheldon,18," Of course, but before we set up a marketing and distribution infrastructure, we should finish optimizing the manufacturing process. To start with, she has a terrible problem with moisture-induced glitter clump.",2
8501,Penny,18," Yeah, it‰Ûªs a bitch.",2
8502,Howard,18," Uh, I‰Ûªve seen this before.",2
8503,Leonard,18, Where?,2
8504,Howard,18," It‰Ûªs a common stripper problem. They dance, they sweat, they clump.",2
8505,Penny,18, Ew.,2
8506,Leonard,18, Are you thinking about adding a desiccant like calcium sulphate?,2
8507,Howard,18," Actually, I‰Ûªm thinking about this one stripper named Vega. But sure, calcium sulphate could work.",2
8508,Sheldon,18, Let‰Ûªs think out of the box for a moment. How about a molecular sieve?,2
8509,Leonard & Howard,18, Oh!,2
8510,Penny,18, I‰Ûªve got a spaghetti strainer in the kitchen.,2
8511,Sheldon,18, Wow.,2
8512,Leonard,18," Hey, we could liberate some micro-porous charcoal from the chem lab.",2
8513,Sheldon,18," Oh, great. Raj, why don‰Ûªt you and Howard go get the charcoal? Leonard, why don‰Ûªt you start working on some preliminary Web site designs. I‰Ûªll make some space in our apartment so we can move the manufacturing process.",2
8514,Penny,18," Well, what‰Ûªs wrong with my apartment?",2
8515,Sheldon,18, It‰Ûªs not my apartment.,2
8516,Penny,18," Wait, wait, what am I going to do?",2
8517,Leonard,18," Uh, hey, it‰Ûªs your business. Do whatever you want.",2
8518,Penny,18," Oh, okay, cool. I‰Ûªm going to take a nap.",2
8519,Scene,18, The apartment.,2
8520,Leonard,18," I‰Ûªm still tweaking things a little bit, but this will give you the general idea of the Web site. So, what do you guys think?",2
8521,Howard (after Raj whispers to him),18," Uh, pretty much any way I say that is going to hurt his feelings.",2
8522,Leonard,18," Okay, what‰Ûªs wrong with it?",2
8523,Sheldon,18, ‰ÛÒ What‰Ûªs wrong with it?,2
8524,Leonard,18, Not you. I wasn‰Ûªt asking you. Penny?,2
8525,Penny,18," Uh, well, it‰Ûªs a little juvenile. I mean, it kind of looks like the MySpace page of a 13-year-old girl.",2
8526,Leonard,18," No, it doesn‰Ûªt.",2
8527,Howard,18, Please. Dateline could use it to attract predators.,2
8528,Sheldon,18," Penny, this is your enterprise, so it‰Ûªs ultimately your decision, but based on the quality of his work, I‰Ûªd strongly recommend that we let Leonard go.",2
8529,Leonard,18, You want to fire me?,2
8530,Sheldon,18, What I want is irrelevant. This is Penny‰Ûªs decision. Penny?,2
8531,Leonard,18," Excuse me, but if I did such a bad job then why do we already have orders?",2
8532,Penny,18, We do?,2
8533,Leonard,18," Uh-huh. Look. Mrs. Fiona Fondell from Huntsville, Alabama has ordered two.",2
8534,Penny,18, No kidding. Two?,2
8535,Leonard,18, Uh-huh. Look at the comments.,2
8536,Penny,18," Thank you, Penny Blossoms. These will be perfect to cover my bald spot. Aww, that is so sweet.",2
8537,Sheldon,18, Camouflaging bald spots. That‰Ûªs primarily a male concern. Perhaps we could expand our market.,2
8538,Penny,18, How are flower barrettes going to appeal to men?,2
8539,Howard,18, We add Bluetooth!,2
8540,Sheldon,18, Brilliant. Men love Bluetooth.,2
8541,Penny,18," Wait a minute, wait a minute, you want to make a hair barrette with Bluetooth?",2
8542,Sheldon,18," Penny, everything is better with Bluetooth.",2
8543,Leonard,18, Holy crap. Someone just ordered a thousand Penny Blossoms.,2
8544,Penny,18, Get out! Who needs a thousand sparkly flower barrettes with rhinestones?,2
8545,Leonard,18," The Fifth Annual East Rutherford, New Jersey, Gay, Lesbian, Bisexual and Transgender Alliance Luau.",2
8546,Sheldon,18," Oh, another market to expand into, balding gay men.",2
8547,Howard,18, And I‰Ûªll bet lesbians love Bluetooth.,2
8548,Sheldon,18, We should get to work.,2
8549,Penny,18," Wait, wait, wait, why does it say one-day rush? Since when do we offer a one-day rush?",2
8550,Leonard,18, Amazon offers one-day rush.,2
8551,Penny,18," Yeah, but they don‰Ûªt have to glue the books together. How the hell are we going to make a thousand Penny Blossoms in one day?",2
8552,Leonard,18, Don‰Ûªt yell at me. I‰Ûªm not manufacturing. I‰Ûªm just Web design.,2
8553,Penny,18," Okay, well, I‰Ûªm gonna have to call them and cancel the order.",2
8554,Sheldon,18," Excuse me, but was this not your goal? Financial independence through entrepreneurial brilliance and innovation? My brilliance and innovation, of course, but still.",2
8555,Penny,18, I just don‰Ûªt see how see can pull this off.,2
8556,Sheldon,18," Okay, that, right there, that equivocation and self-doubt, that is not the American spirit. Did Davy Crockett quit at the Alamo? Did Jim Bowie?",2
8557,Howard,18," They didn‰Ûªt quit. They were massacred by, like, a gazillion angry Mexicans.",2
8558,Sheldon,18," Alright, let me put it this way. Your gross receipts on this one order will be over $3,000 for one night‰Ûªs work.",2
8559,Penny,18, You guys get started.,2
8560,Leonard,18, What are you doing?,2
8561,Penny,18, Going online to buy shoes!,2
8562,Scene,18," The same, later. Sheldon and Penny are making barettes, singing ‰ÛÏShe‰Ûªll be coming round the mountain.‰Û",2
8563,Raj,18," You know, if I wanted to spend my Saturday nights doing this, I could have stayed in India.",2
8564,Howard,18," Oh, stop with the fake third world crap. Your father‰Ûªs a gynaecologist, and you had a house full of servants.",2
8565,Raj,18, We only had four servants. And two of them were children.,2
8566,Leonard,18, How are we doing?,2
8567,Raj,18, We have 128 assorted Penny Blossoms ready to ship.,2
8568,Howard,18," Oh, God, we‰Ûªre never gonna finish in time. Who made Sheldon the boss anyway?",2
8569,Sheldon,18, I believe I‰Ûªm hearing some negativity on the factory floor.,2
8570,Penny,18, So?,2
8571,Sheldon,18," Penny, the labour force is a living organism that must be carefully nurtured. Any counterproductive grumbling must be skilfully headed off by management. Observe. Hey! Less talk, more work!",2
8572,Penny,18, Nicely done.,2
8573,Sheldon,18," Thank you. You hear any union talk, you let me know.",2
8574,Leonard (singing),18, Someone‰Ûªs in the kitchen with Dinah‰Û_,2
8575,Howard (reluctantly singing),18, Someone‰Ûªs in the kitchen I know-ow-ow-ow,2
8576,Penny (singing),18, Someone‰Ûªs in the kitchen with Dinah‰Û_ Sheldon? Sheldon! (nudges him),2
8577,"Sheldon (waking up, singing)",18, ‰Û÷Cause I sold my soul to the company store.,2
8578,Penny,18," Honey, do you want some coffee?",2
8579,Sheldon,18," No, I don‰Ûªt drink coffee.",2
8580,Penny,18," Come on, but if you don‰Ûªt stay awake we‰Ûªll never finish in time.",2
8581,Sheldon,18," I‰Ûªm sorry, coffee‰Ûªs out of the question. When I moved to California, I promised my mother that I wouldn‰Ûªt start doing drugs.",2
8582,Penny,18," Leonard, help.",2
8583,Leonard,18," Sheldon, we still have 380 of these things to make.",2
8584,Sheldon,18, I have complete faith that you will make them. Good night.,2
8585,Penny,18, Leonard?,2
8586,Leonard,18," Yeah, no. But, Sheldon, without your insight and leadership this entire enterprise will surely fail.",2
8587,Sheldon,18," You‰Ûªre right, of course.",2
8588,Penny,18," Here, this will help.",2
8589,Sheldon,18," Very well, but if this leads to opiates or hallucinogenics, you‰Ûªre going to have to answer to my mother.",2
8590,Sheldon,18," Look at Planck‰Ûªs Constant. People say it‰Ûªs arbitrary. It could not be less arbitrary. If it varied even slightly, life as we know it would not exist. Bam! Now, now, let‰Ûªs reconsider the entire argument, but with entropy reversed and effect preceding cause, so you are thinking of a universe that‰Ûªs not expanding from the centre, no, it is retreating from a, from a possibility space. Bam! This is a space where we are all essentially Alice through the looking glass, standing in front the Red Queen, and we‰Ûªre being offered a cracker to quench our thirst. Bam! Of course, in another universe, let‰Ûªs call it universe prime, there‰Ûªs another Sheldon, let‰Ûªs call him Sheldon prime‰Û_",2
8591,Penny,18, We should have let him go to bed.,2
8592,Leonard,18, Bam.,2
8593,Leonard,18, I can‰Ûªt believe we actually did it.,2
8594,Howard,18," 1,000 friggin‰Ûª Penny Blossoms.",2
8595,Penny,18," I just want you guys to know I am really grateful for your help, and for every dollar I make, I‰Ûªm going to give you 20 cents.",2
8596,Howard,18, That‰Ûªs your entire profit margin.,2
8597,Penny,18, Oh. Then never mind.,2
8598,Leonard,18, I‰Ûªll print out the shipping label. Uh-oh.,2
8599,Penny,18, What?,2
8600,Leonard,18," We got an e-mail from the East Rutherford, New Jersey, Gay, Lesbian, Bisexual and Transgender Alliance. They want another thousand Penny Blossoms.",2
8601,Penny,18, Really?,2
8602,Leonard,18, One-day rush. I really need to take that off the Web site.,2
8603,Penny,18," Okay, well. Guess we‰Ûªd better get started.",2
8604,Howard,18, You can‰Ûªt be serious.,2
8605,Penny,18, Come on. What about the living organism of the workforce and the American spirit and Jiminy Crockett at the Alamo?,2
8606,Leonard,18, Davy Crockett. Jiminy Crockett was a cricket.,2
8607,Penny,18," Yes, yes, I know that, okay? I‰Ûªm tired, I‰Ûªve had like 18 cups of coffee. The point is, if we all just pull together, we can do this. Who‰Ûªs with me?",2
8608,Howard,18," Penny, although you may find it hard to believe, we do have lives.",2
8609,Penny,18, Leonard?,2
8610,Leonard,18," Sorry. My apologies to the gay community of East Rutherford, New Jersey.",2
8611,Sheldon (entering dressed as The Flash),18," Zoom, zoom, zoom! Where‰Ûªs the coffee?",2
8612,Penny,18, We‰Ûªre all out.,2
8613,Sheldon,18," No problem. I‰Ûªll be back before this banana hits the ground. Zoom, zoom, zoom, zoom! Zoom, zoom, zoom, zoom!",2
8614,Scene,18, The apartment. Raj is negotiating the laser beams. Sheldon and Howard are singing dramatically. ,2
8615,Raj (reaching the other side),18, Yes! (He takes a slice of pizza),2
8616,Howard,18," Sorry, guys, but Secret Agent Laser Obstacle Lunch is just stupid.",2
8617,Scene,19, The apartment.,2
8618,Penny,19," Okay, it‰Ûªs done. Look, guys, for the future, I don‰Ûªt mind killing the big spiders, but you have to at least try with the little ones.",2
8619,Sheldon,19," Penny, please, we‰Ûªre facing a far more serious problem than stray arachnids.",2
8620,Leonard,19," Sheldon, it‰Ûªs not that bad.",2
8621,Sheldon,19," Not bad? It‰Ûªs horrible. I mean, you hear stories about this sort of thing, but you never think it‰Ûªll happen to you.",2
8622,Leonard,19," So they steamed your dumplings, get over it. New topic, please.",2
8623,Howard,19," All right, Penny, let me take this opportunity to point out that you are looking particularly ravishing today.",2
8624,Penny,19," Not with a thousand condoms, Howard.",2
8625,Howard,19," So, there is a number.",2
8626,Penny,19," Okay, new topic, please. Hey, did you hear the people upstairs in 5A are moving out?",2
8627,Leonard,19, Shh-shh-shh!,2
8628,Sheldon,19, What?,2
8629,Penny,19, The people upstairs are moving out.,2
8630,Leonard,19, No!,2
8631,Sheldon,19, The horror!,2
8632,Leonard,19, Why would you just say something like that?,2
8633,Sheldon,19," No, no, no, no, no, no, no‰Û_",2
8634,Penny,19, How else was I supposed to say it?,2
8635,Leonard,19," Slowly, like putting a new fish in a tank. You don‰Ûªt just drop it in, you let the bag sit in the water a while.",2
8636,Sheldon,19, The horror!,2
8637,Penny,19," Sheldon, I‰Ûªm sure it‰Ûªs going to be fine.",2
8638,Sheldon,19," No, it‰Ûªs not going to be fine, change is never fine. They say it is, but it‰Ûªs not.",2
8639,Penny,19," Okay, honey, did you even know the people that are moving out?",2
8640,Sheldon,19," I never met them. That‰Ûªs what made them perfect, there were no awkward hellos in the halls, there was no clickety-clacking of high heel shoes on hardwood floors, they may as well have been a family of cats just jumping around from drape to drape without that annoying ammonia urine smell.",2
8641,Penny,19," Well, I‰Ûªm sure the new people will be just as quiet.",2
8642,Sheldon,19, You can‰Ûªt know that. How can you possibly know that?,2
8643,Penny,19," You‰Ûªre right, I can‰Ûªt. You know what? Anyone could rent that apartment now, an opera singer, the cast of stomp, yeah, a tap-dancing pirate with a wooden leg.",2
8644,Leonard,19, Why are you making it worse?,2
8645,Penny,19," I tried making it better, he wouldn‰Ûªt go for it.",2
8646,Howard (after Raj whispers to him),19," You‰Ûªre right, that‰Ûªs a great idea.",2
8647,Leonard,19, What?,2
8648,Howard,19," I‰Ûªll take the apartment upstairs. I can finally get away from my mother, and we can all spend some more time together, if you catch my drift.",2
8649,Penny,19, The horror!,2
8650,Scene,19, Outside Howard‰Ûªs house.,2
8651,Sheldon,19," Hold on. You honestly expect me to believe that social protocol dictates we break our backs helping Wolowitz move, and then he only need buy us a pizza?",2
8652,Leonard,19," I‰Ûªm sorry, that really is how it works.",2
8653,Sheldon,19," You‰Ûªre tricking me. You tell me the truth, what do we get?",2
8654,Leonard,19," Raj, help me out here.",2
8655,Raj,19, You get to choose between a mountain bike or a PS3.,2
8656,Sheldon,19," I knew it! PS3, definitelyåÊ PS3, who would pick a mountain bike?",2
8657,Howard (voice from inside),19," Enough with the guilt, ma, we‰Ûªll still see each other. I‰Ûªll come over every night and have dinner with you.",2
8658,Howard‰Ûªs Mother (voice),19," The hell you will! What am I running here, a fancy restaurant? Does this look like Olive Garden?",2
8659,Howard (voice),19," Okay, I get it, you‰Ûªre angry. You don‰Ûªt want to see your little bird leave the nest.",2
8660,Howard‰Ûªs Mother (voice),19," Little bird? You‰Ûªre almost 30, fly, for god‰Ûªs sake!",2
8661,Howard (voice),19," Fine, I‰Ûªll stay! You happy, crazy lady? I sure as hell hope so, because you‰Ûªre ruining my life!",2
8662,Leonard (into phone),19," Hey, Penny, it‰Ûªs Leonard. Good news, you can take your head out of the oven.",2
8663,Sheldon (removing hernia support),19, I guess I won‰Ûªt be needing this.,2
8664,Scene,19," The lobby, there are boxes everywhere and removal men are carrying them up the stairs.",2
8665,Sheldon,19," Oh, no, the new ones, they‰Ûªre here.",2
8666,Leonard,19," Stay calm, we don‰Ûªt know anything about them yet. What are you doing?",2
8667,Sheldon,19, I‰Ûªm checking for musical instruments. Does that sound like castanets to you?,2
8668,Leonard,19, The box says kitchen.,2
8669,Sheldon,19, So? Do cocaine smugglers write cocaine on the box?,2
8670,Blonde girl (arriving),19, Hello?,2
8671,Leonard,19, Hello.,2
8672,Sheldon,19, Hello.,2
8673,Blonde Girl,19, Hello.,2
8674,Leonard,19, Hello.,2
8675,Sheldon,19, Hello.,2
8676,Blonde Girl,19, I‰Ûªm Alicia. I‰Ûªm moving in upstairs.,2
8677,Leonard,19," That is so great. Oh, I‰Ûªm Leonard, I live downstairs. Upstairs from here, but under you. Not under you per se, but under your apartment.",2
8678,Alicia,19, That‰Ûªs nice.,2
8679,Leonard,19," Yeah, it is.",2
8680,Sheldon,19," If that concludes your faltering attempt to mate, hello.",2
8681,Alicia,19, Hello.,2
8682,Sheldon,19, Hello. On a scale of one to ten how light of foot would you describe yourself with one being not cat-like at all and ten being freakishly feline?,2
8683,Alicia,19, Freakishly feline?,2
8684,Sheldon,19, Is that your answer or do you not understand the question? We‰Ûªll come back to that one.,2
8685,Leonard,19, Sheldon‰Û_,2
8686,Sheldon,19," Hang on. Are you now or have you ever been a salsa, Irish folk or break-dancer?",2
8687,Alicia,19, No.,2
8688,Leonard,19, You‰Ûªre making her uncomfortable.,2
8689,Sheldon,19," Oh, I‰Ûªm sorry. Well, if it helps you feel any better you‰Ûªre doing very well so far. Next question, are you fertile?",2
8690,Alicia,19, What?!,2
8691,Sheldon,19, I‰Ûªm trying to determine whether crying infants above my head are a possibility.,2
8692,Alicia,19, I have no immediate plans.,2
8693,Sheldon,19," If that changes, let me know. And finally, area rugs, pro or con?",2
8694,Alicia,19, Pro?,2
8695,Sheldon,19, Alicia?,2
8696,Alicia,19, Yes?,2
8697,Sheldon,19, Welcome to the building.,2
8698,Scene,19, The stairs,2
8699,Alicia,19,"Thanks so much for helping me, Leonard.",2
8700,Leonard,19, Thank you so much for giving me the opportunity to help.,2
8701,Penny (exiting apartment),19," Oh, hey, guys.",2
8702,Leonard,19," Hey, Penny. this is Alicia, our new neighbour.",2
8703,Penny,19, Hi.,2
8704,Alicia,19, Hi.,2
8705,Leonard,19, I‰Ûªm helping.,2
8706,Penny,19, I can see.,2
8707,Sheldon,19," Alicia‰Ûªs non-musical, childless and pro-rug. She‰Ûªs still on probation, of course, but I like her.",2
8708,Alicia,19, Cool t-shirt.,2
8709,Penny,19," Oh, yeah, I don‰Ûªt usually dress like this. I‰Ûªm going jogging.",2
8710,Sheldon,19, You don‰Ûªt jog.,2
8711,Penny,19, I can start.,2
8712,Sheldon,19," True, but the more likely explanation for your attire is that you‰Ûªre out of clean clothes again.",2
8713,Penny,19," Thank you, Sheldon.",2
8714,Sheldon,19," You‰Ûªre welcome, Penny.",2
8715,Alicia,19," Please, you look cute. I‰Ûªm dressed like a slob today, too.",2
8716,Leonard,19, I think you look fantastic.,2
8717,Alicia,19," This one‰Ûªs a player, huh?",2
8718,Penny,19," Oh, yeah, be careful.",2
8719,Alicia,19, Thanks for the warning.,2
8720,Penny,19, Okay.,2
8721,Alicia,19, I‰Ûªll see you around.,2
8722,Penny,19," See ya. I‰Ûªm dressed like a slob today, too.",2
8723,Sheldon,19," Oh, mimicry. I enjoy mimicry. I‰Ûªve been working on Admiral Ackbar from Return of the Jedi. ‰ÛÏIt‰Ûªs a trap.‰Û You have to imagine me with a giant squid head. ‰ÛÏIt‰Ûªs a trap. It‰Ûªs a trap. It‰Ûªs a trap.‰Û",2
8724,Scene,19, The apartment. Sheldon is writing on an imaginary board. There is a knock on the door.,2
8725,Sheldon,19, Come.,2
8726,Penny (entering),19, Hey.,2
8727,Sheldon,19," Congratulations, I see you did your laundry.",2
8728,Penny,19," Well, sort of.",2
8729,Sheldon,19, How does one sort of‰Û_,2
8730,Penny,19," I bought new clothes, okay? Is Leonard around?",2
8731,Sheldon,19, He‰Ûªs upstairs at Alicia‰Ûªs.,2
8732,Penny,19," Oh. all right, that‰Ûªs cool, no biggie. He said he‰Ûªd help me set up my printer, but I guess I can wait. What exactly is he doing up there?",2
8733,Sheldon,19," In what I can only perceive as a tactical move to destroy me, he is with Wolowitz and Koothrappali setting up her stereo.",2
8734,Penny,19," Oh, they‰Ûªre all up there, huh? Hmm, typical.",2
8735,Sheldon,19," It‰Ûªs axiomatically atypical. Up until recently, they did not know Alicia, and had no encounters with her in a previous location. They never went upstairs to visit the former tenants, so your characterization of their behaviour as typical Is demonstrably fallacious.",2
8736,Penny,19," Okay, now I see the giant squid head. (Leaves)",2
8737,Sheldon,19," Oh, great! now, I have to start all over again. (Rubs out imaginary workings)",2
8738,Scene,19, Alicia‰Ûªs apartment.,2
8739,Howard,19," Yeah, I thought about renting this apartment, but I‰Ûªm really more of a downtown loft kind of guy.",2
8740,Alicia,19, Cool. so are you in a loft now?,2
8741,Howard,19," Oh, actually I‰Ûªm, uh, living with a woman in Altadena. Purely platonic, she‰Ûªs also my maid.",2
8742,Alicia,19, Sounds like a sweet deal.,2
8743,Howard,19," I won‰Ûªt lie, it‰Ûªs pretty dope.",2
8744,Penny (arriving),19, Hello?,2
8745,Alicia,19," Oh, hey.",2
8746,Penny,19," Hey, I just wanted to bring you a little housewarming gift.",2
8747,Alicia,19," That is so sweet. Come on in, let‰Ûªs open it.",2
8748,Penny,19, Great.,2
8749,Alicia,19, Nice dress.,2
8750,Penny,19," Oh, this? I‰Ûªm dressed like a slob today.",2
8751,Alicia,19, The guys have been helping me set up my sound system. I‰Ûªve never had such good-looking technical support.,2
8752,Howard,19," Oh, pish-posh. (Raj whispers to him) I don‰Ûªt know, it means shucks. (Raj whispers again) Shucks means shucks. Let one go once in a while.",2
8753,Leonard,19," Hey, uh, penny, you want to hear something awesome?",2
8754,Penny,19, Yeah.,2
8755,Leonard,19," Alicia is an actress, just like you.",2
8756,Penny,19, That is so awesome.,2
8757,Alicia,19," Well, trying to be, but it‰Ûªs so hard.",2
8758,Penny,19," Yeah, I know, tell me about it.",2
8759,Alicia,19," I‰Ûªve been out here three months, and all I‰Ûªve gotten is a couple of national commercials and this recurring thing on a soap.",2
8760,Penny,19," That‰Ûªs why I work at the Cheesecake Factory, I‰Ûªm holding out for the right part.",2
8761,Leonard,19," Alicia, what do you want as your default setting for DVDs, 5.1 Dolby or DTS?",2
8762,Alicia,19," Whatever you think is best, cutie.",2
8763,Leonard,19," Well, DTS has more low end, so‰Û_ okay.",2
8764,Penny,19," Uh, hey, guys, guys, you will really appreciate this, I read the best science joke on the internet. Alicia, you won‰Ûªt get it, but it‰Ûªs right up their alley. Anyway, so, this physicist goes into an ice cream parlour every week and orders an ice cream sundae for himself, and then offers one to the empty stool sitting next to him. This goes on for a while until the owner finally asks him what he‰Ûªs doing. The man says, ‰ÛÏwell, I‰Ûªm a physicist, and quantum mechanics teaches us that it is possible for the matter above this stool to spontaneously turn into a beautiful woman who might accept my offer and fall in love with me.‰Û The owner then says, ‰ÛÏwell, lots of single, beautiful women come in here every day, why don‰Ûªt you buy an ice cream for one of them, and they might fall in love with you?‰Û And the physicist says, ‰ÛÏyeah, but what are the odds of that happening?‰Û",2
8765,Leonard,19," It‰Ûªs a little insulting, don‰Ûªt you think?",2
8766,Penny,19, How would I know? I‰Ûªm not even sure I get it.,2
8767,Alicia,19," Hey, Leonard? If you‰Ûªre done with the DVD player, can you set up my printer?",2
8768,Leonard,19," Uh, yeah, I‰Ûªd love to.",2
8769,Penny,19," Uh, hey, maybe when you‰Ûªre done with her printer, you could set up mine. You know, like you promised a week ago.",2
8770,Leonard,19," Yeah, I‰Ûªll get to it, don‰Ûªt nag me.",2
8771,Raj (drinking some wine),19, Hello there,2
8772,Scene,19, The apartment. Penny walks in without knocking and collapses on the sofa.,2
8773,Sheldon,19," Who is it? Oh hello, Penny, it‰Ûªs open, come in. Sarcasm.",2
8774,Penny,19," Well, they‰Ûªre all still up there.",2
8775,Sheldon,19," You think I can‰Ûªt hear them? Listen to that. Stomp, stomp, stomp. That‰Ûªs Wolowitz in his stacked heels that fool no one.",2
8776,Penny,19," I don‰Ûªt even know why I care. I don‰Ûªt care. All right, I cared enough to memorize that stupid joke, but that‰Ûªs all I care.",2
8777,Sheldon,19," You know, Penny, there‰Ûªs something that occurs in beehives you might find interesting. Occasionally, a new queen will arrive while the old queen is still in power. When this happens, the old queen must either locate to a new hive or engage in a battle to the death until only one queen remains.",2
8778,Penny,19," What are you saying, that I‰Ûªm threatened by Alicia? That I‰Ûªm like the old queen of the hive and it‰Ûªs just time for me to go?",2
8779,Sheldon,19, I‰Ûªm just talking about bees. They‰Ûªre on the discovery channel. What are you talking about?,2
8780,Penny,19, Bees. Aaah! I just got that physicist joke.,2
8781,Scene,19, The apartment.,2
8782,Leonard,19," Gee, Penny, thanks for buying us dinner.",2
8783,Howard,19," Yeah, what‰Ûªs the occasion?",2
8784,Penny,19," No, no occasion, just felt like getting some Chinese chow for my peeps.",2
8785,Sheldon,19," Did you remember to ask for the chicken with broccoli to be diced, not shredded?",2
8786,Penny,19, Yes.,2
8787,Sheldon,19, Even though the menu description specifies shredded?,2
8788,Penny,19, Yes.,2
8789,Sheldon,19," Brown rice, not white?",2
8790,Penny,19, Yes.,2
8791,Sheldon,19, You stop at the Korean grocery and get the good hot mustard?,2
8792,Penny,19, Yes.,2
8793,Sheldon,19, Did you pick up the low-sodium soy sauce from the market?,2
8794,Penny,19, Yes,2
8795,Sheldon,19," Good. See how it‰Ûªs done, Leonard?",2
8796,Penny,19," So, what do we got going on tonight, huh? Playing Halo watching Battlestar, drop some mentos in diet coke?",2
8797,Leonard,19, You want to watch Battlestar?,2
8798,Penny,19," What can I say? I got my geek on, boys.",2
8799,Howard (after Raj whispers to him),19," No, no, PMS is different. (There is a knock on the door. Leonard answers it.)",2
8800,Alicia,19," Oh, thank God you‰Ûªre home. I need help.",2
8801,Leonard,19, What‰Ûªs wrong?,2
8802,Alicia,19, I just got a callback to audition for CSI to play a hooker who gets killed.,2
8803,Leonard,19," Oh, I‰Ûªd watch that.",2
8804,Alicia,19," But my car is in the shop, and I have to be at Universal in forty-five minutes.",2
8805,Leonard,19," Okay, well, I‰Ûªll take you.",2
8806,Alicia,19," Oh, you‰Ûªre a lifesaver.",2
8807,Howard,19, I‰Ûªll run lines with you in the car.,2
8808,Alicia,19," Great. And afterward, I‰Ûªll take you all out for Chinese.",2
8809,Penny,19," Oh, actually, that‰Ûªs okay. we already have‰Û_",2
8810,Howard,19, Yum. Starving.,2
8811,Penny,19, ‰Û_chinese food right here.,2
8812,Sheldon,19," They‰Ûªre gone, Penny. They can‰Ûªt hear you.",2
8813,Penny,19," I cannot believe they‰Ûªre letting her just use them like that. I mean, anything she wants, they go panting after her like trained dogs. You know that just last week, she had Howard drive all the way to her uncle‰Ûªs house in Orange County to pick up her TV?",2
8814,Sheldon,19, You once had Leonard and me get your television from your ex-boyfriend.,2
8815,Penny,19," Apples and oranges here, Sheldon. I‰Ûªm telling you, that girl is a user, iceskating through the life on her looks, taking advantage of innocent weak-willed men, getting auditions for stupid network shows. It creams my corn.",2
8816,Sheldon,19, May I interject something here?,2
8817,Penny,19, Please.,2
8818,Sheldon,19, You got the wrong mustard.,2
8819,Scene,19, The laundry room. ,2
8820,Alicia,19, Hi.,2
8821,Penny,19,,2
8822,Alicia,19, Guess what? I got the part on CSI.,2
8823,Penny,19, Oh boy.,2
8824,Alicia,19, Something wrong?,2
8825,Penny,19," Uh, no. No, no, no, you know, congratulations, I think you‰Ûªll make a great hooker.",2
8826,Alicia,19," Thank you. Hey, I got to ask you something, how much do physicists make?",2
8827,Penny,19," Um, I don‰Ûªt know, I don‰Ûªt think a lot.",2
8828,Alicia,19," Yeah, that‰Ûªs what I figured. Well, got to run, the guys promised to set up my satellite dish and paint my bedroom. Yay!",2
8829,Penny,19," Um, hey, hey, can I talk to you about that for a second?",2
8830,Alicia,19, About what?,2
8831,Penny,19," Well, you know, it‰Ûªs just that Leonard and Howard and Raj, they aren‰Ûªt like other guys. They‰Ûªre special.",2
8832,Alicia,19," Okay, they‰Ûªre special, and?",2
8833,Penny,19," Oh, let‰Ûªs see, how can I explain this, um, they don‰Ûªt know how to use their shields.",2
8834,Alicia,19, Shields?,2
8835,Penny,19," Yeah, you know, like in Star Trek, when you‰Ûªre in battle and you raise the shields? Where the hell did that come from? Anyways, um, you know how guys like this are, so, please don‰Ûªt take advantage of them.",2
8836,Alicia,19, Who says I‰Ûªm taking advantage of them?,2
8837,Penny,19," Come on, they‰Ûªre doing everything for you, because you‰Ûªre leading them on.",2
8838,Alicia,19, So I let them do stuff for me. They‰Ûªre happy. I get stuff. Who cares? And how‰Ûªs it any different from what you do?,2
8839,Penny,19, Excuse me?,2
8840,Alicia,19, I‰Ûªve seen you around them. Are you pretending like you don‰Ûªt do the exact same thing?,2
8841,Penny,19," Okay, lady, you are way out of line.",2
8842,Alicia,19," Oh, I‰Ûªm out of line?",2
8843,Penny,19," Yeah, you‰Ûªre out of line.",2
8844,Alicia,19," Well, what are you going to do about it, bitch?",2
8845,Scene,19, Outside the building.,2
8846,Raj,19," I like green lantern, I‰Ûªm just saying it‰Ûªs pretty lame that He can be defeated by the colour yellow.",2
8847,Sheldon,19, Only the modern green lantern is vulnerable to yellow.,2
8848,Leonard,19, Golden age green lantern was vulnerable to wood.,2
8849,Raj,19," Great, so I can take them both out with a number-two pencil?",2
8850,Howard,19," Oh, my God! Girl fight! (He grabs Leonard)",2
8851,Leonard,19, What are you doing?,2
8852,Howard,19, I know you. you‰Ûªre stupid enough to break it up.,2
8853,Scene,19, The apartment. Penny has a black eye.,2
8854,Howard,19, May I say you look very comely tonight?,2
8855,Penny,19, Thank you.,2
8856,Howard,19," You‰Ûªre right, this filly‰Ûªs been broken.",2
8857,Sheldon (as music comes down through ceiling),19," You set it on DTS, didn‰Ûªt you?",2
8858,Leonard,19," I had to, she called me cutie.",2
8859,Howard,19," According to Alicia‰Ûªs facebook page, she‰Ûªs hooking up with one of the producers on CSI.",2
8860,Penny,19," Well, dead whore on TV, live one in real life.",2
8861,Sheldon,19," Oh, great now she‰Ûªs jumping up and down on the bed.",2
8862,Scene,20, The apartment.,2
8863,Sheldon,20, Hu-u-u-uh‰Û_. Hu-u-u-uh!,2
8864,Leonard,20, Problem?,2
8865,Sheldon,20, This is Thai food.,2
8866,Howard,20, Here we go.,2
8867,Sheldon,20, We don‰Ûªt have Thai food on Thursday. We have pizza on Thursday.,2
8868,Leonard,20," Yes, but we all agreed that the third Thursday of every month would be Anything Can Happen Thursday.",2
8869,Sheldon,20," Well apparently the news didn‰Ûªt reach my digestive system, which, when startled, has its own version of Anything Can Happen Thursday.",2
8870,Howard,20," Come on, the whole idea behind Anything Can Happen Thursday is to get out of this rut we‰Ûªve been in lately.",2
8871,Sheldon,20," Rut? I think you mean consistency. And if we‰Ûªre going to abandon that, then why even call it Thursday? Let‰Ûªs call it Quonko Day and divide it into 29 hours of 17 minutes apiece, and celebrate it by sacrificing a goat to the mighty god Ra.",2
8872,Raj,20, I could go for some goat.,2
8873,Leonard,20," Sheldon, we agreed we‰Ûªd do something different tonight.",2
8874,Sheldon,20, All right. Let‰Ûªs go to the comic book store.,2
8875,Raj,20, We went to the comic book store last night.,2
8876,Sheldon,20," Last night was Wednesday. Wednesday is comic book night. Tonight, we‰Ûªll be going on Thursday, because it‰Ûªs Anything Can Happen Thursday.",2
8877,Leonard,20," Way to think outside but pressed right up against the box, Sheldon.",2
8878,Raj,20, So what are we going to do tonight?,2
8879,Howard,20," If I may proffer a suggestion, in bars all across this great nation of ours, Thursday night is Ladies‰Ûª Night. Which means, as the evening progresses, we will get better looking courtesy of 99 cent margaritas and two-for-one Jell-O shots.",2
8880,Leonard,20," Come on, Howard, the odds of us picking up girls in a bar are practically zero.",2
8881,Howard,20, Really? Are you familiar with the Drake Equation?,2
8882,Sheldon,20," The one that estimates the odds of making contact with extraterrestrials by calculating the product of an increasingly restrictive series of fractional values such as those stars with planets, and those planets likely to develop life? N equals R times FP times NE times FL times FI times FC times L?",2
8883,Howard,20," Yeah, that one. You can modify it to calculate our chances of having sex by changing the formula to use the number of single women in Los Angeles, the number of those who might find us attractive, and what I call the Wolowitz Coefficient.",2
8884,Raj,20, The Wolowitz Coefficient?,2
8885,Howard,20," Neediness times dress size squared. Crunching the numbers, I come up with a conservative 5,812 potential sex partners within a 40-mile radius.",2
8886,Leonard,20, You‰Ûªre joking.,2
8887,Howard,20," I‰Ûªm a horny engineer, Leonard. I never joke about math or sex.",2
8888,Raj,20," Well, what are we waiting for? Let‰Ûªs bounce, bitches.",2
8889,Leonard,20," You‰Ûªre right. It‰Ûªs Anything Can Happen Thursday, let‰Ûªs hit the clubs and meet hot women!",2
8890,Raj,20, Here we go. Lock up your daughters! We‰Ûªre going to hit it and quit it.,2
8891,Leonard,20, Or we could finish eating and go to the comic book store.,2
8892,Raj,20, Also a good plan.,2
8893,Howard,20," Alright, but next Anything Can Happen Thursday, we‰Ûªre definitely going to a bar.",2
8894,Leonard,20," Oh, absolutely.",2
8895,Raj,20," You heard that, Ladies‰Ûª Night ladies? We‰Ûªre eventually coming for you!",2
8896,Sheldon,20, Fascinating.,2
8897,Penny,20," Oh hey, guys, where‰Ûªre you headed?",2
8898,Sheldon,20," To the comic book store. You‰Ûªre probably thinking, the comic book store? On a Thursday? Why, I‰Ûªve fallen down the rabbit hole and into a land of madness. What you have failed to take into account, Penny, is that this is Anything Can Happen Thursday.",2
8899,Penny,20," You got me. While you‰Ûªre there, could pick me up a few comics for my nephew‰Ûªs birthday?",2
8900,Sheldon,20, I think you mean comic books. Comics are feeble attempts at humour featuring talking babies and anthropomorphized pets found traditionally in the optimistically named funny pages.,2
8901,Penny,20," Leonard, could you pick me up a few comics for my nephew‰Ûªs birthday?",2
8902,Leonard,20, Sure. What does he like?,2
8903,Penny,20," I don‰Ûªt know, he‰Ûªs 13. Just pick out anything.",2
8904,Sheldon,20," Just pick out anything? Maybe at the same time we can pick out a new suit for him without knowing his size, or pick out his career for him without knowing his aptitude, or pick out a new breakfast cereal without knowing his fibre requirements or his feelings about little marshmallows.",2
8905,Penny,20, Spider-Man. Get him Spider-Man.,2
8906,Sheldon,20," Amazing Spider-Man, Ultimate Spider-Man, Spectacular Spider-Man, The Marvelous Adventures of Spider-Man, Spider-Man 2099?",2
8907,Penny,20, Leonard?,2
8908,Leonard,20," You know this can go on all night, why don‰Ûªt you just come with us?",2
8909,Penny,20," Ugh, that‰Ûªs what I was trying to avoid.",2
8910,Sheldon,20," Oh, I forgot Sensational Spider-Man.",2
8911,Scene,20, The comic book store.,2
8912,Penny,20," Oh, what a cute, little store. Everybody‰Ûªs staring at me.",2
8913,Leonard,20," Don‰Ûªt worry, they‰Ûªre more scared of you than you are of them.",2
8914,Penny,20," Unlikely. Here, what about this one for my nephew?",2
8915,Sheldon,20, A superb choice.,2
8916,Penny,20," Oh, great.",2
8917,Sheldon,20," Yeah, provided he has already read Infinite Crisis and 52, and is familiar with the re-establishment of the DC multiverse.",2
8918,Penny,20, What‰Ûªs a multiverse?,2
8919,Sheldon,20, Get her out of here.,2
8920,Leonard,20," Come on, I‰Ûªll help you pick something.",2
8921,Raj,20, That‰Ûªs right. She‰Ûªs with us. Guys like that are so pathetic.,2
8922,Howard,20," Tell me about it. Look, a new Batman belt buckle.",2
8923,Store clerk,20," Oh, hey, Leonard. Can I help you find something?",2
8924,Leonard,20," Oh, hey, Stuart. This is Penny. She‰Ûªs looking for some comic books.",2
8925,Stuart,20," Oh, really. Blink twice if you‰Ûªre here against your will.",2
8926,Leonard,20," I think we‰Ûªre fine, Stuart.",2
8927,Stuart,20, Let me know if you need anything.,2
8928,Penny,20, Thanks. He seems like a nice guy.,2
8929,Leonard,20, You mean for someone who‰Ûªs into comic books?,2
8930,Penny,20," No, no, no, I just meant for‰Û_ yeah.",2
8931,Leonard,20," Penny, just because people appreciate comic books doesn‰Ûªt make them weirdos. Stuart‰Ûªs a terrific artist. He went to the Rhode Island School of Design.",2
8932,Penny,20, What about the guy over there in the superhero T-shirt tucked into his sweatpants?,2
8933,Leonard,20," Ah, yeah, that‰Ûªs Captain Sweatpants. He doesn‰Ûªt really help the point I‰Ûªm trying to make.",2
8934,Howard,20," Let it go, Sheldon.",2
8935,Sheldon,20, Why should I let it go? I saw it first.,2
8936,Howard,20," Yes, but I saw it from the front.",2
8937,Sheldon,20, A far less impressive feat.,2
8938,Howard,20," Oh, come on! I need this for my Batman collection.",2
8939,Sheldon,20, I need it for my Robin collection.,2
8940,Howard,20, Rock-Paper-Scissors-Lizard-Spock?,2
8941,Sheldon,20, Why would I gamble? It‰Ûªs mine. Let go.,2
8942,Howard,20, You let go.,2
8943,Sheldon,20," No, you!",2
8944,Leonard,20, Problem?,2
8945,Sheldon,20," Yes, he won‰Ûªt let go of my comic book.",2
8946,Howard,20, It‰Ûªs my comic book!,2
8947,Sheldon,20," Leonard, we need a ruling.",2
8948,Leonard,20," Uh, cut it in half?",2
8949,Penny,20, Excuse me.,2
8950,Stuart,20, Hello again.,2
8951,Penny,20, Hi. What would you recommend as a present for a 13-year-old boy?,2
8952,Stuart,20," A 13-year-old girl. But if you‰Ûªre dead set on a comic book, try this.",2
8953,Penny,20," Oh, Hellblazer. What‰Ûªs this about?",2
8954,Stuart,20," A morally ambiguous confidence man who smokes, has lung cancer and is tormented by the spirits of the undead.",2
8955,Penny,20," Well, if that doesn‰Ûªt make me the favourite aunt, I don‰Ûªt know what will. Is this me?",2
8956,Stuart,20, Depends. Do you like it?,2
8957,Penny,20, It‰Ûªs really good.,2
8958,Stuart,20," Yes, that‰Ûªs you.",2
8959,Penny,20," That‰Ûªs so sweet, but what if I didn‰Ûªt like it?",2
8960,Stuart,20," It‰Ûªd still be you, but I‰Ûªd feel like an idiot.",2
8961,Leonard,20, I don‰Ûªt believe it. Stuart‰Ûªs putting the moves on Penny.,2
8962,Howard,20, I have got to learn how to draw. Hey!,2
8963,Sheldon,20," Once again, defeated by your own prurient interests.",2
8964,Raj,20," Guys, have you seen Stuart all up in Penny‰Ûªs business over there?",2
8965,Leonard,20," Nobody‰Ûªs up in anybody‰Ûªs business, let‰Ûªs just buy our stuff and go.",2
8966,Penny,20," Okay, you‰Ûªve got my number, now, give me the picture.",2
8967,Stuart,20," You drive a hard bargain, but here.",2
8968,Penny,20," All right. So, um, just give me a call.",2
8969,Sheldon,20," So, Leonard, how are you enjoying Anything Can Happen Thursday?",2
8970,Scene,20, The apartment. Sheldon has the comic book. ,2
8971,Sheldon,20," Look at that, that‰Ûªs a dent. Thank you, Howard Ham-Fisted Wolowitz. Did you just shut the TV off in the middle of the classic Deep Space Nine/Star Trek The Original Series Trouble With Tribbles crossover episode?",2
8972,Leonard,20, Apparently so.,2
8973,Sheldon,20, Are you ill?,2
8974,Leonard,20, No.,2
8975,Sheldon,20, All right. Then is it fair to say that you‰Ûªre experiencing some sort of emotional turmoil over the events involving Penny earlier this evening?,2
8976,Leonard,20, When did you pick up on that?,2
8977,Sheldon,20," A moment ago, when you turned off the TV in the middle of }during the classic Deep Space Nine/Star Trek The Original Series Trouble With Tribbles crossover episode. Would you like some advice?",2
8978,Leonard,20," Sure, why not?",2
8979,Sheldon,20," Then, this is the perfect time to launch a blog with an interactive comments section.",2
8980,Leonard,20," Gee, thanks a lot.",2
8981,Sheldon,20, Would you rather I offer my personal insight?,2
8982,Leonard,20, I don‰Ûªt need any insights. I just want to know why Penny‰Ûªs more interested in Stuart than me. We‰Ûªre practically the same guy.,2
8983,Sheldon,20," Oh, I disagree. Stuart is taller, artistic, self-employed and, most significantly, he gets 45 percent off comic books.",2
8984,Leonard,20," You‰Ûªre right, I really should be asking strangers on the Internet.",2
8985,Sheldon,20, My original point.,2
8986,Scene,20, The stairs.,2
8987,Sheldon,20," Chinese food, vintage video games. After the nightmare of Anything Can Happen Thursday, this is Friday night the way it was meant to be.",2
8988,Howard,20, Who‰Ûªs up for Sheldon-Free Saturday?,2
8989,Penny (coming out of apartment),20," Oh, hey guys.",2
8990,Leonard,20," Hey, Penny‰Û_ and Stuart, hey Stuart.",2
8991,Stuart,20," Hey, guys.",2
8992,Howard,20, So what are you kids up to?,2
8993,Penny,20," Uh, Stuart has a piece in an art show that‰Ûªs opening tonight.",2
8994,Leonard,20," And you guys are going together, great‰Û_",2
8995,Stuart,20, It is great. Really great. Freaking awesome. What are you guys doing?,2
8996,Penny,20," It‰Ûªs Friday night, that means Chinese food and vintage video games, right?",2
8997,Sheldon,20," Vintage doesn‰Ûªt even begin to describe what we have planned. Tonight, we are playing the classic 1980 interactive text adventure, Zork. It‰Ûªs the buggy beta version.",2
8998,Penny,20," Wow, Zork. Well, you guys have fun.",2
8999,Stuart,20," Yeah, see you guys.",2
9000,Howard,20," See you, Stuart.",2
9001,Leonard,20," Hey, Howard?",2
9002,Howard,20, Yes.,2
9003,Leonard,20, Take me to a bar with women.,2
9004,Howard,20, Really?,2
9005,Leonard,20, Yeah.,2
9006,Howard,20, Okay! Let me just go inside and slip off my underwear.,2
9007,Leonard,20, Why?,2
9008,Howard,20," Well, if I get lucky, I don‰Ûªt want to be caught in my Aquaman briefs.",2
9009,Leonard (to Raj),20, Do you‰Û_? (Raj checks his underwear) Let‰Ûªs go.,2
9010,Scene,20, A bar.,2
9011,Raj,20," May I have a grasshopper with a little umbrella, please?",2
9012,Howard,20," No, he may not.",2
9013,Raj,20, Why?,2
9014,Howard,20, I‰Ûªm not sitting here with a guy drinking a grasshopper with a little umbrella.,2
9015,Raj,20, Fine. I‰Ûªll have a chocolate martini.,2
9016,Howard,20, Wrong again!,2
9017,Raj,20," Come on, you know I can‰Ûªt talk to women unless I‰Ûªm lit up like the Hindu festival of Diwali.",2
9018,Howard,20," Look, there are plenty of bars in Los Angeles where you can order grasshoppers and chocolate martinis, but you wouldn‰Ûªt have to because there are no women in them.",2
9019,Raj,20, Gotcha. I‰Ûªll have a Brandy Alexander.,2
9020,Howard,20," All right, the Three Musketeers just became the Dynamic Duo.",2
9021,Leonard,20, Should we talk to some of these women?,2
9022,Howard,20," It‰Ûªs way too early in the night for that. See, first we let the lawyers and the jocks thin the herd, and then we go after the weak and the old and the lame.",2
9023,Leonard,20, That‰Ûªs your system?,2
9024,Howard,20," That‰Ûªs my system. Oh, and if you spot a chick with a Seeing Eye dog, she‰Ûªs mine.",2
9025,Scene,20, The stairwell.,2
9026,Penny,20, Oh come on. I think it‰Ûªs nice that Captain Sweatpants showed up to your art opening.,2
9027,Stuart,20," Yeah, it would have been nicer if he hadn‰Ûªt touched all the cheese.",2
9028,Penny,20," Um, you know, it‰Ûªs kind of early. Do you want to maybe come in for some coffee or something?",2
9029,Stuart,20," Oh, gee, it‰Ûªs a little late for coffee, isn‰Ûªt it?",2
9030,Penny,20," Oh, you think coffee, means coffee, that is so sweet. Come on, I think I have decaf.",2
9031,Sheldon,20," Oh, good, Stuart, I thought I heard your voice. Do you have a moment?",2
9032,Stuart,20," Uh, yeah, I guess.",2
9033,Penny,20," Sheldon, we‰Ûªre a little busy here, so‰Û_",2
9034,Sheldon,20, What are you doing?,2
9035,Stuart,20, We‰Ûªre having coffee.,2
9036,Sheldon,20, Isn‰Ûªt it a little late for coffee?,2
9037,Stuart,20, It‰Ûªs okay. She thinks she has decaf.,2
9038,Penny,20, I‰Ûªll just go look for it.,2
9039,Stuart,20, What‰Ûªs up?,2
9040,Sheldon,20," Well, I‰Ûªve spent the last three hours in an online debate in the DC Comics Batman chatroom, and I need your help.",2
9041,Stuart,20, Oh yeah. Those guys can be very stubborn. What‰Ûªs the topic?,2
9042,Sheldon,20," I am asserting, in the event that Batman‰Ûªs death proves permanent, that original Robin, Dick Grayson, is the logical successor to the Bat Cowl.",2
9043,Stuart,20," Ooh, Sheldon, I‰Ûªm afraid you couldn‰Ûªt be more wrong.",2
9044,Sheldon,20, More wrong? Wrong is an absolute state and not subject to gradation.,2
9045,Stuart,20," Of course it is. It‰Ûªs a little wrong to say a tomato is a vegetable, it‰Ûªs very wrong to say it‰Ûªs a suspension bridge. But returning to the original issue, Dick Grayson became Nightwing, a superhero in his own right. Batman 2 has to be the second Robin, Jason Todd.",2
9046,Sheldon,20, Has to be? Has to be? I hope you‰Ûªre being deliberately provocative.,2
9047,Penny,20, I found the decaf!,2
9048,Stuart,20," Oh, great!",2
9049,Sheldon,20," Yeah, herbal tea for me, please.",2
9050,Scene,20, The bar.,2
9051,Raj,20, Barkeep! Alexander me.,2
9052,Leonard,20, How about those two?,2
9053,Howard,20," Nah, they‰Ûªre eating peanuts, and my allergies, one kiss would put me in Cedar-Sinai for a week.",2
9054,Leonard,20, What about the ones in the corner?,2
9055,Howard,20," Possible, very possible. Do you want the one in the whiplash collar or the one who keeps blinking?",2
9056,Leonard,20, I think Blinky‰Ûªs cute.,2
9057,Howard,20," You got it, sir.",2
9058,Leonard,20," Wait, so we just go over there?",2
9059,Howard,20," No, we have a little prep work to do. Put this in your mouth. We walk past them, you stumble a bit. I say, sorry, my friend‰Ûªs had a little too much, and then I start to pull it out of your mouth and say, a little too much fun. Get it? I mean, they‰Ûªre laughing, we‰Ûªre laughing, and then we get them up to about a .15 blood alcohol level, and tell them we‰Ûªre millionaires.",2
9060,Leonard,20, What else you got?,2
9061,Howard,20, Depends. Are you willing to sit on my lap and pretend to be a ventriloquist dummy?,2
9062,Leonard,20, No.,2
9063,Howard,20," I can‰Ûªt sit on your lap, you don‰Ûªt know the routine.",2
9064,Scene,20, Penny‰Ûªs apartment.,2
9065,Stuart,20," I‰Ûªm sorry, but you‰Ûªre obviously stuck in a pre-Zero Hour DC universe.",2
9066,Sheldon,20, Of course I am. Removing Joe Chill as the killer of Batman‰Ûªs parents effectively deprived him of his raison d‰ÛªÌ»tre.,2
9067,Stuart,20," Okay, you can throw all the French around you want, it doesn‰Ûªt make you right.",2
9068,Sheldon,20, Au contraire.,2
9069,Stuart,20," Plus, you‰Ûªre forgetting that the Infinite Crisis storyline restored Joe Chill to the Batman mythology.",2
9070,Sheldon,20, I am forgetting nothing and I resent your tone.,2
9071,Stuart,20," Okay, look, Sheldon, it‰Ûªs late and I‰Ûªve got to get some sleep.",2
9072,Sheldon,20," So, I win.",2
9073,Stuart,20," No, I‰Ûªm tired.",2
9074,Sheldon,20," So, I win.",2
9075,Stuart,20, Fine. You win.,2
9076,Sheldon,20," Darn tootin‰Ûª, I win.",2
9077,Stuart,20," Penny, I really had a terrific time. Penny?",2
9078,Sheldon,20," No, no, no, no, don‰Ûªt wake her. She‰Ûªll maul you like a rabid wolverine.",2
9079,Stuart,20," You know, I don‰Ûªt think that was decaf.",2
9080,Scene,20, The bar.,2
9081,Howard,20," Wait, is this your card or isn‰Ûªt it? Trust me, this was their card.",2
9082,Leonard,20, I thought you were good at this. You‰Ûªre always talking about how you go to bars and meet women.,2
9083,Howard,20," I do, all the time.",2
9084,Leonard,20," Well, what happened? We‰Ûªve been sitting here all night and the longest conversation you‰Ûªve had with a woman was when your mom called.",2
9085,Howard,20," Wow, you‰Ûªre just going to make me come out and say it, aren‰Ûªt you?",2
9086,Leonard,20, Say what?,2
9087,Howard,20, You‰Ûªre weighing me down. I‰Ûªm a falcon who hunts better solo.,2
9088,Leonard,20, Fine. I‰Ûªll sit here. You take flight and hunt.,2
9089,Howard,20," Don‰Ûªt be ridiculous, you can‰Ûªt just tell a falcon when to hunt.",2
9090,Leonard,20," Actually, you can. There‰Ûªs a whole sport built around it. Falconry.",2
9091,Howard,20," Shut up. Let‰Ûªs just get Koothrappali and go. (They turn to see Raj with his tongue down the throat of a ‰ÛÏlarger lady‰Û by the bar.) Lucky bastard. It‰Ûªs got to be that stupid accent of his. (To a girl nearby) Hello. I am Sanjay Wolowitz from Bombay. Okay, I‰Ûªm stumped.",2
9092,Scene,20, Raj‰Ûªs apartment. He wakes up clutched in the arms of the large lady. Tries to get away. She clutches him tighter. He shrugs and goes back to sleep. ,2
9093,Scene,21, The apartment.,2
9094,Howard,21," Okay, are you from Star Wars universe?",2
9095,Leonard,21, Yes,2
9096,Howard,21, Were you in the original trilogy?,2
9097,Leonard,21, Yes,2
9098,Howard,21, Is there a picture of you in my wallet wearing a metal bikini?,2
9099,Leonard,21," God, I hope not. And no, I‰Ûªm not Princess Leia.",2
9100,Raj,21," Oh, okay, okay, my turn. Are you in the six Star Wars movies?",2
9101,Leonard,21, Yes,2
9102,Raj,21, Interesting. Are you a Droid?,2
9103,Leonard,21, Yes,2
9104,Raj,21, Do you kind of look like a shiny Sheldon?,2
9105,Leonard,21, Yes,2
9106,Raj,21, C3PO.,2
9107,Leonard,21, You got it.,2
9108,Sheldon,21," That‰Ûªs preposterous. I do not resemble C3PO. Don‰Ûªt get me wrong, I‰Ûªm flattered, I just don‰Ûªt see it.",2
9109,Howard (phone rings),21," Leslie Winkle. You‰Ûªve reached friends with benefits. For a booty call, press one now.",2
9110,Sheldon,21," What exactly does that expression mean, friends with benefits? Does he provide her with health insurance?",2
9111,Leonard,21," No. Look, imagine you maintained a friendship with someone you had sex with, but you were free to date whoever you wanted.",2
9112,Sheldon,21," I‰Ûªm sorry, I can‰Ûªt imagine any of that.",2
9113,Leonard,21," Alright, back to the game.",2
9114,Sheldon,21," I believe it‰Ûªs my turn, you may begin your questions whenever you‰Ûªre ready.",2
9115,Raj,21, Are you Spock?,2
9116,Sheldon,21, I don‰Ûªt like this game.,2
9117,Howard,21," So, where were we?",2
9118,Raj,21, Aren‰Ûªt you leaving for your booty call?,2
9119,Howard,21," No, it was something else. Why does everything have to be about sex with you? Come on. Who‰Ûªs turn is it?",2
9120,Leonard,21, We were up to you.,2
9121,Howard,21," Great, just start.",2
9122,Leonard,21," Okay, let‰Ûªs see. Are you from a TV series?",2
9123,Howard,21, She dumped me!,2
9124,Sheldon,21," I bet he‰Ûªs someone from Babylon 5, we‰Ûªre never going to guess.",2
9125,Scene,21, A few moments later.,2
9126,Raj,21," What happened with Leslie, why did she dump you?",2
9127,Howard,21," I don‰Ûªt know. She just said Howard, momma‰Ûªs a rolling stone. And then her call waiting beeped and she was gone.",2
9128,Sheldon,21, I don‰Ûªt understand. If you were in a non-emotional relationship then why are you having åÊwhat appears be an emotional response?,2
9129,Leonard,21," Sheldon, he obviously had feelings for her.",2
9130,Howard,21," Of course I had feelings for her, I saw her naked for God‰Ûªs sake!",2
9131,Leonard,21," Okay, uh look, you just need to get your mind off it. Do you want to go to the comic book store? Maybe go see a movie?",2
9132,Howard,21, I don‰Ûªt want to go anywhere.,2
9133,Sheldon,21," You know, I‰Ûªm given to understand that there is an entire city in Nevada designed specifically to help people like Howard forget their problems. WhereåÊ you can replace them with new problems such as alcoholism, gambling addiction and sexually transmitted diseases.",2
9134,Raj,21," Is it me, or was that Sheldon‰Ûªs way of saying Vegas baby!",2
9135,Leonard,21," I‰Ûªve never been there, have you?",2
9136,Raj,21, Me? No. I just got Vegas baby from Vince Vaughn in Swingers. .,2
9137,Howard,21," It could be fun. I know my weekend‰Ûªs wide open, now that‰Û_",2
9138,Leonard,21," Okay, then let‰Ûªs do this, lets go to Las Vegas.",2
9139,Howard,21, Now? Right now?,2
9140,Leonard,21," Why not? People do things right now all the time. Why can‰Ûªt we be right now people too. Go home, pack a bag and we‰Ûªll be right now people. I have to stop at the drug store to refill a prescription, but after that we‰Ûªll go right now.",2
9141,Raj,21," What do you say, Howard?",2
9142,Howard,21, I say Vegas baby!,2
9143,Raj,21, What are you going to tell your mother?,2
9144,Howard,21," Sea World, baby!",2
9145,Leonard,21," Hey, Sheldon, are you coming?",2
9146,Sheldon,21, I‰Ûªd rather have a blowfly lay eggs and hatch larvae in my auditory canal.,2
9147,Leonard,21," Great, we‰Ûªll bring you back a tee-shirt.",2
9148,Scene,21, The lobby.,2
9149,Sheldon,21," Thank you. Hello, neighbour.",2
9150,Penny,21," Hello, Sheldon.",2
9151,Sheldon,21, And how are you doing this fine evening?,2
9152,Penny,21, Great.,2
9153,Sheldon,21, Good. I‰Ûªm glad.,2
9154,Penny,21, Really? Are you drunk?,2
9155,Sheldon,21," I‰Ûªm just in a good mood. While my compatriots are in Las Vegas, I will be enjoying a blissful evening in my personal Fortress of Solitude.",2
9156,Penny,21," That‰Ûªs Superman‰Ûªs big ice thing, right?",2
9157,Sheldon,21," Do you know, I‰Ûªm such a good mood, I‰Ûªm actually finding your tenuous grasp of the English language folksy and charming today.",2
9158,Penny,21," Mmm, what smells so good?",2
9159,Sheldon,21," That is the intoxicating aroma of Kadhai Paneer, a perfect culinary representation of the freedom this evening holds. Not only is it Indian cuisine, which Koothrappali loathes, it contains a generous helping of peanuts, which would reduce Wolowitz to a wheezing 97 pound blister. And finally, it‰Ûªs main ingredient is Paneer, a farmer‰Ûªs cheese which would cause Leonard to render any room uninhabitable within minutes.",2
9160,Penny,21," Yum. Well, enjoy your big evening.",2
9161,Sheldon,21," Penny. I realize you are also on your own tonight, so if at some point you find yourself with nothing to do, please do not disturb me.",2
9162,Penny,21," Have fun, Sheldon.",2
9163,Sheldon,21," Oh, I shall. (Sings Superman theme while searching his pockets.) No!",2
9164,Penny,21," What‰Ûªs wrong, Superman? Locked out of your big ice thingy?",2
9165,Scene,21, A Vegas bathroom.,2
9166,Raj,21," Look at this, mouthwash, lotion, body wash, shampoo and conditioner together in one tiny bottle. I love Las Vegas.",2
9167,Leonard,21," Howard, could I borrow some after shave?",2
9168,Howard,21," Black case, top compartment.",2
9169,Leonard,21, That is a lot of cologne.,2
9170,Howard,21," First row are your musks, second is wood, leathers and botanicals, third is assorted pheromones, tread lightly.",2
9171,Raj (finding a large quantity of condoms),21," That‰Ûªs the spirit, Howard. Yes, we can.",2
9172,Leonard,21," Come on, let‰Ûªs go.",2
9173,Howard,21," You guys go ahead, I just have to finish up an email.",2
9174,Leonard,21," That‰Ûªs not an email, that‰Ûªs Leslie‰Ûªs facebook page.",2
9175,Howard,21," Okay, fine, I‰Ûªm checking her facebook page, look at her status update, she‰Ûªs saying she dumped me, people need to know I dumped her.",2
9176,Raj,21, But she did dump you.,2
9177,Howard,21," Grow up, Raj,there‰Ûªs no place for truth on the internet. Just go, I‰Ûªll catch up with you.",2
9178,Leonard,21, Alright.,2
9179,Raj,21," Oh, we should have a plan in case one of us gets lucky.",2
9180,Leonard,21," Okay, uh, if I get lucky I‰Ûªll take her to my stately manor outside Gotham City, and if you get lucky, I‰Ûªll sleep on the moon.",2
9181,Raj,21, Sounds like a plan.,2
9182,Scene,21, Penny‰Ûªs apartment. ,2
9183,Penny,21," Hang on, I think the emergency key is around here somewhere.",2
9184,Sheldon,21, We have a bowl. Our keys go in a bowl. You should get a bowl.,2
9185,Penny,21," So, how did the beautiful mind of Sheldon Cooper forget his key in the first place.",2
9186,Sheldon,21, I left them in the bowl.,2
9187,Penny,21, Oh-oh. I just remembered where the emergency key is.,2
9188,Sheldon,21, Where?,2
9189,Penny,21, In your apartment.,2
9190,Sheldon,21, What‰Ûªs it doing in my apartment?,2
9191,Penny,21," Well, I went in there a few weeks ago when you guys weren‰Ûªt home, and I forgot it there.",2
9192,Sheldon,21, You were in my‰Û_ why would you‰Û_ what are you saying?,2
9193,Penny,21," It‰Ûªs not a big deal, I was making coffee and I ran out of milk.",2
9194,Sheldon,21, You‰Ûªre the milk thief! Leonard said I was crazy but I knew that carton felt lighter.,2
9195,Penny,21," Alright, Sheldon, let‰Ûªs just calm down and we‰Ûªll call the building manager, he‰Ûªll come open your door, you just eat your dinner here while you‰Ûªre waiting.",2
9196,Sheldon,21, Eat? My dinner? In your apartment?,2
9197,Penny,21," Yeah, why not?",2
9198,Sheldon,21," Sure, why not? And after the sun‰Ûªs down we can all pile in my pick-up and go skinny-dipping down at the creek. ‰Û÷Cause today‰Ûªs the day to stop making sense.",2
9199,Scene,21, A bar at the Las Vegas Casino.,2
9200,Leonard (to barmaid),21, Thanks.,2
9201,Raj,21," I‰Ûªm telling you, Leonard, video slot machines, free drinks brought to us by a bosomy barmaid and all you can eat shrimp for $3.95. Disneyland can suck it. This is the real happiest place on earth.",2
9202,Leonard (as he wins on his slot machine),21," Dude, check it out. That‰Ûªs laundry for a month!",2
9203,Woman (leaning over Raj),21, Hi.,2
9204,Raj (taking a big gulp of his drink),21, Hello.,2
9205,Woman,21, What‰Ûªs your name?,2
9206,Raj,21, Rajesh Ramayan Koothrappali.,2
9207,Woman,21," Hello Rajesh Ram‰Û_ Hi, Rajesh, I‰Ûªm Michaela.",2
9208,Raj,21," Hello, Michaela.",2
9209,Michaela,21," So, are you interested a little party?",2
9210,Raj,21," Why, yes, I love to party. Party is my middle name. Or it would be, if it weren‰Ûªt Ramayan.",2
9211,Leonard,21," Uh, Raj, can I, can I talk to you for a moment.",2
9212,Raj,21," Not now, Leonard, Michaela‰Ûªs inviting me to a party. You better call the moon and you make sure that they have a bed for you.",2
9213,Leonard,21," Yeah, I really need to talk to you.",2
9214,Raj,21," Excuse me, I‰Ûªll be right back. Don‰Ûªt go anywhere. Don‰Ûªt move. Just stay the beautiful unspoiled American flower that you are. (To Leonard) What‰Ûªs wrong with you dude, that woman was all up in my jammy.",2
9215,Leonard,21," Okay, I hate to break this to you and whatever your jammy is, but, I‰Ûªm pretty sure she is a prostitute.",2
9216,Raj,21, What? No. ..,2
9217,Leonard,21," Okay, let me put it this way, in your entire life, how many gorgeous women have walked straight up to you in a bar and asked if you wanted to party.",2
9218,Raj,21, Maybe I can save her.,2
9219,Leonard,21," Maybe, but I‰Ûªm guessing it will cost you about $500 an hour to try.",2
9220,Raj,21," It was lovely meeting you, best of luck in your future endeavours.",2
9221,Michaela,21, Whatever.,2
9222,Raj,21," Oh, I miss her already.",2
9223,Leonard,21," Oh, Howard‰Ûªs losing it. Check out his latest twitters. ‰ÛÏI‰Ûªm at the bottom of a black hole staring into the abyss. My life is meaningless, my future is without hope.‰Û",2
9224,Raj,21, Why don‰Ûªt we take him to see the Blue Man Group?,2
9225,Leonard,21, You think that‰Ûªd help?,2
9226,Raj,21, USA Today calls them exuberant fun for the whole family.,2
9227,Leonard,21," I don‰Ûªt know, Howard isn‰Ûªt really the family fun kind of guy.",2
9228,Raj,21," It‰Ûªs too bad he wasn‰Ûªt here for that hooker. She‰Ûªs exactly his type. A hooker. You know, I bet if we hired her, that would cheer him up.",2
9229,Leonard,21, We‰Ûªre not going to get Wolowitz a hooker.,2
9230,Raj (reading Howard‰Ûªs twitter),21, ‰ÛÏI‰Ûªm so lonely and horny I may open this $20 jar of peanuts and end it all.‰Û,2
9231,Leonard,21, Suppose it wouldn‰Ûªt hurt to get an estimate.,2
9232,Scene,21, Penny‰Ûªs apartment.,2
9233,Sheldon,21," So, how was your day?",2
9234,Penny,21," Are you trying to make small talk? Oh, sweetie, you really don‰Ûªt have to.",2
9235,Sheldon,21," No, it‰Ûªs the accepted convention. How was your day?",2
9236,Penny,21," Well, uh, they shifted my schedule around at the restaurant so my hours are going to be a little different‰Û_",2
9237,Sheldon,21," I‰Ûªm sorry, that‰Ûªs not going to interest me at all, just eat.",2
9238,Scene,21, The casino bar. ,2
9239,Raj,21, Hello again.,2
9240,Michaela,21," Oh, hi.",2
9241,Leonard,21," Yeah, hi, listen, m, if you‰Ûªre not busy, well, w-we were thinking you could‰Û_ well, we were wondering‰Û_",2
9242,Raj,21, If you‰Ûªre really a prostitute.,2
9243,Michaela,21, You guys cops?,2
9244,Together,21, No.,2
9245,Michaela,21, I am a prostitute.,2
9246,Leonard,21," Okay, great. Um‰Û_ uh, the thing is, we‰Ûªve got this friend, and he‰Ûªs kind of down in the dumps, and we thought that maybe you could cheer him up.",2
9247,Raj,21, With sex.,2
9248,Leonard,21, I think she knows what I meant.,2
9249,Raj,21, How can she when you beat around the bush. She‰Ûªs from the mean streets where they shoot from the hip and keep it real.,2
9250,Michaela,21," Don‰Ûªt worry, I can take good care of your friend.",2
9251,Leonard,21," Okay, terrific. Um, uh, listen, is there a way that we can do this where he doesn‰Ûªt know that you‰Ûªre a‰Û_ you know‰Û_",2
9252,Raj,21, Prostitute.,2
9253,Michaela,21, You want the girlfriend experience.,2
9254,Leonard,21," Yes, yeah, exactly, the girlfriend experience.",2
9255,Raj,21," Uh, actually, if it‰Ûªs not too much to ask, could we have the Jewish girlfriend experience.",2
9256,Scene,21, Penny‰Ûªs apartment.,2
9257,Sheldon,21," Okay, that‰Ûªs question 20, you have to guess.",2
9258,Penny,21," Oh, God, I don‰Ûªt know Sheldon, are you Star Wars?",2
9259,Sheldon,21, How can one person be a whole movie?,2
9260,Penny,21," Okay, I give up, can we just do something else?",2
9261,Sheldon,21, Fine. I was Spock. Are you and Leonard friends with benefits.,2
9262,Penny,21, What?,2
9263,Sheldon,21, Are you and Leonard friends with benefits?,2
9264,Penny,21," Where did that even come from, did he say we were?",2
9265,Sheldon,21," No, Leonard said nothing, but who knows what goes on over here when he pretends your mail was misdelivered.",2
9266,Penny,21," No, just mail, no benefits.",2
9267,Sheldon,21," Hmm, I see.",2
9268,Penny,21, Why are you asking?,2
9269,Sheldon,21," I‰Ûªm curious about the whole social construct. On its face, the idea of satisfying ones sexual appetite, assuming one is afflicted with such, without emotional entanglement, that seems eminently practical. What I‰Ûªve observed, however, is Howard Wolowitz crying like a little girl.",2
9270,Penny,21," Well, some people just can‰Ûªt handle that kind of relationship.",2
9271,Sheldon,21, Can you?,2
9272,Penny,21, Excuse me?,2
9273,Sheldon,21, Are you able to have sex with men without developing an emotional attachment?,2
9274,Penny,21," Sheldon, I really don‰Ûªt want to talk about this with you.",2
9275,Sheldon,21, Is this conversation making you uncomfortable?,2
9276,Penny,21," Of course it‰Ûªs making me uncomfortable, can‰Ûªt you tell?",2
9277,Sheldon,21," I really have no idea. I don‰Ûªt particularly excel at reading facial expressions, body language‰Û_",2
9278,Penny,21," I‰Ûªm uncomfortable, Sheldon!",2
9279,Sheldon,21," Thank you, that‰Ûªs very helpful.",2
9280,Scene,21, The casino bar.,2
9281,Howard,21," Alright, where are these amazing shrimp?",2
9282,Leonard,21, Behold?,2
9283,Howard,21," Seriously, you think this is the size of a baby‰Ûªs arm?",2
9284,Raj,21, A little baby.,2
9285,Howard,21, I‰Ûªm going back to the room.,2
9286,Michaela (arriving),21," Boy, would it maybe kill them to put out a nice brisket?",2
9287,Howard,21," Hi there, Howard Wolowitz.",2
9288,Michaela,21, Esther Rosenblatt.,2
9289,Scene,21, Penny‰Ûªs apartment.,2
9290,Penny,21," I don‰Ûªt think the manager‰Ûªs coming tonight so, here.",2
9291,Sheldon,21, Are you suggesting I sleep on the couch.,2
9292,Penny,21," Well, it wasn‰Ûªt the first suggestion that came to mind, but it‰Ûªs the one I‰Ûªm going with.",2
9293,Sheldon,21," I can‰Ûªt sleep on your couch. I sleep in a bed. And given it‰Ûªs dimensions I have no intention of living out E.M. Snickering‰Ûªs beloved children‰Ûªs book , The Tall Man From Cornwall.",2
9294,Penny,21, What?,2
9295,Sheldon,21," There was a tall man from Cornwall whose length exceeded his bed. My body fits on it, but barely upon it, there‰Ûªs no room for my big Cornish head.",2
9296,Penny,21," Oh, alright. I will give you my bed on one condition. That you promise to zip your hole for the next eight hours.",2
9297,Sheldon,21, May I say one last thing.,2
9298,Penny,21, Only if it doesn‰Ûªt rhyme.,2
9299,Sheldon,21, Alright. Goodnight.,2
9300,Scene,21, The casino bar. ,2
9301,Michaela,21, Turn ons. Let me see. Reading a good book in front of the fire. Long walks on the beach. Getting freaky on the Sabbath with a bacon cheeseburger.,2
9302,Howard,21," Really, me too.",2
9303,Michaela,21," Oy gevalt, you‰Ûªre hot.",2
9304,Howard,21, Yeah. Excuse me for a moment.,2
9305,Leonard,21," Hey, how‰Ûªs it going.",2
9306,Howard,21," Cut the crap, you set this up, didn‰Ûªt you?",2
9307,Leonard,21, Yes.,2
9308,Howard,21," She‰Ûªs a hooker, isn‰Ûªt she.",2
9309,Raj,21," A prostitute, yes.",2
9310,Howard,21, You already gave her the money?,2
9311,Leonard,21, Yes.,2
9312,Howard,21, Thank you!,2
9313,Scene,21, Penny‰Ûªs apartment.,2
9314,Sheldon,21, Penny.,2
9315,Penny,21, What?,2
9316,Sheldon,21, I can‰Ûªt sleep. how are you going?,2
9317,Penny,21, Maybe that‰Ûªs because your hole is still open.,2
9318,Sheldon,21, I‰Ûªm homesick.,2
9319,Penny,21, Your home is twenty feet from here.,2
9320,Sheldon,21," Twenty feet, twenty light years, it doesn‰Ûªt matter. It‰Ûªs in a galaxy far, far away.",2
9321,Penny,21, Damn it. What do you want me to do,2
9322,Sheldon,21, Sing soft kitty.,2
9323,Penny,21, That‰Ûªs only for when you‰Ûªre sick.,2
9324,Sheldon,21, Homesick is a type of being sick.,2
9325,Penny,21," Come on, do I really have to?",2
9326,Sheldon,21, I suppose we can stay up and talk.,2
9327,Penny,21," Soft kitty, warm kitty, little ball of fur. Happy kitty, um‰Û_",2
9328,Sheldon,21, Sleepy kitty.,2
9329,Penny,21, Sleepy ki‰Û_,2
9330,Sheldon,21, No. Start over.,2
9331,Penny,21," Soft kitty, warm kitty, little ball of fur. Happy kitty, sleepy kitty, purr, purr, purr.",2
9332,Sheldon,21, Penny.,2
9333,Penny,21, Yeah.,2
9334,Sheldon,21, Thank you for letting me stay here.,2
9335,Penny,21," Oh, you‰Ûªre welcome sweetie.",2
9336,Sheldon,21," Okay, I‰Ûªm sleepy now, get out.",2
9337,Scene,21, The stairwell. ,2
9338,Sheldon,21," Oh, good, you‰Ûªre finally home.",2
9339,Leonard,21, What were you doing at Penny‰Ûªs?,2
9340,Sheldon,21," Well, we had dinner, uh, played some games, and then I spent the night. Oh, you‰Ûªll be happy to know that I now have a much better understanding of friends with benefits.",2
9341,Scene,22, The comic book store.,2
9342,Sheldon,22," Smell that? That‰Ûªs the smell of new comic books. Oh, yes!",2
9343,Howard,22," They‰Ûªre on me today, boys.",2
9344,Raj,22, You‰Ûªre paying? Have you been selling your sperm again?,2
9345,Howard,22," No, I‰Ûªm celebrating. As we speak, the space shuttle is docking at the International Space Station where it will deploy the Wolowitz Zero-Gravity Waste Disposal System.",2
9346,Raj,22," Oh, get over yourself, it‰Ûªs a high-tech toilet.",2
9347,Leonard,22," Just think. Thanks to your hard work, an international crew of astronauts will boldly go",2
9348,Howard,22, Is that supposed to be funny?,2
9349,Sheldon,22, I believe it is. The combination of the Star Trek reference and the play on words involving the double-meaning of the verb to go suggests that Leonard is humorously mocking your efforts in space plumbing.,2
9350,Howard,22," Okay, make your little jokes, but of the four of us, I‰Ûªm the only one making any real-world contribution to science and technology.",2
9351,Raj,22," He‰Ûªs right. This is an important achievement, for two reasons. Number one, and, of course, number two.",2
9352,Sheldon,22," Oh, clever! Playing on the use of cardinal numbers as euphemisms for bodily functions.",2
9353,Stuart,22," Here, Sheldon, I pulled the new Hellboy for you. It‰Ûªs mind-blowing.",2
9354,Sheldon,22," Excuse me, spoiler alert.",2
9355,Stuart,22, I didn‰Ûªt spoil anything.,2
9356,Sheldon,22," You told me it‰Ûªs mind-blowing, so, my mind is going into it pre-blown. And once a mind is pre-blown, it cannot be re-blown.",2
9357,Stuart,22, I‰Ûªm sorry.,2
9358,Sheldon,22, Said the Grinch to Christmas.,2
9359,Stuart,22," Uh, hey, Leonard, can I talk to you about something?",2
9360,Leonard,22," Oh, sure, what‰Ûªs up?",2
9361,Stuart,22, Remember I went out with your friend Penny a couple weeks ago?,2
9362,Leonard,22," Yeah, vaguely.",2
9363,Raj,22, Sure you remember. You went to the bar and made a fool of yourself trying to pick up strange women.,2
9364,Leonard,22, What about it?,2
9365,Stuart,22," Well, uh, the thing is, the date didn‰Ûªt go that well.",2
9366,Leonard,22," Oh, too bad. I guess the thing to do now is just pick yourself up, dust yourself off, forget it and move on.",2
9367,Stuart,22, I can‰Ûªt do that.,2
9368,Leonard,22, Why the hell not?,2
9369,Stuart,22, ‰Û÷Cause we‰Ûªre going out again tomorrow.,2
9370,Sheldon,22," Excuse me, Stuart. Have you read the new Flash?",2
9371,Stuart,22, No.,2
9372,Sheldon,22," Well, I have and it will knock your socks off! Good luck getting them back on.",2
9373,Stuart,22," Uh, anyway, I figured this is probably my last shot with Penny and I don‰Ûªt want to screw it up.",2
9374,Leonard,22, Nobody wants that.,2
9375,Stuart,22," So, here‰Ûªs my question. It‰Ûªs the second date, you think she‰Ûªll be expecting things to get physical?",2
9376,Leonard,22," Uh, oh, gee, my initial reaction is no. You know, let me think about it and get back to you, okay?",2
9377,Stuart,22," Okay, so, you‰Ûªll give me a call?",2
9378,Leonard,22," Yeah, or you call me.",2
9379,Stuart,22, Great.,2
9380,Leonard,22, Or nobody calls anyone.,2
9381,Raj,22, Interesting. Penny‰Ûªs current suitor asking advice from her former suitor.,2
9382,Leonard,22," You know, thanks for closed-captioning my pain, Raj.",2
9383,Howard,22," Hey, wanna make sure he gets nowhere with Penny without jeopardizing your friendship with either of them?",2
9384,Leonard,22, I‰Ûªm listening.,2
9385,Howard,22, Just tell him to do everything you‰Ûªve done with her for the last two years.,2
9386,Scene,22, The lobby.,2
9387,Penny,22," Hey, Leonard.",2
9388,Leonard,22," Oh, hi.",2
9389,Penny,22, How‰Ûªs it going?,2
9390,Leonard,22," Good, good. You?",2
9391,Penny,22," Fine. Oh, hey, can I ask you something?",2
9392,Leonard,22, Sure.,2
9393,Penny,22, You know your friend Stuart?,2
9394,Leonard,22, Yes.,2
9395,Penny,22," Well, he asked me out again and I said yes, and then I started thinking maybe I should talk to you first.",2
9396,Leonard,22, About what?,2
9397,Penny,22," Well, does it bother you, me going out with one of your friends? ‰Û÷Cause you know, you and me‰Û_",2
9398,Leonard,22," No, no that‰Ûªs the past. I‰Ûªm really more of a right now kind of guy. You know, living in the moment. Although I do have to live a little in the future, ‰Ûªcause, well, that‰Ûªs my job. Of course, my fondness for classic science fiction does draw my attention backwards, but those stories often take place in the future. In conclusion, no, it doesn‰Ûªt bother me.",2
9399,Penny,22," Okay, well, that‰Ûªs really cool of you.",2
9400,Leonard,22," Yeah, well I wouldn‰Ûªt say cool, I‰Ûªd just say, that‰Ûªs Leonard!",2
9401,Penny,22," Well, In that case, do you mind giving me some advice?",2
9402,Leonard,22, About Stuart? Love to.,2
9403,Penny,22," He‰Ûªs very shy, how do I make him feel more comfortable around me?",2
9404,Leonard,22," Well, uh, first of all, don‰Ûªt underestimate the value of discomfort.",2
9405,Penny,22, Really?,2
9406,Leonard,22," Well, yeah, Stuart thrives under pressure, that‰Ûªs why he works in a comic book store.",2
9407,Scene,22, The university cafeteria. Leonard‰Ûªs phone rings. ,2
9408,Leonard,22, Oh. It‰Ûªs Stuart.,2
9409,Sheldon,22, You‰Ûªre not going to answer it?,2
9410,Leonard,22, He wants to talk about Penny. I don‰Ûªt want to talk about Penny.,2
9411,Sheldon,22," You‰Ûªre making an assumption. Perhaps the comic book store is on fire, and he needs your assistance.",2
9412,Leonard,22, Why would he call me?,2
9413,Sheldon,22," We don‰Ûªt know. And if you don‰Ûªt answer the phone, we can‰Ûªt know.",2
9414,Leonard,22," I‰Ûªm not answering the phone, Sheldon.",2
9415,Sheldon,22," Answer the phone, Leonard.",2
9416,Leonard,22," No! There, it went to voice mail.",2
9417,Sheldon,22, Aren‰Ûªt you going to check your messages?,2
9418,Leonard,22, No.,2
9419,Sheldon,22," You have to check your messages, the leaving of a message is one half of a social contract which is completed by the checking of the message. If that contract breaks down then all social contracts break down and we descend into anarchy.",2
9420,Leonard,22, It must be hell inside your head.,2
9421,Sheldon,22, At times.,2
9422,Howard,22," Guys, we have a code red.",2
9423,Sheldon,22," Do you mean code red the hospital emergency alert, code red the computer worm, or code red the cherry flavoured soft drink from the makers of Mountain Dew?",2
9424,Howard,22," Look, I was going over the schematics on my zero-G toilet, and I made a teeny tiny mistake on the specifications for the diverter valve.",2
9425,Leonard,22, How teeny tiny?,2
9426,Howard,22, It‰Ûªs gonna fail after about ten flushes.,2
9427,Sheldon,22, But the mission is for six months.,2
9428,Howard,22," Yeah, see, that‰Ûªs the code red. It‰Ûªs kind of like a jack-in-the-box, no one knows exactly when, but at some point something way worse than a puppet is gonna pop out of that box.",2
9429,Sheldon,22, Have you notified NASA?,2
9430,Howard,22, No. Are you crazy?What am I gonna say? I screwed up your toilet and pretty soon there‰Ûªs gonna be crap floating all over your nice shiny space station?,2
9431,Leonard,22," Well, what are you gonna do?",2
9432,Howard,22," I‰Ûªm gonna figure out how to fix it, then I‰Ûªll tell them.",2
9433,Leonard,22," So, what do you need us for?",2
9434,Raj,22, He can‰Ûªt figure out how to fix it.,2
9435,Howard,22," Hey, you said you were gonna be supportive.",2
9436,Raj,22," I‰Ûªm trying, but you have to admit this is pretty damn funny.",2
9437,Sheldon,22, I agree. It‰Ûªs the juxtaposition of the high-tech nature of space exploration against the banality of a malfunctioning toilet that provides the comic fodder here. Check your messages.,2
9438,Scene,22, The apartment.,2
9439,Howard,22," All right, this is an exact duplicate of the Wolowitz Zero-Gravity Human Waste Disposal System as deployed on the International Space Station.",2
9440,Raj,22, Don‰Ûªt you mean the Wolowitz Zero-Gravity Human Waste Distribution System?,2
9441,Leonard,22, Good one.,2
9442,Raj,22, Yeah.,2
9443,Howard,22," Yeah, ha, it‰Ûªs hilarious. Now, here‰Ûªs an approximation of the spare parts available on the Space Station. We gotta find a way, using nothing but this, to reinforce this so the waste material avoids the spinning turbine.",2
9444,Raj,22, You mean so it doesn‰Ûªt hit the fan?,2
9445,Sheldon,22," Yeah, I have to say, I thought the toilet humour would get less funny with repetition. Apparently, there is no law of diminishing comedic returns with space poop. (There is a knock on the door)",2
9446,Stuart,22, Hey Leonard.,2
9447,Leonard,22, Hey Stuart.,2
9448,Stuart,22, You busy?,2
9449,Leonard,22, Um‰Û_,2
9450,Howard,22," Classified, Leonard.",2
9451,Leonard,22," Yeah, it‰Ûªs a regular Manhattan Project. What‰Ûªs up?",2
9452,Stuart,22," Well, tonight‰Ûªs my date with Penny and since we haven‰Ûªt been able to connect by phone‰Û_",2
9453,Leonard,22," Yeah, I‰Ûªm sorry, it‰Ûªs been broken.",2
9454,Stuart,22, Or e-mail.,2
9455,Leonard,22," Yeah, that too. Everything‰Ûªs broken.",2
9456,Stuart,22," Anyway, I was just wondering if you had any last-minute advice.",2
9457,Leonard,22," All right, well, off the top of my head, I think the most important thing with Penny is to go really slow. I mean, glacial.",2
9458,Stuart,22, Okay.,2
9459,Leonard,22," You know, guys come onto her all the time, so, you need to, like, set yourself apart. You know, be a little shy, don‰Ûªt make too much eye contact. And, you know, treat her with, like, cool detachment and, and, and, you know, fear.",2
9460,Stuart,22, Fear?,2
9461,Leonard,22," Yeah, like, you‰Ûªre afraid that if you touch her, she‰Ûªll break.",2
9462,Stuart,22," Well, that plays right into my wheelhouse.",2
9463,Leonard,22," Good, good. Well, you kids have fun tonight.",2
9464,Stuart,22," Thanks, Leonard. What is that thing anyway?",2
9465,Howard,22, You don‰Ûªt know what this is?,2
9466,Stuart,22, No.,2
9467,Howard,22, Good. Get out.,2
9468,Raj,22," Be afraid of Penny, nice, very crafty.",2
9469,Leonard,22, It wasn‰Ûªt bad advice. It just wasn‰Ûªt particularly helpful.,2
9470,Sheldon,22," For what it‰Ûªs worth, my mother says that when we deceive for personal gain, we make Jesus cry.",2
9471,Scene,22, Later.,2
9472,Sheldon,22," All right, what if we use this two-inch PVC to reinforce the centre cross-support?",2
9473,Howard,22," No good. I mean, it might work for the Japanese and the Americans, but have you seen the size of the Russians they got up there? This thing has to hold up against a hearty potato-based diet.",2
9474,Leonard,22, I feel terrible.,2
9475,Howard,22," Maybe if you were helping, you‰Ûªd feel better about yourself.",2
9476,Leonard,22, I deliberately tried to sabotage Stuart‰Ûªs date with Penny.,2
9477,Raj,22," Of course you feel terrible. You completely screwed up your karma, dude.",2
9478,Sheldon,22," You don‰Ûªt really believe in that superstition, do you?",2
9479,Raj,22," It‰Ûªs not superstition. It‰Ûªs practically Newtonian. For every action, there‰Ûªs an equal and opposite reaction. Leonard pretends to be a friend and acts like a two-faced bitch, therefore, he is reborn as a banana slug. It‰Ûªs actually a very elegant system, you know, what goes around comes around.",2
9480,Howard,22, Speaking of what goes around comes around‰Û_,2
9481,Raj,22," Okay, look. Instead of trying to reinforce this structure here, what if we just ran another line, bypass it entirely?",2
9482,Sheldon,22, It won‰Ûªt work. The diameter of the tubing is insufficient.,2
9483,Raj,22, What if we reposition the collection tank?,2
9484,Sheldon,22, It won‰Ûªt work. No way to mount it.,2
9485,Howard,22," Okay, here‰Ûªs an idea. What if I change my name and go live with my cousin and her husband Avi in Israel?",2
9486,Sheldon,22, That could work.,2
9487,Scene,22," Outside Penny‰Ûªs door. Leonard knocks, Penny answers in her dressing gown.",2
9488,Leonard,22, Morning.,2
9489,Penny,22, Morning. What‰Ûªs up?,2
9490,Leonard,22, Nothing. We just pulled an all-nighter trying to fix a zero-gravity‰Û_ pasta maker. I‰Ûªm gonna make a coffee run. Do you want any?,2
9491,Penny,22," Oh, no, thanks. I have coffee.",2
9492,Leonard,22, Great. So how‰Ûªd it go with Stuart last night?,2
9493,Penny,22, I really don‰Ûªt want to talk about it.,2
9494,Leonard,22," Yeah. Right. Sure. The thing is, before you guys went out, I spoke to him and‰Û_",2
9495,Penny,22, I said I don‰Ûªt want to talk about it.,2
9496,Leonard,22, Okay‰Û_ I just‰Û_ I kind of‰Û_,2
9497,Penny,22," Look, Leonard, what goes on between me and Stuart is none of your business. So just leave it alone, okay?",2
9498,Raj,22," If you really want to clean up your karma, go get my freakin‰Ûª latte.",2
9499,Scene,22, The apartment. ,2
9500,Howard,22," Hang on, I think I‰Ûªve got this. Help me see if we can wedge this little piece of PVC behind the support rod.",2
9501,Sheldon,22, You‰Ûªre overestimating the tensile strength of the substructure you‰Ûªre building.,2
9502,Howard,22," Sheldon, I know what I‰Ûªm doing.",2
9503,Sheldon,22," If you knew what you were doing, there wouldn‰Ûªt be a space toilet where my coffee table should be.",2
9504,Raj,22," Howard, wait. Why don‰Ûªt you use this instead of the PVC to keep the transverse filter assembly in place?",2
9505,Howard,22, Because this is not a spare part from the space station. This is the thing from the pizza box that keeps the lid from touching the cheese.,2
9506,Raj,22," That what that‰Ûªs for? In India, the lid just touches the cheese. Of course, we also have rampant poverty and periodic outbreaks of cholera, so a little cardboard in our cheese is no biggie.",2
9507,Howard,22, Where are you going?,2
9508,Leonard,22, Comic book store.,2
9509,Sheldon,22," Oh, an excellent idea! I could certainly use a break.",2
9510,Raj,22," Me, too.",2
9511,Howard,22," Hold on, you can go to the comic book store when man can once again safely poop in space.",2
9512,Sheldon,22, Why does Leonard get to go?,2
9513,Leonard,22," ‰Û÷Cause he‰Ûªs upset over his situation with Penny and if I have to hear about it again, I‰Ûªm going to kick him in his ovaries.",2
9514,Leonard,22," Thanks for understanding, Howard.",2
9515,Howard,22," I got your back, sister. All right, I think we‰Ûªve got a prototype ready to test. Hand me that Tupperware.",2
9516,Raj,22," Wow, that‰Ûªs heavy.",2
9517,Howard,22," Damn right it‰Ûªs heavy, it‰Ûªs my mother‰Ûªs meat loaf, it‰Ûªs been testing toilets for generations.",2
9518,Sheldon,22," I must say, Howard, I think a detailed letter to MIT describing your current circumstances might entitle you to a refund on your master‰Ûªs degree.",2
9519,Howard,22," Okay, simulated zero-gravity human waste disposal test with meat loaf analog in three, two, one. (Switches flush. Meatloaf hits ceiling.)",2
9520,Sheldon,22, Fascinating.,2
9521,Raj,22, What do you think the problem is?,2
9522,Howard,22, Not enough bread crumbs.,2
9523,Scene,22, The comic book store.,2
9524,Leonard,22," Hey, Stuart, I need to talk to you.",2
9525,Stuart,22," Sure, what‰Ûªs up?",2
9526,Leonard,22," I think I gave you bad advice about Penny, and I want to apologize.",2
9527,Stuart,22," No, your advice was great.",2
9528,Leonard,22, It was?,2
9529,Stuart,22," Yeah, going slow really worked.",2
9530,Leonard,22, You‰Ûªre kidding. Never worked for me.,2
9531,Stuart,22," Yeah, last night at dinner, I did what you told me, I went really slow, I kept my distance, and two bottles of wine later, we were making out in my car.",2
9532,Leonard,22, Wine? I didn‰Ûªt say to give her wine.,2
9533,Stuart,22," It doesn‰Ûªt matter, that‰Ûªs where it all went to hell.",2
9534,Leonard,22," During the kissing? What did you do, sneeze in her mouth? I did that to a girl once.",2
9535,Stuart,22," No, everything was good and really hot, and I said ‰ÛÏOh, Penny,‰Û and right where she was supposed to say, ‰ÛÏOh, Stuart,‰Û she said‰Û_ your name.",2
9536,Leonard,22, Leonard?,2
9537,Stuart,22," That is your name, right?",2
9538,Leonard,22," Yeah, no, yeah, wow, I‰Ûªm sorry. That must‰Ûªve been the last thing you wanted to hear.",2
9539,Stuart,22," Well, it beats you know I‰Ûªm a dude, right? Yeah, it was pretty bad.",2
9540,Leonard,22," No doubt, no doubt. Okay, well, I‰Ûªm sorry it didn‰Ûªt work out.",2
9541,Stuart,22, Not your fault.,2
9542,Leonard,22," Yeah, how about that? See you soon.",2
9543,Stuart,22," Yeah, sure.",2
9544,Scene,22, The apartment. Howard is on the phone.,2
9545,Howard,22," Yes, sir, I understand classified. We‰Ûªll keep it all classified, no one has to know but you and me.",2
9546,Penny,22, What‰Ûªs classified?,2
9547,Leonard,22, Howard‰Ûªs space toilet. I‰Ûªll tell you later.,2
9548,Howard,22," Well, they‰Ûªve deployed our solution. Let‰Ûªs just all hope it works.",2
9549,Sheldon,22," I don‰Ûªt see why I have to worry. My career‰Ûªs not hanging in the balance. That was a joke. It‰Ûªs funny, because it‰Ûªs true.",2
9550,Penny,22," Leonard, could you pass the soy sauce, please?",2
9551,Leonard,22," I‰Ûªm sorry, were you talking to me?",2
9552,Penny,22," Yeah, I said Leonard.",2
9553,Leonard,22," Yes, you did, didn‰Ûªt you?",2
9554,Penny,22, What the hell is that?,2
9555,Howard,22, Meatloaf.,2
9556,Leonard,22, What was it doing on the ceiling?,2
9557,Howard,22, That‰Ûªs classified.,2
9558,Scene,22, The International Space Station.,2
9559,Voice,22," Houston, International Space Station. We have a little situation up here. We‰Ûªd like to make an unscheduled space walk.",2
9560,Houston,22," ISS, Houston. Which crew members would be involved in this E.V.A.?",2
9561,ISS voice,22," Houston, we‰Ûªd all like to step outside for a few minutes.",2
9562,Houston,22," ISS, I‰Ûªm afraid we can‰Ûªt authorize that.",2
9563,ISS voice,22," Uh, Houston, this is more of an FYI call. We are basically out the door.",2
9564,Scene,23, The apartment. Leonard is working on a whiteboard.,2
9565,Sheldon,23," Oh, boy.",2
9566,Leonard,23, What?,2
9567,Sheldon,23, I can‰Ûªt comment without violating our agreement that I don‰Ûªt criticize your work.,2
9568,Leonard,23," Then what was oh, boy?",2
9569,Sheldon,23, Great restraint on my part.,2
9570,Leonard,23, There‰Ûªs nothing wrong with the science here.,2
9571,Sheldon,23, Perhaps you mean a different thing than I do when you say science.,2
9572,Leonard (making a change),23," Okay, how‰Ûªs that?",2
9573,Sheldon,23," You actually had it right in the first place. Once again, you‰Ûªve fallen for one of my classic pranks. Bazinga! Well, now here‰Ûªs a peculiar e-mail. The president of the university wants me to meet him at his office tomorrow morning at 8 a.m.",2
9574,Leonard,23, Why?,2
9575,Leonard,23," Yes, how did we live before Twitter? I guess you‰Ûªll find out what it is in the morning.",2
9576,Sheldon,23," That‰Ûªs 14 hours away. For the next 840 minutes, I‰Ûªm effectively one of Heisenberg‰Ûªs particles, I know where I am or I know how fast I‰Ûªm going, but I can‰Ûªt know both. Yet how am I supposed to carry on with this huge annoying thing hovering over my head?",2
9577,Leonard,23," Yeah, I know the feeling.",2
9578,Scene,23, Outside Leonard‰Ûªs bedroom.,2
9579,Sheldon,23," (Knock, knock, knock) Leonard. (Knock, knock, knock) Leonard. (Knock, knock, knock) Leonard.",2
9580,Leonard,23," Sheldon, it‰Ûªs two o‰Ûªclock in the morning.",2
9581,Sheldon,23, Why is everybody keep telling me what time it is?,2
9582,Leonard,23, Everybody?,2
9583,Sheldon,23," You, the president of the university, his wife, their sullen teenage daughter. That entire family is fascinated by what time it is and whether people know it.",2
9584,Leonard,23, You went to President Seibert‰Ûªs house in the middle of the night?,2
9585,Sheldon,23," He didn‰Ûªt respond to my e-mail, his phone number is unlisted. Tell me what my other option was.",2
9586,Leonard,23," You could have waited until morning. I know, look who I‰Ûªm talking to.",2
9587,Sheldon,23, Do you remember the grant proposal I submitted to the National Science Foundation to detect slow-moving monopoles at the magnetic North Pole?,2
9588,Leonard,23, Hardly a day goes by when I don‰Ûªt think about it.,2
9589,Sheldon,23," Aw, how nice. Well, a space opened up at the last minute on the NSF expedition to the Arctic Circle.",2
9590,Leonard,23, Wait a minute. He offered to send you to the North Pole?,2
9591,Sheldon,23," Yes. In fact, he was quite enthusiastic. He said, ‰ÛÏFrankly, if I could send you tonight, I would.‰Û",2
9592,Leonard,23," Okay, well, do you want to go?",2
9593,Sheldon,23," Of course not. I‰Ûªm a theoretical physicist, a career I chose in no small part because it‰Ûªs indoors, but if I‰Ûªm able to detect slow-moving magnetic monopoles there, I will be the scientist to confirm string theory. People will write books about me. Third-graders will create macaroni-art dioramas depicting scenes from my life.",2
9594,Leonard,23," Sure, maybe a tableau of me trying to pummel you to death.",2
9595,Sheldon,23, Sarcasm?,2
9596,Leonard,23, Maybe.,2
9597,Sheldon,23," I‰Ûªm on the horns of a dilemma. Can you imagine me, Sheldon Cooper, at the North Pole?",2
9598,Leonard,23," Easy peasy, I‰Ûªm doing it right now.",2
9599,Sheldon,23," I‰Ûªm not good with cold, Leonard. How often have we had to leave a movie theatre because I got a headache from drinking the Icee too fast? I can‰Ûªt go.",2
9600,Leonard,23," Well, then don‰Ûªt go.",2
9601,Sheldon,23, How can you say that? The scientific opportunity of a lifetime presents itself and my best friend says don‰Ûªt go.,2
9602,Leonard,23," All right, then go.",2
9603,Sheldon,23, Listen to you. How can I possibly go?,2
9604,Leonard,23," Sheldon, what are the words I can say right now to end this conversation and let me go back to sleep?",2
9605,Sheldon,23," Odd, President Seibert posed the exact same question.",2
9606,Leonard,23, How was it resolved?,2
9607,Sheldon,23, It wasn‰Ûªt. His wife set their dogs on me and rendered the question moot.,2
9608,Scene,23, The stairwell.,2
9609,Howard,23," Just imagine. If he says yes, we‰Ûªll have an entire summer without Sheldon.",2
9610,Raj,23, We could play outside.,2
9611,Howard,23, We could sit on the left side of the couch.,2
9612,Raj,23," Our dreams are very small, aren‰Ûªt they?",2
9613,Sheldon,23," Good news, gentlemen, I have tentatively accepted‰Û_",2
9614,All,23, Yeah! Woo-hoo!,2
9615,Sheldon,23, ‰Û_the invitation to join the Arctic Expedition.,2
9616,Leonard,23, It‰Ûªs not gonna be the same without you.,2
9617,Howard,23, Godspeed.,2
9618,Sheldon,23," Thank you, but your sentiments may be premature.",2
9619,Raj,23," Ooh, I don‰Ûªt like where this is going.",2
9620,Sheldon,23, I would like to propose that the three of you accompany me.,2
9621,Howard,23, To the North Pole?,2
9622,Sheldon,23, Yes.,2
9623,Raj,23, Is this just so we won‰Ûªt touch your stuff while you‰Ûªre away?,2
9624,Sheldon,23," I‰Ûªll admit that was a concern. But the fact is, I‰Ûªll need a support team. And the three of you are my first choice.",2
9625,Howard,23, Really?,2
9626,Sheldon,23," Well, there are others who might be more qualified, but the thought of interviewing them gave me a stomach ache. Now, I know I‰Ûªm proposing an enormous undertaking, so why don‰Ûªt you take a few moments to discuss it?",2
9627,Howard,23," We‰Ûªre not really gonna go to the North Pole with him, are we?",2
9628,Sheldon (voice),23, I‰Ûªm still within earshot! You may want to wait for my door to close.,2
9629,Howard,23," We‰Ûªre not really gonna go to the North Pole with him, are we?",2
9630,Leonard,23, Hang on. Let‰Ûªs talk about it. This is a National Science Foundation expedition. I don‰Ûªt know how we can turn it down.,2
9631,Howard,23," Easy. Instead of saying, no, we don‰Ûªt want to go on an NSF expedition, say, no, we don‰Ûªt want to spend ‰ÛÏthree months stuck in a cabin in the Arctic Circle with an anal nutbag.‰Û",2
9632,Raj,23," But if we were part of the team that confirmed string theory, we could drink for free in any bar in any college town with a university that has a strong science program.",2
9633,Leonard,23," Howard, this is big science. You could be the engineer who builds the equipment that puts us on the cover of magazines.",2
9634,Howard,23, I could also be the engineer who builds the crossbow that kills Sheldon.,2
9635,Raj,23, You still might get on a magazine.,2
9636,Howard,23, So you guys are seriously considering this?,2
9637,Leonard,23, Yes.,2
9638,Howard,23, And you think you can put up with Sheldon?,2
9639,Raj,23," Well, I‰Ûªm a Hindu. My religion teaches that if we suffer in this life we are rewarded in the next. Three months at the North Pole with Sheldon and I‰Ûªm reborn as a well-hung billionaire with wings!",2
9640,Sheldon,23," Well, gentlemen, have you reached a decision?",2
9641,Leonard,23, I‰Ûªm in.,2
9642,Raj,23," Me, too.",2
9643,Howard,23," Oh, damn it. Peer pressure. Fine.",2
9644,Sheldon,23," Excellent. And just an FYI, as I am the expedition‰Ûªs team leader, protocol dictates that be phrased fine, sir. But don‰Ûªt worry, there will be a briefing.",2
9645,Scene,23, Outside Penny‰Ûªs door.,2
9646,Sheldon,23," (Knock, knock, knock) Penny.",2
9647,Penny,23," (Knock, knock, knock) Sheldon.",2
9648,Sheldon,23," (Knock, knock, knock) Penny.",2
9649,Penny,23," (Knock, knock, knock) Sheldon.",2
9650,Sheldon,23," (Knock, knock, knock) Penny.",2
9651,Penny,23," (Knock, knock, knock) Sheldon.",2
9652,Sheldon,23," (Knock, knock, knock) Penny.",2
9653,Penny,23," (Knock, knock, knock) Sheldon.",2
9654,Sheldon,23," (Knock, knock, knock) Penny.",2
9655,Penny,23," (Knock, knock, knock) Sheldon.",2
9656,Sheldon,23," (Knock, knock, knock) Penny.",2
9657,Penny,23," (Knock, knock, knock) Sheldon.",2
9658,Sheldon,23," (Knock, knock, knock) Penny.",2
9659,Penny,23, What do you want?,2
9660,Sheldon,23, I need access to the Cheesecake Factory‰Ûªs walk-in freezer.,2
9661,Penny,23," Now, honey, I already told you, the hamburger meat is fresh and stored at a safe temperature.",2
9662,Sheldon,23, No. This is to train for a three-month expedition to the magnetic North Pole.,2
9663,Penny,23, What?,2
9664,Sheldon,23," I don‰Ûªt know how that sentence could possibly confuse you, but to elaborate, I‰Ûªm going to the Arctic Circle with Leonard, Wolowitz and Koothrappali.",2
9665,Penny,23, You‰Ûªre all going?,2
9666,Sheldon,23, Yes.,2
9667,Penny,23, For three months?,2
9668,Sheldon,23, Yes.,2
9669,Penny,23, Excuse me.,2
9670,Sheldon,23, Is that a yes or a no on the freezer? The woman has the attention span of a gnat.,2
9671,Penny,23," Hey, Leonard.",2
9672,Leonard,23, Hi.,2
9673,Penny,23, Sheldon says you‰Ûªre going to the North Pole.,2
9674,Leonard,23," Yeah. Pretty cool, huh?",2
9675,Penny,23, Yeah. I‰Ûªm just a little surprised you didn‰Ûªt tell me.,2
9676,Leonard,23," Oh, well, it all happened kind of fast, and we had to get physicals and buy thermal underwear and study up on, you know, snow and stuff. Sorry, I was gonna tell you.",2
9677,Penny,23," Oh, hey, no, you don‰Ûªt have to apologize. There‰Ûªs no reason you have to tell me. I was just, you know, surprised.",2
9678,Sheldon,23," Yes, yes, you were busy, you were surprised, all very fascinating. Now where do we stand on the freezer?",2
9679,Penny,23, Is he serious?,2
9680,Leonard,23," Actually, it would help.",2
9681,Penny,23," All right, I‰Ûªll see what I can do. So, three months at the North Pole. Wow, that is awesome.",2
9682,Leonard,23, Yeah.,2
9683,Sheldon,23," I‰Ûªm sorry, but at what point do you put this see what you can do plan into action?",2
9684,Penny,23," Just a warning, Sheldon, the freezer locks from the outside.",2
9685,Leonard,23, Did she seem upset to you?,2
9686,Sheldon,23, No. Did she seem upset to you?,2
9687,Leonard,23, No.,2
9688,Sheldon,23," Oh, good, I got it right. Are you upset?",2
9689,Leonard,23, A little bit.,2
9690,Sheldon,23, Two for two. I‰Ûªm on fire.,2
9691,Leonard,23," I mean, I know she‰Ûªs not my girlfriend or anything, but wouldn‰Ûªt you think she‰Ûªd feel a little bad that I‰Ûªm going to be gone for the whole summer?",2
9692,Sheldon,23," That feels like a bonus question. I‰Ûªm going to stop here while I‰Ûªm ahead, but I‰Ûªve had a great time.",2
9693,Scene,23, Inside the cheesecake factory freezer.,2
9694,Sheldon,23," Alright, now the purpose of this drill is to acclimate us to the use of tools in extreme temperatures such as we will face in the Arctic Circle.",2
9695,Raj,23, Where are your tools?,2
9696,Sheldon (pointing at his brain),23," Right here. All right, team, open up your practice kits. As the university did not permit me to bring the actual equipment we‰Ûªll be using to the Cheesecake Factory, because apparently I‰Ûªm ‰ÛÏridiculous,‰Û I‰Ûªve provided substitutes which will exercise your fine motor skills. Leonard, you will be doing a series of complex mathematical problems on a vintage Casio model 1175 calculator watch I received when I won the Earth Science medal in 3rd grade. Treat it with respect. Raj, you will be painting sideburns and a Van Dyke on a six-inch figurine of Legolas the elf. Now, remember, a Van Dyke is a goatee without a moustache. Wolowitz, you will be completing a series of delicate surgical procedures on the classic children‰Ûªs game, Operation. To begin with, you will remove funny bone for two hundred dollars.",2
9697,Howard,23, For this I went to MIT.,2
9698,Sheldon,23, And begin.,2
9699,Raj,23, I think I swallowed some paint!,2
9700,Leonard,23," I can‰Ûªt press any of the buttons with my gloves. Oh, son of a bitch!",2
9701,Sheldon,23, Adversity is to be expected. Continue.,2
9702,Howard,23," Oh, boy, am I gonna get sued.",2
9703,Leonard,23," Okay, I can‰Ûªt do this.",2
9704,Raj,23, Me either.,2
9705,Sheldon,23," Gentlemen, use your imagination. Innovate. Did Han Solo let Luke Skywalker freeze to death on the ice planet of Hoth? No. He cut open a tauntaun and used its internal body heat to warm him up.",2
9706,Howard,23, You heard the man. Hold him down and I‰Ûªll cut him open.,2
9707,Leonard,23," Hang on, I know I don‰Ûªt possess the tools of leadership, but I don‰Ûªt understand why we can‰Ûªt assemble the equipment inside the hut and then take it outside.",2
9708,Sheldon,23, I hadn‰Ûªt thought of that. I guess we‰Ûªre done here.,2
9709,Scene,23, The apartment kitchen.,2
9710,Sheldon,23," Here, drink slash eat this.",2
9711,Leonard,23, What is it?,2
9712,Sheldon,23, It‰Ûªs hot chocolate with a stick of butter.,2
9713,Howard,23," Okay, why?",2
9714,Sheldon,23," Because in the frigid temperatures in the Arctic, we need to consume at least 5,000 calories a day just to maintain our body weight.",2
9715,Leonard,23," Sheldon, you know I can‰Ûªt eat butter. I‰Ûªm lactose intolerant.",2
9716,Sheldon,23," Way ahead of you, that‰Ûªs an ‰ÛÏI Can‰Ûªt Believe It‰Ûªs Not Butter‰Û stick.",2
9717,Raj (on his webcam),23," But mummy, all the other guys are going to the North Pole.",2
9718,Mrs Koothrappali,23," I don‰Ûªt care what the other guys are doing. If the other guys jumped in the Bay of Bengal and tried to swim to Sri Lanka, would you follow them?",2
9719,Raj,23," If you were standing behind me nagging, I might.",2
9720,Dr Koothrappali,23," Don‰Ûªt talk back to your mother. This trip is much too dangerous, Rajesh.",2
9721,Raj,23," No, it‰Ûªs not. Howard, tell them.",2
9722,Howard,23," Doctor and Mrs. Koothrappali, namaste. I understand your concern, but if it‰Ûªll make you feel any better, my mother is fine with me going, and this is a woman who kept a safety rail on my bed until I was 17.",2
9723,Mrs Koothrappali,23," So, she has no problem with her son being eaten by a walrus?",2
9724,Sheldon,23," That‰Ûªs very unlikely, Mrs. Koothrappali. If Raj dies, it‰Ûªll be from frostbite, gangrene, acute sunburn or being ripped to shreds by a fifteen hundred pound polar bear.",2
9725,Howard,23," Ma, I‰Ûªm putting you on speakerphone with Raj‰Ûªs parents. Can you tell them that you‰Ûªre okay with me going to the Arctic?",2
9726,Howard‰Ûªs Mother,23, Arctic? I thought you said Arkansas!,2
9727,Howard,23, I didn‰Ûªt say that. You never listen to me!,2
9728,Howard‰Ûªs Mother,23, He doesn‰Ûªt tell me anything! He lives a secret life because he‰Ûªs ashamed!,2
9729,Penny (arriving),23," Hey, Leonard, can I talk to you for a sec?",2
9730,Leonard,23," Sure, but let‰Ûªs go out here where there‰Ûªs a little less yelling and guilt. What‰Ûªs up?",2
9731,Penny,23," Well, I got you a little going away present.",2
9732,Leonard,23," Oh, a blanket.",2
9733,Penny,23," Oh, no, no, no, not just a blanket. See, it has sleeves. Yeah! åÊSo, you can, you know, be all snoodled up while you do your science stuff.",2
9734,Leonard,23," Oh, wow, cool.",2
9735,Penny,23," Oh, I‰Ûªm gonna miss you. (She hugs him for a long time) See you later.",2
9736,Leonard,23, Bye.,2
9737,Mrs Koothrappali,23, I told you no. Why don‰Ûªt you believe me?,2
9738,Howard‰Ûªs Mother,23," ‰Û÷Cause it doesn‰Ûªt make sense to me! How can it be that in the entire country of India, there isn‰Ûªt one Outback Steakhouse?!",2
9739,Scene,23, Sheldon‰Ûªs bedroom. Sheldon is asleep. There is a knock on the door.,2
9740,Leonard,23," Sheldon, Sheldon?",2
9741,Sheldon,23," I want a cookie, Meemaw.",2
9742,Leonard,23," Sheldon, it‰Ûªs me.",2
9743,Sheldon,23, But Meemaw just made cookies.,2
9744,Leonard,23," Listen, I don‰Ûªt know if I can go on the expedition.",2
9745,Sheldon,23, What?,2
9746,Leonard,23, I don‰Ûªt think I can go to the North Pole.,2
9747,Sheldon,23," Okay, Leonard, I know you‰Ûªre concerned about disappointing me but I want you to take comfort from the knowledge that my expectations of you are very low.",2
9748,Leonard,23," Yeah, that‰Ûªs very comforting.",2
9749,Sheldon,23," Comforting is a part of leadership. It‰Ûªs not a part I care for, but such is my burden.",2
9750,Leonard,23," Terrific, it‰Ûªs just that I don‰Ûªt think Penny wants me to go.",2
9751,Sheldon,23," Assuming that‰Ûªs a valid reason not to go, which it isn‰Ûªt, how do you know this? Did she say it?",2
9752,Leonard,23, Not exactly. But she said she was gonna miss me and she gave me this.,2
9753,Sheldon,23, What is it?,2
9754,Leonard,23, It‰Ûªs a blanket with sleeves.,2
9755,Sheldon,23," Oh, that‰Ûªs clever. Let me see if I understand this correctly. Her missing you is an emotional state you find desirable?",2
9756,Leonard,23," Yes, obviously.",2
9757,Sheldon,23," All right. Well, given that missing you is predicated on you leaving, logic dictates you must leave.",2
9758,Leonard,23," Yes, okay, but I‰Ûªm gonna be gone for three months. What if she doesn‰Ûªt miss me that long and she meets someone else?",2
9759,Sheldon,23, She does have a short attention span.,2
9760,Leonard,23," So, I can‰Ûªt go.",2
9761,Sheldon,23," Leonard, you may be right. It appears that Penny secretly wants you in her life in a very intimate and carnal fashion.",2
9762,Leonard,23, You really think so?,2
9763,Sheldon,23," Of course not. Even in my sleep-deprived state, I‰Ûªve managed to pull off another one of my classic pranks. Bazinga!",2
9764,Scene,23, Outside Penny‰Ûªs door. Leonard is knocking.,2
9765,Penny,23," Oh, Leonard, what time is it?",2
9766,Leonard,23," It‰Ûªs 7 a.m. I‰Ûªm sorry it‰Ûªs early, but we‰Ûªre leaving soon, and I needed to talk to you.",2
9767,Penny,23, Okay.,2
9768,Leonard,23, What did you mean when you said you‰Ûªre going to miss me?,2
9769,Penny,23," Um, I don‰Ûªt know. You‰Ûªll be gone and I‰Ûªll notice.",2
9770,Leonard (indicating the blanket),23," Okay, well, um, what about this? What does this mean?",2
9771,Penny,23," Wine, credit card and late night television are a bad combination.",2
9772,Leonard,23," All right, fine. What about that really long hug? What did that mean?",2
9773,Penny,23, That wasn‰Ûªt a long hug.,2
9774,Leonard,23, It was at least five Mississippis. A standard hug is two Mississippis tops.,2
9775,Penny,23," Leonard, I don‰Ûªt know what to tell you. It was just a hug.",2
9776,Leonard,23, Glad we cleared that up.,2
9777,Penny,23, Yeah.,2
9778,Leonard,23, I guess I‰Ûªll see you.,2
9779,Penny,23," Okay, have a safe trip.",2
9780,Leonard,23, Thank you. Bye.,2
9781,Penny,23," Okay, bye. (Penny closes door. To herself) Means I wish you weren‰Ûªt going.",2
9782,Scene,23, The North Pole.,2
9783,Leonard,23, Damn it.,2
9784,Howard,23, What?,2
9785,Leonard,23, We‰Ûªre out of ice.,2
9786,Sheldon,23," All right, men, we begin initial assembly and deployment of the testing equipment starting tomorrow at 0700 hours, but until then, you are all off duty. I suggest you keep the shenanigans to a minimum as medical help is 18 hours away by dogsled.",2
9787,Raj,23, What are you working on?,2
9788,Howard,23, Crossbow.,2
9789,Leonard,23," Hey, guys, can I just say something? How about we take a moment to think about where we are right now? This is literally the top of the world. Only a handful of people in all of human history will ever see what we are going to see.",2
9790,Raj,23, He‰Ûªs right.,2
9791,Howard,23," Yeah, wow.",2
9792,Sheldon,23, It is remarkable.,2
9793,Raj,23," So, who‰Ûªs up for a movie?",2
9794,Howard,23," Good idea, what do you think? Ice Station Zebra or John Carpenter‰Ûªs The Thing?",2
9795,Raj,23, I say double feature.,2
9796,Leonard,23, Dinner‰Ûªs ready!,2
9797,Sheldon,23, What are we having?,2
9798,Leonard,23, Reconstituted Thai food.,2
9799,Sheldon,23, Did you bring the dehydrated low-sodium soy sauce?,2
9800,Leonard,23, Check.,2
9801,Sheldon,23, Freeze-dried spicy mustard?,2
9802,Leonard,23, Check.,2
9803,Sheldon,23," Flash-frozen brown rice, not white?",2
9804,Leonard,23," Uh, oh, sorry.",2
9805,Sheldon,23, Not to worry. I hid it. Bazinga! You‰Ûªre in my spot.,2
9806,Howard,23, There‰Ûªs no time for a crossbow. Find me an icicle.,2
9807,Sheldon,23, Three months. This is gonna be great!,2
9808,Scene,1," Opening shows some scenes from the final episode of the previous season, followed by the caption ‰ÛÏThree months later.‰Û Scene then opens in lobby, with the guys arriving home from the North Pole. All have long hair and bushy beards except Sheldon, whose hair is slightly longer and who has a goatee. ",3
9809,Leonard,1," Oh, thank God we‰Ûªre home.",3
9810,Howard,1, I can‰Ûªt believe we spent three months in that frozen hell.,3
9811,Raj,1, It was like a snowy nightmare from which there was no awakening.,3
9812,Sheldon,1," I don‰Ûªt know what Arctic expedition you guys were on, but I thought it was a hoot and a half.",3
9813,Scene,1, The apartment door. Sheldon is on the phone.,3
9814,Sheldon,1," Oh, hi mom. No, I told you I‰Ûªd call you when I got home, I‰Ûªm not home yet. (Walks through door) Alright, I‰Ûªm home. The Arctic expedition was a remarkable success, I‰Ûªm all but certain there‰Ûªs a Nobel Prize in my future. Actually, I shouldn‰Ûªt say that. I‰Ûªm entirely certain. No, mother, I could not feel your church group praying for my safety. The fact that I‰Ûªm home safe is not proof that it worked, that logic is Post Hoc Ergo Propter Hoc. No, I‰Ûªm not sassing you in Eskimo talk.",3
9815,Leonard,1, I‰Ûªm going to go let Penny know we‰Ûªre back.,3
9816,Sheldon,1," Mother, I have to go. Yeah, love you. Bye. (To his spot) Hello, old friend. (Sits) Daddy‰Ûªs home.",3
9817,Scene,1, Penny‰Ûªs door.,3
9818,Penny,1," Leonard, you‰Ûªre back.",3
9819,Leonard,1," Yeah, I just stopped by to say‰Û_ (she grabs him and kisses him) Yeah, so, hi!",3
9820,Penny,1," Hi! (They stumble, kissing, into her apartment and slam the door shut)",3
9821,Howard,1," Dammit, I should have gone over and told her we were back.",3
9822,Raj,1," Yeah, it was first come, first served.",3
9823,Scene,1, A moment later.,3
9824,Sheldon,1," I just want you both to know, when I publish my findings, I won‰Ûªt forget your contributions.",3
9825,Howard,1, Great.,3
9826,Raj,1, Thanks.,3
9827,Sheldon,1," Of course, I can‰Ûªt mention you in my Nobel acceptance speech, but when I get round to writing my memoirs you can expect a very effusive footnote, and perhaps a signed copy.",3
9828,Raj,1, We have to tell him.,3
9829,Sheldon,1, Tell me what?,3
9830,Howard,1, Damn his Vulcan hearing.,3
9831,Sheldon,1," You fellows are planning a party for me, aren‰Ûªt you?",3
9832,Howard,1," Okay, Sheldon, sit down.",3
9833,Sheldon,1," If there‰Ûªs going to be a theme, I should let you know that I don‰Ûªt care for luau, toga or under the sea.",3
9834,Howard,1," Yeah, we‰Ûªll keep that in mind, look, we need to talk to you about something that happened at the North Pole.",3
9835,Sheldon,1," If this is about the night the heat went out, there‰Ûªs nothing to be embarrassed about.",3
9836,Raj,1, It‰Ûªs not about that.,3
9837,Howard,1, And we agreed to never speak of it again.,3
9838,Sheldon,1, So we slept together naked. It was only to keep our core body temperatures from plummeting.,3
9839,Howard,1, He‰Ûªs speaking about it.,3
9840,Raj,1," For me, it was a bonding moment.",3
9841,Howard,1," Sheldon, you remember the first few weeks we were looking for magnetic monopoles and not finding anything and you were acting like an obnoxious, giant dictator?",3
9842,Raj,1, I thought we were going to be gentle with him.,3
9843,Howard,1," That‰Ûªs why I added the tator. And then when we found our first positive data, you were so happy.",3
9844,Sheldon,1," Oh, yes. In the world of emoticons, I was colon, capital D.",3
9845,Howard,1," Well, in actuality, what your equipment detected wasn‰Ûªt so much evidence of paradigm-shifting monopoles as it was‰Û_ static from the electric can opener we were turning on and off.",3
9846,Raj,1," He just went colon, capital O.",3
9847,Sheldon,1, You tampered with my experiment?,3
9848,Howard,1, We had to.,3
9849,Raj,1, It was the only way to keep you from being such a huge Dickensian. You see that? I added the ensian.,3
9850,Sheldon,1, Did Leonard know about this? Leonard‰Ûªs my best friend in the world. Surely Leonard didn‰Ûªt know.,3
9851,Howard,1," Actually, it was his idea.",3
9852,Sheldon,1, Of course it was. The whole plan reeks of Leonard.,3
9853,Scene,1, Penny‰Ûªs apartment. ,3
9854,Penny,1, I missed you so much.,3
9855,Leonard,1," I missed you, too.",3
9856,Penny,1, I couldn‰Ûªt even think of anyone else while you were gone.,3
9857,Leonard,1," Me, neither. Except for one night when the heat went out. Long story, it‰Ûªs‰Û_ don‰Ûªt ask.",3
9858,Sheldon,1," (Knock, knock, knock) Leonard. (Knock, knock, knock) Leonard. (Knock, knock, knock) Leonard.",3
9859,Leonard (whispering),1, Do not make a sound.,3
9860,Sheldon,1, Whispering do not make a sound is a sound.,3
9861,Leonard,1," Damn his Vulcan hearing. Not a good time, Sheldon.",3
9862,Sheldon,1," (Knock, knock, knock) Penny. (Knock, knock, knock) Penny. (Knock, knock, knock) Penny.",3
9863,Penny,1," Oh, this is ridiculous. What?",3
9864,Sheldon,1," Hello, Penny. I realize you‰Ûªre currently at the mercy of your primitive biological urges, but as you have an entire lifetime of poor decisions ahead of you, may I interrupt this one?",3
9865,Penny,1, It‰Ûªs great to see you too. Come on in.,3
9866,Sheldon,1, Wolowitz has informed me of your grand deception. Do you have anything to say for yourself?,3
9867,Leonard,1," Yes, I feel terrible about it. I will never forgive myself, I don‰Ûªt expect you to either, and I would really appreciate it if you would leave me with Penny for a session of self-criticism and repentance.",3
9868,Penny,1," Okay, can someone please tell me what‰Ûªs going on here?",3
9869,Sheldon,1," What‰Ûªs going on is I was led to believe I was making groundbreaking strides in science, when in fact, I was being fed false data at the hands of Wolowitz, Koothrappali and your furry little boy toy.",3
9870,Penny,1, Is that true?,3
9871,Leonard,1, It was the only way to make him happy.,3
9872,Penny,1, Why did you have to make him happy?,3
9873,Leonard,1," Because when he wasn‰Ûªt happy, we wanted to kill him. There was even a plan. We were going to throw his Kindle outside, and when he went to get it, lock the door and let him freeze to death.",3
9874,Sheldon,1, That seems like a bit of an overreaction.,3
9875,Leonard,1," No, the overreaction was the plan to tie your limbs to four different sled dog teams and yell mush. Look, we kept the original data. You can still publish the actual results.",3
9876,Sheldon,1," Yes, but the actual results are unsuccessful and I‰Ûªve already sent an e-mail to everyone at the university explaining that I have confirmed string theory and forever changed man‰Ûªs understanding of the universe.",3
9877,Leonard,1," Aw, see, yeah, you probably shouldn‰Ûªt have done that. So write another e-mail, set the record straight, it‰Ûªs no big deal.",3
9878,Sheldon,1," You‰Ûªre right, Leonard, it‰Ûªs not a big deal. All you did was lie to me destroy my dream and humiliate me in front of the whole university. That, FYI, was sarcasm. I, in fact, believe it is a big deal",3
9879,Penny,1," Oh, the poor thing.",3
9880,Leonard,1," Yeah, I feel terrible.",3
9881,Penny,1," Wait, wait. Aren‰Ûªt you going to go talk to him?",3
9882,Leonard,1," What? Uh, he‰Ûªll be fine, the guy‰Ûªs a trouper, come here.",3
9883,Penny,1," No, you‰Ûªre right, you shouldn‰Ûªt talk to him. I will.",3
9884,Leonard,1," Man, I cannot catch a break.",3
9885,Scene,1, Sheldon‰Ûªs bedroom. Penny knocks and enters.,3
9886,Penny,1, Hey. Do you want to talk?,3
9887,Sheldon,1, About what? Being betrayed by my friends? Spending three months at the North Pole for nothing? And I didn‰Ûªt even get to go to Comic-Con!,3
9888,Penny,1," Oh, hon‰Û_ Uh‰Û_ (singing)  Soft kitty, warm kitty‰Û_",3
9889,Sheldon,1, That‰Ûªs for when I‰Ûªm sick. Sad is not sick.,3
9890,Penny,1, Oh. Sorry. I don‰Ûªt know your sad song.,3
9891,Sheldon,1, I don‰Ûªt have a sad song. I‰Ûªm not a child.,3
9892,Penny,1," Well, you know, I do understand what you‰Ûªre going through.",3
9893,Sheldon,1, Really? Did you just have the Nobel Prize in waitressing stolen from you?,3
9894,Penny,1," Well, no, but when I was a senior in high school, one of my friends heard I was going to be named head cheerleader. Oh, I was so excited. My mom even made me a celebration pie. Then they named stupid Valerie Mossbacher head cheerleader. Big ol‰Ûª slutbag.",3
9895,Sheldon,1, Are you saying that you think a celebration pie is even remotely comparable to a Nobel Prize?,3
9896,Penny,1," Well, they‰Ûªre pretty tasty.",3
9897,Sheldon,1," And on a different, but not unrelated topic, based on your current efforts to buoy my spirits, do you truly believe that you were ever fit to be a cheer leader?",3
9898,Penny,1," Look, Sheldon, I just don‰Ûªt think that the guys and Leonard really meant to hurt you. You know? They just told an unfortunate lie to deal with a difficult situation. Okay, you know what it‰Ûªs like? Remember that scene in the new Star Trek movie when Kirk has to take over the ship, so he tells Spock all that stuff he knew wasn‰Ûªt true, like saying Spock didn‰Ûªt care his mom died?",3
9899,Sheldon,1, I missed Comic-Con and the new Star Trek movie!,3
9900,Scene,1, The university cafeteria. The guys have shaved and had haircuts. Howard has kept his moustache.,3
9901,Raj,1, I like the new look.,3
9902,Howard,1, Thanks. I call it the Clooney.,3
9903,Raj,1," I call it the Mario and Luigi, but whatever. Hey, how‰Ûªs Sheldon doing?",3
9904,Leonard,1," Well, he came out of his room this morning wearing his Darth Vader helmet and tried to choke me to death with the Force, so I‰Ûªd say, a little better.",3
9905,Howard,1," If I may abruptly change the subject, did you and Penny finally‰Û_ you know.",3
9906,Leonard,1, Howard‰Û_,3
9907,Howard,1," Personally, I don‰Ûªt care, but my genitals wanted me to ask.",3
9908,Leonard,1," Well, tell your genitals what I do with Penny is none of their business.",3
9909,Howard (to his genitals),1, He says they didn‰Ûªt do it.,3
9910,"Leonard (to Sheldon, entering)",1," Sheldon, over here. (Sheldon sits at another table and tries to choke all three to death with the force. Raj pretends he is choking.) ",3
9911,Howard,1, What are you doing?,3
9912,Raj,1, I feel bad for the guy.,3
9913,Leonard,1," Sheldon, why are you sitting by yourself?",3
9914,Sheldon,1," Because I am without friends. Like the proverbial cheese, I stand alone. Even while seated.",3
9915,Leonard,1, Come on. We said we were sorry.,3
9916,Sheldon,1, It‰Ûªs going to take more than I‰Ûªm sorry and a store-bought apology pie from Penny to make up for what you‰Ûªve done to me.,3
9917,Kripke (arriving),1," Hey, Cooper. Wead your wetwaction e-mail. Way to destroy your weputation.",3
9918,Sheldon,1, You see? People have been pointing and laughing at me all morning.,3
9919,Kripke,1, That‰Ûªs not twue. People have been pointing and waughing at you your whole wife.,3
9920,Sheldon,1," All right, I‰Ûªve had enough. Attention, everyone. I‰Ûª m Dr. Sheldon Cooper. As many of you in the physics department might know, my career trajectory has taken a minor detour.",3
9921,Kripke,1, Off a cwiff.,3
9922,Sheldon,1, My credibility may have been damaged‰Û_,3
9923,Kripke,1, Compwetely wecked.,3
9924,Sheldon,1," But I would like to remind you that in science, there‰Ûªs no such thing as failure. There once was a man who referred to his prediction of a cosmological constant as the single biggest blunder of his career. That man‰Ûªs name was, surprise, surprise, Albert Einstein.",3
9925,Kripke,1," Yeah, but wesearch into Dark Energy pwoved that Einstein‰Ûªs cosmowogical constant was actually wight all along, so you‰Ûªre still, surpwise, surpwise, a woser.",3
9926,Sheldon,1," Oh, you think you‰Ûªre so clever. Well, let me just tell you, while I do not currently have a scathing retort, you check your e-mail periodically for a doozy.",3
9927,Leonard,1, So much for our friendship with Sheldon.,3
9928,Raj,1," Well, we‰Ûªll always have the night the heat went out.",3
9929,Scene,1, Penny‰Ûªs apartment.,3
9930,Penny,1, Hi.,3
9931,Leonard,1," Hey. Listen, since we got, you know, interrupted last night, I didn‰Ûªt have a chance to give you this.",3
9932,Penny,1," Oh, Leonard, you shouldn‰Ûªt have. Oh, boy! What is it?",3
9933,Leonard,1, It‰Ûªs a snowflake. From the North Pole.,3
9934,Penny,1, Are you serious?,3
9935,Leonard,1, Uh-huh. It‰Ûªll last forever. I preserved it in a one percent solution of polyvinyl acetal resin.,3
9936,Penny,1," Oh, my God. That‰Ûªs the most romantic thing anyone‰Ûªs ever said to me that I didn‰Ûªt understand.",3
9937,Leonard,1," It‰Ûªs actually a pretty simple process. You see, cyanoacrylate are monomers which polymerize on‰Û_ (she kisses him) ",3
9938,Howard (arriving),1," Red alert, Leonard. Sheldon ran away.",3
9939,Leonard,1," Man, I can not catch a break.",3
9940,Penny,1," So, how do you know he ran away?",3
9941,Howard,1," Well, he‰Ûªs not answering his phone, he handed in his resignation at the university and he sent me a text that said, I‰Ûªm running away.",3
9942,Leonard,1," Okay, well, thanks for letting me know.",3
9943,Penny,1," Well, Leonard, aren‰Ûªt you going to do something?",3
9944,Leonard,1," Of course I‰Ûªm going to do something. Uh, Howard, you check the comic book store. Raj, go to the Thai restaurant. I‰Ûªll stay here with Penny in her apartment. (His phone rings) Oh, damn it. It‰Ûªs Sheldon‰Ûªs mother. A break cannot be caught. Hi, Mrs. Cooper. He is? Sheldon went home to Texas. Yeah, no, I know he resigned. Yes, I guess it kind of is our fault. No, no, no, you, you‰Ûªre right, someone needs to come talk to him. Don‰Ûªt worry, I‰Ûªll take care of it. Yeah. All right. New plan. Howard, you and Raj go to Texas. I‰Ûªll stay here with Penny in her apartment.",3
9945,Penny,1," Well, you‰Ûªre not gonna go with them?",3
9946,Leonard,1," Well, you know, I gave you the snowflake and we were kissing and‰Û_ Oh, come on, I don‰Ûªt want to go to Texas!",3
9947,Howard,1," Oh, right, and I do? My people already crossed a desert once, we‰Ûªre done.",3
9948,Leonard,1," Trust me, you‰Ûªll be fine. See ya.",3
9949,Penny,1," Well, wait a second, Leonard, come on, how can you not go? He‰Ûªs your best friend.",3
9950,Leonard,1," Yeah, but I already saw him naked. Just come here.",3
9951,Penny,1, No. I promise I will be here when you get back. Just go help Sheldon.,3
9952,Leonard,1, Really?,3
9953,Penny,1, Yeah. We waited a few months. We can wait a few more days.,3
9954,Leonard,1, Maybe you can.,3
9955,Penny,1, Go.,3
9956,Raj,1," Boy, you cannot catch a break, can you?",3
9957,Scene,1, Sheldon‰Ûªs mother‰Ûªs kitchen. ,3
9958,Mrs Cooper,1," Here you go, Shelly.",3
9959,Sheldon,1," Thanks, Mom.",3
9960,Mrs Cooper,1," Hold your horses, young man. Here in Texas, we pray before we eat.",3
9961,Sheldon,1," Aw, Mom.",3
9962,Mrs Cooper,1," This is not California, land of the heathen. Gimme. By His hand we are all‰Û_",3
9963,Sheldon,1, Fed.,3
9964,Mrs Cooper,1," Give us, Lord, our daily‰Û_",3
9965,Sheldon,1, Bread.,3
9966,Mrs Cooper,1, Please know that we are truly‰Û_,3
9967,Sheldon,1, Grateful.,3
9968,Mrs Cooper,1, For every cup and every‰Û_,3
9969,Sheldon,1, Plateful.,3
9970,Mrs Cooper,1," Amen. Now, that wasn‰Ûªt so hard, was it?",3
9971,Sheldon,1, My objection was based on considerations other than difficulty.,3
9972,Mrs Cooper,1, Whatever. Jesus still loves you.,3
9973,Sheldon,1, Thank you for carving a smiley face in my grilled cheese sandwich.,3
9974,Mrs Cooper,1," Oh, I know how to take care of my baby. His eyes came out a little thin, but you can just pretend he‰Ûªs Chinese. So, do you want to talk about what happened with you and your little friends?",3
9975,Sheldon,1, They‰Ûªre not my friends.,3
9976,Mrs Cooper,1," All right. If you recall, when you were little, we sat right here at this very spot and we talked about some of the problems you had getting along with the neighbour kids.",3
9977,Sheldon,1, That was different. They were threatened by my intelligence and too stupid to know that‰Ûªs why they hated me.,3
9978,Mrs Cooper,1," Oh baby, they knew very well why they hated you.",3
9979,Scene,1, A rental car.,3
9980,Leonard,1, I can‰Ûªt believe you bought a red cowboy hat.,3
9981,Howard,1," Hello? I‰Ûªm wearing a red turtleneck. Plus, it was the only boys‰Ûª large they had.",3
9982,Raj,1," I‰Ûªm sorry, this does not look like Texas. Where‰Ûªs the tumbleweeds? Where‰Ûªs the saloons?",3
9983,Leonard,1, Saloons?,3
9984,Raj,1," Yeah, like in the movies I saw growing up in India. You know, uh, Four for Texas, Yellow Rose of Texas.",3
9985,Howard,1, This neighbourhood is more Texas Chainsaw Massacre.,3
9986,Raj,1, I was really hoping to see a cattle drive.,3
9987,Leonard,1, What can I tell you? They probably have steaks on sale at that big-ass Costco over there.,3
9988,Scene,1, Sheldon‰Ûªs mother‰Ûªs house.,3
9989,Leonard,1, Will you please take that stupid hat off?,3
9990,Howard,1," No, I want to blend in.",3
9991,Raj,1, To what? Toy Story?,3
9992,Mrs Cooper,1," Hi, boys.",3
9993,Howard,1," Howdy, ma‰Ûªam.",3
9994,Mrs Cooper,1," Howdy to you, too. You got here quick.",3
9995,Leonard,1, ‰ÛÒ We took the red-eye.,3
9996,Mrs Cooper,1," Well, come on in.",3
9997,Howard,1, Thank you kindly.,3
9998,Mrs Cooper,1, Can I‰Û_ Can I get you something to drink?,3
9999,Leonard,1," Uh, no, thank you.",3
10000,Howard,1," If y‰Ûªall don‰Ûªt mind, I got a hankerin‰Ûª for a Lone Star beer.",3
10001,Mrs Cooper,1, There‰Ûªs no alcohol in this household. Stop talking like that and lose the hat.,3
10002,Howard,1, Sorry. I‰Ûªll take a diet Yoo-Hoo if you have it.,3
10003,Mrs Cooper,1," You‰Ûªll take a Cola.* What about you? Radge, isn‰Ûªt it? Oh, you still having trouble talking to the ladies? Because, you know, at our church we have a woman who‰Ûªs an amazing healer. Mostly she does, uh, crutch and wheelchair people, but I bet she‰Ûªd be willing to take a shot at whatever Third World demon is running around inside of you.",3
10004,Mrs Cooper,1, A girl?,3
10005,Leonard,1," Uh, yes, ma‰Ûªam.",3
10006,Mrs Cooper,1," Oh, good. I‰Ûªve been praying for you. Oh, Sheldon.",3
10007,Sheldon,1, What are they doing here?,3
10008,Leonard,1, We came to apologize.,3
10009,Howard,1, Again.,3
10010,Leonard,1," And bring you home. So, why don‰Ûªt you pack up your stuff and we‰Ûªll head back.",3
10011,Leonard,1," No, this is my home now. Thanks to you, my career is over and I will spend the rest of my life here in Texas trying to teach evolution to creationists.",3
10012,Mrs Cooper,1," You watch your mouth, Shelly. Everyone‰Ûªs entitled to their opinion.",3
10013,Sheldon,1," Evolution isn‰Ûªt an opinion, it‰Ûªs fact.",3
10014,Mrs Cooper,1, And that is your opinion.,3
10015,Sheldon,1, I forgive you. Let‰Ûªs go home.,3
10016,Mrs Cooper,1, Don‰Ûªt tell me prayer doesn‰Ûªt work.,3
10017,Scene,1, In Penny‰Ûªs bed.,3
10018,Leonard,1, How about that? I finally caught a break.,3
10019,Penny,1, Uh-huh.,3
10020,Leonard,1, You know how they say when friends have sex it can get weird?,3
10021,Penny,1, Sure.,3
10022,Leonard,1, Why does it have to get weird?,3
10023,Penny,1, I don‰Ûªt know.,3
10024,Leonard,1," I mean, we were friends, and now we‰Ûªre more than friends. We‰Ûªre whatever this is. But why label it, right? I mean, it is what it is and‰Û_",3
10025,Penny,1, Leonard?,3
10026,Leonard,1, Yeah?,3
10027,Penny,1, It‰Ûªs weird.,3
10028,Leonard,1, Totally.,3
10029,Scene,2, The comic book store.,3
10030,Howard,2," Sheldon, you‰Ûªre wrong. Wolverine was not born with bone claws.",3
10031,Sheldon,2," Howard, you know me to be a very smart man. Don‰Ûªt you think if I were wrong, I‰Ûªd know it?",3
10032,Howard,2," Okay, first of all‰Û_",3
10033,Raj,2," Give it up, dude, you‰Ûªre arguing with a crazy person.",3
10034,Sheldon,2, I‰Ûªm not crazy. My mother had me tested.,3
10035,Leonard,2," Hey, guys.",3
10036,Howard,2, What are you doing here?,3
10037,Leonard,2, What do you mean? It‰Ûªs new comic book night.,3
10038,Raj,2," Yeah, but since you and Penny finally hooked up, we thought you two would be having bouncy naked yum-yum night.",3
10039,Leonard,2," There‰Ûªs more to life than sex, Raj.",3
10040,Howard,2," Okay, who had Leonard flames out with Penny in less than 24 hours‰Û?",3
10041,Sheldon,2, I did.,3
10042,Leonard,2," Nothing flamed out. We don‰Ûªt have to have sex every night, you know.",3
10043,Howard,2," You don‰Ûªt have to, but it‰Ûªs highly recommended.",3
10044,Raj,2," Yeah, take advantage of that window of opportunity before it slams shut on your little dinky.",3
10045,Leonard,2, It‰Ûªs not a matter of opportunity. We‰Ûªre getting to know each other. There‰Ûªs a learning curve.,3
10046,Howard,2," What‰Ûªs there to learn? You get naked, do nasty things to each other, then somebody makes scrambled eggs and salami. Easy peasy.",3
10047,Sheldon,2, Perhaps what Leonard is obliquely referring to is the occurrence of some sort of sexual dysfunction.,3
10048,Raj,2," Okay, who had Leonard gets a floppy disk?",3
10049,Sheldon,2," Oh, a clever, albeit obsolete, euphemism for insufficient blood flow to the male sex organ.",3
10050,Leonard,2," Nothing like that happened, all right? The sex was just fine.",3
10051,Raj,2," Just fine? Oh, dude, the fourth Harry Potter movie was just fine.",3
10052,Leonard,2," I‰Ûªm not saying it was bad, I‰Ûªm just saying it‰Û_ wasn‰Ûªt great.",3
10053,Howard,2," Okay, when you say ‰ÛÏit wasn‰Ûªt great, do you mean for both of you? Because we can totally see it not being great for her. Am I right?",3
10054,Raj,2," Oh, yeah.",3
10055,Leonard,2," To tell you the truth, I think we were both a little, I don‰Ûªt know‰Û_",3
10056,Raj,2, Disappointed? Let down?,3
10057,Howard,2, Ashamed? Horrified? Repulsed?,3
10058,Leonard,2," All I know is, it wasn‰Ûªt the way I dreamed it would be.",3
10059,Howard,2, Sex is never the way I dream it‰Ûªs gonna be.,3
10060,Raj,2, That‰Ûªs because in your dreams you‰Ûªre a horse from the waist down.,3
10061,Scene,2, The apartment.,3
10062,Leonard,2," Sheldon, dinner‰Ûªs here.",3
10063,Sheldon,2, Tandoori Palace?,3
10064,Leonard,2," No, we went somewhere new.",3
10065,Sheldon,2," You‰Ûªre good-naturedly ribbing me, aren‰Ûªt you?",3
10066,Leonard,2," No, look, Mumbai Palace.",3
10067,Sheldon,2, Why? Why would we change? We had a perfectly good palace. Tandoori Palace is our palace.,3
10068,Leonard,2," Trust me, this will be just fine.",3
10069,Howard,2, You are the authority on just fine.,3
10070,Leonard,2, What‰Ûªs that supposed to mean?,3
10071,Howard (after Raj whispers to him),2," Yeah, exactly. Not bad, but not great.",3
10072,Penny,2, What are they talking about?,3
10073,Leonard,2, I don‰Ûªt know,3
10074,Sheldon,2, I know. As I‰Ûªm sure you‰Ûªre aware‰Û_,3
10075,Leonard,2, Duh-duh-duh-duh-duh-duh.,3
10076,Sheldon,2," If that‰Ûªs Morse code, that‰Ûªs terrible. As I was saying, you and Leonard had a disappointing sexual encounter. Earlier this evening, Leonard characterized it as just fine. So what you‰Ûªre seeing here is a continuation of the mocking that followed.",3
10077,Penny,2," Okay, yeah, well, I‰Ûªm just gonna go eat my dinner elsewhere. Maybe an airplane headed for a mountainside.",3
10078,Leonard,2," Penny, wait. Aagh! What is wrong with you?",3
10079,Sheldon,2, I sense I may have crossed some sort of line.,3
10080,Raj,2," Yeah, you‰Û_",3
10081,Howard,2," Uh, no, no, no, don‰Ûªt tell him, let‰Ûªs see if he can figure it out.",3
10082,Penny,2," Ugh, I am so embarrassed!",3
10083,Leonard,2, Please don‰Ûªt be mad.,3
10084,Penny,2, What did you tell them?,3
10085,Leonard,2," Nothing bad, just that last night was fine.",3
10086,Penny,2, Fine? You said it was fine?,3
10087,Leonard,2," Yeah, it‰Ûªs a perfectly good word. You put it in front of wine or dining, and you‰Ûªve really got something. Okay, well, let me ask you this, how was last night for you?",3
10088,Penny,2, It was‰Û_ okay.,3
10089,Leonard,2, Okay?,3
10090,Penny,2," Yeah, it‰Ûªs a perfectly good word. I mean, you put it in front of dokay and you really got something. All right, look, let‰Ûªs not overreact, you know? For a lot of couples, it takes time to get to know each other‰Ûªs rhythms. Learn what the other person wants and likes.",3
10091,Leonard,2," So, you‰Ûªve been through this before?",3
10092,Penny,2, No.,3
10093,Leonard,2, Okay-dokay.,3
10094,Penny,2," You know, I think this is one of those things where talking about it is not going to make it better. Want a glass of wine?",3
10095,Leonard,2, So much.,3
10096,Penny,2," Okay. See, we should‰Ûªve done this last night, you know, have a little wine, take the edge off.",3
10097,Leonard,2," Actually, ethyl alcohol inhibits electrical conduction in the nerve cells and stimulates reuptake receptors of inhibitory neurotransmitters like gamma-aminobutyric acid.",3
10098,Penny,2," Don‰Ûªt talk, just drink.",3
10099,Howard,2," No, you‰Ûªre misunderstanding. A shiksa goddess isn‰Ûªt an actual goddess and we don‰Ûªt pray to them, we prey on them.",3
10100,Raj,2," Whatever, dude. The point is, Leonard‰Ûªs got one and you don‰Ûªt.",3
10101,Sheldon,2," Is this it? It was inappropriate to discuss Leonard and Penny‰Ûªs sex life in front of Leonard and Penny. (Howard indicates that he has got it.) Oh, good! Now I can eat.",3
10102,Raj,2, What‰Ûªs that?,3
10103,Howard,2, Sounds like a cricket.,3
10104,Sheldon,2," Hang on. Based on the number of chirps per minute and the ambient temperature in this room, it is a snowy tree cricket.",3
10105,Howard,2," Oh, give me a frickin‰Ûª break. How could you possibly know that?",3
10106,Sheldon,2," In 1890, Emile Dolbear determined that there was a fixed relationship between the number of chirps per minute of the snowy tree cricket and the ambient temperature. A precise relationship that is not present with ordinary field crickets.",3
10107,Raj,2, How do you know what the exact temperature of the room is?,3
10108,Sheldon,2," Under the terms of my roommate agreement with Leonard, I‰Ûªve had unilateral control of the thermostat ever since the sweaty night of ‰Ûª06.",3
10109,Howard,2," Okay, you were right about Wolverine and bone claws, but you‰Ûªre wrong about the cricket.",3
10110,Sheldon,2," Howard, don‰Ûªt embarrass yourself, the science chirps for itself. Humorous word play.",3
10111,Howard,2," No, no, not this time. I know insects, my friend, I spent many childhood years capturing them with nets, putting them in glass jars, sticking pins through them, mounting them on corrugated cardboard with Dymo labels underneath, identifying the genus and species. In Latin.",3
10112,Raj,2," Oh, dude, you are never getting a shiksa goddess.",3
10113,Sheldon,2, That is a snowy tree cricket. Oecanthus fultoni. I was done with Latin by fifth grade.,3
10114,Howard,2," Okay, okay, tell you what. I am willing to bet anything that‰Ûªs an ordinary field cricket.",3
10115,Sheldon,2, I can‰Ûªt take your money.,3
10116,Howard,2," What‰Ûªs the matter, you chicken?",3
10117,Sheldon,2," I‰Ûªve always found that an inappropriate slur. Chickens are not, by nature, at all timid. In fact, when I was young, my neighbour‰Ûªs chicken got loose and chased me up the big elm tree in front of our house.",3
10118,Raj,2, Chickens can‰Ûªt climb trees,3
10119,Sheldon,2, Thank God.,3
10120,Howard,2," Okay, I believe a chicken made you his bitch. But the cricket thing, I don‰Ûªt buy. Bet me.",3
10121,Sheldon,2, Fair enough. What stake do you propose?,3
10122,Howard,2," I will put up my Fantastic Four number 48, first appearance of Silver Surfer against your Flash 123, the classic Flash of two worlds issue.",3
10123,Sheldon,2," All right, you have a wager.",3
10124,Howard,2, Hmm.,3
10125,Raj,2," Great. Now how are you going to settle it, hmm? There is no way to determine the species of the cricket without examining it.",3
10126,Raj,2, I wonder what the non-pathetic people are doing tonight.,3
10127,Scene,2," Penny‰Ûªs apartment, Penny and Leonard are kissing. They break and look at each other uncomfortably.",3
10128,Leonard,2, More wine?,3
10129,Penny,2, Hit me.,3
10130,Scene,2," The apartment, the guys are still searching for the cricket. They are inside the cupboard.",3
10131,Sheldon,2, I don‰Ûªt see anything.,3
10132,Howard,2, Shh!,3
10133,Raj,2, Hallway. (All try to exit at once and get stuck in doorway.),3
10134,Sheldon,2, One at a time. (Same thing happens again. Eventually they leave the apartment. There is a growling noise.) What was that?,3
10135,Raj,2," My stomach. Indian food doesn‰Ûªt agree with me. Ironic, isn‰Ûªt it?",3
10136,Howard,2, Shh! Elevator shaft.,3
10137,Sheldon,2, Help me open it.,3
10138,Howard,2, Are you crazy? We can‰Ûªt go down an empty elevator shaft.,3
10139,Sheldon,2," Fine, if you don‰Ûªt want to proceed, then you forfeit the bet, and I‰Ûªll take possession of your Fantastic Four.",3
10140,Howard,2, Let‰Ûªs open her up.,3
10141,Sheldon,2, Are you bothered that I can so easily manipulate you?,3
10142,Howard,2," Don‰Ûªt push me, Sheldon. I may be small, but I took kung fu when I was 13, and I remember a good deal of it.",3
10143,Sheldon,2," Oh, really? Well, I grew up with an older brother and a very contentious twin sister and I believe I could easily best you in any physical confrontation, be it noogies, swirlies or the classic why are you hitting yourself?",3
10144,Raj,2," Ooh, big talk from a man who was once treed by a chicken.",3
10145,Scene,2, Penny‰Ûªs apartment.,3
10146,Leonard,2, What are we drinking now?,3
10147,Penny,2, Peppermint schnapps.,3
10148,Leonard,2, Why would you buy peppermint schnapps?,3
10149,Penny,2," Because I like peppermint, and it‰Ûªs fun to say schnapps. Hey, Leonard?",3
10150,Leonard,2, What?,3
10151,Penny,2, Schnapps.,3
10152,Leonard,2," Schnapps. You‰Ûªre right, that is fun.",3
10153,Scene,2, The elevator shaft. Sheldon is inside.,3
10154,Raj,2, Be careful.,3
10155,Sheldon,2," If I were not being careful, your telling me to be careful would not make me careful.",3
10156,Raj (hearing the cricket),2, Stairwell.,3
10157,Sheldon,2," Uh-oh, flashlight went out. I need some batteries. Fellas? Hello? It‰Ûªs really dark down here.",3
10158,Scene,2, Penny‰Ûªs bathroom. Leonard is vomiting in the toilet. ,3
10159,Penny,2," Oh, sweetie. You really can‰Ûªt hold your liquor, can you?",3
10160,Leonard,2," I‰Ûªm okay. Just a little mouthwash, and then I‰Ûªm gonna rock your world. (Penny vomits in sink) Are you okay? (Vomits in toilet again)",3
10161,Scene,2, The university cafeteria. Raj has the cricket in a jar.,3
10162,Raj,2," Ugh, Toby, what did you do in a past life to be so disgusting now?",3
10163,Sheldon,2, His name isn‰Ûªt Toby. Toby is an absurd name for a cricket.,3
10164,Raj,2, What would you name him?,3
10165,Sheldon,2," An appropriate cricket name. For example, Jiminy.",3
10166,Howard,2," All right, Sheldon, here we go, Kleingast‰Ûªs Field Guide to North American Insects. Hey, Toby. Right here, see it? The common field cricket, aka Gryllus assimilis, which is Latin for suck it, you lose.",3
10167,Sheldon,2," Hang on. VoilÌÊ, the snowy tree cricket, aka Oecanthus fultoni, which is Latin for I‰Ûªll suck nothing. Of course I‰Ûªm joking because the Latin for that is nihil exsorbibo.",3
10168,Howard,2," That is not Toby, this is Toby. Raj, what do you think?",3
10169,Raj,2," Oh, I really don‰Ûªt care anymore",3
10170,Leonard,2," God, I had the most horrible night.",3
10171,Raj,2, What happened?,3
10172,Sheldon,2, Obviously another carnal fiasco with the shiksi goddess.,3
10173,Howard,2, Shiksa. Shik-sa.,3
10174,Sheldon,2," Forgive me. Yiddish was not spoken in east Texas. And if it was, it wasn‰Ûªt spoken for long.",3
10175,Howard,2," Yeah, fine, whatever. The point is, you‰Ûªre wrong again.",3
10176,Sheldon,2, We haven‰Ûªt established that I‰Ûªm wrong once.,3
10177,Howard,2," All right. Tell you what, let‰Ûªs go down to the Entomology Department and let Professor",3
10178,Sheldon,2," He‰Ûªs a snowy tree cricket, and his name is Jiminy. (They leave) ",3
10179,Leonard,2, I bet I could throw a rock in this room and come up with three better friends.,3
10180,Scene,2, The Entomology Department.,3
10181,Raj,2, Holy crap. It‰Ûªs like Silence of the Lambs down here. (Howard tickles the back of his neck. He screams) Don‰Ûªt do that!,3
10182,Howard,2, You‰Ûªre such a girl. They‰Ûªre just bugs.,3
10183,Raj,2," Yeah, well, I don‰Ûªt like bugs, okay? They freak me out.",3
10184,Sheldon,2, Interesting. You‰Ûªre afraid of insects and women. Ladybugs must render you catatonic. It was a joke. I made it to lessen your discomfort. You‰Ûªre welcome,3
10185,Prof Crawley (arriving),2, Don‰Ûªt knock. Just walk in. Why be polite to the world‰Ûªs leading expert on the dung beetle?,3
10186,Sheldon,2," Excuse me, are you Professor Crawley?",3
10187,Prof Crawley,2, Who wants to know?,3
10188,Sheldon,2, I‰Ûªm Dr. Cooper from the Physics Department.,3
10189,Prof Crawley,2," Couldn‰Ûªt wait, huh?",3
10190,Sheldon,2, I‰Ûªm sorry?,3
10191,Prof Crawley,2," I haven‰Ûªt even packed yet, and you‰Ûªre already measuring my lab for one of your godless laser machines.",3
10192,Howard,2," No, you don‰Ûªt understand. We just want to ask you a question.",3
10193,Prof Crawley,2," Let me ask you one first. What‰Ûªs a world renowned entomologist with a doctorate and 20 years of experience to do with his life when the university cuts off the funding for his lab, huh?",3
10194,Raj,2, Ask rhetorical questions that make people uncomfortable?,3
10195,Prof Crawley,2, What‰Ûªs your deal? Are they planning to outsource my job to Bangalore?,3
10196,Raj,2, I‰Ûªm from New Delhi. Maybe you should find another entomologist.,3
10197,Sheldon,2," No, no. We‰Ûªre here, let‰Ûªs settle this. Professor, can you identify our cricket?",3
10198,Prof Crawley,2, Of course I can. I can identify every insect and arachnid on the planet. Not that that‰Ûªs going to keep me from having to move in with my daughter in Oxnard. And we‰Ûªre not talking Oxnard at the beach. No! We‰Ûªre talking Oxnard in the onion fields.,3
10199,Howard,2," Well, could you look at Toby?",3
10200,Prof Crawley,2, Toby? What a stupid name for a cricket.,3
10201,Sheldon,2, Told you.,3
10202,Prof Crawley,2, It‰Ûªs a field cricket.,3
10203,Howard,2, Yes!,3
10204,Sheldon,2," No, no, wait. Dr. Crawley, are you sure?",3
10205,Prof Crawley,2," Young man, I‰Ûªve been studying insects since I was eight years old. You know what they used to call me in school? Creepy Crawley.",3
10206,Sheldon,2," Cruel as that may be, that is not in itself a credential.",3
10207,Prof Crawley,2," Let me show you something. See that? That‰Ûªs a Crawley‰Ûªs dung beetle. I discovered it after spending six months slogging through a Bornean rain forest, while my wife was back home shacking up with a two-bit ornithologist who lives on a sailboat and likes to wear boot-cut jeans! So, when I tell you that that‰Ûªs a common field cricket, you can take that to the damn bank! Cause God knows I can‰Ûªt. That tramp took me for everything!",3
10208,Sheldon,2," Well, apparently, I was wrong. Congratulations.",3
10209,Raj,2, Enjoy Oxnard. I‰Ûªm sure your daughter‰Ûªs looking forward to having you.,3
10210,Scene,2, The lobby.,3
10211,Penny,2," Oh, hey, Sheldon. What you got there? A new comic book?",3
10212,Sheldon,2, Old comic book. I just retrieved it from my safe deposit box.,3
10213,Penny,2, What do you have a safe deposit box for?,3
10214,Sheldon,2, Old comic books. I lost this to Wolowitz in an ill-considered cricket wager.,3
10215,Penny,2," What, do they have Wii cricket now? That can‰Ûªt be very popular.",3
10216,Sheldon,2," Penny, I‰Ûªd rather not talk about it.",3
10217,Penny,2," Well, if it makes you feel any better, I‰Ûªm not feeling so hot either.",3
10218,Sheldon,2, Why would that make me feel better?,3
10219,Penny,2," I don‰Ûªt know, empathy? Anyway, I‰Ûªm just saying that you‰Ûªre feeling upset about something with Howard, and I‰Ûªm upset about something with Leonard.",3
10220,Sheldon,2," Yes, yes, the disappointing sex. That‰Ûªs an inexact parallel. You and Leonard can always return to being friends, whereas I can never return to a state in which Wolowitz has not bested me like Mrs. Riley‰Ûªs chicken.",3
10221,Penny,2, What‰Ûªs Mrs. Riley‰Ûªs chicken?,3
10222,Sheldon,2, A chicken that was owned by Mrs. Riley.,3
10223,Penny,2," Okay, forget the chicken.",3
10224,Sheldon,2," Well, I wish I could.",3
10225,Penny,2," No, no. You may be right about me and Leonard.",3
10226,Sheldon,2, Of course I‰Ûªm right What are the odds I‰Ûªd be wrong twice in one week?,3
10227,Penny,2," No, I mean, we can always go back to being friends.",3
10228,Sheldon,2, I just said that. This conversation has started to circle. Meeting adjourned.,3
10229,Scene,2, The apartment,3
10230,Sheldon,2, Hello.,3
10231,Leonard,2, Hey. What‰Ûªs going on?,3
10232,Sheldon,2," Oh, you‰Ûªd like to catch up on the events of the day. All right. Well, there was a half-hour wait at the bank to get into my safe deposit box, I was forced to talk to Penny about your sexual problems, and, oh, yes, in a moment filled with biblical resonance, pride wenteth before my fall, causing my Flash 123 to goeth to Wolowitz.",3
10233,Leonard,2, Wait a minute. You talked to Penny about our sex life?,3
10234,Sheldon,2," Leonard, it astonishes me how you continually fixate on the trivial. I lost a bet to Wolowitz.",3
10235,Leonard,2," Right, right. You‰Ûªre saying you talked to Penny?",3
10236,Sheldon,2,åÊ Yes.,3
10237,Leonard,2, Interesting.,3
10238,Sheldon,2, Hardly.,3
10239,Leonard,2, Excuse me.,3
10240,Sheldon,2, Have I crossed some sort of line again?,3
10241,Leonard,2, Little bit. (Exits),3
10242,Sheldon,2," Hmm. Oh, who cares?",3
10243,Scene,2, Penny‰Ûªs doorway.,3
10244,Penny,2," Oh, hey.",3
10245,Leonard,2," Hey. Uh, what did Sheldon say to you?",3
10246,Penny,2, Not a lot. Just that we always have the option of going back to being friends.,3
10247,Leonard,2, Is that what you want?,3
10248,Penny,2," I don‰Ûªt know. I mean, you have to admit things seemed simpler when we were just friends.",3
10249,Leonard,2, I guess.,3
10250,Penny,2, It would take the pressure off.,3
10251,Leonard,2," It would, wouldn‰Ûªt it?",3
10252,Penny,2," So, we‰Ûªll just be friends.",3
10253,Leonard,2," Good, good.",3
10254,Penny,2, Come here. (She gives him a hug. It turns into a big kiss.),3
10255,Leonard (closing door),2, Okay-dokay,3
10256,Scene,3, The apartment kitchen. Penny is cooking breakfast while singing and dancing along to ‰ÛÏMan I Feel Like A Woman‰Û by Shenia Twain. Sheldon enters.,3
10257,Penny,3," Morning, Sheldon. Come dance with me.",3
10258,Sheldon,3, No.,3
10259,Penny,3, Why not?,3
10260,Sheldon,3," Penny, while I subscribe to the many worlds theory which posits the existence of an infinite number of Sheldons in an infinite number of universes, I assure you that in none of them am I dancing.",3
10261,Penny,3, Are you fun in any of them?,3
10262,Sheldon,3, The math would suggest that in a few I‰Ûªm a clown made of candy. But I don‰Ûªt dance.,3
10263,Penny,3," All right, want some French toast?",3
10264,Sheldon,3, It‰Ûªs Oatmeal Day.,3
10265,Penny,3," Tell you what, next French Toast Day, I will make you oatmeal.",3
10266,Sheldon,3," Dear Lord, are you still going to be here on French Toast Day?",3
10267,Leonard,3, Morning.,3
10268,Sheldon,3," Look, Leonard, Penny made French toast.",3
10269,Leonard,3, Sorry. I haven‰Ûªt given her your schedule yet.,3
10270,Sheldon,3," It‰Ûªs an iCal download, she can put it right in her phone. And I thought we agreed that you‰Ûªd have your conjugal visits in her apartment.",3
10271,Leonard,3," We did, but there were extenuating circumstances.",3
10272,Sheldon,3, I see. Did her abysmal housekeeping skills finally trump her perkiness?,3
10273,Leonard,3," No, her bed kind of‰Û_ broke.",3
10274,Sheldon,3, That doesn‰Ûªt seem likely. Her bed‰Ûªs of sturdy construction. Even the addition,3
10275,Penny,3, A homunculus?,3
10276,Leonard,3, Perfectly formed miniature human being.,3
10277,Penny,3," Oh, you‰Ûªre my little homunculus.",3
10278,Leonard,3, Don‰Ûªt do that.,3
10279,Penny,3," Sorry. Okay, who wants syrup and who wants cinnamon sugar?",3
10280,Sheldon,3, I want oatmeal.,3
10281,Penny,3," Yes, well, I want a boyfriend whose roommate isn‰Ûªt a giant pain in the ass.",3
10282,Sheldon,3," I‰Ûªm sure that will happen soon enough. But in the meantime, I still want oatmeal.",3
10283,Penny,3," You know what, I give up. He‰Ûªs impossible.",3
10284,Sheldon,3," I can‰Ûªt be impossible. I exist. I believe what you meant to say is, ‰ÛÏI give up, he‰Ûªs improbable.‰Û",3
10285,Leonard,3," Sheldon, you really need to find a better way of dealing with Penny.",3
10286,Sheldon,3," What am I supposed to do, eat French toast on a Monday? Now, that would be impossible.",3
10287,Leonard,3," I‰Ûªm just saying, you can catch more flies with honey than with vinegar.",3
10288,Sheldon,3, You can catch even more flies with manure. What‰Ûªs your point?,3
10289,Leonard,3, It‰Ûªs a‰Û_ (gives up),3
10290,Sheldon,3," Boy, that does smell good. Too bad it‰Ûªs Monday.",3
10291,Scene,3, The apartment.,3
10292,Penny,3," Okay, so Kim the night manager went on maternity leave, and her husband‰Ûªs name is Sandy, right? So get this, her replacement is a woman named Sandy whose husband‰Ûªs name is Kim.",3
10293,Leonard,3, Wow!,3
10294,Penny,3, I know. What are the odds?,3
10295,Sheldon,3," Easily calculable, we begin by identifying the set of married couples with unisex names. We then eliminate those unqualified for restaurant work, the aged, the imprisoned and the limbless, for example. Next we look at‰Û_",3
10296,Leonard,3," Sheldon! it‰Ûªs an amazing coincidence, can we leave it at that?",3
10297,Sheldon,3," I‰Ûªm sorry. Ooh, Penny, it‰Ûªs as if the Cheesecake Factory is run by witches.",3
10298,Penny,3," Ooh, Sheldon, it‰Ûªs as if you don‰Ûªt think I‰Ûªll punch you.",3
10299,Leonard,3," Come on, you guys, let it go.",3
10300,Penny,3," Fine, whatever. Are you finished?",3
10301,Sheldon,3," Well, thank you. How thoughtful. Would you like a chocolate",3
10302,Penny,3," Um, yeah, sure, thanks.",3
10303,Leonard,3, What was that?,3
10304,Sheldon,3, You said be nice to Penny. I believe offering chocolate to someone falls within the definition of nice.,3
10305,Leonard,3," It does. But in my experience, you don‰Ûªt.",3
10306,Sheldon,3," There are more things in heaven and earth, Horatio, than are dreamt of in your philosophy.",3
10307,Leonard,3," Yeah, yeah, now that‰Ûªs you, obnoxious and insufferable.",3
10308,"Howard (arriving, in goth gear)",3," What‰Ûªs going on, day dwellers?",3
10309,Penny,3," Oh, man, did the Kiss Army repeal don‰Ûªt ask, don‰Ûªt tell?",3
10310,Howard,3, No. Raj and I are going a goth club in Hollywood to hang with the night people. Anybody want to come along?,3
10311,Penny,3," Oh, wow, you‰Ûªre actually going out like that?",3
10312,Howard,3," No, no. I‰Ûªm going out like this. (Whips off jacket to reveal tattoos up both arms)",3
10313,Leonard,3," Howard, what did you do?",3
10314,Howard,3," They‰Ûªre called tattoo sleeves. Look. I bought them online, Raj got a set, too. Fantastic, right? Put them on, have hot sex with some freaky girl with her business pierced, take them off, and I can still be buried in a Jewish cemetery.",3
10315,Sheldon,3," You know, I‰Ûªve always wanted to go to a goth nighclub.",3
10316,Howard,3, Really?,3
10317,Sheldon,3," Bazinga! None of you ever see my practical jokes coming, do you?",3
10318,Howard,3," Okay, how about you two? Look, I‰Ûªve got some extra tat sleeves.",3
10319,Leonard,3, Why are you carrying extras?,3
10320,Howard,3," Well, In case I snag one on someone‰Ûªs nipple ring.",3
10321,Penny,3," Uh, yeah, I think we‰Ûªll pass.",3
10322,Howard,3," Oh, is the missus speaking for the couple now?",3
10323,Leonard,3," In this case, you bet she is.",3
10324,Howard (after Raj whispers),3," Yes, she‰Ûªs pushy and yes, he‰Ûªs whipped, but that‰Ûªs not the expression. Come on, I want to stop at Walgreens and pick up some more eyeliner.",3
10325,Leonard,3, They‰Ûªre gonna get beaten up at that club.,3
10326,Penny,3," They‰Ûªre gonna get beaten up at Walgreens. Oh, sorry, Sheldon, I almost sat in your spot.",3
10327,Sheldon,3, Did you? I didn‰Ûªt notice. Have a chocolate.,3
10328,Penny,3, Thank you.,3
10329,Scene,3, The goth club.,3
10330,Raj,3, I think we‰Ûªre fitting in quite nicely.,3
10331,Howard,3, It‰Ûªd help if you weren‰Ûªt drinking light beer.,3
10332,Raj,3," Oh, what‰Ûªs so gothic about vodka and cranberry juice?",3
10333,Howard,3," Hello, it looks like blood. Did you even read the Wiki How link I sent you on being goth?",3
10334,Raj,3," No, I‰Ûªm behind on my wiki-reading I‰Ûªm kind of on a John Grisham kick right now.",3
10335,Howard,3, What?,3
10336,Raj,3," Well, I finished reading The Pelican Brief and loved it so much, I dived right into The Client. He was a lawyer himself so his novels are accurate as well as entertaining.",3
10337,Howard,3," Just remember we are lost boys, children of the night.",3
10338,Raj,3," Great. Lost boys, children of the night. Got it. Can you pass the Chex mix, please. Thank you. We are lost boys.",3
10339,Girl,3, Good for you.,3
10340,Howard,3, I‰Ûªm actually much morelost than he is.,3
10341,Girl,3, Nice ink.,3
10342,Howard,3, Thanks. Can we buy you ladies a drink?,3
10343,Girl,3, Two light beers.,3
10344,Raj,3," Light beers? Well, Wiki-how about that?",3
10345,Second girl,3, What‰Ûªs your names?,3
10346,Howard,3, I‰Ûªm Howard.,3
10347,Raj,3, Raj.,3
10348,Girl,3, I‰Ûªm Bethany.,3
10349,Howard,3," Nice to meet you, Bethany.",3
10350,Raj,3," Yes, very nice.",3
10351,Bethany,3, Nice to meet you too.,3
10352,Second girl,3, I‰Ûªm Sarah. Not that anyone cares.,3
10353,Raj,3, Do either of you ladies enjoy the novels of John Grisham?,3
10354,Scene,3, The apartment. ,3
10355,Penny,3, What‰Ûªs this cartoon called again?,3
10356,Sheldon,3," And it‰Ûªs not a cartoon, it‰Ûªs anime.",3
10357,Penny,3," Anime. You know, I knew a girl in high school named Anna May. Anna May Fletcher. She was born with one nostril. Then she had this bad nose job and basically wound up with three.",3
10358,Sheldon,3, You‰Ûªre here a lot now.,3
10359,Penny,3," Oh, am I talking too much? I‰Ûªm sorry. Zip.",3
10360,Sheldon,3, Thank you. Chocolate?,3
10361,Penny,3," Yes please. (Her phone rings) Oh. Hey, Kim. Yeah, I‰Û_ (sees Sheldon looking disapprovingly) You know what, hold on, let me take this in the hall. (Sheldon silently offers her another chocolate. She takes it.) You‰Ûªll never guess who they got to replace you at work‰Û_",3
10362,Leonard,3," Okay, I know what you‰Ûªre doing.",3
10363,Sheldon,3, Really?,3
10364,Leonard,3," Yes, you‰Ûªre using chocolates as positive reinforcement for what you consider correct behaviour.",3
10365,Sheldon,3, Very good. Chocolate?,3
10366,Leonard,3," No, I don‰Ûªt want any chocolate! Sheldon, you can‰Ûªt train my girlfriend like a lab rat.",3
10367,Sheldon,3," Actually, it turns out I can.",3
10368,Leonard,3," Well, you shouldn‰Ûªt.",3
10369,Sheldon,3," There‰Ûªs just no pleasing you, is there, Leonard? You weren‰Ûªt happy with my previous approach to dealing with her, so I decided to employ operant conditioning techniques, building on the work of Thorndike and B.F. Skinner. By this time next week, I believe I can have her jumping out of a pool, balancing a beach ball on her nose.",3
10370,Leonard,3," No, this has to stop now.",3
10371,Sheldon,3," I‰Ûªm not suggesting we really make her jump out of a pool. I thought the ‰ÛÏbazinga‰Û was implied. I‰Ûªm just tweaking her personality, sanding off the rough edges if you will.",3
10372,Leonard,3," No, you‰Ûªre not sanding Penny.",3
10373,Sheldon,3," Are you saying that I‰Ûªm forbidden from applying a harmless, scientifically valid protocol that will make our lives better?",3
10374,Leonard,3," Yes, you‰Ûªre forbidden.",3
10375,Sheldon (Squirting him with a water spray),3, Bad Leonard.,3
10376,Scene,3, The goth club.,3
10377,Bethany,3, So what do you guys do?,3
10378,Howard,3," Oh, you know, goth stuff. Goth magazines, goth music.",3
10379,Raj,3, Goth food.,3
10380,Sarah,3, What‰Ûªs goth food?,3
10381,Raj,3, Uh‰Û_ blackened salmon?,3
10382,Bethany,3," No, I meant what do you do for jobs?",3
10383,Raj,3," Oh, we‰Ûªre scientists.",3
10384,Howard,3," Yeah, you know, the dark sciences.",3
10385,Bethany,3, What are the dark sciences,3
10386,Raj,3," Well, I am an astrophysicist and a lot of that takes place at night. When there are vampires and miscellaneous undead out and about.",3
10387,Howard,3, Oy vay.,3
10388,Raj,3, That sounds really cool.,3
10389,Howard,3," Does it? Okay, if you like space stuff, I design components for the international space station. Which is in space. Where, as I‰Ûªm sure you know, no one can hear you scream.",3
10390,Raj,3, So what do you gals do?,3
10391,Bethany,3, I work at the Gap.,3
10392,Howard,3, Really? How about that? I‰Ûªve been to the Gap.,3
10393,Raj,3," Yeah, I‰Ûªve been there as well. I like your tee-shirts with the little pocket.",3
10394,Sarah,3," I work there too. Not that anyone cares. You know, this place is boring.",3
10395,Bethany,3, Yeah. Why don‰Ûªt we go somewhere else and have some fun?,3
10396,Howard,3, Okay.,3
10397,Raj,3," Sure, we like fun.",3
10398,Howard,3, We are fun people.,3
10399,Raj,3, Dark and fun.,3
10400,Bethany,3," Come on, I know a place you‰Ûªll really dig.",3
10401,Howard,3, Did you bring the black condoms?,3
10402,Raj,3, In my fanny pack.,3
10403,Howard,3, Let‰Ûªs go.,3
10404,Scene,3, A tattoo parlour. Bethany is getting a tattoo.,3
10405,Raj,3, Are you happy now?,3
10406,Howard,3, Not particularly.,3
10407,Scene,3, The apartment.,3
10408,Penny (voice outside door),3," Oh‰Ûª my God, she didn‰Ûªt!",3
10409,Leonard,3, What could she possibly be talking about for so long?,3
10410,Sheldon,3," Obviously, waitressing at the Cheesecake Factory is a complex socioeconomic activity, that requires a great deal of analysis and planning. Bazinga! You know, using positive reinforcement techniques, I could train that behaviour out of her in a week.",3
10411,Leonard,3, No.,3
10412,Sheldon,3," If you let me use negative reinforcement, I can get it done before we go to bed.",3
10413,Leonard,3, You‰Ûªre not squirting her in the face with water.,3
10414,Sheldon,3," No, of course not. We‰Ûªre talking very mild electric shocks. No tissue damage whatsoever.",3
10415,Leonard,3, Forget it.,3
10416,Sheldon,3," Oh, come on, you can‰Ûªt tell me that you‰Ûªre not intrigued about the possibility of building a better girlfriend.",3
10417,Leonard,3," I‰Ûªm not. And Penny‰Ûªs qualities, both good and bad, are what make her who she is.",3
10418,Sheldon,3," You mean, like that high-pitched, irritating laugh?",3
10419,Leonard,3, Yes.,3
10420,Leonard,3, You‰Ûªre not changing how Penny laughs.,3
10421,Sheldon,3," No, that would be incongruous, I was going to lower the whole voice to a more pleasing register.",3
10422,Penny (entering),3," Uh, sorry guys, that girl is (high pitched) freaky!",3
10423,Sheldon,3, Come again?,3
10424,Penny (normal voice),3, Freaky.,3
10425,Sheldon (lower voice),3, Freaky?,3
10426,Penny (lower voice),3," Yeah, freaky.",3
10427,Sheldon,3, Have a chocolate.,3
10428,Penny,3, Thank you.,3
10429,Scene,3," The tattoo parlour. Howard is laying down, preparing to have a tattoo on his lower back.",3
10430,Raj,3, Are you seriously going to deface your body just for the possibility you could have cheap sex with a strange girl you met in a bar?,3
10431,Howard,3," Uh, yeah!",3
10432,Raj,3, What is your mother going to say?,3
10433,Howard,3, She‰Ûªs not going to see it. She takes my temperature orally now.,3
10434,Bethany,3," What are you going to get, Howard?",3
10435,Howard,3," Well, I can‰Ûªt really decide between a screaming devil, this mean little skull or Kermit the Frog.",3
10436,Bethany,3, Kermit the Frog?,3
10437,Howard,3," You know (Kermit voice) Hi ho, I‰Ûªm on Howard‰Ûªs butt!",3
10438,Bethany,3," Get the mean little skull, and I‰Ûªll see if I can make him smile.",3
10439,Howard,3," Yeah, I‰Ûªd like the mean little skull, please.",3
10440,Sarah,3," What are you going to get, Raj?",3
10441,Raj,3," With my luck, hepatitis",3
10442,Tattooist,3," Okay, here we go.",3
10443,Howard,3," Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow!",3
10444,Tattooist,3, That‰Ûªs just rubbing alcohol.,3
10445,Howard,3," I know, but it was cold. Ow, ow, ow!",3
10446,Tattooist,3, I‰Ûªm putting on the stencil.,3
10447,Howard,3, What comes after the stencil?,3
10448,Tattooist,3, This.,3
10449,Howard,3," Aaaaaargh! Okay, that‰Ûªs it, no needle, no pain, no tattoo.",3
10450,Bethany,3," What‰Ûªs the big deal, you‰Ûªve done this before.",3
10451,Howard,3," No, I haven‰Ûªt, look. (Rips off tattoo sleeves) I‰Ûªm sorry, I‰Ûªm a fraud, he‰Ûªs a fraud.",3
10452,Raj,3, We‰Ûªre both frauds.,3
10453,Howard,3," Yeah, I think I covered that.",3
10454,Raj,3, But I was summing up.,3
10455,Howard,3," We‰Ûªre not goth, we‰Ûªre just guys.",3
10456,Raj,3," Very, very smart guys.",3
10457,Bethany,3, So you were totally scamming us?,3
10458,Howard,3, Yes. And I wouldn‰Ûªt blame you if you walked out of here and never wanted to see us again. Unless of course our bold honesty has suddenly made us attractive.,3
10459,Bethany,3, I‰Ûªm leaving.,3
10460,Sarah,3, I‰Ûªm leaving too. Not that anyone cares.,3
10461,Raj,3," When we tell this story, let‰Ûªs end it differently.",3
10462,Howard,3, What are you thinking? Maybe a big musical number?,3
10463,Scene,3, The apartment.,3
10464,Sheldon,3," Well, I‰Ûªm going to make some warm milk and then turn in. I trust if you two are planning in engaging in amorous activites, you‰Ûªll keep the decibel level to a minimum.",3
10465,Penny,3, Of course.,3
10466,Sheldon,3, Thank you. (Throws a chocolate. Penny catches it in her mouth),3
10467,Penny,3," Mmm, these are so good",3
10468,Leonard,3, Unbelievable.,3
10469,Penny,3, What?,3
10470,Leonard,3," I was just thinking, we should probably turn in too.",3
10471,Penny,3," well, my new bed got delivered, if you come over and put it together, you can stay at my place.",3
10472,Leonard,3," Really, that‰Ûªs a lot of work, and it‰Ûªs kind of late.",3
10473,Penny,3," Yeah, but if we stay there, we won‰Ûªt have to be quiet.",3
10474,Leonard,3, Let‰Ûªs go.,3
10475,Sheldon,3, Interesting. Sex works even better than chocolate to modify behaviour. I wonder if anyone else has stumbled on to that.,3
10476,Scene,3, Raj‰Ûªs car.,3
10477,Howard,3," Okay, wait, how about this? We say there were four goth girls, the two girls in the club had two friends.",3
10478,Raj,3," I like it, I like it. Did they smell good despite their gothlike nature?",3
10479,Howard,3, What‰Ûªs that got to do with the story?,3
10480,Raj,3, Engaging my olfactory sense helps make it real for me.,3
10481,Howard,3," Fine, they smelled good.",3
10482,Raj,3," Oh, they did. Like jasmine and honeysuckle.",3
10483,Howard,3, Whatever.,3
10484,Raj,3," And then they held hands and did a sexy, demonic hokey-pokey for us.",3
10485,Howard,3," No, no. Look, let me say my story all the way through, and then you can say yours, and then we‰Ûªll pick.",3
10486,Raj,3, I‰Ûªm sorry. Go on.,3
10487,Howard,3," Okay. We got tattoos, and then the four girls took us to their place.",3
10488,Raj,3, But we don‰Ûªt have tattoos. What if someone asks to see our tattoos?,3
10489,Howard,3, We say they‰Ûªre in a very intimate area.,3
10490,Raj,3," Oh, we are bad boys, aren‰Ûªt we?",3
10491,Howard,3," Right, right, so we go back to their place, and then the six of us end up in a hot tub.",3
10492,Raj,3, But we just got tattoos. Wouldn‰Ûªt we be concerned about bacterial infection?,3
10493,Howard,3," True. Okay, forget the hot tub. The point is, we each have a mÌ©nage with sexy goth girls.",3
10494,Raj,3, Wow. What a great night.,3
10495,Howard,3," Yeah. Hey, want to try a country bar tomorrow night.",3
10496,Raj,3," Yeah, maybe we‰Ûªll get lucky with some sexy cowgirls.",3
10497,Howard,3, Could happen.,3
10498,Raj,3, I wonder how they smell.,3
10499,Scene,4, The apartment.,3
10500,Sheldon,4, This movie baffles me every time we watch it.,3
10501,Leonard,4, What do you mean?,3
10502,Sheldon,4," Well, the instructions are very clear, don‰Ûªt feed the gremlins after midnight, don‰Ûªt get the gremlins wet. How hard is that?",3
10503,Penny (arriving),4," Hi, guys. Hi, honey.",3
10504,Leonard,4, Hey.,3
10505,Howard,4," Ooh, we‰Ûªre honey now, are we?",3
10506,Sheldon,4," Yes. Since their relationship became carnal, Penny has upgraded his designated term of endearment, thus distinguishing him from those she calls sweetie, usually in an attempt to soften a thinly-veiled insult.",3
10507,Penny,4, You‰Ûªre boring people sweetie.,3
10508,Sheldon,4," Although, sometimes, she omits the veil entirely.",3
10509,Penny,4," So, what are you guys doing?",3
10510,Howard,4, Celebrating Columbus Day.,3
10511,Leonard,4," We‰Ûªre watching Goonies, Gremlins and Young Sherlock Holmes. They were all written by Chris Columbus.",3
10512,Penny,4, Okay. What do you watch on Thanksgiving?,3
10513,Sheldon,4, The parade.,3
10514,Penny,4," Oh, you know, that reminds me, I usually go back to Nebraska for thanksgiving, but this year they‰Ûªre calling it off on account of my brother‰Ûªs trial.",3
10515,Leonard,4, What‰Ûªs he on trial for?,3
10516,Penny,4," Oh, just a big misunderstanding. You know, you‰Ûªd actually like my brother, he‰Ûªs kind of a chemist. Anyway, I was thinking I‰Ûªd have thanksgiving here, and you are all invited.",3
10517,Leonard,4, Oh. I‰Ûªll be there.,3
10518,Sheldon,4, Will you be serving cranberry jelly or cranberry sauce?,3
10519,Penny,4, I guess I could serve both.,3
10520,Sheldon,4, You guess? You don‰Ûªt seem to have much of a handle on this.,3
10521,Howard,4," Yeah, I really wish I could, Penny, but every year my mother has all the relatives over and cooks up her famous tur-briska-fil.",3
10522,Penny,4, Tur-briska-fil?,3
10523,Howard,4, Turkey stuffed with a brisket stuffed with gefilte fish. It‰Ûªs not as good as it sounds.,3
10524,Penny,4," Raj, what about you?",3
10525,Howard,4," Oh, he usually comes to my house. Right, pal? (Raj bursts into tears and runs away) All right, this year, you don‰Ûªt have to eat the tur-briska-fil. I don‰Ûªt even chew it. I swallow it like pills.",3
10526,Scene,4, A few moments later.,3
10527,Leonard,4," So, what‰Ûªs going on with Raj?",3
10528,Howard,4," Well, the good news is, he has no problem with my mother‰Ûªs tur-brka-fil.",3
10529,Penny,4," Hard to believe, but go on.",3
10530,Howard,4," The bad news is, he says he‰Ûªs getting deported.",3
10531,Leonard,4," What do you mean, he‰Ûªs getting deported?",3
10532,Sheldon,4," I believe it means that the U.S. Government is going to expel him from the country. He could then either return to his native India, emigrate to another country that‰Ûªs willing to accept him, or wander the high seas as a stateless pirate. Personally, I‰Ûªd choose pirate.",3
10533,Howard,4," Penny, would you mind stepping outside so we can speak to him?",3
10534,Penny,4," Ugh, fine. But the man really needs to work on his girl issues.",3
10535,Sheldon,4," Another reason to consider a life of piracy. Even today, I understand that‰Ûªs an all-male profession.",3
10536,Howard,4," Okay, she‰Ûªs gone.",3
10537,Raj,4, Sorry. I lost my cool.,3
10538,Leonard,4," So, what‰Ûªs going on?",3
10539,Raj,4," Okay, here‰Ûªs the deal, six months ago, my research testing the predicted composition of trans-Neptunian objects ran into a dead end.",3
10540,Howard,4, So?,3
10541,Raj,4," So, my visa‰Ûªs only good as long as I‰Ûªm employed at the university, and when they find out I‰Ûªve got squat, they‰Ûªre going to cut me off. By the way, when I say squat, I mean diddly-squat. I wish I had squat.",3
10542,Leonard,4," So, wait, what have you been doing for the past six months?",3
10543,Raj,4," You know, checking e-mail, updating my facebook status, messing up wikipedia entries. Hey, did you know Netflix lets you stream movies on your computer now?",3
10544,Sheldon,4, And you‰Ûªve continued to take the university‰Ûªs money under false pretences? Highly unethical for an astrophysicist. Although practically mandatory for a pirate.,3
10545,Raj,4," I don‰Ûªt want to go back to India. It‰Ûªs hot and loud, and there‰Ûªs so many people. You have no idea, they‰Ûªre everywhere.",3
10546,Howard,4," Okay, guys, think, how do we keep Raj in the country?",3
10547,Penny (from outside),4, Why doesn‰Ûªt he just get another job?,3
10548,Howard (after Raj whispers to him),4, What are you asking me for? I don‰Ûªt know if you can talk now or not.,3
10549,Scene,4, The university cafeteria.,3
10550,Raj,4," Oh, beef, I‰Ûªm going to miss you so much. Do you know, at the Mumbai McDonald‰Ûªs, you can‰Ûªt get a Big Mac? All you can get is a Chicken Maharaja Mac. And the special sauce, curry, which, in India,",3
10551,Leonard,4," Don‰Ûªt worry, you‰Ûªll find another job.",3
10552,Raj,4, Yeah let me start practicing for it. Do you want fries with that Maharaja Mac?‰Û,3
10553,Sheldon,4," Hi, Leonard. Hello, Raj.",3
10554,Raj,4, Hello Sheldon.,3
10555,Sheldon,4," Forgive me, as you know, I‰Ûªm no adept at reading facial cues, but I‰Ûªm going to take a stab here, you‰Ûªre either sad or nauseated.",3
10556,Raj,4, I‰Ûªm sad.,3
10557,Sheldon,4, I was going to say sad. I don‰Ûªt know why I hedged.,3
10558,Raj,4, What are you eating?,3
10559,Sheldon,4, Elbow macaroni with ground hamburger and tomato sauce.,3
10560,Raj,4," Oh, beefaroni. I think I‰Ûªll miss you most of all.",3
10561,Leonard,4, I‰Ûªve always been a little confused about this. Why don‰Ûªt Hindus eat beef?,3
10562,Raj,4, We believe cows are gods.,3
10563,Sheldon,4," Not technically. In Hinduism, cattle are thought to be like God.",3
10564,Raj,4," Do not tell me about my own culture, Sheldon! In the mood I‰Ûªm in, I‰Ûªll take you out, I swear to cow!",3
10565,Sheldon,4, I‰Ûªm sorry.,3
10566,Raj,4," Me, too. I‰Ûªm just, I‰Ûªm a little on edge.",3
10567,Sheldon,4," Understandable. Your entire life seems to be crumbling around you, and your future appears bleak at best.",3
10568,Raj,4, Thank you.,3
10569,Sheldon,4, And you‰Ûªre wrong about Hinduism and cows.,3
10570,Howard (arriving),4," Hey, Raj, guess what. Professor Laughlin is looking for someone to join the stellar evolution research team.",3
10571,Raj,4," You, you‰Ûªre kidding. That‰Ûªs fantastic!",3
10572,Howard,4," Come on, what are you waiting for? Call him and set up an interview.",3
10573,Raj,4, I‰Ûªm on it.,3
10574,Sheldon,4," That‰Ûªs happy, right?",3
10575,Leonard,4, Yeah.,3
10576,Sheldon,4, Nailed it.,3
10577,Scene,4, Professor Laughlin‰Ûªs office.,3
10578,Prof Laughlin,4," Dr. Koothrappali, come on in. I was surprised to hear you were interested In joining our little team. Giving up on those trans-Neptunian objects, are we?",3
10579,Raj,4," No, no, it‰Ûªs a very promising area. In a perfect world I‰Ûªd spend several more years on it. But I just couldn‰Ûªt pass up the opportunity to work with you on your tremendously exciting and not yet conclusively disproved hypothesis.",3
10580,Prof Laughlin,4," Splendid. Uh, please sit down. Can I offer you a sherry?",3
10581,Raj,4," It‰Ûªs a little early, isn‰Ûªt it?",3
10582,Prof Laughlin,4, Not on Proxima Centauri.,3
10583,Raj,4," That‰Ûªs very good. Jolly amusing, but if you don‰Ûªt mind, I‰Ûªll hold off until sunset on titan.",3
10584,Prof Laughlin,4," Oh, well done. I have a feeling you‰Ûªre going to fit in just fine, Dr. Koothrappali.",3
10585,Raj,4," Thank you, sir. (There is a knock on the door. A young woman enters)",3
10586,Woman,4, I‰Ûªm sorry. Am I late?,3
10587,Prof Laughlin,4," No, no, no. Right on time. Dr. Koothrappali, may I present Dr. Millstone from MIT. She‰Ûªll be heading up our data analysis team.",3
10588,Dr Millstone,4," It‰Ûªs nice to meet you, Dr. Koothrappali. I read your paper on Kuiper belt object size distribution. I really enjoyed it. How did you correct for the selection bias? (During this, Raj surreptitiously wanders over to where Prof Laughlin‰Ûªs drinks are, pours himself a large sherry and knocks it back in one.)",3
10589,Raj,4," Well, I ran a simulation that allowed me to correct for the observational efficiency.",3
10590,Dr Millstone,4, That‰Ûªs just fascinating.,3
10591,Raj,4," Thank you. Would you like to hear more about it in my hot tub? So, when do I start?",3
10592,Scene,4, The apartment.,3
10593,Howard,4, What do you mean you didn‰Ûªt get the job? How could you not get it?,3
10594,Raj,4," You know, he‰Ûªs British, I‰Ûªm Indian, ever since Gandhi they haven‰Ûªt liked us very much.",3
10595,Leonard,4," Wait, are you saying that he discriminated against you? Because we should file a complaint.",3
10596,Raj,4," That‰Ûªs okay. A complaint has been filed. So, that‰Ûªs it. That was my last hope. I‰Ûªm going to be deported, sent home in disgrace, exposed to the sardonic barbs of my cousin Sanjay. Or, as you may know him, Dave from AT&T customer service.",3
10597,Howard,4, I‰Ûªm really going to miss you.,3
10598,Raj,4, Will you come visit me in India?,3
10599,Howard,4," Gee, that‰Ûªs, like, a 17-hour flight. How about I meet you halfway?",3
10600,Raj,4, Halfway is 600 miles off the coast of Japan.,3
10601,Howard,4," Tell you what, we‰Ûªll skype.",3
10602,Sheldon (arriving),4, Gentlemen.,3
10603,Leonard,4, Hey.,3
10604,Sheldon,4," Raj, did you get the job with Professor Laughlin?",3
10605,Raj,4, No.,3
10606,Sheldon,4," I assumed as much. But never fear. Like the subordinate male protagonist in countless action movies who disappears half way through the second reel, I have returned to save the day. Odd, usually, he‰Ûªs met by cheers. Anyway, I was thinking about exploring the string theory implications of gamma rays from dark matter annihilations, and it occurred to me that I could benefit‰Û_",3
10607,Leonard,4," Excuse me, Sheldon, how many reels before the subordinate male protagonist gets to his point?",3
10608,Sheldon,4," I‰Ûªm sorry, if you didn‰Ûªt cheer at my entrance, it‰Ûªs too late to buy into the premise. Anyway, I got some extra money from the head of the department, and raj can come work for me.",3
10609,Raj,4, You want me to work with you?,3
10610,Sheldon,4, For me. You‰Ûªre going to have to listen more carefully when you‰Ûªre on the job.,3
10611,Raj,4," Okay, uh, please don‰Ûªt take this the wrong way, but I‰Ûªd rather swim buck-naked across the Ganges with a paper cut on my nipple and die a slow, agonizing death from a viral infection than work with you.",3
10612,Sheldon,4, For me.,3
10613,Scene,4, Sheldon‰Ûªs office.,3
10614,Raj (knocking and entering),4," Sheldon, are you busy?",3
10615,Sheldon,4, Of course I‰Ûªm busy.,3
10616,Raj,4, Shall I wait?,3
10617,Sheldon,4," Yes, please. (After about 30 seconds) How may I help you?",3
10618,Raj,4, I‰Ûªve reconsidered your offer to let me work with you.,3
10619,Sheldon,4, For me.,3
10620,Raj,4," Yes, for you. I do, however, have a few conditions. First, at all times, I am to be treated as a colleague and an equal. Second, my contributions shall be noted in all published material. And third, you are never allowed to lecture me on Hinduism or my Indian culture.",3
10621,Sheldon,4," I‰Ûªm impressed, Raj. Those are very cogent and reasonable conditions.",3
10622,Raj,4, Thank you.,3
10623,Sheldon,4, I reject them all.,3
10624,Raj,4, Then you leave me no choice. I accept the job.,3
10625,Sheldon,4," I‰Ûªm sorry, I believe you‰Ûªve misunderstood. I‰Ûªm not giving you the job. I‰Ûªm simply affording you the opportunity to apply for it. Have a seat, we‰Ûªll get started with the interview.",3
10626,Raj,4, Wha‰Û_ You‰Ûªre kidding!,3
10627,Sheldon,4, Please.,3
10628,Raj,4, All right.,3
10629,Sheldon,4," So, that‰Ûªs what you wear to an interview?",3
10630,Raj,4," Come on, dude, we‰Ûªve been friends for years.",3
10631,Sheldon,4," Oh, pulling strings, are we?",3
10632,Raj,4," Sheldon, for God‰Ûªs sakes, don‰Ûªt make me beg.",3
10633,Sheldon,4, Bazinga! You‰Ûªve fallen victim to another one of my classic practical jokes. I‰Ûªm your boss now. You may want to laugh at that.,3
10634,Scene,4, The apartment.,3
10635,Penny,4," Ah, it‰Ûªs nice having the place to ourselves, isn‰Ûªt it?",3
10636,Leonard,4," Uh-huh. Now that Raj is working for Sheldon, I don‰Ûªt have to chauffeur him around anymore. Plus, yeah, with them working late so much, we get some privacy.",3
10637,Penny,4," Mm-hmm. Hey, want to get a little crazy?",3
10638,Leonard,4, What are you thinking?,3
10639,Penny,4, Let‰Ûªs slide over to Sheldon‰Ûªs spot a make out.,3
10640,Leonard,4, You are a dirty girl.,3
10641,Penny (as the making out is interrupted by a knock on the door),4," Oh, God, how did he know?",3
10642,Howard,4, Hello.,3
10643,Leonard,4," Hi, Howard.",3
10644,Howard,4, Am I interrupting?,3
10645,Leonard,4," Little bit, yeah.",3
10646,Howard,4, Guess I should have called.,3
10647,Penny,4," Yeah, maybe.",3
10648,Howard,4, Tonight‰Ûªs the night I usually go line dancing with Raj at the palomino.,3
10649,Leonard,4, Uh-huh.,3
10650,Howard,4, But he‰Ûªs working with Sheldon.,3
10651,Penny,4," Yes, we know.",3
10652,Howard,4, Want me to leave?,3
10653,Leonard,4," You know, whatever.",3
10654,Howard,4," Okay, I guess I can hang for a little while. So what are we watching? Sex and the city.",3
10655,Penny,4," Hey, I happen to love this movie.",3
10656,Howard,4," Fine, let‰Ûªs watch it. Maybe all our periods will synchronize.",3
10657,Scene,4, Sheldon‰Ûªs office.,3
10658,Sheldon,4," All right, we‰Ûªre going to be designing an experiment to look for the annihilation spectrum resulting from dark matter collisions in space.",3
10659,Raj,4," Ooh, dark matter. We better bring a flashlight. I was making a joke.",3
10660,Sheldon,4, I‰Ûªm the boss. I make the jokes.,3
10661,Raj,4," Sorry, go ahead and make your joke.",3
10662,Sheldon,4," This is not the time for joking. We‰Ûªre doing serious research, which requires complete and utter focus.",3
10663,Raj,4," All right, let‰Ûªs buckle down and work.",3
10664,Raj,4, Sheldon.,3
10665,Sheldon,4, What?,3
10666,Raj,4, I need an aspirin.,3
10667,Sheldon,4, Top desk drawer.,3
10668,Raj,4, Thank you.,3
10669,Sheldon,4, Alright?,3
10670,Raj,4, Yes.,3
10671,Sheldon,4, Good.,3
10672,Scene,4, Penny and Leonard exiting Leonard‰Ûªs bedroom. ,3
10673,Leonard,4, That was fun. Thank you.,3
10674,Penny,4," Leonard, honey, you don‰Ûªt have to say thank you every time we have sex.",3
10675,Leonard,4, Oh. Okay. Tomorrow you‰Ûªre going to get a card in the mail. Just throw it away.,3
10676,Howard,4, Top o‰Ûª the mornin‰Ûªo ya!,3
10677,Leonard,4, What are you doing here?,3
10678,Howard,4," Well, usually, on Sundays, I go with Raj to scam on hippie chicks at the farmers market, but he‰Ûªs still working with Sheldon, so I thought I‰Ûªd come over here and make you guys scrambled eggs and salami. It‰Ûªs the perfect meal for apres l‰Ûªamour.",3
10679,Penny,4," Oh, kill me.",3
10680,Howard,4," By the way, I couldn‰Ûªt help overhearing your big finish. Bravo, Leonard.",3
10681,Penny,4," See, if you had killed me when I said kill me, I wouldn‰Ûªt have had to hear that.",3
10682,Howard,4," What do you guys think? Want to take in a matinee, maybe go rollerblading, catch a step class?",3
10683,Penny,4, Do something.,3
10684,Leonard,4," Yeah, okay. Um, Howard, we need to talk.",3
10685,Howard,4," Sure. ‰Û÷sup, homes?",3
10686,Leonard,4," Uh, please understand that it‰Ûªs not that we don‰Ûªt want you around, but Penny and I occasionally need some alone time.",3
10687,Howard,4," Oh. I get it, I‰Ûªm the third wheel. Sorry, I should have seen that. I‰Ûªll get out of your way. Uh, you‰Ûªre gonna want to eat those eggs while they‰Ûªre still hot.",3
10688,Leonard,4," Thank you. There‰Ûªs lox and cream cheese in the fridge, the bagels are in the oven, I was warming them up.",3
10689,Penny,4, That‰Ûªs great.,3
10690,Howard,4, Ill just hang out with my mom. That‰Ûªs always fun.,3
10691,Leonard,4, Good.,3
10692,Penny,4, Are we terrible people?,3
10693,Leonard,4, I don‰Ûªt know. What do you want me to do?,3
10694,Penny,4," Get him, bring him back.",3
10695,Leonard,4, Are you sure?,3
10696,Penny,4, Yeah.,3
10697,Leonard,4, Okay. Howard come back.,3
10698,Howard,4," Oh, you guys had me scared for a minute.",3
10699,Scene,4, Sheldon‰Ûªs office. Sheldon is writing on the whiteboard.,3
10700,Raj,4," No, no, no, no! That rate is much too low for what we‰Ûªd expect from this collision. Do you understand that we‰Ûªre talking about dark matter colliding in outer space?",3
10701,Sheldon,4, Of course I understand. And who are you to tell me about outer space?,3
10702,Raj,4, I‰Ûªm the astrophysicist. Astro means space.,3
10703,Sheldon,4, Astro means star.,3
10704,Raj,4," Okay, well, let me just tell you, if we were having this argument in my native language, I‰Ûªd be kicking your butt.",3
10705,Sheldon,4, English is your native language.,3
10706,Raj,4," Okay, you got me there, but you‰Ûªre wrong about this!",3
10707,Sheldon,4, There is a fine line between wrong and visionary. Unfortunately you have to be a visionary to see it.,3
10708,Raj,4," My god, you think that every thought that comes out of your head is pure gold. Well, let me tell you something. Some of those thoughts are pure caca.",3
10709,Sheldon,4, Caca?,3
10710,Raj,4, It means doo-doo.,3
10711,Sheldon,4," All right! First of all, Dr. Koothrappali, when I first proposed that you work with me‰Û_",3
10712,Raj,4, Aha! So I am working with you.,3
10713,Sheldon,4," In this context, with me means for me.",3
10714,Raj,4," Ah, well, in this context‰Û_ (blows raspberry)",3
10715,Sheldon,4," Oh! If I‰Ûªm wrong, prove it.",3
10716,Raj,4, Okay. Here‰Ûªs where we derive the mass of the dark matter particle.,3
10717,Sheldon,4," No, no, no, you‰Ûªve misstated the atomic weight of the target.",3
10718,Raj,4, Let me finish.,3
10719,Sheldon,4, You‰Ûªre defacing my work.,3
10720,Raj,4," I‰Ûªm not defacing it, I‰Ûªm fixing it.",3
10721,Sheldon,4, Give me the eraser.,3
10722,Raj,4, No.,3
10723,Sheldon,4, I said give it to me.,3
10724,Raj,4, Come and get it.,3
10725,Sheldon,4," Fine. (Uses hand as an eraser. Then realises his hand is dirty) Oh, lord. Dr. Koothrappali, as your superior, I forbid you from writing on my board!",3
10726,Raj,4, You are not my superior.,3
10727,Sheldon,4, I am in every way.,3
10728,Raj,4," Oh, yeah? Can you do this? (PerformsåÊ complex finger trick*) Nice working with you. I‰Ûªm sorry, for you. (Exits. Sheldon stares a moment, then tries to perform the trick. Fails.)",3
10729,Scene,4, Outside Raj‰Ûªs flat.,3
10730,Sheldon,4," (Knock, knock, knock) Raj. (Knock, knock, knock) Raj. (Knock, knock, knock) Raj.",3
10731,Raj,4, I‰Ûªm busy.,3
10732,Sheldon,4," Doing what? (Performs finger trick again) All right, you‰Ûªve made your point.",3
10733,Raj,4," What do you want, Sheldon?",3
10734,Sheldon,4, I looked over the board and it turns out you were right.,3
10735,Raj,4, So you were wrong.,3
10736,Sheldon,4, I didn‰Ûªt say that.,3
10737,Raj,4, That‰Ûªs the only logical inference.,3
10738,Sheldon,4," Nevertheless, I didn‰Ûªt say it. Anyway, I would like you to come back and work for me.",3
10739,Raj,4, For you or with you?,3
10740,Sheldon,4, In this context for me could mean with me.,3
10741,Raj,4," All right, but I have some conditions.",3
10742,Sheldon,4, I reject them all.,3
10743,Raj,4, I‰Ûªll take the job. See you Monday.,3
10744,Sheldon,4," Wait, you have to drive me home.",3
10745,Raj,4, How did you get here?,3
10746,Sheldon,4, I walked.,3
10747,Raj,4, So walk home.,3
10748,Sheldon,4," I can‰Ûªt. There‰Ûªs a big dog outside. On the way home, we can start thinking about methods of optimizing the detector for 500 GEV particles.",3
10749,Raj,4," All right. (As they walk down the corridor, Eye of the Tiger starts playing again.)",3
10750,Scene,5, The apartment.,3
10751,Howard,5," All right, Raj has played his phantom warlord card, and I am going to back him up with my strangling vines. Choke on that, sucka.",3
10752,Leonard,5," Okay, well, then I‰Ûªll just cut your vines with my ruby sword. That‰Ûªs right, I did it. I cut ‰Ûªem.",3
10753,Penny,5," Um, I have a question.",3
10754,Leonard,5," Warlord beats troll, troll beats elf, elf beats water sprite, and basically everything beats enchanted bunny.",3
10755,Howard,5, Unless you have the carrot power.,3
10756,Penny,5," Okay, I‰Ûªve got another question. When does this get fun?",3
10757,Howard,5, Are we going to talk or are we going to play Mystic Warlords of Ka-ah?,3
10758,Leonard,5, Just play a potion card.,3
10759,Penny,5, Which one?,3
10760,Sheldon,5, It doesn‰Ûªt matter. You can‰Ûªt possibly win.,3
10761,Leonard,5," Sheldon, don‰Ûªt ruin the game.",3
10762,Penny,5, How could he ruin the game?,3
10763,Sheldon,5," Given the cards that have already been played, Penny can only be holding necromancer potions, which are only effective against wraiths and day-walkers, and there are no more of either left to be drawn. The cards remaining in the undrawn stack are four fire weapons, a troll, two ogres and the jewel of Osiris.",3
10764,Leonard,5, See? Ruined.,3
10765,Penny,5," Sheldon, that is incredible.",3
10766,Sheldon,5," From your vantage point, it certainly must seem so.",3
10767,Leonard,5, Sheldon has kind of a photographic memory.,3
10768,Sheldon,5," Photographic is a misnomer. I have an eidetic memory, as I‰Ûªve told you many times. Most recently last year during lunch on the afternoon of may seventh. You had turkey and complained it was dry.",3
10769,Howard,5," Well, I guess game‰Ûªs over.",3
10770,Penny,5," Really? Oh, great. I mean, aw. Okay, I gotta go.",3
10771,Leonard,5, Why?,3
10772,Penny,5," Because the last me I didn‰Ûªt go, I ended up playing Mystic Warlords of Ka.",3
10773,Howard,5, Not Ka. Ka-ah.,3
10774,Penny,5, Ba-eye.,3
10775,Leonard,5, See ya. Still can‰Ûªt believe she‰Ûªs going out with me.,3
10776,Raj,5, Nobody can.,3
10777,Howard,5," That reminds me, I have a bone to pick with you.",3
10778,Leonard,5, What?,3
10779,Howard,5," You and I made a pact that if either of us ever got a hot girlfriend, that person would have his girlfriend hook the other guy up with one of her girlfriends.",3
10780,Leonard,5," Yeah, I don‰Ûªt remember that.",3
10781,Sheldon,5," June 30th, 2004. Opening day of Spider-man 2 at the AMC Pasadena. They only had red icees, no blue.",3
10782,Leonard,5," Oh, yeah.",3
10783,Howard,5," So you‰Ûªve been with Penny for like a month and a half now. Where‰Ûªs my shorty, Morty?",3
10784,Leonard,5," Howard, you can‰Ûªt hold me to that.",3
10785,Howard,5, Why not?,3
10786,Leonard,5," Because when I made that agreement, I didn‰Ûªt think I‰Ûªd ever have a hot girlfriend. And I was positive you never would.",3
10787,Raj,5," Hey, how come I wasn‰Ûªt part of this deal?",3
10788,Sheldon,5, You had left the refreshment stand in order to indulge in your customary preemptive pre-show urination.,3
10789,Raj,5," Oh, so that‰Ûªs how it works? I have a teeny bladder and now I don‰Ûªt get a hot girlfriend?",3
10790,Howard,5," Yeah, Raj, that‰Ûªs how it works.",3
10791,Raj,5, Damn.,3
10792,Scene,5, The university cafeteria.,3
10793,Leonard,5," Oh, damn it. Can I have a napkin?",3
10794,Sheldon,5," I‰Ûªm sorry, no.",3
10795,Leonard,5, But you have a whole bunch of ‰Ûªem.,3
10796,Sheldon,5," Yes, I‰Ûªve moved to a four-napkin system. Lap, hands, face and personal emergencies. If you like, starting tomorrow, I‰Ûªll add a guest napkin, but I‰Ûªm afraid there‰Ûªs nothing I can do for you today. (Leonard steals a napkin) Good luck. That‰Ûªs the face napkin.",3
10797,Howard,5," So, have you talked to Penny yet?",3
10798,Leonard,5," No, I haven‰Ûªt.",3
10799,Howard,5, Why not?,3
10800,Leonard,5," Because I‰Ûªve been busy, because I haven‰Ûªt figured out a way to bring it up, and mostly, and I can‰Ûªt stress how key this is, because I don‰Ûªt want to.",3
10801,Howard,5," Leonard, a pact is a pact. You have to get Penny to fix me up.",3
10802,Leonard,5," It‰Ûªs not that simple. What am I supposed to say? Penny, do you have any friends you‰Ûªd like to never hear from again?",3
10803,Howard,5," Come on, I‰Ûªm smart, I have good job and I have only three percent body fat.",3
10804,Raj,5," It‰Ûªs true. I‰Ûªve seen him at the beach, he‰Ûªs like a human chicken wing.",3
10805,Howard,5," Leonard, come on.",3
10806,Leonard,5, Fine. I‰Ûªll ask if she has a friend for you.,3
10807,Howard,5, A hot friend.,3
10808,Leonard,5, Right.,3
10809,Howard,5, And tall. I want our kids to be able to ride space mountain before they‰Ûªre 20.,3
10810,Leonard,5, I‰Ûªll see what I can do.,3
10811,Raj,5," Hey, Sheldon, guess what I heard today?",3
10812,Sheldon,5," I‰Ûªd imagine you heard any number of things today. When you arrived at work you undoubtedly heard, hello, Raj, how are you, Raj? Given that you‰Ûªre wearing a new sweater-vest, you may have heard new sweater-vest? And possibly, though far less likely, nice sweater-vest.",3
10813,Raj,5, Why don‰Ûªt I just tell you what I heard today.,3
10814,Sheldon,5, That would probably save us some time.,3
10815,Raj,5," Saturday night at the comic book store, they‰Ûªre having a Mystic Warlords of Ka-ah tournament. First prize is five hundred dollars. If we team up, we‰Ûªd be unstoppable.",3
10816,Sheldon,5," I‰Ûªm sorry, Raj, but I have no interest in playing a game in which I find no challenge.",3
10817,Raj,5, What about the money?,3
10818,Sheldon,5, I have money.,3
10819,Raj,5, But this is other money.,3
10820,Sheldon,5, How does it different from the money I have?,3
10821,Raj,5, Half of it will be mine.,3
10822,Sheldon,5, Do you need it to buy a less disturbing sweater-vest?,3
10823,Raj,5," Leonard, help.",3
10824,Leonard,5, Are you kidding? I couldn‰Ûªt even talk him into giving me one of his freakin‰Ûª napkins.,3
10825,Scene,5, Leonard and Penny are in bed.,3
10826,Penny,5," Wow, you really are a genius.",3
10827,Leonard,5," Not really. I googled how to do that. So, listen, have you ever made a pact with someone?",3
10828,Penny,5," You mean, like a pinky swear?",3
10829,Leonard,5," Okay, fine, like a pinky swear.",3
10830,Penny,5," Well, in the first grade, my friend Rosie and I made a pact to marry Bert and Ernie. You know, from Sesame Street?",3
10831,Leonard,5," Yeah, I‰Ûªm familiar with Bert and Ernie.",3
10832,Penny,5, Then we found out we both wanted Ernie. We didn‰Ûªt speak again until middle school.,3
10833,Leonard,5, Over puppets?,3
10834,Penny,5," The heart wants what the heart wants, Leonard.",3
10835,Leonard,5," Okay. Speaking of what the heart wants, um, a long time ago, I made a pact with Wolowitz that kind of involves you.",3
10836,Penny,5," Okay, I don‰Ûªt know where you‰Ûªre going with this, but tread carefully because it may be the last conversation we ever have.",3
10837,Leonard,5," No, no, nothing like that. The deal was that if either of us ever got a girlfriend, we‰Ûªd have her fix the other one up with one of her friends.",3
10838,Penny,5, And you thought a good time to bring this up be right after sex.,3
10839,Leonard,5," Well, I sure as hell wasn‰Ûªt going to bring it up before sex, and during, I was trying to remember what I read on google, so‰Û_",3
10840,Penny,5, I‰Ûªm not hooking Wolowitz up with one of my friends.,3
10841,Leonard,5," Come on, it doesn‰Ûªt have to be a good friend. And you know that deep down inside, Howard‰Ûªs a really nice guy.",3
10842,Penny,5, The problem isn‰Ûªt what‰Ûªs on the inside. It‰Ûªs the creepy candy coating.,3
10843,Leonard,5, Will you at least think about it? Just as a favour to me?,3
10844,Penny,5," Oh, great thing about Ernie, was he never asked me for anything. He just gave.",3
10845,Scene,5, The comic book store.,3
10846,Sheldon,5, Got it. Got it. Got it. Got it. Got it. Got it. Betty and Veronica? Ugh.,3
10847,Stuart,5," Hey, Sheldon, the new Green Lantern figurine‰Ûªs coming in tomorrow. Want me to set one aside for you?",3
10848,Sheldon,5, Thank you. You just robbed me of the opportunity to stumble upon the figurine and make the oh-so-satisfying journey from discovery to desire to possession.,3
10849,Stuart,5," All right, I won‰Ûªt set one aside for you.",3
10850,Sheldon,5, But I must have it.,3
10851,Stuart,5," Okay, I‰Ûªll set one aside for you.",3
10852,Sheldon,5," Thank you. You know, I can buy all these things online. I come here for the personal service.",3
10853,Raj,5," Hey, Stuart, is the Wil Wheaton signed up for the mystic warlords tournament THE Wil Wheaton from Star Trek?",3
10854,Stuart,5," Yeah, he lives around here. Big gamer.",3
10855,Stuart,5," Oh, I‰Ûªm sorry, did I rob you of the opportunity to stumble onto that for yourself?",3
10856,Sheldon,5," You don‰Ûªt understand. Growing up, I idolized Wil Wheaton? Wesley Crusher had an eidetic memory just like me.",3
10857,Raj,5," Oh, what a coincidence. Maybe you can discuss that with him while you‰Ûªre playing in the tournament. Sign here.",3
10858,Sheldon,5," I was such a fan that in 1995, I travelled ten hours by bus to a sci-fi convention in Jackson, Mississippi, wearing my Star Fleet Academy cadet uniform in order to meet Wil Wheaton and get him to autograph my mint in-package Wesley Crusher action figure.",3
10859,Raj,5," Ooh, it‰Ûªll be like a reunion then. Sign here.",3
10860,Sheldon,5," My arduous journey, however, was for naught. Although advertised to appear, he did not show up. It was at that moment, I vowed eternal hatred for Wil Wheaton.",3
10861,Raj,5," Okay, great, you can tell him you hate him. Sign here.",3
10862,Sheldon,5," It might also interest you to know that Wil Wheaton currently ranks sixth on my all-time enemies list, right between director Joel Schumacher, who nearly destroyed the Batman movie franchise, and Billy Sparks, who lived down the street from me and put dog poop on the handles of my bicycle.",3
10863,Raj,5," Okay, I get it, he‰Ûªs a bad guy. Sign here.",3
10864,Sheldon,5," In the words of Khan Noonien Singh in the immortal wrath of Khan, he tasks me, he tasks me and I shall have him.",3
10865,Raj,5," No doubt, sign here.",3
10866,Sheldon,5," From hell‰Ûªs heart, I stab at thee.",3
10867,Stuart,5," All right, Raj, looks like you‰Ûªre teamed up with die, Wil Wheaton, die.",3
10868,Scene,5, Leonard‰Ûªs car.,3
10869,Howard,5," So, tell me more about the future mother of my children.",3
10870,Penny,5," She‰Ûªs adorable, Howard. I think you‰Ûªll like her.",3
10871,Howard,5, Great. So what did you tell her about me? Did you mention the body fat?,3
10872,Penny,5," No, I thought that would be a nice surprise for her.",3
10873,Howard,5," Good, good.",3
10874,Penny,5," I just told her you‰Ûªre an aerospace engineer, you speak five languages‰Û_",3
10875,Howard,5, Six if you count Klingon.,3
10876,Leonard,5," Girls don‰Ûªt count Klingon, Howard. Right?",3
10877,Penny,5," Right. Oh, and I told her you have an unhealthy attachment to your mother.",3
10878,Howard,5, What?,3
10879,Penny,5, I‰Ûªm kidding.,3
10880,Leonard,5, Another delightful surprise for her.,3
10881,Scene,5, The comic book store.,3
10882,Raj,5," Sheldon, it‰Ûªs your play. Sheldon.",3
10883,Sheldon,5, My enchanted troll bludgeons your screaming harpy with a cursed mace. Game.,3
10884,Raj,5," Sorry, boys. Say hi to your mother when she picks you up. Or I could just tell her later tonight! We pwned them, dude! Up top!",3
10885,Sheldon,5," Look at him. Wil Wheaton, my old friend, I have chased you round the moons of Nibia and round the Antares maelstrom and round perdition‰Ûªs flames!",3
10886,Raj,5," You know you keep quoting Wrath of Khan, but he was in next generation. It‰Ûªs a totally different set of characters.",3
10887,Sheldon,5, Silence! How much longer must I wait for my revenge?,3
10888,Raj,5," Well, if Wil Wheaton and Stuart win their match and we beat lonely Larry and Captain Sweatpants in the next round, we‰Ûªll face off for the championship.",3
10889,Sheldon,5," So, my path to satisfaction is blocked by lonely Larry and Captain Sweatpants. Very well. They must be destroyed.",3
10890,Raj,5," Dude, you have to stop talking like that. It‰Ûªs really lame.",3
10891,Sheldon,5, Silence!,3
10892,Scene,5, Leonard‰Ûªs car.,3
10893,Howard,5," So, Penny tells me you‰Ûªre working as a waitress to put yourself through grad school. That‰Ûªs pretty great, what are you studying?",3
10894,Bernadette,5, Microbiology.,3
10895,Howard,5," Oh, cool. So you could study me.",3
10896,Bernadette,5, I don‰Ûªt understand.,3
10897,Howard,5, Microbiology is the study of tiny living things.,3
10898,Bernadette,5," I know, I‰Ûªm studying it.",3
10899,Howard,5, And I said you could study me ‰Ûªcause I‰Ûªm a tiny living thing. It‰Ûªs a joke.,3
10900,Bernadette,5, Are you sure?,3
10901,Howard,5, Do you like science-fiction?,3
10902,Bernadette,5, No.,3
10903,Howard,5, Role-playing games?,3
10904,Bernadette,5, Like in the bedroom or like Dungeons and Dragons?,3
10905,Howard,5, Either.,3
10906,Bernadette,5, No.,3
10907,Leonard,5, Gonna be a long night.,3
10908,Penny,5," Yeah, well, it‰Ûªs your fault.",3
10909,Leonard,5, I had to ask. You didn‰Ûªt have to say yes.,3
10910,Howard,5, You like magic?,3
10911,Bernadette,5, Not really.,3
10912,Howard,5, Okay.,3
10913,Leonard,5," Long, long night.",3
10914,Scene,5, The comic book store.,3
10915,Sheldon,5," I play my endless serpent. Raj will play ecstatic frenzy, which means Larry will have to play chaos overlord, then Captain Sweatpants, molten river. I play nightshade dryad, game, set and match. Now fetch me Wil Wheaton! bortaS bIr jablu‰ÛªDI‰Ûª reH QaQqu‰Ûª nay‰Ûª",3
10916,Wil Wheaton,5, Did that guy just say revenge is a dish best served cold in Klingon?,3
10917,Stuart,5, I believe so.,3
10918,Wil Wheaton,5, What is wrong with him?,3
10919,Stuart,5, Everyone has a different theory.,3
10920,Scene,5, A restaurant.,3
10921,Howard,5, How about computers? Do you like computers?,3
10922,Bernadette,5, I use them. I don‰Ûªt like them.,3
10923,Howard,5, Okay‰Û_ Puppies? Where do you stand on puppies?,3
10924,Bernadette,5, A puppy once bit my face.,3
10925,Howard,5, Of course it did.,3
10926,Leonard,5, How about that? Einstein was wrong.,3
10927,Penny,5, What?,3
10928,Leonard,5, Approaching the speed of light doesn‰Ûªt slow down time. Approaching them does.,3
10929,Howard (phone rings),5," Excuse me. Oh, damn. It‰Ûªs my mother.",3
10930,Bernadette,5, Are you going to answer it?,3
10931,Howard,5," I‰Ûªm torn. She might be dying, and, you know, I wouldn‰Ûªt want to miss that. On the other hand, if I let it go to voicemail, I could play it over and over.",3
10932,Bernadette,5, I know how you feel. My mother makes me crazy.,3
10933,Howard,5, Not as crazy as my mother makes me.,3
10934,Bernadette,5," Oh, yeah? Does your mother call you every day at work to see if you‰Ûªve had a healthy lunch?",3
10935,Howard,5, My mother calls me at work to see if I had a healthy bowel movement.,3
10936,Bernadette,5," Okay, well, does she lay out your clothes for you in the morning like you‰Ûªre nine years old?",3
10937,Howard,5, You live with your mother?,3
10938,Bernadette,5, No. That‰Ûªs the sad part.,3
10939,Howard,5," Ooh, rough. Okay, check this out. My mother made me wear rubber gloves to kindergarten so I wouldn‰Ûªt pick up a disease from the other children.",3
10940,Bernadette,5, That‰Ûªs nothing. I couldn‰Ûªt ride a bicycle ‰Ûªcause my mother was afraid I‰Ûªd hit a bump and lose my virginity.,3
10941,Howard,5," Oh, wow. You didn‰Ûªt, did you?",3
10942,Bernadette,5, Not on a bicycle. In a Camry.,3
10943,Howard,5, Corolla!,3
10944,Bernadette,5, Oh!,3
10945,Howard,5, More wine?,3
10946,Bernadette,5, I‰Ûªd love some.,3
10947,Howard,5," Listen, you have to come to shabbat dinner at my house sometime.",3
10948,Bernadette,5, Why?,3
10949,Howard,5, A catholic girl like you wearing a big cross like that might just give my mother the big brain aneurysm I‰Ûªve been hoping for.,3
10950,Bernadette,5," Okay, but only if you come to Sunday dinner at my house wearing a yarmulke.",3
10951,Howard,5, It‰Ûªs a date.,3

10967,Wil Wheaton,5, Hang on.,3
10968,Sheldon,5," You‰Ûªre holding two moderate spell cards, a small rock and a potion of Zancor, which will be about as much help as an air conditioner on the ice planet Hoth. Your only move is to play the potion, lose the skirmish, and two moves later, the game.",3
10969,Wil Wheaton,5, I think he‰Ûªs got me.,3
10970,Sheldon,5," The year was 1995, the place, Jackson, Mississippi. Having spent ten hours on a bus, during which I had to twice violate my personal rule against relieving myself on board a moving vehicle, I finally arrived at the fourth annual Dixie-Trek convention only to find that my idol Wil Wheaton decided he had better things to do than to show up and sign my action figure.",3
10971,Wil Wheaton,5, What?,3
10972,Sheldon,5," You betrayed me, Wil Wheaton. Now I have my revenge.",3
10973,Wil Wheaton,5," You went to the ‰Ûª95 Dixie-Trek? Oh, dude, my grandmother had just died, and I had to go to her funeral.",3
10974,Sheldon,5, Your mee-maw died? That‰Ûªs terrible.,3
10975,Wil Wheaton,5," Yeah, it was. But I‰Ûªm really sorry that I disappointed you.",3
10976,Sheldon,5," No, no, I understand. Anything happened to my mee-maw, I‰Ûªd be one inconsolable moon pie. I should clarify that statement by explaining that she calls me moon pie.",3
10977,Wil Wheaton,5," It‰Ûªs special relationship, isn‰Ûªt it, between a boy and his grandmother?",3
10978,Sheldon,5," Oh, yes.",3
10979,Raj,5," Okay, great, everybody loves their grandmas! Now, come on, Sheldon, finish him off!",3
10980,Wil Wheaton,5," It‰Ûªs okay, Sheldon. I let you down. I deserve it. Potion of Zancor.",3
10981,Raj,5," What are you waiting for? Kill Wil Wheaton! From hell‰Ûªs heart, stab at him!",3
10982,Sheldon,5, I can‰Ûªt.,3
10983,Raj,5, Sure you can. Do it! Do it!,3
10984,Sheldon,5," No. I came here to defeat Wil Wheaton, the man who destroyed my dreams. But I can‰Ûªt defeat Wil Wheaton, the man who loved his mee-maw. Enchanted bunny.",3
10985,Raj,5, No! Not enchanted bunny!,3
10986,Wil Wheaton,5," I call my mee-maw nana. And she‰Ûªs going be very happy to hear that my small rock kills your enchanted bunny. Game over, moon pie.",3
10987,Sheldon,5, I‰Û_ I‰Û_ I don‰Ûªt understand. Your grandmother‰Ûªs alive?,3
10988,Wil Wheaton,5," Oh, you catch on quick. Come on, Stewie, let‰Ûªs get our prize money.",3
10989,Stuart,5, That was fun.,3
10990,Sheldon (while camera zooms out from Sheldon to above planet in a pastiche of the famous Wrath of Khan scene),5, Wheaton! Wheaton! Wheaton!,3
10991,Scene,6, The stairwell. The guys are carrying kites.,3
10992,Leonard,6," Kites, ho!",3
10993,Howard,6, Kites ho!,3
10994,Raj,6, Kites ho!,3
10995,All three,6," Kites, ho!",3
10996,Sheldon,6," Excuse me. You‰Ûªre misusing the word ho. It‰Ûªs an interjection used to call attention to a destination, not an object, as in, uh, Land, ho! Or, uh, Westward, ho!",3
10997,The three guys,6," Kites, ho!",3
10998,Penny,6," Hey, guys. What you doing? Going out to discover electricity?",3
10999,Leonard,6," If you‰Ûªre referring to the work of Benjamin Franklin, he did not discover electricity, he merely used a kite to determine that lightning consists of electricity. He also invented the Franklin stove, bifocals and the flexible urinary catheter. Kites, ho.",3
11000,Leonard,6, We‰Ûªre heading out for some kite fighting.,3
11001,Penny,6, Kite fighting?,3
11002,Leonard,6," Oh, yeah. It‰Ûªs an extremely competitive, cutthroat sport.",3
11003,Sheldon,6," Well, actually, the risk of throat cutting is very low. On the other hand, severe string burn is a real and ever-Present danger.",3
11004,Leonard,6, You want to come watch?,3
11005,Penny,6," Oh, gee, sounds amazing, but, um, I‰Ûªve got some friends coming over. Not a big thing, we‰Ûªre just gonna watch the Nebraska game.",3
11006,Leonard,6," Oh. Football, sure.",3
11007,Howard,6, Good guess.,3
11008,Penny,6," I would‰Ûªve invited you, but I know you‰Ûªre not a football fan.",3
11009,Leonard,6," No, no, I‰Ûªm not, so, great. You‰Ûªve got plans doing something you like, I‰Ûªve got plans doing something I like, so it‰Ûªs good.",3
11010,Penny,6," Well, maybe we‰Ûªll hang out later, you know, after everybody‰Ûªs gone.",3
11011,Leonard,6," Yeah, great.",3
11012,Penny,6, See ya.,3
11013,Leonard,6," Well, this sucks.",3
11014,Sheldon,6," I‰Ûªm sorry, I got bored and drifted off. Where exactly in the interaction did the sucking lie?",3
11015,Raj,6," Leonard just realized that Penny‰Ûªs been hiding him from her friends because he‰Ûªs a tiny, little man who flies kites.",3
11016,Sheldon,6," Oh, that certainly would suck.",3
11017,Scene,6, The park.,3
11018,Sheldon,6," Wolowitz is trying to outflank us. Let out some string, add altitude and I‰Ûªll go under and cut his line.",3
11019,Leonard,6, Why wouldn‰Ûªt Penny want her friends to meet me?,3
11020,Sheldon,6," Focus, Leonard, focus! The heat of battle is upon us, the dogs of war are unleashed.",3
11021,Leonard,6," Maybe Koothrappali‰Ûªs right, maybe I embarrass her.",3
11022,Sheldon,6," You‰Ûªre embarrassing me right now, a grown man worrying about such nonsense when in the middle of flying kites.",3
11023,Leonard,6, Sorry.,3
11024,Sheldon,6, Sorry won‰Ûªt bring their kites down. Ow! String burn! String burn!,3
11025,Raj,6," Oh, they think we‰Ûªre flanking, they‰Ûªre playing right into our hands. On the count of three, we execute the flying scissor. One, two‰Û_",3
11026,Howard,6, Whoa! Did you see that?,3
11027,Raj,6, See what?,3
11028,Howard,6," That chick, she smiled at me.",3
11029,Raj,6," No, she didn‰Ûªt.",3
11030,Howard,6," Yes, she did.",3
11031,Raj,6," Come on, scissors, scissors!",3
11032,Howard,6, Hold my line.,3
11033,Raj,6," Wait, what are you doing? I can‰Ûªt scissors by myself! Howard! Come back!",3
11034,Sheldon,6, Victory!,3
11035,Raj,6, Son of a bitch.,3
11036,Scene,6, Leonard‰Ûªs car.,3
11037,Raj,6," You‰Ûªre a sucky friend, you know that? A sucky, sucky friend.",3
11038,Howard,6, What was I supposed to do? She gave me that come-hither look.,3
11039,Raj,6, If she gave you any look at l. It was a you suck look.,3
11040,Howard,6, I would‰Ûªve caught up to her if I hadn‰Ûªt pulled a hammy.,3
11041,Raj,6," Oh, please, you weigh 80 pounds. You don‰Ûªt have a hammy.",3
11042,Leonard,6," So, Penny doesn‰Ûªt want me around her friends, I embarrass her. What else could it be?",3
11043,Sheldon,6," Well, her actions could be out of concern for your feelings. Perhaps she‰Ûªs excluded you from these gatherings because she‰Ûªs scouting for a new mate and doesn‰Ûªt want to do it in front of you.",3
11044,Leonard,6," Oh, how kind of her.",3
11045,Sheldon,6, Agreed. Most primates don‰Ûªt show that sort of discretion. A female bonobo will copulate with a new male in front of the old one without so much as a how do you do?,3
11046,Raj,6," You always do this, you know? You ditch me for a woman you don‰Ûªt have a shot with.",3
11047,Howard,6, I totally had a shot.,3
11048,Raj,6," With a woman you were chasing through a park? That‰Ûªs not a shot, that‰Ûªs a felony. What‰Ûªs worse, it cost me my prized Patang fighting kite. Sheldon, I don‰Ûªt suppose there‰Ûªs any chance you could give me my kite back?",3
11049,Sheldon,6," I‰Ûªm sorry, Raj, but the rules of aerial warfare dictate at the fallen kite go to the victor. And without rules, the competition has no meaning. And without meaning, the following would be an empty gesture. (Sings) I have your kite. I have your kite.",3
11050,Scene,6, Penny‰Ûªs apartment.,3
11051,Leonard,6, Hey.,3
11052,Penny,6, Hi.,3
11053,Leonard,6, How was your football party?,3
11054,Penny,6, It was pretty good. We won.,3
11055,Leonard,6," Oh, that‰Ûªs excellent. It‰Ûªs a weird figure of speech, isn‰Ûªt it, we won when you weren‰Ûªt",3
11056,Penny,6, I‰Ûªm glad to hear it.,3
11057,Leonard,6," Oh, hey, on a related subject, are you embarrassed to have me around your friends?",3
11058,Penny,6," Oh, my god, no. Why would you ask that?",3
11059,Leonard,6," Well, you know, I just noticed I haven‰Ûªt really met any of them.",3
11060,Penny,6, Sure you have.,3
11061,Leonard,6," Well, yeah, no, I met the huge ex-boyfriend and the smaller yet still larger than me ex-boyfriend. Were they here today?",3
11062,Penny,6, Of course not.,3
11063,Leonard,6, Of course not. Why would they be? Why would I ask? Why am I rambling? Why don‰Ûªt you stop me?,3
11064,Penny,6," Leonard, look, if you want to meet my friends, that would be great. I just, you know, I didn‰Ûªt want you to be bored.",3
11065,Leonard,6, I wouldn‰Ûªt be bored. Why would I be bored?,3
11066,Penny,6," Well, ‰Ûªcause they‰Ûªre not genius scientists.",3
11067,Leonard,6," Penny, I like all sorts of people. In fact, some of my best friends aren‰Ûªt geniuses.",3
11068,Penny,6, Like who?,3
11069,Leonard,6," Okay, some of my Facebook friends aren‰Ûªt geniuses. My point is, if we‰Ûªre going to be a couple, I should be friends with your friends.",3
11070,Penny,6," Okay, great. Well, then why don‰Ûªt you come over next Saturday and watch the game with us.",3
11071,Leonard,6, Another football game?,3
11072,Penny,6, They have them every week.,3
11073,Leonard,6, Did not know that.,3
11074,Penny,6, You wanted to meet my friends.,3
11075,Leonard,6," Sure, sure, just I don‰Ûªt know much about football.",3
11076,Penny,6," Oh, that‰Ûªs okay, a lot of the guys‰Ûª girlfriends don‰Ûªt know football. They just kind of drink and talk in the kitchen.",3
11077,Leonard,6, Great.,3
11078,Scene,6, The apartment. Leonard and Raj are watching a football game on the television. ,3
11079,Leonard,6," Okay, a complete pass. First down, New England. I think I‰Ûªm starting to get this.",3
11080,Raj,6," Really? The only thing I‰Ûªve learned in the last two hours is that American men love drinking beer, pee too often and have trouble getting erections.",3
11081,Leonard,6," Focus on the game, not the commercials, Raj.",3
11082,Raj,6," I‰Ûªm just saying, maybe if you people cut back on the beer, you could get out of the bathroom and satisfy your women without pharmaceutical help.",3
11083,Howard (arriving),6," Raj, what are you doing here? You were supposed to help me pimp out my Vespa.",3
11084,Raj,6," I‰Ûªm sorry, are you under the impression that we‰Ûªre still friends?",3
11085,Howard,6," Oh come on, you‰Ûªre not still grinding on the kite thing, are you?",3
11086,Raj,6," It‰Ûªs not just the kite thing. Every time we go some place, you think you can just dump me whenever someone prettier comes along, even though you don‰Ûªt have a shot with them.",3
11087,Howard,6, But I had a shot with that jogger.,3
11088,Raj,6, Fine. Paint green flames on your little scooter with her. (Leaves),3
11089,Howard,6, It‰Ûªs not a little scooter. It‰Ûªs the second biggest Vespa they make! Are you watching football?,3
11090,Leonard,6," There‰Ûªs no fooling you. Now, what is this sacks statistic they put up there?",3
11091,Howard,6," All I know about Saks is, my mother shops there.",3
11092,Leonard,6," Sacks, sacks‰Û_",3
11093,Sheldon,6, It‰Ûªs football nomenclature for when a quarterback is tackled behind the line of scrimmage.,3
11094,Leonard,6, Huh‰Û_ Scrimmage‰Û_,3
11095,Sheldon,6, The line of scrimmage is the imaginary transverse line separating the offence from the defence.,3
11096,Leonard,6, Oh.,3
11097,Howard,6, Sheldon knows football?,3
11098,Leonard,6, Apparently.,3
11099,Howard,6," I mean, Quidditch, sure. But football?",3
11100,Leonard,6," Sheldon, how do you know this stuff?",3
11101,Sheldon,6," I grew up in Texas. Football is ubiquitous in Texas. Pro football, college football, high school football, peewee football, in fact, every form of football except the original, European football, which most Texans believe to be a Commie plot.",3
11102,Leonard,6, Unbelievable.,3
11103,Sheldon,6," If you‰Ûªre interested, I also know all about frying meat that isn‰Ûªt chicken as if it were chicken.",3
11104,Leonard,6, So you could teach me?,3
11105,Sheldon,6, Football or chicken-fried meats?,3
11106,Leonard,6, Football. I‰Ûªm going to Penny‰Ûªs on Saturday to watch a game with her friends and I don‰Ûªt want to look like an idiot. I want to blend in.,3
11107,Sheldon,6," If you want to blend in with Penny‰Ûªs friends, I‰Ûªd think looking like an idiot would be the perfect camouflage.",3
11108,Leonard,6," Come on, Sheldon, please teach me about football. It‰Ûªll be fun.",3
11109,Sheldon,6," That‰Ûªs exactly what my father said. Come to the games, watch the games, week in and week out from the time I was five until I went off to college. Longest seven years of my life.",3
11110,Leonard,6," Please, I‰Ûªm asking you as a friend.",3
11111,Sheldon,6, Are you making this a tier one friendship request?,3
11112,Leonard,6, Yes.,3
11113,Sheldon,6, Fine.,3
11114,Leonard,6, I really appreciate this.,3
11115,Sheldon,6," Yeah, yeah. All right, Poindexter, sit down, shut up and listen.",3
11116,Leonard,6, I‰Ûªm sorry?,3
11117,Sheldon,6," That‰Ûªs how my father always began our football conversations. And if you‰Ûªd like, after the game, I‰Ûªll take you outside and teach you how to shoot close enough to a racoon that it craps itself.",3
11118,Scene,6, The kitchen. Sheldon is making toast in a cylon toaster which burns an image of a cylon onto the toast. ,3
11119,Leonard,6, When are you going to stop making Cylon toast?,3
11120,Sheldon,6, When I have enough to destroy all the human toast on the battlestar known as Galactica. Is that what you‰Ûªre wearing to watch football at Penny‰Ûªs?,3
11121,Leonard,6, What‰Ûªs wrong with a football jersey?,3
11122,Sheldon,6," Nothing. That, however, appears to be a football cocktail dress.",3
11123,Leonard,6," I‰Ûªs the smallest size they had, except the one for dogs. I can‰Ûªt believe they had one for dogs.",3
11124,Sheldon,6," Oh, yes. Canine football fans are a common sight in Texas. Cats, however, refuse to wear sporting apparel. My sister found that out the hard way.",3
11125,Leonard,6," Anyway, wish me luck.",3
11126,Sheldon,6," Leonard, wait. Am I correct in assuming that your attempt to be accepted by Penny‰Ûªs peers is based on your desire to ensure your continuing mating privileges with her?",3
11127,Leonard,6," Well, I wouldn‰Ûªt put it exactly that way.",3
11128,Sheldon,6, How would you put it?,3
11129,Leonard,6," Yeah, okay, like you said.",3
11130,Sheldon,6," Huh. Seems like an awful lot of trouble to go through for intercourse. Don‰Ûªt you have access to women who will do it for money? By the way, another accepted usage for the term ho.",3
11131,Leonard,6," Good-Bye, Sheldon.",3
11132,Sheldon,6, Hold on I believe that social convention dictate you not arrive empty-Handed. Would you like to bring some Cylon toast?,3
11133,Leonard,6," Yeah, no, I‰Ûªm trying to fit in, not get laughed at.",3
11134,Sheldon,6, What‰Ûªs funny about Cylon toast?,3
11135,Scene,6, Raj‰Ûªs apartment. Raj is watching a Bollywood movie. There is a knock on the door.,3
11136,Raj,6, It‰Ûªs open.,3
11137,Howard,6," Hey, pal.",3
11138,Raj,6, What do you want?,3
11139,Howard,6, I brought you a little gift. New kite.,3
11140,Raj,6," The kite you made me lose was an authentic Patang, an Indian fighting kite that my brother sent to me from New Delhi. It took me a day to put together and two days to paint. This is Hello Kitty.",3
11141,Howard,6," Yeah, but it comes with a little coin purse. Does a Patang?",3
11142,Raj,6," Wow, you just don‰Ûªt get it, do you? Buying me something pretty isn‰Ûªt going to make our problem just go away.",3
11143,Howard,6," Look, I admit I haven‰Ûªt always been the best friend I could be.",3
11144,Raj,6," You‰Ûªve been a sucky friend, a sucky, sucky friend.",3
11145,Howard,6, Stipulated.,3
11146,Raj,6," And you do it all the time. Last week in the mall at Radio Shack, we were looking for a phone with giant numbers for your mother, and I suddenly realize you‰Ûªre not even there.",3
11147,Howard,6," I know, I know.",3
11148,Raj,6, And where were you?,3
11149,Howard,6," Getting shot down by the girl at Hot Dog on a Stick. But in my defence, she was gorgeous, and working that squeezer to make the lemonade, going up and down and up and down. It was like a free pole dance right in the middle of the food court.",3
11150,Raj,6, You‰Ûªre impossible.,3
11151,Howard,6," Hey, at least I can talk to women without being drunk.",3
11152,Raj,6," Excuse me, I have selective mutism, a recognized medical disorder. You‰Ûªre just a douche.",3
11153,Howard,6," No. You know what? Maybe that‰Ûªs what this whole thing‰Ûªs about. You‰Ûªre not mad at me, you‰Ûªre mad at yourself.",3
11154,Raj,6," No, I‰Ûªm mad at you. I hate myself, but I‰Ûªm mad at you.",3
11155,Howard,6," Fine. You‰Ûªre mad at me. I get it. Now, how about we go spend the day together? Just the two of us. We‰Ûªll go anywhere you want.",3
11156,Raj,6, I don‰Ûªt know.,3
11157,Howard,6, Come on. Let me take you someplace nice.,3
11158,Raj,6, I‰Û_ I do enjoy the La Brea Tar Pits.,3
11159,Howard,6," Really, now? With the traffic and the parking, it‰Ûªs‰Û_ okay, fine. The Tar Pits. Let‰Ûªs go.",3
11160,Raj,6," Oh, why can‰Ûªt I stay mad at you?",3
11161,Scene,6, Penny‰Ûªs apartment. Everyone is watching football.,3
11162,Leonard,6, Go! Go! Go! Go-Go-Go-Go! Yes! Are you people watching this? Is this amazing or what?,3
11163,Penny,6," Sweetie, that‰Ûªs a highlight from the ‰Ûª98 championship game.",3
11164,Leonard,6, Oh. Did not know that.,3
11165,Penny,6, How much beer have you had?,3
11166,Leonard,6," None, why?",3
11167,Penny,6, Oh. I was just kind of hoping you were drunk. Now we‰Ûªre back live.,3
11168,Leonard,6," Okay, yeah. I can see the difference.",3
11169,Guy in baseball hat,6," Oh, where‰Ûªs the flag, that‰Ûªs intentional grounding.",3
11170,Second guy,6, Totally.,3
11171,Leonard,6," That completely was a forward pass, which they threw intentionally incomplete to avoid loss of yardage or to conserve time. I can‰Ûªt believe they‰Ûªre not being penalized with the loss of a down and by having to move the line of scrimmage back to the spot of the foul.",3
11172,Penny,6," Here, have some pizza, sweetie.",3
11173,Leonard,6," Penny, you know I‰Ûªm lactose intolerant.",3
11174,Penny,6, I know. I just need you stop talking.,3
11175,Sheldon,6," (Knock, knock, knock) Penny. (Knock, knock, knock) Penny. (Knock, knock, knock) Penny.",3
11176,Penny,6," Sheldon, come in.",3
11177,Sheldon,6," Thank you. I‰Ûªd like to make a sandwich, but I‰Ûªm out of bread.",3
11178,Penny,6, There‰Ûªs some in the fridge.,3
11179,Sheldon,6," You shouldn‰Ûªt keep your bread in the refrigerator. Staleness is caused by crystallization of the starch molecules, which occurs faster at cool temperatures.",3
11180,Penny,6," On Earth, we say thank you.",3
11181,Sheldon,6," So Leonard, how goes the mimesis?",3
11182,Leonard,6, Mimesis?,3
11183,Sheldon,6, You know. Mimesis. An action in which the mimic takes on the properties of a specific object or organism. Mimesis.,3
11184,Leonard,6, What the hell are you talking about?,3
11185,Sheldon,6," I‰Ûªm attempting to communicate with you without my meaning becoming apparent to those around you. Let me try again. Have the indigenous fauna accepted you as one of their own? Nudge, nudge, wink, wink.",3
11186,Leonard,6," Oh, I guess so.",3
11187,Sheldon,6," Good. Oh, FYI. After I eat my sandwich, I‰Ûªm taking Koothrappali‰Ûªs Patang kite out for a test run. Would you like to get your delta-wing raptor and join me?",3
11188,Leonard,6," I don‰Ûªt want to fly kites, Sheldon. We‰Ûªre watching football here.",3
11189,Sheldon,6, I can see that. I was providing you with an alternative. A courtesy I was never offered in similar circumstances.,3
11190,Leonard,6," Oh, look at that. The Oklahoma coach has thrown down a red flag indicating he‰Ûªs challenging the ruling on the field. I hope he‰Ûªs right, ‰Ûªcause if he‰Ûªs not, it‰Ûªll cost him one of his three time-Outs.",3
11191,Penny,6," You know, Leonard, honey, I wouldn‰Ûªt mind if you wanted to go fly kites with Sheldon.",3
11192,Leonard,6," No, I‰Ûªll watch the end of the game. Besides, there‰Ûªs only three minutes left.",3
11193,Penny,6, Until half time.,3
11194,Leonard,6, This is just half? We‰Ûªve been here for hours.,3
11195,Penny,6, And you‰Ûªre gonna be here for a couple more.,3
11196,Leonard,6," Oh, you‰Ûªre kidding me.",3
11197,Penny,6, No.,3
11198,Leonard,6, Nice meeting all of you.,3
11199,Penny,6," So, yeah, anyway, that‰Ûªs my boyfriend. He is really smart.",3
11200,Scene,6, The Le Brea Tar Pits.,3
11201,Raj,6, I really like my saber-toothed cat. Thank you.,3
11202,Howard,6," My pleasure. Maybe after lunch, we can go to Marie Callender‰Ûªs and have some pie.",3
11203,Raj,6, I‰Ûªd like that. This is turning out to be a perfect Saturday.,3
11204,Howard,6," Good. I‰Ûªm glad. Oh, man. Did you see the way she smiled at me?",3
11205,Raj,6, Fine. Go ahead.,3
11206,Howard,6, No. This is our day.,3
11207,Raj,6," If you want to chase after her, chase after her.",3
11208,Howard,6," Ah, who am I kidding? I wouldn‰Ûªt have a shot with a girl like that.",3
11209,Raj,6, Don‰Ûªt put yourself down. You‰Ûªre a very attractive man.,3
11210,Howard,6, You think so?,3
11211,Raj,6," Yeah. Absolutely. It wouldn‰Ûªt kill you to take a Pilates class with me now and then, but you have a certain wiry appeal.",3
11212,Howard,6," Yeah, well, it doesn‰Ûªt matter ‰Û÷cause she wasn‰Ûªt really smiling at me.",3
11213,Raj,6," Actually, in this case, I think she was.",3
11214,Howard,6, Really?,3
11215,Raj,6, Yeah.,3
11216,Howard,6, Bye.,3
11217,Raj,6, What a douche.,3
11218,Scene,7, The apartment.,3
11219,Penny,7," Wow, Sheldon, I cannot believe you made up your own game.",3
11220,Sheldon,7," Oh, Research Lab is more than a game. It‰Ûªs like the slogan says, the physics is theoretical, but the fun is real.",3
11221,Leonard,7, We must not be playing it right.,3
11222,Penny,7," All right, five. One, two, three, four, five. Oh, wow, look at that, my Department of Defence research grant is renewed.",3
11223,Sheldon,7, Oh! Great roll! Now you can demolish your Soviet-style cyclotron and build the large Hadron Collider.,3
11224,Penny,7, Yay.,3
11225,Sheldon,7," You‰Ûªre a natural at this, Penny. And as the first beta testers, you two‰Ûªll have quite the edge when we play with Wolowitz and Koothrappali on Sunday.",3
11226,Leonard,7," Oh, gee, Sheldon, I don‰Ûªt think we can play on Sunday.",3
11227,Sheldon,7, Why not?,3
11228,Leonard,7, Because of the reasons that Penny will now tell you. Penny?,3
11229,Penny,7," Actually, I have to pick up my friend Justin from the airport.",3
11230,Leonard,7," There you go, she has to pick up her friend Justin at the airport, aAnd I can‰Ûªt play ‰Ûªcause I‰Ûªm going with her, right?",3
11231,Penny,7," Um, yeah, if you want. I mean, there may not be room. He‰Ûªs got a lot of stuff, like guitars and amplifiers.",3
11232,Leonard,7, Wait. What are you talking about?,3
11233,Penny,7," My friend, Justin.",3
11234,Sheldon,7," Pay attention, Leonard. That‰Ûªs why she can‰Ûªt play on Sunday.",3
11235,Leonard,7, Who is this Justin?,3
11236,Sheldon,7," Your turn, Leonard.",3
11237,Penny,7, I told you about him.,3
11238,Leonard,7," No, you didn‰Ûªt.",3
11239,Sheldon,7," Roll the dice, Leonard.",3
11240,Penny,7," Yeah, my friend from Omaha, plays the guitar. Anyway, he‰Ûªs coming to L.A. looking for some session work, so I told him he could just crash on my couch for a few weeks.",3
11241,Sheldon,7," Come on, Leonard, if you roll a six, Penny dies horribly in a nuclear meltdown. See what I mean when I say the fun is real?",3
11242,Leonard,7, Hang on. Some guy is going to be sleeping on your couch?,3
11243,Penny,7, He‰Ûªs not some guy. He‰Ûªs my friend.,3
11244,Leonard,7," So by friend, do you mean friend friend, gay friend, or ex boyfriend who you‰Ûªre now platonic with but still might have a thing for you friend‰Û?",3
11245,Penny,7," Well, he‰Ûªs definitely not gay.",3
11246,Leonard,7," Oh, a definitely not gay musician sleeping on my girlfriend‰Ûªs couch. Yippee.",3
11247,Penny,7," Okay, we went out a little bit, a long time ago, but we were never like going out.",3
11248,Leonard,7," Okay, not to be pedantic, but the last I checked went out was in fact the past tense of going out, which I think we all know is a popular euphemism for saw each other naked.",3
11249,Sheldon,7, I‰Ûªll just roll for you.,3
11250,Penny,7, Do you have a problem with Justin staying with me?,3
11251,Leonard,7, What was your first clue?,3
11252,Sheldon,7, Uh-oh! Industrial accident.,3
11253,Penny,7, You know what? Don‰Ûªt talk to me like I‰Ûªm an idiot.,3
11254,Leonard,7, I‰Ûªm not talking to you like you‰Ûªre an idiot! I‰Ûªm saying the whole idea is idiotic!,3
11255,Sheldon,7, You accidentally stare at a helium-argon laser. Lose one turn and a retina.,3
11256,Penny,7," How is that not talking to me like I‰Ûªm an idiot? It‰Ûªs my friend, it‰Ûªs my couch, and it‰Ûªs my freakin‰Ûª life!",3
11257,Sheldon,7, It‰Ûªs also your roll.,3
11258,Leonard,7," You know what? It is your life. If you want to have some stupid guitarist stay on your couch, then fine. Why don‰Ûªt you just rent some bunk beds and invite The Black Eyed Peas?",3
11259,Penny,7," Hey, if I want to invite the entire line up of Lollapalooza to sleep in my apartment, I will, and it‰Ûªs none of your business!",3
11260,Leonard,7, Are you listening to yourself? Do you know how childish you sound right now?,3
11261,Penny,7," Oh, now I‰Ûªm a child? Well, at least I‰Ûªm not an idiot anymore!",3
11262,Leonard,7, The two aren‰Ûªt mutually exclusive!,3
11263,Penny,7," Oh, you are such a‰Û_ (Sheldon has placed ice in the blender and turned it on) What the hell is he doing?",3
11264,Leonard,7, He‰Ûªs drowning us out. He doesn‰Ûªt like fighting.,3
11265,Penny,7," Sheldon, just stop, look, the fight is over. Oh, and FYI, you never even heard of The Black Eyed Peas until you met me!",3
11266,Leonard,7," I heard of ‰Ûªem. Didn‰Ûªt know they were a band. Sheldon, she‰Ûªs gone. You can turn off the blender.",3
11267,Sheldon,7, Has your relationship reached its inevitable ugly end?,3
11268,Leonard,7," No, we just had a little spat.",3
11269,Sheldon,7," Look on the bright side. As the result of Penny‰Ûªs forfeit, you have become the world‰Ûªs first winner of Research Lab. Would you like a commemorative snow cone?",3
11270,Scene,7, Leonard‰Ûªs car.,3
11271,Leonard,7, I don‰Ûªt get how she can just announce that an old boyfriend is going to be sleeping on her couch.,3
11272,Sheldon,7," Hey, I thought of a game we can play in the car.",3
11273,Leonard,7," I don‰Ûªt want to play a game, Sheldon.",3
11274,Sheldon,7," It‰Ûªs called Scientists. Now, I will name three scientists, then you will put them in order of the size of their contribution to their respective fields. To make this game even more compelling, you must consider only the contribution of the man to the field, not the validity of the field itself. For example, Abu Musa Jabir ibn Hayn made a greater contribution to the discredited field of alchemy than Halbert Vanderplatt made to neurobiology. Okay, ready to have some fun?",3
11275,Leonard,7," An old boyfriend who‰Ûªs definitely not gay. That‰Ûªs what a guy likes to hear, definitely.",3
11276,Sheldon,7," All right, I‰Ûªll start with an easy one, um, Isaac Newton, Madame Curie and Niels Bohr.",3
11277,Leonard,7, And then I say one little thing and I end up being the bad guy!,3
11278,Sheldon,7," Hint, Madame Curie had her husband to help her.",3
11279,Leonard,7," What am I supposed to say? Sure, Penny, I‰Ûªm cool with your old boyfriend sleeping in your apartment. Well, Leonard, it doesn‰Ûªt matter if you‰Ûªre cool or not because I‰Ûªm Penny and I‰Ûªm pretty and I can do whatever the hell I want! Oh, I get it! You think you‰Ûªre doing me a favour just by being in a relationship with me! No, no, Leonard! I‰Ûªm doing you a favour just by being in the same room as you!",3
11280,Sheldon,7, Leonard! Stop the car!,3
11281,Leonard,7, What?,3
11282,Sheldon,7, I can‰Ûªt listen to the two of you fight anymore.,3
11283,Scene,7, Leaving the apartment.,3
11284,Sheldon,7," Come on, come on, we‰Ûªre late.",3
11285,Leonard,7," Calm down, we‰Ûªll make the movie.",3
11286,Sheldon,7," I believe my alarm is appropriate, given the situation. The movie starts in 17 minutes, which means we‰Ûªll need to make all the lights on Colorado Boulevard, plus skip the concession stand, and preshow urination.",3
11287,Raj,7," Oh, dude, I wish you had said something before I pounded that last Red Bull.",3
11288,Sheldon,7," Go, go, Power Rangers, go!",3
11289,Penny,7, Hey.,3
11290,Leonard,7," Hey. We‰Ûªre, uh, going to the movies.",3
11291,Sheldon,7," No, we‰Ûªre not. We‰Ûªre standing in the hallway, suffering through an awkward encounter.",3
11292,Leonard,7," Hang on. They‰Ûªre showing a new digital print of Time Bandits, you wouldn‰Ûªt want to come, would you?",3
11293,Penny,7," Not really, no.",3
11294,Sheldon,7," All right, invitation pointlessly offered, invitation declined as expected, everyone‰Ûªs civil, nobody‰Ûªs fighting. Have a nice evening.",3
11295,Leonard,7, Just give us a minute.,3
11296,Howard,7," Oh, take all the time you need.",3
11297,Leonard,7," So, are we going to talk about last night?",3
11298,Penny,7, Are you ready to apologize?,3
11299,Leonard,7, No.,3
11300,Penny,7," E-e-e-e-eh! Wrong answer, but thank you for playing.",3
11301,Leonard,7," Oh, come on. This is stupid.",3
11302,Penny,7," Oh, there it is again! You think I‰Ûªm stupid!",3
11303,Leonard,7," No, there‰Ûªs a difference between being stupid and acting stupid.",3
11304,Penny,7," Oh, yeah? well, there‰Ûªs a difference between being a jerk and being an ass!",3
11305,Leonard,7," No, there isn‰Ûªt! They‰Ûªre synonyms!",3
11306,Raj,7," Well, that was rather unpleasant.",3
11307,Howard,7," Yeah, I don‰Ûªt think I need my preshow urination anymore.",3
11308,Sheldon,7," Leonard, when that woman moved in three years ago I told you not to talk to her, and now look, we‰Ûªre going to be late for the movies.",3
11309,Scene,7, The comic book store.,3
11310,Howard,7, Hey! Look! Amazing Spider-Man 183.,3
11311,Sheldon,7, Got it.,3
11312,Howard,7, Remember this one? Spider-Man loses a big fight and then his girlfriend breaks up with him. Want me to get it for you? It‰Ûªll help take your mind off things.,3
11313,Stuart,7," Hey, guys. What‰Ûªs going on?",3
11314,Leonard,7," Oh, we need to kill a couple hours till the next showing of Time Bandits.",3
11315,Stuart,7," Oh, well, no problem. I was thinking of closing early and going home, but let‰Ûªs face it, that‰Ûªs just a slightly smaller lonely room filled with comic books.",3
11316,Leonard,7," Thanks, Stuart. Let me ask you something. Do you think it‰Ûªs okay for Penny to have an ex-boyfriend sleep on her couch?",3
11317,Howard,7," No, I mean, she‰Ûªs obviously way out of line.",3
11318,Leonard,7, Thank you!,3
11319,Howard,7," But if she dumps you, she‰Ûªll have a new boyfriend by tomorrow morning and you‰Ûªll have a new girlfriend when you figure out how to build one. So the only question is, how long until you fold?",3
11320,Leonard,7, I am not going to fold.,3
11321,Raj,7," Well, excuse me, I don‰Ûªt think Penny‰Ûªs out of line at all. You don‰Ûªt own her. It‰Ûªs like my girl, Beyonce says, if you like it, you shoulda put a ring on it.‰Û",3
11322,Howard,7," Come on. At the very least, when she found out Leonard was upset about it, she should‰Ûªve backed off.",3
11323,Raj,7, You mean like when a guy‰Ûªs upset because his friend agreed to take a cooking class with him and then doesn‰Ûªt show up because he‰Ûªs doing a juice fast with his mother?,3
11324,Howard,7, I didn‰Ûªt know you were upset about that.,3
11325,Raj,7," Really! Did you miss all the subtle indicators, like me saying, Howard, I am upset.",3
11326,Howard,7," Okay, sorry.",3
11327,Raj,7," Maybe it means something different in this country. Back in India, it means you‰Ûªre upset with a guy named Howard!",3
11328,Howard,7, I said I‰Ûªm sorry.,3
11329,Raj,7, Sorry doesn‰Ûªt make up for the fact that I had to make chicken and rice with this vegan guy. Do you know what vegan chicken and rice is? Rice!,3
11330,Howard,7," Yeah, well, you think I was having fun, sitting around all night listening to my mother say ‰ÛÏHave you ever peed so much in your life?‰Û",3
11331,Raj,7," Oh, my God, you are such a mama‰Ûªs boy.",3
11332,Howard,7," Hey, don‰Ûªt bring my mother into this!",3
11333,Raj,7, You brought your mother into this!,3
11334,Sheldon,7," Stop it, both of you. All this fighting, I might as well be back with my parents! Damn it, George, I told you if you didn‰Ûªt quit drinkin‰Ûª I‰Ûªd leave you! Well, I guess that makes you a liar, ‰Ûªcause I‰Ûªm drunk as hell and you‰Ûªre still here! Stop yelling! You‰Ûªre making Sheldon cry! I‰Ûªll tell you what‰Ûªs making Sheldon cry! That I let you name him Sheldon.",3
11335,Howard,7," Boy, what got him so upset?",3
11336,Raj,7," Oh, sure, you can tell when Sheldon‰Ûªs upset.",3
11337,Scene,7, The Cheesecake Factory.,3
11338,Penny,7," Oh, thank you very much. Come back soon. With the other half of my tip. Hey, Sheldon, what are you doing here?",3
11339,Sheldon,7," This is a restaurant. It‰Ûªs lunchtime. I would think, as a waitress, you‰Ûªd be familiar with the paradigm.",3
11340,Penny,7, Is Leonard coming?,3
11341,Sheldon,7," No, I believe Leonard is waiting for you to come crawling back to him and apologize.",3
11342,Penny,7," Well, that‰Ûªs not gonna happen.",3
11343,Sheldon,7," I assumed that would be your attitude. Hence, my true purpose in coming here.",3
11344,Penny,7, Which is?,3
11345,Sheldon,7, I want you to crawl back to him and apologize.,3
11346,Penny,7, I‰Ûªm busy.,3
11347,Sheldon,7," Excuse me, miss. I‰Ûªd like to order lunch.",3
11348,Penny,7, Fine. What do you want?,3
11349,Sheldon,7," I have a few questions. First, I notice that you offer soup and a half-sandwich?",3
11350,Penny,7, Yes.,3
11351,Sheldon,7," Where exactly does the half-sandwich come from? Are you giving me half of someone else‰Ûªs sandwich, or do I have to wait for someone else in the restaurant to order the other half?",3
11352,Penny,7," No, no, Sheldon, they just make a half-sandwich.",3
11353,Sheldon,7," You can‰Ûªt make a half-sandwich. If it‰Ûªs not half of a whole sandwich, it‰Ûªs just a small sandwich.",3
11354,Penny,7," Okay, fine, it‰Ûªs soup and a small sandwich. Is that what you want?",3
11355,Sheldon,7, Of course not. I‰Ûªll have my usual.,3
11356,Penny,7, Great.,3
11357,Sheldon,7, Aren‰Ûªt you going to ask me if I want a beverage?,3
11358,Penny,7, Don‰Ûªt you usually get lemonade?,3
11359,Sheldon,7, Yes.,3
11360,Penny,7, Do you want lemonade?,3
11361,Sheldon,7, Yes.,3
11362,Penny,7, Anything else?,3
11363,Sheldon,7," Yes, I want you to apologize to Leonard.",3
11364,Penny,7, I am not going to apologize. I‰Ûªve done nothing wrong. He is completely overreacting.,3
11365,Sheldon,7, Irrelevant. The disruption in your relationship is making my life intolerable.,3
11366,Penny,7," Well, I‰Ûªm sorry, Sheldon, but this really isn‰Ûªt about you.",3
11367,Sheldon,7, I don‰Ûªt follow.,3
11368,Penny,7," Yeah, yeah, I‰Ûªll be right there. Look, Sheldon, I have to go.",3
11369,Sheldon,7," All right, let‰Ûªs assume, ad argumentum, that in this case, Leonard is wrong.",3
11370,Penny,7, Leonard is wrong.,3
11371,Sheldon,7," Considering the number of transgressions you‰Ûªve committed that he‰Ûªs overlooked, don‰Ûªt you think that, just this once, you could return the favour?",3
11372,Penny,7," I‰Ûªm coming. Goodbye, Sheldon. What do you mean, transgressions I‰Ûªve committed?",3
11373,Sheldon,7, Were you under the impression that Leonard has no complaints about you?,3
11374,Penny,7," Like what? Yeah, yeah, I see you, you‰Ûªre making a little cheque sign in the air, I got it, just hold your horses. What does Leonard complain about?",3
11375,Sheldon,7," Your driving, the plethora of stuffed animals on your bed that stare at him during your amorous activities, your constant tardiness, your singing.",3
11376,Penny,7, My singing?,3
11377,Sheldon,7," That‰Ûªs actually from my list, but Leonard would be a fool if he didn‰Ûªt agree with it.",3
11378,Penny,7," Okay, if Leonard has so many problems with me, why hasn‰Ûªt he just said so?",3
11379,Sheldon,7," Because, according to him, you‰Ûªre oversensitive and have a temper.",3
11380,Penny,7," Oh, really? Well, then, do me a favour and tell Leonard that he can drop dead!",3
11381,Sheldon,7, And she wonders why she‰Ûªs constantly undertipped.,3
11382,Scene,7, The apartment.,3
11383,Leonard,7, Hey.,3
11384,Sheldon,7," Oh, good, you‰Ûªre home. I need you to do me a favour.",3
11385,Leonard,7, Sure.,3
11386,Sheldon,7, Go apologize to Penny.,3
11387,Leonard,7, What?,3
11388,Sheldon,7, Right now would be good.,3
11389,Penny (knocking),7, Leonard!,3
11390,Sheldon,7," Although, a few minutes ago would have been better.",3
11391,Penny,7," I hear you don‰Ûªt like my stuffed animals, my driving or my punctuality.",3
11392,Leonard,7, What? Who would tell you something like that? Why would you tell her something like that?,3
11393,Penny,7," It doesn‰Ûªt matter why he told me. It‰Ûªs true, isn‰Ûªt it?",3
11394,Leonard,7," Okay, yeah, it‰Ûªs true, but I can live with that stuff. What I can‰Ûªt live with is you casually informing me that some guy‰Ûªs going to be staying in your apartment without even asking me first!",3
11395,Penny,7," That isn‰Ûªt even your problem, the problem is you don‰Ûªt trust me!",3
11396,Leonard,7," Oh, come on. Sheldon, have you ever once heard me say that I don‰Ûªt trust Penny? Sheldon? Where did he go?",3
11397,Penny,7," Oh, your yelling must have freaked him out again.",3
11398,Leonard,7, Where are you going? You just walk away in the middle of an argument?!,3
11399,Penny,7," No, I‰Ûªm going to go find your damn roommate before he hurts himself trying to cross the street or something!",3
11400,Leonard,7, Why didn‰Ûªt you say so?,3
11401,Penny,7," Oh, now I need your permission for that, too?!",3
11402,Leonard,7," Well, I can‰Ûªt read your mind, Penny!",3
11403,Penny,7," Really? Why not? You‰Ûªre so smart, and I‰Ûªm so dumb!",3
11404,Scene,7, Raj‰Ûªs apartment.,3
11405,Sheldon,7," (Knock, knock, knock) Raj. (Knock, knock, knock) Raj. (Knock, knock, knock) Raj.",3
11406,Raj,7," Stop knocking! It‰Ûªs open! Please tell my parents that our dark matter research is at a critical juncture, and I can‰Ûªt come home for my cousin Sanjay‰Ûªs wedding.",3
11407,Mrs Koothrappali,7," Sheldon, ask our son what we‰Ûªre supposed to say to Mr. and Mrs. Choudhry, whose daughter, Lakshmi is flying in from London, for the sole purpose of meeting him.",3
11408,Raj,7, I didn‰Ûªt ask you to set me up with Lakshmi.,3
11409,Mrs Koothrappali,7, You should be thanking us!,3
11410,Dr Koothrappali,7," Yes, Lakshmi just got her stomach stapled. You have an opportunity to get in good with her before she loses weight, and her self-esteem goes up.",3
11411,Raj,7, I don‰Ûªt care! And why don‰Ûªt you think I can find a woman for myself?,3
11412,Mrs Koothrappali,7," Because you‰Ûªre 27, and the closest thing we have to a daughter-in-law is that Jewish boy Howard.",3
11413,Raj,7," Oh, that is completely below the belt. Sheldon, tell my parents that Howard and I are just friends. Sheldon? Howard and I are just friends! Fine. I‰Ûªll come home for Sanjay‰Ûªs wedding.",3
11414,Scene,7, Penny‰Ûªs car.,3
11415,Penny (out of the window),7, Sheldon! (whistles) ,3
11416,Leonard,7, What are you doing? He‰Ûªs not a lost dog.,3
11417,Penny,7," Hey, why don‰Ûªt you just let me find him while you sit there hitting your imaginary brake?",3
11418,Leonard,7," The brake might be imaginary, but that stop sign you just ran wasn‰Ûªt.",3
11419,Penny,7, What stop sign?,3
11420,Leonard,7, Eyes on the road. Eyes on the road!,3
11421,Scene,7, Outside Howard‰Ûªs house. Sheldon rings the doorbell.,3
11422,Howard‰Ûªs Mother,7," Howard, answer the door! I‰Ûªm busy!",3
11423,Howard,7," I‰Ûªm busy too, you answer it.",3
11424,Howard‰Ûªs Mother,7, I can‰Ûªt! I‰Ûªm on the toilet!,3
11425,Howard,7," For God‰Ûªs sake, I don‰Ûªt need to hear that! Can‰Ûªt you just say, I‰Ûªm busy?",3
11426,Howard‰Ûªs Mother,7," I said I‰Ûªm busy, but that wasn‰Ûªt good enough for you!",3
11427,Howard,7," You know what? I hope it‰Ûªs one of those home invasion deals, and they shoot me in the head.",3
11428,Howard‰Ûªs Mother,7," Well, if it‰Ûªs a home invader, don‰Ûªt tell them I‰Ûªm on the toilet!",3
11429,Howard,7," There‰Ûªs no one there. You‰Ûªre hearing things, you crazy old lady!",3
11430,Scene,7, The comic book store.,3
11431,Leonard,7," Hey, Stuart, have you seen Sheldon?",3
11432,Stuart,7," Yeah, he‰Ûªs, uh, over in the graphic novel section. Built himself a little nest.",3
11433,Leonard,7, Thank you.,3
11434,Stuart,7," Uh, Penny?",3
11435,Penny,7, Yeah?,3
11436,Stuart,7, Is everything okay?,3
11437,Penny,7, What do you mean?,3
11438,Stuart,7," Uh, Sheldon told me you and Leonard were having a fight?",3
11439,Penny,7," Oh, yeah, kind of. It‰Ûªs, it‰Ûªs no big thing.",3
11440,Stuart,7," Oh, good, good. (She moves away) I love you.",3
11441,Leonard,7, I‰Ûªm not leaving until you talk to me.,3
11442,Penny,7," All right, what‰Ûªs going on?",3
11443,Leonard,7," It‰Ûªs a little hard to explain. He does this thing where he pretends he‰Ûªs in an alternate dimension that occupies the same physical space we‰Ûªre in, but he can‰Ûªt perceive us.",3
11444,Sheldon,7, Don‰Ûªt flatter yourself. I‰Ûªm just ignoring you.,3
11445,Penny,7," Come on, Sheldon, let‰Ûªs go home. Look, we‰Ûªre done fighting.",3
11446,Sheldon,7," I‰Ûªve heard that before, but then, the next thing you know I‰Ûªm hiding in my bedroom, blaring a Richard Feinman lecture while my mom is shouting that Jesus would forgive her if she put ground glass in my dad‰Ûªs meatloaf, and my dad‰Ûªs on the roof skeet-shooting her Franklin Mint collectible plates.",3
11447,Penny,7," Okay, there‰Ûªs going to no more shouting and no skeet-shooting.",3
11448,Sheldon,7, Really? Where‰Ûªs your friend Justin going to sleep?,3
11449,Leonard,7," Yeah, where‰Ûªs he gonna sleep?",3
11450,Penny,7," Oh, my God, would you let this go?!",3
11451,Stuart,7, I‰Ûªd let it go.,3
11452,Leonard,7," Why should I let it go? Why don‰Ûªt you just tell the guy to find another place to sleep? (Sheldon turns on a loud toy robot) Oh, for God‰Ûªs sakes. So, you have childhood issues, we all have childhood issues, at some point, you just need to grow up and get past them. (Sheldon turns on another robot)",3
11453,Penny,7," Leonard, will you just let me handle this, please? Look, let‰Ûªs just‰Û_ Sheldon, please,",3
11454,Leonard,7, Always is a long time. Sure. Always.,3
11455,Penny,7," You know, how about we buy you this robot, and then we all go home?",3
11456,Sheldon,7, I want that one.,3
11457,Penny,7," Okay, you can have that one.",3
11458,Leonard,7," Oh, come on, he‰Ûªs just going to play with it twice, and then it‰Ûªll end up in his closet with all the other junk.",3
11459,Penny,7," Buy him the robot, Leonard.",3
11460,Sheldon,7," Can I get this comic book, too?",3
11461,Penny,7," Yes, you can.",3
11462,Stuart,7, We meet again.,3
11463,Scene,7, Penny‰Ûªs bed. ,3
11464,Leonard,7, So what did Justin say when you told him he couldn‰Ûªt sleep on your couch?,3
11465,Penny,7," He‰Ûªs a musician. He‰Ûªll sleep in his own vomit, if he has to.",3
11466,Scene,7," The apartment. Sheldon is in his spot. Beside him, a long haired bearded person is asleep. There is a guitar propped up on the arm of the sofa.",3
11467,Sheldon,7, I should have asked for much more than a comic book and a robot.,3
11468,Scene,8, A camp site.,3
11469,Howard,8, How much time do we have?,3
11470,Leonard,8," Uh, t-minus five hours, 37 minutes to onset of meteor shower.",3
11471,Raj,8," Okay, our position is 34.48 degrees north, 118.31 west. That means the azimuth should be 168.22 degrees relative to magnetic north with an elevation of 49.93.",3
11472,Howard,8, Anything yet?,3
11473,Leonard,8," Uh, we have a signal, but there‰Ûªs no frame lock.",3
11474,Howard,8," Hang on, how about now?",3
11475,Raj,8, We did it. We have the west coast feed of HBO.,3
11476,Howard,8," Ooh, Real Sex.",3
11477,Raj,8, Big deal. Every time I watch that show it‰Ûªs old women putting condoms on cucumbers.,3
11478,Howard,8," Alright, let‰Ûªs see what‰Ûªs on the east coast feed.",3
11479,Leonard,8," Oh, hey. Dune.",3
11480,Raj,8," Not a great movie, but look at that beautiful desert.",3
11481,Leonard,8, Too bad Sheldon couldn‰Ûªt come with us.,3
11482,Raj,8," Yes, it‰Ûªs not the same without him. (They all laugh)",3
11483,Howard,8," Oh, this sucks, I‰Ûªm switching back to Real Sex.",3
11484,Scene,8, The apartment.,3
11485,Sheldon,8," Sheldon‰Ûªs log, stardate 63345.3. While my colleagues are off observing the Leonid meteor shower, I have remained behind to complete my paper on the decays of highly excited massive string states. Although my research is going well I do miss the warmth of human companionship. (He laughs)",3
11486,Scene,8, The apartment.,3
11487,Sheldon,8," And good evening to you, Siam Palace. This is Sheldon Cooper. Yeah, I‰Ûªm going to be dining alone this evening, so I‰Ûªll be reducing my usual order. I‰Ûªd like to start with one quarter of the assorted appetizers plate and, uh, one half of the golden treasure for two. Oh, for heaven‰Ûªs sake, in the mid-18th century, King Rama IV of Siam divided a huge empire amongst the colonial powers of Europe in order to preserve his throne. Surely, you, his cultural descendant, can handle pad thai and dumplings.",3
11488,Penny (voice off),8, Sheldon help!,3
11489,Sheldon,8," I need to go, but you keep in mind that my sharply worded comments on yelp.com recently took down a local muffin store. (At Penny‰Ûªs door, knock, knock, knock) Penny. (Knock, knock, knock) Penny. (Knock, knock, knock) Penny..",3
11490,Penny,8, Come in! Hurry!,3
11491,Sheldon,8, Penny?,3
11492,Penny,8, I‰Ûªm back here.,3
11493,Sheldon,8," (At Penny‰Ûªs bedroom door, knock, knock, knock) Penny. (Knock, knock, knock) Penny. (Knock, knock, knock) Penny..",3
11494,Penny,8," Oh, for god‰Ûªs sakes, I‰Ûªm in the bathroom!",3
11495,Sheldon,8, Shall I come back at a better time?,3
11496,Penny,8, Get in here! Hurry! Don‰Ûªt you dare knock.,3
11497,Sheldon,8, Hello.,3
11498,Penny,8," I slipped in the shower, and I think I dislocated my shoulder.",3
11499,Sheldon,8, Not surprising. You have no safety mat or adhesive stickers to allow for purchase on a surface with a low coefficient of static friction.,3
11500,Penny,8, What?,3
11501,Sheldon,8, Tubs are slippery.,3
11502,Penny,8, I know. I slipped.,3
11503,Sheldon,8, I have a series of whimsical duck stickers on the bottom of my tub.,3
11504,Penny,8," Yeah, okay, whatever. Will you just turn the water off and help me up?",3
11505,Sheldon,8, They‰Ûªre holding umbrellas.,3
11506,Penny,8, What?,3
11507,Sheldon,8, The ducks in my tub.,3
11508,Penny,8, Uh-huh.,3
11509,Sheldon,8," They‰Ûªre whimsical because ducks have neither the need for, nor the ability to use umbrellas.",3
11510,Penny,8," Oh, my god. I got to go to the emergency room.",3
11511,Sheldon,8," Well, assuming you‰Ûªre correct that your right humerus is no longer seated in the glenoid socket, I would certainly think so.",3
11512,Penny,8," Okay, can you drive me?",3
11513,Sheldon,8, I don‰Ûªt drive.,3
11514,Penny,8," Well, I can‰Ûªt drive!",3
11515,Sheldon,8," Well, it seems we‰Ûªve reached an impasse.",3
11516,Penny,8, Ow.,3
11517,Sheldon,8, But I could call you a cab or an ambulance.,3
11518,Penny,8," No, no, no, I can‰Ûªt wait that long, you got to help me, please.",3
11519,Sheldon,8, All right. Let it never be said that Sheldon Lee Cooper ignored the pleas of a damsel in distress.,3
11520,Penny,8, No one‰Ûªs saying that. Let‰Ûªs go.,3
11521,Sheldon,8," Well, it does seem rather ironic that for want of 99-cent adhesive ducks, we both might die in a fiery car crash.",3
11522,Scene,8, The camp site.,3
11523,Leonard,8," I wish Penny didn‰Ûªt have to work, she loves camping.",3
11524,Raj,8," Yeah, that would have been great. You and Penny having sex in the tent while I sit out here and watch Howard hump a cactus.",3
11525,Howard,8," Okay, the best I can tell, there are eight other campsites nearby. Mostly science nerds like us, but just over yon ridge are two not unattractive middle school teachers who reek of desperation.",3
11526,Raj,8, Wow. Wonderful. How old are they?,3
11527,Howard,8," Oh I don‰Ûªt know, 50, 55.",3
11528,Raj,8," Oh, menopause, nature‰Ûªs birth control.",3
11529,Leonard,8," Come on, you guys can‰Ûªt be that hard up.",3
11530,Howard,8, I am.,3
11531,Raj,8," Yeah, me, too.",3
11532,Howard,8," Look, they gave me homemade cookies.",3
11533,Leonard,8," Of course, they did. That‰Ûªs what grandmothers do.",3
11534,Raj,8," So, what are we waiting for?",3
11535,Howard,8," Relax, I said we‰Ûªd stop by a little later after they have their nap.",3
11536,Raj,8, Good idea. They‰Ûªll be refreshed.,3
11537,Howard,8, Cookie?,3
11538,Raj,8," Yeah, thank you. Mmmm.",3
11539,Leonard,8," Mmmm, not bad.",3
11540,Raj,8," Yeah, very tasty. Well, so tell me more about these teachers.",3
11541,Howard,8, Not much to tell. They had a VW Microbus and were wearing tie-dyed Grateful Dead shirts.,3
11542,Raj,8, Huh. Mmm. Good cookies.,3
11543,Scene,8, Penny‰Ûªs bedroom.,3
11544,Sheldon,8, I see no organizational system in here whatsoever. Which panties do you wear on Mondays?,3
11545,Penny,8," I don‰Ûªt need panties, I just need shorts and a shirt.",3
11546,Sheldon,8, My mother always told me one should wear clean underpants in case one is in an accident.,3
11547,Penny,8, One was already in an accident.,3
11548,Sheldon,8," That doesn‰Ûªt mean one won‰Ûªt be in another, especially if I‰Ûªm driving.",3
11549,Penny,8," Clothes, Sheldon. I need clothes!",3
11550,Sheldon,8," Okay, here.",3
11551,Penny,8, Seriously? Those shorts with that top?,3
11552,Sheldon,8, All right.,3
11553,Penny,8," No‰Û_ No‰Û_ Oh, that‰Ûªs cute.",3
11554,Sheldon,8, We should have you checked for a concussion.,3
11555,Penny,8," Okay, now, you got to help me put these on.",3
11556,Sheldon,8, All right.,3
11557,Penny,8, But don‰Ûªt look.,3
11558,Sheldon,8, Don‰Ûªt look?,3
11559,Penny,8, I don‰Ûªt want you to see me naked.,3
11560,Sheldon,8," Oh. Well, that‰Ûªs understandable. You may be interested to know that a prohibition against looking is well established in heroic mythology. Uh, Lot and his wife, Perseus and Medusa, Orpheus and Eurydice.",3
11561,Penny,8," Yeah, great.",3
11562,Sheldon,8, They always look. It never ends well.,3
11563,Penny,8," Ok, now you gotta help me get my arm into the sleeve.",3
11564,Sheldon,8, Ok.,3
11565,Penny,8, Is that my arm?,3
11566,Sheldon,8, It doesn‰Ûªt feel like an arm.,3
11567,Penny,8," Then, maybe you should let it go.",3
11568,Sheldon,8, All righty.,3
11569,Scene,8, The camp site. ,3
11570,Leonard,8," Stars are pretty, aren‰Ûªt they?",3
11571,Howard,8," Up above the world so high, like little diamonds in the sky.",3
11572,Raj,8," That‰Ûªs beautiful, dude. You should‰Û_ You should write that down before someone steals it.",3
11573,Howard,8," So, when do the meteors get here?",3
11574,Raj,8," The meteors don‰Ûªt get here, the earth is moving into their path.",3
11575,Leonard,8," I can feel it. I can feel the earth moving. It‰Ûªs moving too fast. Raj, slow it down.",3
11576,Raj,8," Okay, how‰Ûªs that?",3
11577,Leonard,8, Better. Thanks.,3
11578,Howard,8," Stars are pretty, aren‰Ûªt they?",3
11579,Leonard,8, What‰Ûªs so funny?,3
11580,Raj,8," It‰Ûªs your American accent. Everything you say sounds stupid. (With an American accent) Stars are pretty, aren‰Ûªt they?",3
11581,Scene,8, Penny‰Ûªs car.,3
11582,Sheldon,8," For the record, I should let you know this is my first time driving an actual motor vehicle.",3
11583,Penny,8," You have your learner‰Ûªs permit, right?",3
11584,Sheldon,8," Yes, and I have logged a considerable number of hours on a simulator.",3
11585,Penny,8, Good.,3
11586,Sheldon,8, Didn‰Ûªt work out well.,3
11587,Penny,8," All right, can we please go?",3
11588,Sheldon,8," One moment. According to my driver‰Ûªs ed book, a side mirror is properly adjusted when a portion of the is driver‰Ûªs door handle is visible in the lower right corner. There‰Ûªs the handle. Oh, no, too far, bringing it back. Optimized. Now, where is the switch to adjust the passenger side mirror?",3
11589,Penny,8, It‰Ûªs right there.,3
11590,Sheldon,8, Where is the passenger side mirror?,3
11591,Penny,8," In a parking lot in Hollywood. Now, can we please go?",3
11592,Sheldon,8," Yes. As soon as I adjust my seat. Whee! Oh, dear. I‰Ûªm going to have to start again.",3
11593,Scene,8, The camp site. ,3
11594,Raj,8," If I could speak the language of rabbits, they would be amazed, and I would be their king.",3
11595,Leonard,8, I hate my name. It has nerd in it. Len nerd.,3
11596,Howard,8, I lost my virginity to my cousin Jeanie.,3
11597,Raj,8, I would be kind to my rabbit subjects. At first.,3
11598,Leonard,8, You know what‰Ûªs a cool name? Angelo. That has angel and jell-o in it.,3
11599,Howard,8, It was my Uncle Murray‰Ûªs funeral. We were all back at my Aunt Barbara‰Ûªs house. Our eyes locked over the pickled herring. We never meant for it to happen.,3
11600,Raj,8," One day, I hold a great ball for the President of France, but the rabbits, they hate me and don‰Ûªt come. I am embarrassed, so I eat all the lettuce in the world and make them watch.",3
11601,Leonard,8," People could call me Angie. Yo, Angie, how‰Ûªs it goin‰Ûª?",3
11602,Howard,8," To this day, I can‰Ûªt look at pickled herring without being aroused and ashamed. Oh, cousin Jeanie.",3
11603,Scene,8, Penny‰Ûªs car.,3
11604,Penny,8, Could you please drive a little faster?,3
11605,Sheldon,8," Oh, I think we‰Ûªre going sufficiently fast. What‰Ûªs that?",3
11606,Penny,8, Nothing. The engine does that sometimes.,3
11607,Sheldon,8," That can‰Ûªt be nothing, the check engine light is on. We need to find a service station.",3
11608,Penny,8, No. The light has been on since I bought the car.,3
11609,Sheldon,8, All the more reason to consult with a mechanic before it explodes.,3
11610,Penny,8," It‰Ûªs not going to explode, just keep driving. Warp speed ahead, Mr. Spock.",3
11611,Sheldon,8," Mr. Spock did not pilot the Enterprise. He was the science officer, and I guarantee you that if he ever saw the Enterprise‰Ûªs check engine light blinking, he would pull the ship over immediately.",3
11612,Penny,8," Oh, god, I‰Ûªm gonna lose the arm.",3
11613,Sheldon,8," Oh, oh, red light, release accelerator and slowly apply the brake. Nailed it. While we have a moment, may I ask you a question?",3
11614,Penny,8, What?,3
11615,Sheldon,8, Why do you have the Chinese character for soup tattooed on your right buttock?,3
11616,Penny,8," It‰Ûªs not soup, it‰Ûªs courage.",3
11617,Sheldon,8," No, it isn‰Ûªt. But I suppose it does take courage to demonstrate that kind of commitment to soup.",3
11618,Penny,8, How did you see it? You said you wouldn‰Ûªt look.,3
11619,Sheldon,8," Sorry. As I told you, the hero always peeks.",3
11620,Scene,8, The camp site. ,3
11621,Howard,8, Anything?,3
11622,Leonard,8, No. That was the last pudding cup.,3
11623,Howard,8, No! What about Slim Jims?,3
11624,Leonard,8," That‰Ûªs what he used to eat his pudding, remember?",3
11625,Raj,8, Right! That was so good! Sweety and meaty at the same time.,3
11626,Howard,8," Wait. Wait, wait. So you‰Ûªre saying we‰Ûªre out of food?",3
11627,Leonard,8, The only thing in here are blue ice packs.,3
11628,Raj,8," I know they‰Ûªre poison, but they look like big, yummy otter pops.",3
11629,Leonard,8," Oh, god, I am so hungry.",3
11630,Howard,8, Me too. Check and see if we have any more pudding.,3
11631,Leonard,8, Okay.,3
11632,Scene,8, The hospital waiting room.,3
11633,Sheldon,8," All right, there‰Ûªs no need to bark at me. According to the inexplicably irritable nurse behind the desk, you‰Ûªll be seen after the man who claims to be having a heart attack, but appears to be well enough to play Doodle Jump on his iPhone. We have to fill these out. Describe illness or injury.",3
11634,Penny,8, I dislocated my shoulder.,3
11635,Sheldon,8, All right. And how did the accident occur?,3
11636,Penny,8, You ready know that.,3
11637,Sheldon,8," Cause of accident, lack of adhesive ducks. Okay, medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with diabetes?",3
11638,Penny,8, No.,3
11639,Sheldon,8, Kidney disease?,3
11640,Penny,8, No.,3
11641,Sheldon,8, Migraines?,3
11642,Penny,8, Getting one.,3
11643,Sheldon,8, Are you currently pregnant?,3
11644,Penny,8, No.,3
11645,Sheldon,8, Are you sure? You look a bit puffy.,3
11646,Penny,8, Change migraine to yes.,3
11647,Sheldon,8, When was your last menstrual period?,3
11648,Penny,8," Oh, next question.",3
11649,Sheldon,8," I‰Ûªll put, in progress. Okay, moving to psychiatric disorders, list all major behavioural diagnoses, e.g. depression, anxiety, etcetera.",3
11650,Penny,8," Oh, my god, what the hell does this have to do with my stupid shoulder?",3
11651,Sheldon,8, Episodes of sub psychotic rage.,3
11652,Penny,8, Ass.,3
11653,Sheldon,8," Possible Tourette‰Ûªs. All right, moles, lesions or other skin conditions. Soup tattoo on right buttock.",3
11654,Penny,8," Hey, Sheldon, Sheldon, look, I am scared and in a lot of pain. Could you please just take a break from being you for just a minute and try being, I don‰Ûªt know, comforting?",3
11655,Sheldon,8," I‰Ûªm sorry. There, there. Everything‰Ûªs going to be fine. Sheldon‰Ûªs here.",3
11656,Penny,8, Thanks. That‰Ûªs much better.,3
11657,Scene,8, The camp site.,3
11658,Raj,8," Oh, I‰Ûªm so hungry!",3
11659,Leonard,8, Will you shut up? We‰Ûªre all hungry.,3
11660,Howard,8," Okay, our objective is the boy scout campsite to the east. Easy target. Big doughy scout master, couple of cubs, most webelos.",3
11661,Leonard,8, What kind of score are we looking at?,3
11662,Howard,8," Hot dogs, buns, s‰Ûªmores, I mean, it‰Ûªs a freaking 7-11.",3
11663,Leonard,8," All right, everyone grab flashlights.",3
11664,Howard,8," Oh, my god, could it be? Yes! My mother put an I love you brisket in my backpack.",3
11665,Leonard,8," Quick, get forks.",3
11666,Howard,8," You don‰Ûªt need forks. It‰Ûªs so tender, it falls apart in your hands.",3
11667,Raj,8, He‰Ûªs right.,3
11668,Leonard,8, I feel like we‰Ûªre forgetting something important.,3
11669,Raj,8," Me, too. But what? (Behind them, the meteor shower has begun)",3
11670,Howard,8, Maybe a tupperware bowl of roasted potatoes and carrots?,3
11671,Leonard and Raj together,8, Yes! Yes!,3
11672,Scene,8, Penny‰Ûªs apartment.,3
11673,Sheldon,8," Now remember, you were given powerful pain medication and a muscle relaxer, so, uh, don‰Ûªt operate heavy machinery. Try not to choke on your own drool.",3
11674,Penny,8, Wait. You have to help me get into bed. Sheldon has to get me into bed. Bet you never thought I‰Ûªd say that.,3
11675,Sheldon,8, Yes. The charm of your drug addled candour knows no bounds.,3
11676,Penny,8," You know, people think you‰Ûªre this weird robot man who‰Ûªs so annoying all the time, and you totally are, but then it‰Ûªs like that movie Wall-E at the end. You‰Ûªre so full of love, and you can save a plant and get fat people out of the floaty chairs.",3
11677,Sheldon,8," That‰Ûªs a fairly laboured metaphor, but I appreciate the sentiment behind it.",3
11678,Penny,8, Sing ‰ÛÏSoft Kitty‰Û to me.,3
11679,Sheldon,8, ‰ÛÏSoft Kitty‰Û is for when you‰Ûªre sick. You‰Ûªre not sick.,3
11680,Penny,8, Injured and drugged is a kind of sick.,3
11681,Sheldon (singing),8," Soft kitty, warm kitty, little ball of fur‰Û_",3
11682,Penny,8," Wait, wait. Let‰Ûªs sing it as a round. I‰Ûªll start. Soft kitty, warm kitty, little ball of fur‰Û_ See that‰Ûªs where you come in. I‰Ûªll start over. Soft kitty, warm kitty, little ball of fur‰Û_ I‰Ûªve got all night, Sheldon. Soft kitty, warm kitty‰Û_ (Sheldon joins in with the round) little ball of fur, happy kitty, sleepy kitty, purr, purr, purr.",3
11683,Scene,8, The camp site. Raj is telling a ghost story with the torch on his face.,3
11684,Raj,8," ‰Û_And the next morning when he woke up, he rolled over and realized‰Û_ duh-duh-duh! ‰Û_she was his cousin.",3
11685,Howard,8, That‰Ûªs still not funny.,3
11686,Raj (imitating him),8, That‰Ûªs still not funny.,3
11687,Howard,8, And she was my second cousin.,3
11688,Raj (imitating him),8, And she was my second cousin.,3
11689,Howard,8, You‰Ûªre a real douche.,3
11690,Raj,8, Who cares? You slept with your cousin.,3
11691,Scene,9, Outside an apartment building.,3
11692,Howard,9," So two years later, there‰Ûªs a knock on the door, guy opens it, and there on his porch is the snail, who says, ‰ÛÏWhat the heck was all that about?‰Û",3
11693,Bernadette,9, I don‰Ûªt really get it.,3
11694,Howard,9," Well, see, it took two years for the snail to‰Û_ (she kisses him) not important.",3
11695,Bernadette,9, Can I ask you a question?,3
11696,Howard,9, Sure.,3
11697,Bernadette,9, Where do you think this is going?,3
11698,Howard,9," To be honest, I was hoping at least second base.",3
11699,Bernadette,9, You‰Ûªre so funny. You‰Ûªre like a stand-up comedian.,3
11700,Howard,9," A Jewish stand-up comedian, that‰Ûªd be new.",3
11701,Bernadette,9," Actually, I think a lot of them are Jewish.",3
11702,Howard,9," No, I was just‰Û_ never mind.",3
11703,Bernadette,9," Look, Howard, this is our third date and we both know what that means.",3
11704,Howard,9, We do?,3
11705,Bernadette,9, Sex.,3
11706,Howard,9, You‰Ûªre kidding.,3
11707,Bernadette,9, But I need to know whether you‰Ûªre looking for a relationship or a one-night stand.,3
11708,Howard,9," Okay, just to be clear, there‰Ûªs only one correct answer, right? It‰Ûªs not like chicken or fish on an airplane?",3
11709,Bernadette,9, Maybe you need to think about it a little.,3
11710,Howard,9," You know, it‰Ûªs not unheard of for a one-night stand to turn into a relationship.",3
11711,Bernadette,9, Call me when you figure it out.,3
11712,Howard,9, Three dates means sex? Who knew?,3
11713,Scene,9, The apartment.,3
11714,Howard,9," Greetings, homies, homette.",3
11715,Penny,9, Why are you back from your date so early?,3
11716,Howard,9," In romance, as in show business, always leave them wanting more.",3
11717,Penny,9, What exactly does that mean?,3
11718,Leonard,9, He struck out.,3
11719,Scene,9, The university cafeteria.,3
11720,Howard,9," Hey, did either of you guys know that three dates with the same woman is the threshold for sex?",3
11721,Raj,9," Actually, I‰Ûªve never had three dates with the same woman.",3
11722,Leonard,9," With Penny and me, it took two years. Now that I think about it, that was three dates.",3
11723,Howard,9," Okay, well, before you and Penny hooked up, did she ask for any kind of commitment?",3
11724,Leonard,9," No, she was pretty clear about wanting to keep her options open.",3
11725,Sheldon (arriving),9," I have something to announce, but out of respect for convention, I will wait for you to finish your current conversation. What are you talking about?",3
11726,Leonard,9, The cultural paradigm in which people have sex after three dates.,3
11727,Sheldon,9," I see. Now, are we talking date, the social interaction, or date, the dried fruit?",3
11728,Leonard,9," Never mind, what‰Ûªs your announcement?",3
11729,Sheldon,9," Oh, good, my turn. Well, this is very exciting and I wanted you to be among the first to know‰Û_",3
11730,Kripke,9," Hey, Cooper, I hear you‰Ûªre going to be on the wadio with Ira Fwatow from Science Fwiday next week.",3
11731,Sheldon,9," Thank you, Kripke, for depriving me of the opportunity to share my news with my friends.",3
11732,Kripke,9, My pweasure.,3
11733,Sheldon,9, My thank you was not sincere.,3
11734,Kripke,9," But my pweasure is. Let me ask you a question, at what point did National Public Wadio have to start scwaping the bottom of the bawwel for its guests? Eh, don‰Ûªt answer, it‰Ûªs wetowical.",3
11735,Sheldon,9, Why are you such a stupid head? That is also rhetorical. I‰Ûªm sorry you had to hear that.,3
11736,Leonard,9, Are you really going to be on NPR?,3
11737,Sheldon,9," Yes, they‰Ûªre interviewing me by phone from my office, regarding the recent so-called discovery of magnetic monopoles in spin-ices. It‰Ûªs pledge week and they‰Ûªre trying to goose the ratings with a little controversy.",3
11738,Leonard,9," Very cool, congratulations.",3
11739,Sheldon,9," Thank you. My mother is very excited. She‰Ûªs convening her Bible study group to listen in, and then pray for my soul.",3
11740,Scene,9, The apartment.,3
11741,Sheldon,9," All right. These are the talking points for my NPR interview tomorrow. I need to make sure that they‰Ûªre simple enough for the less educated in the audience to understand. Howard, look this over and tell me what‰Ûªs unclear to you.",3
11742,Howard,9," Excuse me, I have a master‰Ûªs degree in engineering from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. It required the completion of 144 units of grad work and an original thesis.",3
11743,Sheldon,9, Yes. Look this over and tell me what‰Ûªs unclear to you.,3
11744,Leonard,9," You know, when Sheldon gives you homework, you don‰Ûªt have to do it.",3
11745,Raj,9," In fact, it‰Ûªs better if you don‰Ûªt, otherwise it makes the rest of us look bad.",3
11746,Penny,9," Hi, guys.",3
11747,Leonard,9, Hey.,3
11748,Sheldon,9, Hello.,3
11749,Penny,9," Yo, Raj, talk to me. I‰Ûªm sorry, just screwing with you. Hey, Howard, why haven‰Ûªt you called Bernadette?",3
11750,Howard,9, Did she say something?,3
11751,Penny,9," Yeah, she said she hasn‰Ûªt heard from you in a week. I thought you liked her?",3
11752,Howard,9," I do, yeah, but she wants a commitment and I‰Ûªm not sure she‰Ûªs my type.",3
11753,Penny,9, She agreed to go out with you for free. What more do you need?,3
11754,Howard,9," Look, Bernadette is really nice. I just always thought when I finally settle down into a relationship, it would be with someone, you know, different.",3
11755,Penny,9, Different how?,3
11756,Howard,9," Well, you know, more like Megan Fox from Transformers, or Katee Sackhoff from Battlestar Galactica.",3
11757,Penny,9, Are you high?,3
11758,Leonard,9, You‰Ûªd have a better shot with the three-breasted Martian hooker from Total Recall.,3
11759,Howard,9," Okay, now you‰Ûªre just being unrealistic. Anyway, that movie was like 20 years ago, imagine how saggy those things would be.",3
11760,Penny,9," Howard, you‰Ûªre going to throw away a great girl like Bernadette because you‰Ûªre holding out for some ridiculous fantasy?",3
11761,Howard,9," Hey, just because you settled doesn‰Ûªt mean I have to.",3
11762,Leonard,9," Excuse me, I‰Ûªm sitting here.",3
11763,Penny,9," Hey, I did not settle for Leonard. I mean, obviously, he isn‰Ûªt the kind of guy I usually go out with, you know, physically.",3
11764,Leonard,9," Again, I‰Ûªm right here.",3
11765,Penny,9," My point is, I do not judge a book by its cover. I am interested in the person underneath.",3
11766,Leonard,9," I am here, right? You see me.",3
11767,Howard,9," Hey, I‰Ûªm interested in what‰Ûªs inside people, too, but why is it wrong to want those insides wrapped up in, say, the delicious caramel that is Halle Berry? (To Raj) Yes, you‰Ûªre delicious caramel, too.",3
11768,Penny,9," All right, you know what, I will tell you why it‰Ûªs wrong‰Û_",3
11769,Sheldon,9," Excuse me, may I interject?",3
11770,Penny,9, What?,3
11771,Sheldon,9," Biologically speaking, Howard is perfectly justified in seeking out the optimum mate for the propagation of his genetic line.",3
11772,Howard,9," Thank you, Sheldon.",3
11773,Sheldon,9," Now, whether that propagation is in the interest of humanity is, of course, an entirely different question.",3
11774,Scene,9, Kripke is in a storage cupboard of some kind. He has tubes rigged up through the roof attached to helium tanks which he is turning on. The radio is playing. ,3
11775,Radio,9," This is Ira Flatow and you‰Ûªre listening to NPR‰Ûªs Science Friday. Joining us today by phone from his office in Pasadena, California is Dr. Sheldon Cooper.",3
11776,Kripke,9," Oh, this is going to be a wiot.",3
11777,Radio,9," Thanks for being with us today, Dr. Cooper.",3
11778,Sheldon,9," My pleasure, Ira.",3
11779,Ira,9," Now, let‰Ûªs talk about magnetic monopoles. Can you explain to our audience just what a monopole is?",3
11780,Sheldon,9," Of course. First, consider an ordinary magnet which has, (the pitch of his voice begins to rise) as even the most uneducated in your audience must know, two poles, (pitch rises further) a north and south pole. If you cut that in half, you have two smaller magnets, each with its own north and south pole.",3
11781,Ira,9," Uh, Dr. Cooper, I think there might be something wrong with our connection.",3
11782,Sheldon (even higher pitch),9," No, I hear you fine. As I was saying, an ordinary magnet has two poles. The primary characteristic of a monopole is that it has only one pole, hence, monopole.",3
11783,Sheldon,9," A requirement for string theory, or M-theory, if you will, is the existence of such monopoles. I, myself, led an expedition to the Arctic Circle in search of said particles. Kripke, I found the nozzle! I‰Ûªm going to kill you!",3
11784,Scene,9, Howard‰Ûªs bathroom. He is in the bath.,3
11785,Howard,9, So nice you could join me this evening. You‰Ûªre looking lovely as always.,3
11786,Katee Sackhoff,9," Thanks, Howard. Always nice to be part of your masturbatory fantasies.",3
11787,Howard,9," Come on, Katee, don‰Ûªt make it sound so cheap.",3
11788,Katee,9," I‰Ûªm sorry, fiddling with yourself in the bathtub is a real class act.",3
11789,Howard,9," Thank you. So, shall we get started?",3
11790,Katee,9, Sure. But can I ask you a question first?,3
11791,Howard,9, You want to play Cylon and colonist?,3
11792,Katee,9, No. I want to know why you‰Ûªre playing make-believe with me when you could be out with a real woman tonight.,3
11793,Howard,9," You mean, Bernadette?",3
11794,Katee,9," No, I mean Princess Leia. Of course I mean Bernadette. She‰Ûªs a wonderful girl and she really likes you.",3
11795,Howard,9," I know, but she‰Ûªs not you.",3
11796,Katee,9," I‰Ûªm not me. The real me is in Beverly Hills going out with a tall, handsome, rich guy.",3
11797,Howard,9, Really? Tall?,3
11798,Katee,9, Six-four.,3
11799,Howard,9, Ouch.,3
11800,Katee,9," The point is, you‰Ûªve got a wonderful girl in your life, and you‰Ûªre ignoring her in order to spend your nights in the bathtub with a mental image and a wash cloth.",3
11801,Howard‰Ûªs Mother,9, Howard! What are you doing in there?,3
11802,Howard,9, I‰Ûªm taking a bath!,3
11803,Howard‰Ûªs Mother,9, I hope that‰Ûªs all you‰Ûªre doing! We share that tub!,3
11804,Howard,9," Don‰Ûªt remind me! (Katee has vanished) Oh, man. All soaped up and no place to go.",3
11805,Scene,9, Sheldon‰Ûªs bedroom. ,3
11806,Leonard,9," How ya doin‰Ûª, buddy?",3
11807,Sheldon,9, I was humiliated on national radio. How do you think I‰Ûªm doing?,3
11808,Leonard,9," Come on, it wasn‰Ûªt that bad.",3
11809,Sheldon,9, What do you want?,3
11810,Raj (in a munchkin voice),9," We represent the Lollipop Guild, and we want you.",3
11811,Leonard,9," Okay, so Kripke played a joke on you.",3
11812,Sheldon,9, It wasn‰Ûªt funny.,3
11813,Raj,9, I thought it was funny.,3
11814,Leonard,9, Raj.,3
11815,Raj,9, You laughed.,3
11816,Sheldon,9, Did you laugh?,3
11817,Leonard,9," I fell on the floor. All right, he got you, you can get him back.",3
11818,Sheldon,9, I refuse to sink to his level.,3
11819,Raj,9," You can‰Ûªt sink. With all that helium in you, you‰Ûªre lucky you don‰Ûªt float away.",3
11820,Leonard,9, Are you really admitting defeat?,3
11821,Sheldon,9, I never admit defeat.,3
11822,Leonard,9, Good.,3
11823,Sheldon,9," However, on an unrelated topic, I am never getting out of this bed again.",3
11824,Leonard,9, What if you could make Kripke look even sillier than he made you look?,3
11825,Raj,9," I don‰Ûªt think that‰Ûªs possible, dude.",3
11826,Leonard,9, You‰Ûªre not helping.,3
11827,Raj,9," I didn‰Ûªt come to help, I came to mock.",3
11828,Leonard,9," Sheldon, what you need to do is figure out a way to exact vengeance on Kripke, like, uh, like, how the Joker got back at Batman for putting him in the Arkham Asylum for the Criminally Insane.",3
11829,Raj,9," That‰Ûªs true. He didn‰Ûªt just stay there and talk about his feelings with the other psychotic villains. He, he broke out and poisoned Gotham‰Ûªs water supply.",3
11830,Sheldon,9," Well, I suppose I could poison Kripke.",3
11831,Leonard,9," No, no.",3
11832,Sheldon,9, It‰Ûªs a simple matter. There are several toxic chemicals that‰Ûªd be untraceable in an autopsy.,3
11833,Leonard,9," Okay, uh, that‰Ûªs the spirit, but, um, let‰Ûªs dial it back to a non-lethal form of vengeance.",3
11834,Sheldon,9," Oh! How about we put awhoopee cushion on his office chair? He‰Ûªll sit down, it‰Ûªll sound like he‰Ûªs flatulent, even though he‰Ûªs not.",3
11835,Leonard,9, Let‰Ûªs keep thinking.,3
11836,Scene,9, The Cheesecake Factory. Howard enters.,3
11837,Penny,9," Oh, gee, you‰Ûªre too late. Scarlett Johansson and Wonder Woman were just in here trolling around for neurotic, little weasels.",3
11838,Howard,9," Yeah, I came to talk to Bernadette. She‰Ûªs working today, right?",3
11839,Penny,9," Yes, but I don‰Ûªt think she wants to see you.",3
11840,Howard,9, Why not?,3
11841,Penny,9," Come on, Howard. You hurt her feelings by not calling her all week. Plus, I‰Ûªve kind of been talkin‰Ûª some smack about ya.",3
11842,Bernadette,9," Hello, Howard.",3
11843,Howard,9," Wait, Bernadette, I need to talk to you.",3
11844,Bernadette,9," I can‰Ûªt now, I‰Ûªm working.",3
11845,Howard,9," This will only take a second. You asked me to think about where our relationship was going, and I did. Bernadette? Will you marry me?",3
11846,Bernadette,9, Is this more comedy that I don‰Ûªt understand?,3
11847,Howard,9," No. I‰Ûªm serious. I‰Ûªm never going to find another girl like you who likes me and is, you know, real.",3
11848,Bernadette,9," So, this isn‰Ûªt a joke?",3
11849,Howard,9, No.,3
11850,Bernadette,9, Then you‰Ûªre insane.,3
11851,Howard,9, I prefer to think of myself as quirky.,3
11852,Bernadette,9," Howard, we‰Ûªve only been on three dates. We haven‰Ûªt even had sex yet.",3
11853,Howard,9, Fair enough. When‰Ûªs your break?,3
11854,Bernadette,9, Wow. (Walks away),3
11855,Howard,9, Don‰Ûªt you just hate when this happens?,3
11856,Penny,9, Wow.,3
11857,Scene,9, The apartment kitchen.,3
11858,Sheldon,9," All right, how‰Ûªs this for revenge? A solution of hydrogen peroxide, and one of saturated potassium iodide.",3
11859,Raj,9, What‰Ûªs this?,3
11860,Sheldon,9," Mountain Dew. Ah, refreshing. Now, we‰Ûªre going to combine these chemicals with ordinary dish soap, creating a little exothermic release of oxygen.",3
11861,Raj,9, Foamy vengeance.,3
11862,Sheldon,9," Yes, exactly.",3
11863,Leonard,9," This is brilliant, Sheldon. How are we going to deploy it in Kripke‰Ûªs office?",3
11864,Sheldon,9," Already taken care of. Observe. This is a live shot of Kripke‰Ûªs lab via a mini webcam I was able to install, thanks to a dollar bill discreetly placed in the night janitor‰Ûªs shirt pocket. At the same time, I also secured large quantities of these chemicals above the tiles in the drop ceiling.",3
11865,Raj,9," Oh, Sheldon, you remind me of a young Lex Luthor.",3
11866,Sheldon,9," You flatter me, sir.",3
11867,Leonard,9," Let me guess, motion sensors?",3
11868,Sheldon,9," The reaction will be triggered when Kripke reaches the center of the room. Mwah, ha, ha.",3
11869,Leonard,9," I gotta say, I am really impressed. This is truly the Sheldon Cooper way to get even. (Sits down. There is a flatulent noise)",3
11870,Sheldon,9," It may be low-tech, but I still maintain the whoopee cushion has comic validity.",3
11871,Raj,9, Here comes Kripke!,3
11872,Leonard,9, Who is that with him?,3
11873,Raj,9, I believe that‰Ûªs the president of the university.,3
11874,Leonard,9, And the board of directors. Abort! Abort!,3
11875,Sheldon,9, There is no abort.,3
11876,Raj,9," Well, how could you not put in an abort?",3
11877,Sheldon,9," I made a boo-boo, all right?",3
11878,Kripke,9," I think the board will weally appweciate how well we‰Ûªre using that NSA gwant, Pwesident Seibert. Wight here we have a micwo-contwolled pwasma‰Û_ (foam falls from the ceiling soaking everyone)",3
11879,Raj,9, Wow. Looks like the Ganges on laundry day.,3
11880,Leonard,9, At least they don‰Ûªt know it was you.,3
11881,Sheldon (on Kripke‰Ûªs computer in the lab),9," Hello, Kripke. This classic prank comes to you from the malevolent mind of Sheldon Cooper. If you‰Ûªd like to see the look on your stupid face, this video is being instantly uploaded to YouTube. Oh, and a hat tip to Leonard Hofstadter and Raj Koothrappali for their support and encouragement in this enterprise.",3
11882,Raj,9," Well, I‰Ûªm going back to India. What‰Ûªs your plan?",3
11883,Scene,9, The Cheesecake Factory.,3
11884,Penny,9," Hey, here‰Ûªs your tip from table seven.",3
11885,Bernadette,9," Oh, thanks.",3
11886,Penny,9, Mm-hmm.,3
11887,"Howard (on the stage, into a microphone)",9, Testing. Check. Check two.,3
11888,Bernadette,9," Oh, now what?",3
11889,Penny,9, You want me to throw him out?,3
11890,Bernadette,9," No, that‰Ûªs okay.",3
11891,Penny,9," Are you sure? He‰Ûªs small. I bet I can get a nice, tight spiral on him.",3
11892,Howard,9," I want to dedicate this number to a great gal who I‰Ûªve done wrong. (To the tune of the Four Tops song Bernadette)  Bernadette, I am so sorry for trying to propose to you, Bernadette, you found it creepy but that‰Ûªs just the kind of thing I do. I know now it was too soon to talk of love. It was just a crazy idea that came to me in my tub. But, Bernadette, give me one more chance, sweet Bernadette, I‰Ûªll get the hang of this thing they call romance, sweet Bernadette, I dream to once again kiss your lips, sweet Bernadette. Sincerely yours, Howard Wolowitz, Bernadette‰Û_",3
11893,Penny,9," Oh, I am so sorry.",3
11894,Bernadette,9, Are you kidding? That‰Ûªs the most romantic thing anyone‰Ûªs ever done for me.,3
11895,Howard (still singing),9," ‰Û_Bernadette! Thank you, Cheesecake Factory!",3
11896,Scene,10, The apartment,3
11897,Penny,10," Hey, Leonard, check this out. (Throws some food in the air and catches it in her mouth)",3
11898,Sheldon,10," Leonard, she‰Ûªs doing it again.",3
11899,Leonard,10, I think it upsets Sheldon when you play with the food.,3
11900,Sheldon,10, No. It upsets Sheldon when she willy-nilly takes it from the containers without regard for its equitable distribution. This is essentially why you have famine in India.,3
11901,Penny,10, You want me to put it back?,3
11902,Sheldon,10, Leonard.,3
11903,Leonard,10, It upsets Sheldon when you play with the Sheldon.,3
11904,Howard (arriving),10," What‰Ûªs up, my nerdizzles? Raj, Sheldon, I want you to meet my girlfriend Bernadette.",3
11905,Sheldon,10, Hello.,3
11906,Howard,10," Leonard, Penny, you know my girlfriend Bernadette.",3
11907,Leonard,10, Yeah. Hey.,3
11908,Howard,10," Bernadette, say fo‰Ûªshizzle to my nerdizzles.",3
11909,Bernadette,10, I don‰Ûªt think I can. I don‰Ûªt have Howard‰Ûªs street cred.,3
11910,Howard,10," I hope it‰Ûªs all right, I told my girlfriend Bernadette she could join us for dinner.",3
11911,Leonard,10," Sure. The more, the merrier.",3
11912,Sheldon,10," Wait, no, that‰Ûªs a false equivalency. More does not equal merry. If there were 2,000 people in this apartment right now, would we be celebrating? No, we‰Ûªd be suffocating.",3
11913,Leonard,10, Sheldon‰Û_,3
11914,Sheldon,10," Don‰Ûªt Sheldon me. We ordered for five people, not six.",3
11915,Penny,10," Oh, come on, it‰Ûªs fine. We‰Ûªll just put it all on the table, you know, family style.",3
11916,Sheldon,10," Oh, sure. And while we‰Ûªre at it, why don‰Ûªt we put our hands behind our backs, have an old-fashioned eating contest?",3
11917,Leonard,10," Relax, it‰Ûªll be fine, sit down, you guys.",3
11918,Everyone,10, NO!,3
11919,Bernadette,10, What?,3
11920,Penny,10," Oh, yeah, you can‰Ûªt sit there.",3
11921,Bernadette,10, Why not?,3
11922,Leonard,10, That‰Ûªs where Sheldon sits.,3
11923,Bernadette,10, He can‰Ûªt sit somewhere else?,3
11924,Penny,10," Oh no, no, you see, in the winter, that seat is close enough to the radiator so that he‰Ûªs warm, yet not so close that he sweats. In the summer, it‰Ûªs directly in the path of a cross-breeze created by opening windows there and there. It faces the television at an angle that isn‰Ûªt direct, so he can still talk to everybody, yet not so wide that the picture looks distorted.",3
11925,Sheldon,10, Perhaps there‰Ûªs hope for you after all.,3
11926,Scene,10, A few moments later. ,3
11927,Bernadette,10," Ooh, I love your shoes.",3
11928,Penny,10," Oh, thanks. They are cute, aren‰Ûªt they?",3
11929,Bernadette,10, Where‰Ûªd you get them?,3
11930,Penny,10, Shoes for Less.,3
11931,Bernadette,10, I‰Ûªve been meaning to go over there.,3
11932,Penny,10," Oh, great selection, great prices.",3
11933,Sheldon,10, My mother was right. Hell is real.,3
11934,Howard,10," Come on, Sheldon. let the womenfolk chat.",3
11935,Penny,10, Womenfolk?,3
11936,Howard,10, Gals? Chicks? Utero-Americans?,3
11937,Penny,10, Just eat your dinner.,3
11938,Bernadette,10," Don‰Ûªt take him too seriously, a lot of what he says is intended as humour.",3
11939,Penny,10," Yeah, well, I don‰Ûªt think it‰Ûªs very funny.",3
11940,Bernadette,10," Me neither, but he just lights up when I laugh.",3
11941,Penny,10," Howard, never let her go.",3
11942,Bernadette,10," So, Leonard, Howard says you‰Ûªre working on fundamental tests of quantum mechanics.",3
11943,Leonard,10, I am. Are you interested in physics?,3
11944,Bernadette,10," Oh, I find it fascinating. If I hadn‰Ûªt gone into microbiology, I probably would have gone into physics. Or ice dancing.",3
11945,Leonard,10," Actually, my tests of the Aharonov-Bohm quantum interference effect have reached an interesting point. Right now, we‰Ûªre testing the phase shift due to an electric potential.",3
11946,Bernadette,10, That‰Ûªs amazing.,3
11947,Sheldon,10," Yes. Leonard‰Ûªs work is nearly as amazing as third graders growing lima beans in wet paper towels. (Raj whispers to him) While I appreciate the oh, snap, I‰Ûªm uncomfortable having your moist breath in my ear.",3
11948,Bernadette,10, Are you going to try to set up the voltages using tunnel junctions?,3
11949,Leonard,10," Yes, I am. You want to see a simulation on my laptop?",3
11950,Bernadette,10," Oh, yeah, show me. In microbiology, the most exciting thing I get to work with is yeast.",3
11951,Sheldon,10, Howard?,3
11952,Howard,10, Yeah?,3
11953,Sheldon,10, Your shoes are delightful. Where did you get them?,3
11954,Howard,10, What?,3
11955,Sheldon,10, Bazinga. I don‰Ûªt care.,3
11956,Scene,10, The apartment. Sheldon and Raj are playing a racing game on the Wii.,3
11957,Raj,10," Ha! Eat my dust, racially stereotypical plumber.",3
11958,Sheldon,10, That‰Ûªs not fair. I got stuck behind a tree.,3
11959,Raj,10," And a cow and a penguin. Face it dude, whether it‰Ûªs a real car or a virtual cartoon car, you can‰Ûªt drive.",3
11960,Sheldon,10, Just need a little more practice.,3
11961,Raj,10," What you need is cheat codes, motor skills and a magic genie who grants wishes to little boys who suck at Mario Kart.",3
11962,Penny (knocking and entering),10," Hey, Sheldon, can I talk to you for a second?",3
11963,Sheldon,10," It‰Ûªs not about shoes, is it? I don‰Ûªt think I could go through that again.",3
11964,Penny,10, It‰Ûªs not about shoes.,3
11965,Sheldon,10, Then speak.,3
11966,Penny,10," Um, actually, can we do it in private?",3
11967,Sheldon,10," All right. (To Raj) Go away. I agree, it‰Ûªs rude, but she asked for privacy.",3
11968,Penny,10," Thanks, Raj. Okay, so here‰Ûªs the thing, I was wondering if you could maybe teach me a little physics?",3
11969,Sheldon,10," A little physics? There‰Ûªs no such thing. Physics encompasses the entire universe, from quantum particles to supernovas, from spinning electrons to spinning galaxies.",3
11970,Penny,10," Yeah, okay, cool. I don‰Ûªt need the PBS special, I just want to know enough so I can talk to Leonard about his job. You know, like Bernadette does.",3
11971,Sheldon,10, Why can‰Ûªt Leonard teach you?,3
11972,Penny,10, ‰Û÷Cause I want to surprise him.,3
11973,Sheldon,10," Can‰Ûªt you surprise him in some other way? For example, I‰Ûªm sure he‰Ûªd be delightfully taken aback if you cleaned your apartment.",3
11974,Penny,10," Come on, Sheldon, this is important to me.",3
11975,Sheldon,10," Penny, this would be a massive undertaking, and my time is both limited and valuable.",3
11976,Penny,10, You‰Ûªre sitting here playing video games all day.,3
11977,Sheldon,10," Okay, point. What sort of foundation do you have? Did you take any science classes in school?",3
11978,Penny,10, Sure. I did the one with the frogs.,3
11979,Sheldon,10, The one with the frogs.,3
11980,Penny,10," Yeah, actually, it was pretty cool. A lot of the girls threw up, but I gutted that thing like a deer.",3
11981,Sheldon,10," I‰Ûªm sorry, Penny, I don‰Ûªt think so.",3
11982,Penny,10," Oh, come on! A smart guy like you, it‰Ûªll be a challenge. You can make it like an experiment.",3
11983,Sheldon,10," Interesting. I suppose if someone could teach sign language to KoKo the gorilla, I could teach you some rudimentary physics.",3
11984,Penny,10," Great! It‰Ûªs a little insulting, but great. I‰Ûªll be KoKo.",3
11985,Sheldon,10," Not likely. KoKo learned to understand over 2,000 words, not one of which had anything to do with shoes.",3
11986,Scene,10, The university cafeteria.,3
11987,Howard,10," Hey, fellas. This is my girlfriend Bernadette. My girlfriend Bernadette.",3
11988,Bernadette,10, Who are all those people?,3
11989,Howard,10," Have no idea. Hey, Leonard.",3
11990,Bernadette,10, Hi.,3
11991,Leonard,10," Hey, look, it‰Ûªs Howard and his girlfriend Bernadette.",3
11992,Howard,10, Thought I‰Ûªd give the little woman a tour of the old salt mines.,3
11993,Bernadette,10, He doesn‰Ûªt mean salt mines. He means where he works.,3
11994,Leonard,10," Yeah, no, I got it.",3
11995,Bernadette,10," So, how‰Ûªs your experiment going?",3
11996,Leonard,10," Ah, terrific. We‰Ûªre getting the electron accelerator set up. We should be ready to go day after tomorrow.",3
11997,Bernadette,10," Boy, I‰Ûªd love to see that.",3
11998,Leonard,10, You‰Ûªre welcome to come.,3
11999,Bernadette,10," Really? Oh, that‰Ûªd be great. How exciting is that?",3
12000,Howard,10, Like Hanukkah in July.,3
12001,Bernadette,10, Do they have that?,3
12002,Howard,10, No.,3
12003,Bernadette,10," Oh. You got me again. This isn‰Ûªt non-fat yogurt, this is fatty fat fat. Excuse me.",3
12004,Howard,10," Could you grab me another napkin, sweetie?",3
12005,Bernadette,10, Sure.,3
12006,Howard,10," Thanks, honey. (She goes) All right, what is your deal?",3
12007,Leonard,10, Excuse me?,3
12008,Howard,10, Inviting my girlfriend to come see your electron accelerator?,3
12009,Leonard,10, Yeah? So?,3
12010,Howard,10," Wow! You really are a piece of work. It‰Ûªs not enough you get the prom queen, you have to get the head of the decorating committee, too?",3
12011,Leonard,10, What are you talking about?,3
12012,Howard,10, Don‰Ûªt play innocent with me. I practically invented using fancy lab equipment to seduce women.,3
12013,Leonard,10, Has it ever worked?,3
12014,Howard,10," Not so far, but that‰Ûªs not the point!",3
12015,Leonard,10," Howard, relax, I‰Ûªm not interested in your girlfriend.",3
12016,Howard,10," I hope not, because you don‰Ûªt want to mess with me. I‰Ûªm crazy.",3
12017,Leonard,10, I believe you.,3
12018,Scene,10, The apartment. ,3
12019,Sheldon,10," Research journal, entry one. I‰Ûªm about to embark on one of the great challenges of my scientific career, teaching Penny physics. I‰Ûªm calling it Project Gorilla.",3
12020,Penny,10," Hey, Sheldon.",3
12021,Sheldon,10, Come in. Take a seat. Subject has arrived. I‰Ûªve extended a friendly casual greeting.,3
12022,Penny,10, Ready to get started?,3
12023,Sheldon,10," One moment. Subject appears well-rested and enthusiastic. Apparently, ignorance is bliss. All right, let us begin. Where‰Ûªs your notebook?",3
12024,Penny,10," Um, I don‰Ûªt have one.",3
12025,Sheldon,10, How are you going to take notes without a notebook?,3
12026,Penny,10, I have to take notes?,3
12027,Sheldon,10, How else are you gonna study for the tests?,3
12028,Penny,10, There‰Ûªs gonna be a test?,3
12029,Sheldon,10, Tests. Here. It‰Ûªs college-ruled. I hope that‰Ûªs not too intimidating.,3
12030,Penny,10, Thank you.,3
12031,Sheldon,10," You‰Ûªre welcome. Now, Introduction to Physics. What is physics? Physics comes from the ancient Greek word physika. It‰Ûªs at this point that you‰Ûªll want to start taking notes. Physika means the science of natural things. And it is there, in ancient Greece, that our story begins.",3
12032,Penny,10, Ancient Greece?,3
12033,Sheldon,10," Hush. If you have questions, raise your hand. It‰Ûªs a warm summer evening, circa 600 BC, you‰Ûªve finished your shopping at the local market, or agora, and you look up at the night sky. There you notice some of the stars seem to move, so you name them planetes, or wanderer. Yes, Penny?",3
12034,Penny,10," Um, does this have anything to do with Leonard‰Ûªs work?",3
12035,Sheldon,10, This is the beginning of a twenty six hundred year journey we‰Ûªre going to take together from the ancient Greeks through Isaac Newton to Niels Bohr to Erwin Schrodinger to the Dutch researchers that Leonard is currently ripping off.,3
12036,Penny,10, Twenty six hundred years?,3
12037,Sheldon,10," Yeah, give or take. As I was saying, it‰Ûªs a warm summer evening in ancient Greece‰Û_ Yes, Penny?",3
12038,Penny,10, I have to go to the bathroom.,3
12039,Sheldon,10, Can‰Ûªt you hold it?,3
12040,Penny,10, Not for twenty six hundred years.,3
12041,Sheldon,10," Project Gorilla, entry two. I am exhausted.",3
12042,Scene,10, Howard‰Ûªs bedroom.,3
12043,Bernadette,10, Howard?,3
12044,Howard,10, Huh?,3
12045,Bernadette,10, It unhooks in the front.,3
12046,Howard,10," Oh, that explains a lot.",3
12047,Howard‰Ûªs Mother,10," Howard, I‰Ûªm home!",3
12048,Howard,10, Of course.,3
12049,Howard‰Ûªs Mother,10," Senior fitness was cancelled. It turns out you can forget how to ride a bike. I‰Ûªm fine, but, oy, did Sam Harpootian eat gravel.",3
12050,Howard,10," That‰Ûªs great, Ma!",3
12051,Howard‰Ûªs Mother,10, What‰Ûªs great about an 80-year-old Armenian man with half his chin scraped off?,3
12052,Bernadette,10, I guess I should go.,3
12053,Howard,10," No, no, don‰Ûªt move. Hey, Ma, can I have lamb stew for dinner?",3
12054,Howard‰Ûªs Mother,10, Lamb stew? I‰Ûªd have to go to the supermarket.,3
12055,Howard,10, Please? I got a real hankering.,3
12056,Howard‰Ûªs Mother,10," Oh, I can‰Ûªt say no to my little tushy face. I‰Ûªll be back soon.",3
12057,Howard,10," Thanks, Ma.",3
12058,Howard‰Ûªs Mother,10, Do you want the regular peas or the Le Seur?,3
12059,Howard,10, Always Le Seur peas with lamb stew!,3
12060,Howard‰Ûªs Mother,10," You‰Ûªre right! When you‰Ûªre right, you‰Ûªre right! What if they‰Ûªre out of the Le Seur?",3
12061,Howard,10, Then get the regular!,3
12062,Howard‰Ûªs Mother,10, All right! You don‰Ûªt have to yell!,3
12063,Howard,10, Sorry about that.,3
12064,Bernadette (her phone chimes),10, Let me just put that on vibrate.,3
12065,Howard,10, I‰Ûªm already on vibrate.,3
12066,Bernadette,10," You know, that one I got. Howard, did you say something to Leonard about me?",3
12067,Howard,10," Uh, what do you mean?",3
12068,Bernadette,10, He says if I go see his experiment tomorrow it might weird you out.,3
12069,Howard,10, Really? He said that?,3
12070,Bernadette,10," You‰Ûªre not jealous of Leonard, are you?",3
12071,Howard,10, Me? No. I may have mentioned that it‰Ûªs a little inappropriate to be asking another man‰Ûªs girlfriend to his experiment without first discussing it with said man.,3
12072,Bernadette,10, Are you saying I need to ask your permission to hang out with Leonard?,3
12073,Howard,10," I didn‰Ûªt say anything like that. I said Leonard has to ask my permission. (Bernadette storms out) Come on, I don‰Ûªt want to eat lamb stew with my mother. Damn, I was this close on the bra.",3
12074,Scene,10, The apartment.,3
12075,Sheldon,10," Now, remember, Newton realized that Aristotle was wrong and force was not necessary to maintain motion. So let‰Ûªs plug in our 9.8 meters per second squared as A and we get force, Earth gravity, equals mass times 9.8 meters per second per second. So we can see that MA equals MG and what do we know from this?",3
12076,Penny,10," Uh, we know that‰Û_ Newton was a really smart cookie. Oh! Is that where Fig Newtons come from?",3
12077,Sheldon,10," No, Fig Newtons are named after a small town in Massachusetts. Don‰Ûªt write that down!",3
12078,Penny,10, Sorry.,3
12079,Sheldon,10," Now, if MA equals MG what does that imply?",3
12080,Penny,10, I don‰Ûªt know.,3
12081,Sheldon,10, How can you not know? I just told you. Have you suffered a recent blow to the head?,3
12082,Penny,10, Hey! You don‰Ûªt have to be so mean!,3
12083,Sheldon,10, I‰Ûªm sorry. (Smiling) Have you suffered a recent blow to the head?,3
12084,Penny,10," No, you just suck at teaching.",3
12085,Sheldon,10," Really? Of those two explanations, which one seems the most likely?",3
12086,Penny,10," Oh, God, Sheldon, look I‰Ûªm trying to understand, but you‰Ûªre going too fast. Can you just back up a little bit?",3
12087,Sheldon,10, All right. It‰Ûªs a warm summer evening in ancient Greece‰Û_,3
12088,Penny,10, Not that far back!,3
12089,Sheldon,10, Okay! At what point did you begin to feel lost?,3
12090,Penny,10, I don‰Ûªt know. Where were we looking up at the night sky?,3
12091,Sheldon,10, Greece.,3
12092,Penny,10, Damn it!,3
12093,Sheldon,10," There‰Ûªs no need to get frustrated, people learn at different rates. Unlike objects falling in a vacuum, which‰Û_? MA equals MG?",3
12094,Penny,10, Squared?,3
12095,Sheldon,10, No.,3
12096,Penny,10, Aristotle?,3
12097,Sheldon,10, No.,3
12098,Penny,10, Five?,3
12099,Sheldon,10, Oh!,3
12100,Penny,10, Then I don‰Ûªt know.,3
12101,Sheldon,10, Why are you crying?,3
12102,Penny,10, Because I‰Ûªm stupid!,3
12103,Sheldon,10," That‰Ûªs no reason to cry. One cries because one is sad. For example, I cry because others are stupid and it makes me sad.",3
12104,Penny,10," Okay, look, can we just please forget about all this extra stuff and can you just tell me what Leonard does?",3
12105,Sheldon,10, All right. Leonard is attempting to learn why sub-atomic particles move the way they do.,3
12106,Penny,10," Really? That‰Ûªs it? Well, that doesn‰Ûªt sound so complicated.",3
12107,Sheldon,10, It‰Ûªs not. That‰Ûªs why Leonard does it.,3
12108,Penny,10," Okay, I just have one question. What exactly are sub-atomic particles?",3
12109,Sheldon,10, A good question.,3
12110,Penny,10, Thank you.,3
12111,Sheldon,10," And to answer it, we first must ask ourselves, what is physics?",3
12112,Penny,10," Oh, balls.",3
12113,Sheldon,10, It‰Ûªs a warm summer evening in ancient Greece‰Û_,3
12114,Scene,10, Leonard‰Ûªs lab.,3
12115,Howard,10," Okay, I got a bone to pick with you.",3
12116,Leonard,10, What did I do now?,3
12117,Howard,10," I was in bed with Bernadette, and you text-blocked me.",3
12118,Leonard,10, What?,3
12119,Howard,10," We were completely naked, about to devour each other when, you text her that I have a problem with her hanging out with you.",3
12120,Leonard,10, You do have a problem with her hanging out with me.,3
12121,Howard,10," Yeah, but that‰Ûªs not what you tell her.",3
12122,Leonard,10, What was I supposed to tell her?,3
12123,Howard,10," I don‰Ûªt know, something that doesn‰Ûªt make me come off as a petty, jealous douche.",3
12124,Leonard,10, And what would that be?,3
12125,Howard,10," Come on, do I have to think of everything?",3
12126,Bernadette,10," Hey, Leonard. Am I too late to see the experiment? Oh, hi.",3
12127,Howard,10, Hi.,3
12128,Bernadette,10, What are you doing here?,3
12129,Howard,10, Same thing you‰Ûªre doing here. I came to see Leonard‰Ûªs experiment.,3
12130,Bernadette,10," No, you didn‰Ûªt. You said Leonard‰Ûªs experiment was stupid.",3
12131,Leonard,10, You told her my experiment was stupid?,3
12132,Howard,10," I was just repeating what Sheldon said. Let‰Ûªs not get off topic, Bernadette, I need to apologize. I was wrong to tell you who you should be friends with.",3
12133,Leonard,10," Should I, um, leave you two alone?",3
12134,Bernadette,10," No, Leonard, you should hear this.",3
12135,Leonard,10," Okay, good, ‰Ûªcause I wasn‰Ûªt really gonna go.",3
12136,Howard,10," Look, I know I come off as confident and worldly, but the truth is I‰Ûªm not.",3
12137,Leonard,10, We‰Ûªre shocked.,3
12138,Howard,10, Which is why I tend to feel threatened by other guys.,3
12139,Leonard,10," Or loud noises, clowns and nuns.",3
12140,Howard,10, But I now realize how foolish that is.,3
12141,Leonard,10, He had a panic attack once when he got his head stuck in a sweater.,3
12142,Howard,10, It was a full turtleneck. Why aren‰Ûªt you helping me?,3
12143,Leonard,10, I don‰Ûªt know. Maybe because I‰Ûªm crazy?,3
12144,Howard,10," Bernadette, please, I‰Ûªm asking you to give me another chance.",3
12145,Bernadette,10," What do you think, Leonard? Should I give him another chance?",3
12146,Leonard,10, It‰Ûªs up to you. He didn‰Ûªt call your experiment stupid.,3
12147,Bernadette,10," Come here, tushy face.",3
12148,Leonard,10," Tushy face, that is going on Twitter right now.",3
12149,Scene,10, The apartment. ,3
12150,Bernadette,10," Raj, you should‰Ûªve seen Leonard‰Ûªs experiment. The interference pattern was so cool when the electron beam was on.",3
12151,Leonard,10, I‰Ûªm glad you enjoyed it. Most people aren‰Ûªt that interested in what I do.,3
12152,Penny,10," Actually, that‰Ûªs not true, Leonard. In fact, recently I‰Ûªve been thinking that given the parameters of your experiment, the transport of electrons through the aperture the nano-fabricated metal rings is qualitatively no different than the experiment already conducted in the Netherlands. Their observed phase shift in the diffusing electrons inside the metal ring already conclusively demonstrated the electric analogue of the Aharonov-Bohm quantum-interference effect. That‰Ûªs it. That‰Ûªs all I know. Oh, wait! Fig Newtons were named after a town in Massachusetts, not the scientist.",3
12153,Scene,11, The apartment.,3
12154,Penny,11," Oh, I always tear up when the Grinch‰Ûªs heart grows three sizes.",3
12155,Sheldon,11," Tears seem appropriate. Enlargement of the heart muscle, or hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, is a serious disease which could lead to congestive heart failure.",3
12156,Leonard (singing Deck the Halls),11," Fa-la-la, la-la-la, la-la-la.",3
12157,Penny,11," You really didn‰Ûªt like it, Sheldon?",3
12158,Sheldon,11," No, on the contrary. I found the Grinch to be a relatable, engaging character, and I was really with him right up to the point that he succumbed to social convention and returned the presents and saved Christmas. What a buzz kill that was.",3
12159,Leonard,11," When we watch Frosty the Snowman, he roots for the sun.",3
12160,Sheldon,11," Excuse me, but the sun is essential for all life on Earth. Frosty is merely a bit of frozen supernatural ephemera in a stolen hat. A crime, by the way, for which he is never brought to account.",3
12161,Leonard (continuing Deck the Halls),11," Fa-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la.",3
12162,Scene,11, The apartment.,3
12163,Penny,11, I just love decorating the Christmas tree. It makes me feel like a little girl again.,3
12164,Leonard,11, We didn‰Ûªt have a tree when I was growing up.,3
12165,Penny,11, Really? Why not?,3
12166,Leonard,11," Mmm, in my family, holidays weren‰Ûªt so much celebrated as studied for their anthropological and psychological implications on human society.",3
12167,Penny,11," Oh, sounds festive. Did you at least give presents?",3
12168,Leonard,11," Mmm, in a way. We presented papers, and then broke off into focus groups and critiqued each other.",3
12169,Penny,11," Sheldon, what about you? Did you have a Christmas tree?",3
12170,Sheldon,11," Oh, yes. We had a tree, we had a manger, we had an inflatable Santa Claus with plastic reindeer on the front lawn. And to make things even more jolly, there were so many blinking lights on the house they induced neighbourhood-wide seizures.",3
12171,Penny,11, So I take it you don‰Ûªt want to help us trim the tree.,3
12172,Sheldon,11, I do not. But if you insist on decorating a spider-infested fire hazard in my home I would request that you add this.,3
12173,Penny,11, What is it?,3
12174,Sheldon,11," You‰Ûªre kidding, right? It‰Ûªs a bust of Sir Isaac Newton.",3
12175,Penny,11," Oh, sure, sure, yeah. Very Christmassy.",3
12176,Sheldon,11," Wait, excuse me, but it‰Ûªs much more Christmassy than anything you‰Ûªve put on the tree.",3
12177,Leonard,11, Here we go.,3
12178,Sheldon,11," December 25, 1642, Julian calendar, Sir Isaac Newton is born. Jesus, on the other hand, was actually born in the summer. His birthday was moved to coincide with a traditional pagan holiday that celebrated the winter solstice with lit fires and slaughtered goats. Which, frankly, sounds like more fun than 12 hours of church with my mother followed by a fruitcake.",3
12179,Leonard,11," Merry Newton-mas, everyone.",3
12180,Sheldon,11," I sense that‰Ûªs not sincere, although I have no idea why.",3
12181,Penny,11," No, it‰Ûªs fine. Look, Sir Isaac can go right next to this little candy cane.",3
12182,Sheldon,11, No. Isaac goes at the top of the tree.,3
12183,Leonard,11," No, he doesn‰Ûªt.",3
12184,Sheldon,11, I understand. You dispute Newton‰Ûªs claim that he invented calculus and you want to put Gottfried Leibniz on the top.,3
12185,Leonard,11," Yeah, you got me. I‰Ûªm a Leibniz man.",3
12186,Sheldon,11," Well, perhaps when your mother gets here, she‰Ûªll talk some sense into you.",3
12187,Penny,11, What? Your‰Û_ your mother‰Ûªs coming? When?,3
12188,Leonard,11, Tomorrow.,3
12189,Penny,11, When were you going to tell me?,3
12190,Leonard,11," Um, tomorrow?",3
12191,Penny,11, Why were you keeping this a secret?,3
12192,Leonard,11," Well, I just, I thought‰Û_",3
12193,Sheldon,11," If I can interject here, obviously Leonard is concerned that his mother won‰Ûªt approve of you as his mate.",3
12194,Penny,11, Why wouldn‰Ûªt she approve of me? I‰Ûªm adorable.,3
12195,Leonard,11," You are, it‰Ûªs just‰Û_",3
12196,Sheldon,11," If I can interject again. Leonard comes from a remarkably high-achieving family, who have all chosen high-achieving partners. He probably feels that it‰Ûªs doubtful that his mother will be overly impressed with his dating a woman whose most significant achievement is memorizing the Cheesecake Factory menu.",3
12197,Penny,11," Hey, it‰Ûªs a big menu. There‰Ûªs two pages just for desserts.",3
12198,Leonard,11," I know. And those specials, they change every day.",3
12199,Penny,11," Okay, you know what? It‰Ûªs lame when I say it, it‰Ûªs just ridiculous when you pile on.",3
12200,Leonard,11," Okay, sorry.",3
12201,Penny,11, So what did she say when you told her we were going out?,3
12202,Leonard,11, Um‰Û_,3
12203,Penny,11," You didn‰Ûªt tell her we were going out, did you?",3
12204,Leonard,11, Um‰Û_,3
12205,Penny,11, Why not?,3
12206,Leonard,11, Um‰Û_,3
12207,Sheldon,11," Leonard, I‰Ûªm no expert on meditation, but if you‰Ûªre trying to calm yourself down, I believe the word is Om.",3
12208,Scene,11, Leonard‰Ûªs car.,3
12209,Beverley,11, It was so nice of you to come all the way down to the airport to pick me up.,3
12210,Sheldon,11, No trouble at all.,3
12211,Leonard,11," I drove, Mother. I‰Ûªm driving now.",3
12212,Beverley,11," Yes, dear. Mommy‰Ûªs proud. I‰Ûªve been meaning to thank you for your notes on my paper disproving quantum brain dynamic theory.",3
12213,Sheldon,11," My pleasure. For a non-physicist, you have a remarkable grasp of how electric dipoles in the brain‰Ûªs water molecules could not possibly form a Bose condensate.",3
12214,Leonard,11," Wait, wait, wait. When did you send my mom notes on a paper?",3
12215,Sheldon,11, August 16th. Right after her carpal tunnel surgery.,3
12216,Beverley,11," Oh, did I thank you for the flowers?",3
12217,Sheldon,11, You did.,3
12218,Beverley,11, I don‰Ûªt really like flowers.,3
12219,Sheldon,11," Neither do I, but it‰Ûªs the social convention.",3
12220,Beverley,11," It is, isn‰Ûªt it?",3
12221,Leonard,11," Wait, wait, wait. You had surgery?",3
12222,Beverley,11," Yes, and Sheldon sent me flowers.",3
12223,Leonard,11," No, I heard that.",3
12224,Beverley,11," Then what was all that wait, wait, wait about?",3
12225,Leonard,11, I just don‰Ûªt understand why he knows more about your life than I do.,3
12226,Beverley,11," Well, I would assume it‰Ûªs because Sheldon and I stay in touch due to mutual interest and respect, while you avoid me, due to unresolved childhood issues.",3
12227,Sheldon,11, It‰Ûªs what we think caused your narcissistic personality disorder. We discussed it at length during our last video chat. Although how we got onto the subject of you is baffling.,3
12228,Beverley,11," Yes, but we are on the subject, so I‰Ûªm obliged to ask, Leonard, how are you?",3
12229,Leonard,11," Fine, Mom. How are you?",3
12230,Beverley,11," Mmm, menopausal.",3
12231,Leonard,11, Now I‰Ûªm less fine.,3
12232,Beverley,11, Have you heard your brother has gotten engaged?,3
12233,Leonard,11," No. Sheldon, why didn‰Ûªt you tell me?",3
12234,Sheldon,11, My bad. I did send a gift from both of us.,3
12235,Beverley,11, She‰Ûªs a remarkable girl. The youngest appeals court judge in New Jersey and a two-time Olympic bronze medallist.,3
12236,Leonard,11, You must be very happy.,3
12237,Beverley,11," Why? I‰Ûªm not marrying her. So, how about you? Are you seeing anyone interesting?",3
12238,Sheldon,11," Well, I‰Ûªm not sure about interesting, but‰Û_",3
12239,Leonard,11," Not the time, Sheldon.",3
12240,Sheldon,11, Very well. Shall we switch topics to Isaac Newton v. Gottfried Leibniz?,3
12241,Beverley,11," It‰Ûªs all right, Sheldon. I will just pretend that Leonard‰Ûªs not withholding information. Although, I will point out, Leonard, that I am a trained psychiatrist and you are exhibiting the same secretive behavioural tics that accompanied your learning to masturbate.",3
12242,Sheldon,11," Isn‰Ûªt she brilliant, Leonard? How I envy you.",3
12243,Scene,11, The apartment.,3
12244,Beverley,11," So, Howard, have you and Rajesh finally summoned the courage to express your latent homosexual feelings toward one another?",3
12245,Howard,11, What? No.,3
12246,Beverley,11, Why not?,3
12247,Howard,11, Because we don‰Ûªt have latent homosexual feelings toward one another.,3
12248,Beverley,11, I see.,3
12249,Howard,11," No, really. I have a girlfriend now.",3
12250,Beverley,11, And where is she this evening?,3
12251,Howard,11, She had to go out of town. Her grandmother died.,3
12252,Beverley,11, I see. Her grandmother died.,3
12253,Howard,11," Honest to God. Leonard, tell her I have a girlfriend.",3
12254,Leonard,11, I don‰Ûªt know what you‰Ûªre talking about.,3
12255,Howard,11, What do you mean you don‰Ûªt know what I‰Ûªm talking about? Tell her I have a girlfriend!,3
12256,Leonard,11, All right. He ‰ÛÏhas‰Û a ‰ÛÏgirlfriend.‰Û,3
12257,Howard,11," Her name is Bernadette, she‰Ûªs working as a waitress, but she‰Ûªs going to school to be a microbiologist.",3
12258,Beverley,11," Howard, keep in mind that the more passionately you stick to this construct, the more you‰Ûªre hurting your partner.",3
12259,Howard (to Raj who has whispered to him),11, Do you really think your lips in my ear is helping?,3
12260,Penny (arriving),11, Hi. Sorry I‰Ûªm late.,3
12261,Leonard,11," Oh, glad you‰Ûªre here, uh, sit down, I‰Ûªll get you a plate. Mom, you remember Penny.",3
12262,Beverley,11," Oh, yes, the waitress slash actress with the unresolved father issues. Has he finally come to terms with his little slugger growing breasts?",3
12263,Penny,11," Well, he sent me a football and a catcher‰Ûªs mitt for Christmas, so I‰Ûªm going to say no.",3
12264,Howard,11," If it helps, we‰Ûªre all good with your breasts.",3
12265,Beverley,11," Classic overcompensation. Oh, speaking of fathers, Leonard, that reminds me, I‰Ûªm divorcing yours.",3
12266,Leonard,11, What?,3
12267,Beverley,11, Yes. He was cheating on me.,3
12268,Leonard,11, No!,3
12269,Beverley,11," Yes, with some waitress from the university cafeteria. Can you believe it? A waitress? Oh, no offense, dear.",3
12270,Penny,11," No, it sounded like a compliment.",3
12271,Leonard,11, When did this happen?,3
12272,Beverley,11," Mmm, well, let‰Ûªs see. Sheldon, when did I leave Leonard‰Ûªs father?",3
12273,Sheldon,11, September 22nd.,3
12274,Beverley,11," Oh, yes, that‰Ûªs right. The weekend after Leonard‰Ûªs dog died.",3
12275,Leonard,11, Mitzy‰Ûªs dead?,3
12276,Sheldon,11," She was old and blind, Leonard. What choice did we have?",3
12277,Leonard,11, I don‰Ûªt believe this. Why am I the last to know?,3
12278,Beverley,11," Excuse me, Leonard, I am the one who‰Ûªs getting a divorce, Mitzy is the one who is dead. Why are you the one making a fuss?",3
12279,Leonard,11," You‰Ûªre right. I‰Ûªm-I‰Ûªm-I‰Ûªm-I‰Ûªm sorry, I‰Ûªm way out of line!",3
12280,Beverley,11," So, Penny, what‰Ûªs new in your life?",3
12281,Penny,11, Nothing. Not a damn thing.,3
12282,Scene,11, Penny‰Ûªs car.,3
12283,Beverley,11, Thank you for driving me back to my hotel.,3
12284,Penny,11," Oh, it‰Ûªs not a problem.",3
12285,Beverley,11," I was going to ask Leonard to do it, but he seemed a bit emotionally unstable and you don‰Ûªt want someone like that operating heavy machinery.",3
12286,Penny,11," No, you do not.",3
12287,Beverley,11, Your check engine light is on.,3
12288,Penny,11," Yeah, I gotta put a sticker over that. So, uh, you must be devastated about your divorce.",3
12289,Beverley,11," Oh, not at all. But I am a bit distressed to be in a vehicle that‰Ûªs not subjected to regular maintenance.",3
12290,Penny,11," Come on, I mean, you‰Ûªre not upset that your marriage is over?",3
12291,Beverley,11," Well, initially I felt something akin to grief and perhaps anger, but that‰Ûªs the natural reaction of the limbic system to being betrayed by a loathsome son of a bitch.",3
12292,Penny,11," Sure, sure.",3
12293,Beverley,11," Thankfully, my shock was somewhat mitigated by the fact that I haven‰Ûªt had intercourse with him in eight years.",3
12294,Penny,11, Eight years?,3
12295,Beverley,11," Oh, that‰Ûªs nothing. I‰Ûªve been responsible for my own orgasms since 1982.",3
12296,Penny,11, Yikes. What‰Ûªs so funny?,3
12297,Beverley,11, That‰Ûªs exactly what I say during orgasms. Yikes.,3
12298,Penny,11, You know what? I could use a drink. Do you want to stop for a drink?,3
12299,Beverley,11," Oh, I don‰Ûªt drink.",3
12300,Penny,11," I do, I‰Ûªll teach you.",3
12301,Scene,11, Leonard‰Ûªs bedroom.,3
12302,Sheldon,11," (Knock, knock, knock) Leonard? (Knock, knock, knock) Leonard? (Knock, knock, knock) Leonard?",3
12303,Leonard,11, I don‰Ûªt want tea.,3
12304,Sheldon,11, I didn‰Ûªt make tea for you. This is my tea.,3
12305,Leonard,11, Then why are you telling me?,3
12306,Sheldon,11, It‰Ûªs a conversation starter.,3
12307,Leonard,11, That‰Ûªs a lousy conversation starter.,3
12308,Sheldon,11," Oh, is it? We‰Ûªre conversing. Checkmate.",3
12309,Leonard,11," What do you want, Sheldon?",3
12310,Sheldon,11, What I want is to be departing the Starship Enterprise in a one-man shuttle craft headed to the planetoid I rule known as Sheldon Alpha Five.,3
12311,Leonard,11, I want that too. Why are you here?,3
12312,Sheldon,11," To comfort you, of course. No, that‰Ûªs not going to work at all, I‰Ûªll comfort you from over here. Leonard, what you‰Ûªre experiencing is a classic Jungian crisis in which the aging individual mourns the loss of the never-to-be realized ideal family unit.",3
12313,Leonard,11," Thank you, that‰Ûªs very comforting.",3
12314,Sheldon,11, That‰Ûªs not the comforting part.,3
12315,Leonard,11, It‰Ûªs not?,3
12316,Sheldon,11," No, no. The comforting part is that the Germans have a term for what you‰Ûªre feeling. Weltschmerz. It means the depression that arises from comparing the world as it is to a hypothetical, idealized world.",3
12317,Leonard,11," You‰Ûªre right, I do feel better.",3
12318,Sheldon,11," Well, the Germans have always been a comforting people. Just remember, Leonard, where your biological family has failed you, you always have me, your surrogate family.",3
12319,Leonard,11, You‰Ûªre my surrogate family?,3
12320,Sheldon,11," If it‰Ûªs any consolation, I‰Ûªm not happy about it either. Good night.",3
12321,Scene,11, A bar.,3
12322,Penny,11," Okay, now this time try drinking it all at once.",3
12323,Beverley,11, Yikes.,3
12324,Penny,11, I‰Ûªve been responsible for my own buzz since 2003. Another round for me and my homegirl.,3
12325,Beverley,11, I feel a spreading warmth through my extremities.,3
12326,Penny,11," As long as you don‰Ûªt feel it running down your pants, you‰Ûªre fine.",3
12327,Beverley,11," Oh, that is fascinating. I‰Ûªm noticing an immediate lowering of my inhibitions. For example, I‰Ûªm seriously considering asking that busboy to ravish me in the alleyway while I eat cheesecake. What do you think?",3
12328,Penny,11," Well, we are known for our cheesecake. Hit us again.",3
12329,Beverley,11," Yes. If a little is good, more must be better.",3
12330,Penny,11," Hey, Bev, guess what?",3
12331,Beverley,11, What?,3
12332,Penny,11, I‰Ûªm sleeping with your son.,3
12333,Beverley,11, Really? Which one?,3
12334,Penny,11, The one from whom I live across the hall from.,3
12335,Beverley,11," Well, that‰Ûªs convenient. How did his penis turn out?",3
12336,Penny,11," Oh, Beverly, I can‰Ûªt talk to my boyfriend‰Ûªs mother about his penis.",3
12337,Beverley,11," Oh, fair enough. What can you tell me, if anything, about that busboy‰Ûªs penis?",3
12338,Penny,11," Actually, I‰Ûªve only had the cheesecake. One more time. You know, Leonard did not want to tell you we were dating.",3
12339,Beverley,11," Really? Well, that means he‰Ûªs either embarrassed about the relationship or he doesn‰Ûªt care enough about his mother to tell her he‰Ûªs in one. Either way, one of us should be insulted.",3
12340,Penny,11," Well, let‰Ûªs go find out who.",3
12341,Beverley,11," You go get a taxi. I‰Ûªm gonna slip my business card into that busboy‰Ûªs back pocket, cupping his firm, right buttock as I do so.",3
12342,Scene,11, The apartment.,3
12343,Penny,11, Leonard?,3
12344,Beverley,11, Sonny boy!,3
12345,Penny,11, Get out here! Your mommy wants to talk to you!,3
12346,Leonard,11, What the hell is going on?,3
12347,Penny,11, You‰Ûªre in trouble.,3
12348,Beverley,11, Why didn‰Ûªt you tell me you were tapping my homegirl? Did I say that right?,3
12349,Penny,11," Yeah, not bad, not bad.",3
12350,Leonard,11, Are you guys drunk?,3
12351,Beverley,11," Well, I hope so. Otherwise, why would we have stopped at Del Taco? Now, how could you not tell me you were in a relationship with this lovely, charming young woman?",3
12352,Penny,11," Oh, thank you.",3
12353,Beverley,11," You‰Ûªre welcome. Is it because she‰Ûªs uneducated, trapped in a menial service position?",3
12354,Penny,11, What the hell happened to lovely and charming?,3
12355,Leonard,11, How come you didn‰Ûªt tell me that you and Father were getting a divorce? How come you didn‰Ûªt tell me you had surgery? How come you didn‰Ûªt tell me my dog died?,3
12356,Beverley,11," Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. What I hear you saying is that you want a more intimate mother-son relationship.",3
12357,Leonard,11, I do.,3
12358,Beverley (gives him an uncomfortable hug),11," There. It‰Ûªs late. Now, go to bed. I‰Ûªm getting a warm feeling spreading through my heart.",3
12359,Penny,11, That‰Ûªs the Del Taco.,3
12360,Sheldon,11, Why is Leonard softly banging his head against his bedroom door?,3
12361,Beverley,11," Speaking of warm feelings, come here. (She grabs Sheldon and kisses him) No, I‰Ûªd rather have the busboy.",3
12362,Scene,11, Leonard‰Ûªs car.,3
12363,Beverley,11, Thank you for taking me to the airport.,3
12364,Sheldon,11, You‰Ûªre very welcome.,3
12365,Leonard,11," Once again, I‰Ûªm driving. I‰Ûªm right here.",3
12366,Beverley,11," Please, I am very hungover and in no mood to satisfy your need for approval. Sheldon, I do hope you‰Ûªll forgive me for my inappropriate behaviour last night.",3
12367,Sheldon,11, I don‰Ûªt blame you. You were intoxicated.,3
12368,Beverley,11, Thank you.,3
12369,Sheldon,11, I blame Penny.,3
12370,Penny,11," I blame Penny, too. Bad Penny.",3
12371,Leonard,11," Wait a minute, what are you talking about? What inappropriate behaviour?",3
12372,Beverley,11, I think it‰Ûªs best that you not know.,3
12373,Sheldon,11, Agreed.,3
12374,Penny,11, Agreed.,3
12375,Leonard,11," What the hell, agreed.",3
12376,Beverley,11, And I want you to take very good care of this young woman.,3
12377,Penny,11," Oh, thank you, Beverly.",3
12378,Beverley,11," You‰Ûªre welcome. She doesn‰Ûªt have much in the way of career prospects, don‰Ûªt make her responsible for her own orgasms as well.",3
12379,Leonard,11," Mother, remember when I was complaining that you don‰Ûªt communicate with me enough?",3
12380,Beverley,11," Yes, dear.",3
12381,Leonard,11, I‰Ûªm over it.,3
12382,Penny (finishing Deck the Halls),11," Fa-la-la-la-la, la-la la-la.",3
12383,Scene,12, The apartment.,3
12384,Leonard,12, Look at us. Getting ready for a double date with actual women who publicly acknowledge they‰Ûªre our girlfriends.,3
12385,Howard,12," Yes, actual women are the best.",3
12386,Sheldon,12, I don‰Ûªt understand. What other kind of women are there?,3
12387,Leonard,12," Howard, artificial women are your department. You want to take this?",3
12388,Howard,12," No, it would just freak him out. Listen, before we leave, I should warn you, I‰Ûªm a passionate man and I tend towards public displays of affection.",3
12389,Leonard,12," What are you trying to tell me, Howard?",3
12390,Howard,12," There might be some making out in the car or the restaurant, and I don‰Ûªt want Bernadette to feel uncomfortable, so it would help if you and Penny made out, too.",3
12391,Leonard,12, Don‰Ûªt worry. We‰Ûªre planning to have sex right on the salad bar.,3
12392,Raj (arriving),12," Namaste, white people. Good news! I rented us the four-hour edition of Watchmen.",3
12393,Leonard,12, Got it.,3
12394,Howard,12, Seen it.,3
12395,Sheldon,12, Detailed analysis posted online.,3
12396,Raj,12," Well, then what are we going to do tonight?",3
12397,Leonard,12," Uh, sorry, Raj. Howard and I are going out to dinner with Penny and Bernadette.",3
12398,Howard,12," Yeah, no more carefree bachelor nights for me and Leonard. These broncos have been saddled.",3
12399,Leonard,12, How did we get actual women?,3
12400,Raj,12," Great. They get girlfriends, and they just abandon us?",3
12401,Sheldon,12," It is great, isn‰Ûªt it? We have a wonderful evening ahead of us.",3
12402,Raj,12, We do?,3
12403,Sheldon,12," Oh, yes. I just discovered I don‰Ûªt have enough room on my hard drive for a Linux partition, so you and I are going to perform a full backup, reinitialize and then reinstall all my operating systems.",3
12404,Raj,12, I don‰Ûªt want to do that.,3
12405,Sheldon,12," All right. Well, I‰Ûªm going to perform full backup, reinitialize and then reinstall all my operating systems.",3
12406,Raj,12, What about me?,3
12407,Sheldon,12," Well, I understand there are several types of artificial women. Maybe you should look into that.",3
12408,Scene,12, A little later.,3
12409,Raj,12," Dude, there‰Ûªs so many cool things we could be doing tonight. Look. At the Glendale Galleria, put on your best zoot suit, it‰Ûªs a salute to Swing music in the center court near Macy‰Ûªs. 5pm to 9pm, huh, huh? A salute to zoot. Sounds like a hoot.",3
12410,Sheldon,12," I‰Ûªm sorry, Raj, I have no desire to salute any article of clothing tonight. Much less one that‰Ûªs linked to race riots in the 1940s.",3
12411,Raj,12, Race riots?,3
12412,Sheldon,12, The zoot suit riots.,3
12413,Raj,12," Oh. I always thought that was some sort of after-Christmas sale. Well, then why don‰Ûªt we just go to the galleria and walk around?",3
12414,Sheldon,12, I don‰Ûªt need anything at the Galleria. Do you need anything at the Galleria?,3
12415,Raj,12, No. We would just walk around and see what‰Ûªs what.,3
12416,Sheldon,12, That‰Ûªs a semantically null sentence.,3
12417,Raj,12," Okay, well, how about this? From the university Web site, 7pm to 10pm, Norton Hall Multipurpose Room, mixer for grad students and faculty of the science and humanities departments. Whether you split atoms or infinitives, this is the place to be.",3
12418,Sheldon,12," Well, that‰Ûªs certainly amusing, but I have no interest.",3
12419,Raj,12," Come on, Sheldon, the world is filled with people doing things outside. Let‰Ûªs go outside. Outside is good.",3
12420,Sheldon,12," If outside is so good, why has mankind spent thousands of years trying to perfect inside?",3
12421,Raj,12," I don‰Ûªt know, it‰Ûªs a marketing scheme. Please, Sheldon, I‰Ûªm a young, virile visitor from a foreign land and I need to strut my stuff.",3
12422,Sheldon,12," Let me offer you a compromise. Sometimes when I feel stifled and want a change of scenery, I use my imagination.",3
12423,Raj,12," Oh, boy.",3
12424,Sheldon,12," One of my favourite places to visit is the two-dimensional world described in Edwin Abbott‰Ûªs mathematical fantasy, Flatland.",3
12425,Raj,12, I don‰Ûªt want to go to Flatland.,3
12426,Sheldon,12, You‰Ûªre only saying that because you haven‰Ûªt been there. I am now a hexagon in two-dimensional space and can only perceive the edges of other objects.,3
12427,Raj,12, Oy.,3
12428,Sheldon,12," Is that you, Raj? I don‰Ûªt recognize your edge.",3
12429,Raj,12," Sheldon, I‰Ûªm begging you. I want to go to this mixer, and I don‰Ûªt want to go alone.",3
12430,Sheldon,12," Well, you‰Ûªre in luck, there‰Ûªs a mixer here in Flatland. Oh, look, there‰Ûªs a sexually attractive line segment, you should chat her up.",3
12431,Raj,12, What?,3
12432,Sheldon,12," Tell her you‰Ûªre a circle, Flatland gals are all hot for circles.",3
12433,Scene,12, Leonard‰Ûªs car.,3
12434,Leonard,12," I hope you‰Ûªre hungry, Bernadette, we‰Ûªre going to a terrific restaurant.",3
12435,Bernadette,12," Oh, yeah, I‰Ûªm starved. When you spend all day in a bio-lab, watching flesh-eating bacteria skeletonize small rodents it really works up an appetite.",3
12436,Howard,12," Flesh-eating bacteria. And yet, I still want to kiss this woman, what does that tell you?",3
12437,Penny,12, That you‰Ûªd be willing to die a horrible death on the off-chance you‰Ûªd get to second base?,3
12438,Bernadette,12," Oh, we‰Ûªre way past second base. Right, Howard?",3
12439,Howard,12," Well, we kind of disagree about what the bases are.",3
12440,Bernadette,12," How‰Ûªs your work going, Penny? Any acting jobs?",3
12441,Penny,12," Well, the last big thing I did was this production of Diary of Anne Frank above a bowling alley. But I think things might be turning around pretty soon.",3
12442,Leonard,12, Great. How come?,3
12443,Penny,12," Well, promise you won‰Ûªt make fun of me.",3
12444,Leonard,12," Of course, I would never make fun of you.",3
12445,Penny,12," Okay. Well, I went to this psychic who told me that if I cut my hair, I‰Ûªm going to get a national commercial.",3
12446,Leonard (laughing),12, Seriously? You‰Ûªre getting career advice from a psychic?,3
12447,Howard,12, Good job not making fun of her.,3
12448,Penny,12," She‰Ûªs not one of those phonies, okay. She wrote a book and has her own Web site.",3
12449,Leonard,12," Oh, gee, why didn‰Ûªt you say so? They don‰Ûªt let just anyone have a Web site.",3
12450,Penny,12, Why are you being such a jerk?,3
12451,Leonard,12, You‰Ûªre surprised? Your psychic didn‰Ûªt tell you I was going to be a jerk?,3
12452,Penny,12," Ha-ha, bite me.",3
12453,Leonard,12," Come on, Penny.",3
12454,Howard,12, Why don‰Ûªt you kids go ahead and chat? We‰Ûªre gonna make out back here.,3
12455,Bernadette,12, I‰Ûªm sliding into third.,3
12456,Scene,12, The university mixer.,3
12457,Raj,12, Thanks for coming with me.,3
12458,Sheldon,12, Thanks for giving me your limited edition Green Lantern lantern.,3
12459,Raj,12, Did you really have to bring it in with you?,3
12460,Sheldon,12, What if evil strikes and my power ring runs low?,3
12461,Raj,12," Come on, let‰Ûªs get a drink.",3
12462,Sheldon,12, I don‰Ûªt drink.,3
12463,Raj,12," Yeah, well I do. And when my wingman is carrying a Green Lantern lantern, I drink a lot. I‰Ûªll have a screwdriver, please. Don‰Ûªt be chintzy with the screw.",3
12464,Sheldon,12, I would like a root beer float.,3
12465,Raj,12," Sheldon, they don‰Ûªt have ice cream.",3
12466,Sheldon,12," They don‰Ûªt? Well, apparently, these people and I differ greatly on the definition of party.",3
12467,Raj,12, He‰Ûªll have a Shirley Temple.,3
12468,Sheldon,12, And don‰Ûªt be chintzy with the Shirley.,3
12469,Raj,12," Okay, let‰Ûªs check out the females.",3
12470,Sheldon,12, All right. There‰Ûªs a female.,3
12471,Raj,12," That‰Ûªs Professor Wilkinson‰Ûªs wife, she‰Ûªs like 80 years old.",3
12472,Sheldon,12, But she‰Ûªs female. Isn‰Ûªt that the game?,3
12473,Raj,12, No. I‰Ûªm looking for a hookup.,3
12474,Sheldon,12," Oh, yes. So, the point of this exercise is for you to find someone to copulate with?",3
12475,Raj,12," Not so loud, but ideally, yes. Thanks.",3
12476,Sheldon,12, Thank you. And what is my function as wingman?,3
12477,Raj,12, You help me run my game.,3
12478,Sheldon,12, Okay. What is your game?,3
12479,Sheldon,12," When I lie through my teeth to a woman, you nod and agree.",3
12480,Girl,12," Hey, that‰Ûªs pretty cool. What is it?",3
12481,Sheldon,12, It‰Ûªs a limited edition Green Lantern lantern. My friend is looking for someone to copulate with.,3
12482,Girl,12, You‰Ûªre very funny. I‰Ûªm Abby.,3
12483,Sheldon,12, I‰Ûªm Sheldon. How do you do?,3
12484,Raj,12, How do you do? Rajesh Ramayan Koothrappali. Call me Raj.,3
12485,Abby,12," Hi, Raj. Where are you from?",3
12486,Raj,12, The mysterious subcontinent of India.,3
12487,Abby,12," Ooh, India.",3
12488,Raj,12, You know India?,3
12489,Abby,12, I saw Slumdog Millionaire.,3
12490,Raj,12," Well, I‰Ûªm a slumdog astrophysicist.",3
12491,Sheldon,12, I thought your father was a gynaecologist. I‰Ûªm sorry. (Smiles and nods),3
12492,Abby,12," Martha, come here. Meet Raj and Sheldon. This is my friend, Martha.",3
12493,Martha,12, Hi.,3
12494,Raj,12, Hello.,3
12495,Sheldon,12, Hello.,3
12496,Martha,12, Is that the limited edition Green Lantern lantern?,3
12497,Sheldon,12," In brightest day, in darkest night, no evil shall escape my sight.",3
12498,Martha,12," Oh, that is so awesome.",3
12499,Sheldon,12, Thank you. Have you chosen one to copulate with?,3
12500,Scene,12, A restaurant.,3
12501,Bernadette,12," So, what should we talk about?",3
12502,Howard,12," Well, we could always learn more about why people who believe in psychics are idiots. Leonard?",3
12503,Penny,12," Oh, we don‰Ûªt need to talk about that anymore. Leonard covered it pretty well in the car.",3
12504,Leonard,12," I‰Ûªm sorry, but facts are facts.",3
12505,Penny,12," Right, and if you can‰Ûªt understand it, it‰Ûªs not a fact.",3
12506,Leonard,12," No, if it‰Ûªs not a fact, it‰Ûªs not a fact.",3
12507,Penny,12," Oh, got it. Thank you for educating me.",3
12508,Leonard,12, You‰Ûªre welcome. How‰Ûªs your fish?,3
12509,Penny,12, Amazing. Would you like to try some?,3
12510,Leonard,12," Yeah, sure.",3
12511,Penny,12," Well, the fact is, you can‰Ûªt.",3
12512,Leonard,12," Come on, Howard, Bernadette, you‰Ûªre both scientists. Help me out here.",3
12513,Howard,12, What do you think? Want to jump right into the middle of another couple‰Ûªs argument?,3
12514,Bernadette,12," No, thank you.",3
12515,Howard,12, Sorry.,3
12516,Leonard,12, Maybe we should just stop talking about this.,3
12517,Penny,12, Maybe some of us should stop talking altogether.,3
12518,Waiter,12, How is everything tonight?,3
12519,Bernadette,12, Really uncomfortable.,3
12520,Scene,12, The stairwell.,3
12521,Leonard,12," You know, the best thing about being in a committed, monogamous, mutually supportive relationship is that even if you have different ideas, you can have a spirited debate, yet still care for, even make love with‰Û_ (she shuts the door in his face) Want your fish? (Opens door, takes fish, closes it again) I knew you were going to do that. Doesn‰Ûªt make me psychic! Attaboy, Leonard, make it worse. (Opens his own apartment door to find Sheldon, Raj and the two girls playing Rock Band and performing American Woman)",3
12522,Leonard,12, What‰Ûªs going on?,3
12523,Sheldon,12, We scored. I‰Ûªm the wingman.,3
12524,Scene,12, Leonard‰Ûªs lab.,3
12525,Howard,12, Hey.,3
12526,Leonard (handing him protective glasses),12, Laser.,3
12527,Howard,12," Had a great night last night. I don‰Ûªt like to kiss and tell, but somebody made it to eighth base.",3
12528,Leonard,12, What the hell is eighth base?,3
12529,Howard,12," Seventh base with shirt off. Well, my shirt. How‰Ûªd things go with Penny?",3
12530,Leonard,12," Oh, couldn‰Ûªt be better.",3
12531,Howard,12, Are we taking our relationship frustrations out on innocent Cylons?,3
12532,Leonard,12, It‰Ûªs not just Cylons. Superman‰Ûªs next.,3
12533,Howard,12," All right, I was going to try to squeeze in a little more mocking before lunch, but I can come back later when you don‰Ûªt have a high-powered weapon.",3
12534,Leonard,12, How can I go out with a woman who believes in psychics?,3
12535,Howard,12," Hey, I once dated a girl who believed she was abducted by aliens.",3
12536,Leonard,12, And that didn‰Ûªt bother you?,3
12537,Howard,12, Au contraire. It meant she was gullible and open to a little probing.,3
12538,Leonard,12," What am I supposed to do, pretend I believe something I don‰Ûªt whenever I‰Ûªm with Penny?",3
12539,Howard,12," Hey, I‰Ûªm sure Penny fakes all kinds of things when she‰Ûªs with you.",3
12540,Leonard,12," Do me a favour, lean over, put your head right here.",3
12541,Howard,12, Let me show you another way to look at this. Here we have the universe of all women. These are the ones you want to sleep with. These are the women who believe exactly what you believe. These are the women who would be willing to sleep with you. And right there in the,3
12542,Leonard,12," What‰Ûªs your point? In order to keep having a sexual relationship with Penny, I have to give up everything I believe in, my intellectual integrity, the very nature of who I am? I can‰Ûªt do that, Howard.",3
12543,Howard,12," I respect that. (Takes Leonard‰Ûªs hand, draws a dot on it.) ",3
12544,Leonard,12, What is that?,3
12545,Howard,12, Your new girlfriend. Have fun tonight.,3
12546,Scene,12, The apartment. Sheldon is learning Finnish. ,3
12547,Sheldon,12, The dog‰Û_ koira. The roof‰Û_ katto. Grapes‰Û_ ryp leet. (There is a knock on the door) One minute. SisåÊ n.,3
12548,Raj,12, What was that?,3
12549,Sheldon,12," It means come in. It‰Ûªs taking forever to load the new operating system on my computer. I disinfected the kitchen and the bathroom, and now I thought I‰Ûªd learn Finnish.",3
12550,Raj,12," ˆ_Ïˆ´Ü ˆ__ˆ´Û ˆ__ˆ´ˆ_¨ˆ´ˆ__ˆ__ˆ_¡ˆ´à ˆ_¬ˆ__ˆ_µ ˆ_¨ˆ_âˆ_Ñˆ__ˆ_ö. That‰Ûªs Hindi for whatever floats your boat. Uh, listen, I got a text from that girl Abby, and she and her friend Martha want to hang out with us again. What do you say?",3
12551,Sheldon,12, I don‰Ûªt say anything. I merely offer you a facial expression that suggests you‰Ûªve gone insane.,3
12552,Raj,12, I don‰Ûªt get it. You had a great time.,3
12553,Sheldon,12," Yes, exactly, I had a great time. That‰Ûªs done, I‰Ûªve moved on to other things. For example, after I learn Finnish, I‰Ûªm not going to learn Finnish again.",3
12554,Raj,12," Please, Sheldon, I‰Ûªm a lost Indian boy far from home, and I want a girlfriend and I want her to be Abby, and she‰Ûªll only come over if she can bring Martha.",3
12555,Sheldon,12," Raj, I highly doubt there is any argument you can make, threat you might levy, rhetorical strategy, plea, invocation, supplication, or‰Û_ vetoomus that you can employ that would convince me to reconsider.",3
12556,Raj,12, My Incredible Hulk hands signed by Stan Lee.,3
12557,Sheldon,12," Oh, my. I‰Ûªve admired these for years.",3
12558,Raj,12, So does that mean we can go with the girls again?,3
12559,Sheldon,12, Hulk agree to second date with puny humans!,3
12560,Raj,12, You can‰Ûªt wear the hands on the date.,3
12561,Sheldon,12, Hulk sad.,3
12562,Scene,12, The laundry room.,3
12563,Leonard,12," Hey. Cleaning out the old dryer lint, huh? Not only is it courteous, it‰Ûªs safety smart. Every year, 15,000 fires are caused by accidental dryer lint ignition. Now you‰Ûªre supposed to say, wow, what an interesting fact. Come here, you crazy, nerdy guy. I could never be mad at you.",3
12564,Penny,12," Wow, that‰Ûªs all you got after you were the most obnoxious person on a double date that included Howard Wolowitz?",3
12565,Leonard,12," No, I‰Ûªm sorry. I really am. It‰Ûªs not right to mock what a person believes in.",3
12566,Penny,12, Thank you. Would you be willing to go to my psychic and see what it‰Ûªs all about?,3
12567,Leonard,12, Would you be willing to read a book that concisely explains how all psychics are frauds?,3
12568,Penny,12, I would not.,3
12569,Leonard,12," Okay, let‰Ûªs go see your psychic.",3
12570,Penny,12, Really?,3
12571,Leonard,12," Well, yeah, one of us has to keep an open mind.",3
12572,Penny,12, You saying I don‰Ûªt have an open mind?,3
12573,Leonard,12," No, not at all. Let me help you with this stuff.",3
12574,Penny,12," You know, I believe in ghosts, too.",3
12575,Leonard,12, Great.,3
12576,Penny,12, And astrology.,3
12577,Leonard,12," I know, and pyramid power and healing crystals.",3
12578,Penny,12," Oh, no, no, no, crystals don‰Ûªt work.",3
12579,Leonard,12," Really, that‰Ûªs the line? Psychics are real, but crystals are voodoo?",3
12580,Penny,12," Oh, voodoo‰Ûªs real. You don‰Ûªt want to mess with voodoo.",3
12581,Scene,12, The apartment.,3
12582,Martha,12, Flatland is more than just a mathematical essay. It is also a treatise on Victorian social mores.,3
12583,Sheldon,12," You know, I had never considered that. Wow, that‰Ûªs going to completely change my visits there. Well, it‰Ûªs late.",3
12584,Martha,12, Uh-huh.,3
12585,Sheldon,12, Time for bed.,3
12586,Martha,12, Okay.,3
12587,Sheldon,12," Good night, puny human! (He gets up and leaves).",3
12588,Scene,12, Outside Sheldon‰Ûªs bedroom.,3
12589,Martha,12, Sheldon?,3
12590,Sheldon,12, Yes?,3
12591,Martha,12," Listen, they‰Ûªre kind of getting busy in the living room, and I was wondering if I could hang out in here for a while.",3
12592,Sheldon,12," Well, I suppose. Come in. I‰Ûªll sleep in Leonard‰Ûªs room. Good night.",3
12593,Scene,13, A Chinese restaurant.,3
12594,Howard,13," Boy, seems like forever since the four of us have been out to eat, you know? Just the guys.",3
12595,Raj,13," Oh, God! Yes, we get it. You have a girlfriend now.",3
12596,Howard,13," A little jealous, are we?",3
12597,Raj,13," No, I‰Ûªm not jealous. All right, I‰Ûªd kill a hobo if it‰Ûªll get me laid. Now, can we order?",3
12598,Sheldon,13," Oh, dear Lord, they re-did the menu.",3
12599,Leonard,13, So what? It‰Ûªs the same food.,3
12600,Sheldon,13," Oh, is it? Look at this. General Tso‰Ûªs Chicken is no longer listed under specialties. It‰Ûªs now under chicken.",3
12601,Raj,13, So?,3
12602,Sheldon,13," Yes, General Tso.",3
12603,Raj,13," Not Tso the chicken, so the question. So?",3
12604,Sheldon,13," So, why is it no longer a specialty? Did the chef lose confidence in the dish or himself? And look over here, shrimp in mobster sauce. What is mobster sauce?",3
12605,Leonard,13, It‰Ûªs obviously a typo.,3
12606,Sheldon,13," Perhaps. Perhaps this restaurant‰Ûªs now a front for organized crime. For all we know, the mobster sauce contains actual chunks of deceased mobsters.",3
12607,Raj,13," No, no, no, no, I think it just means it‰Ûªs the kind of sauce that mobsters like.",3
12608,Howard,13, It doesn‰Ûªt mean any of that! It‰Ûªs a typo.,3
12609,Leonard,13, You know what? Let‰Ûªs just get a pizza.,3
12610,Sheldon,13, Good idea. We‰Ûªll go to Corleone‰Ûªs.,3
12611,Howard,13," Sure, no mobsters there.",3
12612,Scene,13, The stairwell.,3
12613,Sheldon,13," You know, the more I think about it, the mobster sauce couldn‰Ûªt possibly contain chunks of mobster.",3
12614,Leonard,13, And why is that?,3
12615,Sheldon,13, It was listed under seafood.,3
12616,Leonard,13, What if they were mobsters who slept with the fishes?,3
12617,Sheldon,13," Leonard, are we having a serious conversation or not?",3
12618,Leonard (noticing their door has been broken open),13, What the‰Û_?,3
12619,Sheldon,13, The TV is gone.,3
12620,Leonard,13, So are our laptops.,3
12621,Sheldon,13," Oh God, oh God, oh, God! It‰Ûªs all right. They didn‰Ûªt take my comic books.",3
12622,Scene,13, The apartment. ,3
12623,Sheldon,13," They took our TV, two laptops, four external hard-drives, our PS2, our PS3, our X-Box, our X-Box 360, our classic Nintendo, our Super Nintendo, our Nintendo 64 and our Wii.",3
12624,Leonard,13, We like games.,3
12625,Policeman,13, Assorted video games.,3
12626,Sheldon,13, When does the CSI team get here?,3
12627,Policeman,13, What?,3
12628,Sheldon,13," In anticipation of their arrival, I‰Ûªve bagged some evidence. One of the thieves had the audacity to quench his thirst while ransacking our home. You should be able to pull some good prints off this. And now, here are my prints so you can rule me out as a suspect.",3
12629,Leonard,13, What about me?,3
12630,Sheldon,13," I‰Ûªm sorry, Leonard. It‰Ûªs too early to discount the possibility of this being an inside job.",3
12631,Leonard,13, Would I be completely out of line to ask you to shoot him?,3
12632,Policeman,13, I‰Ûªd be happy to put him under a 72-hour psychiatric hold.,3
12633,Sheldon,13, I‰Ûªm not crazy. My mother had me tested.,3
12634,Policeman,13," We‰Ûªre done here. Call this number, and we‰Ûªll fax you a copy of the report so you can submit it to your insurance company.",3
12635,Sheldon,13," I‰Ûªm sorry, that‰Ûªs the end of your inquiry?",3
12636,Policeman,13, Do you have any more information that might be relevant?,3
12637,Sheldon,13," Oh, my goodness. Where do I begin? For instance, my laptop contained four out of the five gedanken experiments necessary for a cogent restatement of the quantum measurement problem.",3
12638,Leonard,13, How is that going to help them?,3
12639,Sheldon,13," Well, they could monitor scientific publications and see if anyone posts such a cogent restatement in the next couple of months. If so, the authors are most likely in possession of my stolen laptop.",3
12640,Policeman,13," Good night, fellas. Come on, Bochco.",3
12641,Leonard,13, What are we supposed to do now?,3
12642,Sheldon,13, The only thing we can do. Watch TV on our phones until the criminals return and bludgeon us to death in our sleep.,3
12643,Leonard,13, Does that mean you‰Ûªve ruled me out as a suspect?,3
12644,Sheldon,13," Oh, how I wish I could.",3
12645,Scene,13, Sheldon‰Ûªs bedroom. Sheldon is restless. He gets up and checks the door is locked. He then moves his chest of drawers in front of the door. Goes back to bed.,3
12646,Sheldon,13, I do not have to urinate. I am the master of my own bladder. Drat.,3
12647,Scene,13, Penny‰Ûªs apartment.,3
12648,Penny,13," I can‰Ûªt believe it. If I hadn‰Ûªt been working the dinner shift, I would‰Ûªve run",3
12649,Leonard,13," Hey, there‰Ûªs no reason for you to be scared.",3
12650,Penny,13, I‰Ûªm not scared. I would‰Ûªve gone all Nebraska on their asses.,3
12651,Sheldon,13," (Knock, knock, knock) Leonard and Penny. (Knock, knock, knock) Leonard and Penny. (Knock, knock, knock) Leonard and Penny.",3
12652,Leonard,13, Hand me the bat.,3
12653,Sheldon,13," We just had a major crime in the building, and you open the door without asking who it is?",3
12654,Penny,13," It won‰Ûªt happen again, what‰Ûªs up?",3
12655,Sheldon,13, Nothing. Just wanted to see if you were both okay.,3
12656,Leonard,13," We‰Ûªre fine, Sheldon.",3
12657,Sheldon,13," All right, then. Good night.",3
12658,Penny,13," Good night. That was weird, even for him.",3
12659,Leonard,13, Mm-hmm.,3
12660,Sheldon,13," (Knock, knock, knock) Leonard and Penny. (Knock, knock, knock) Leonard and Penny. (Knock, knock, knock) Leonard and Penny.",3
12661,Penny,13, Who is it?,3
12662,Sheldon,13, Sheldon. Sheldon Cooper.,3
12663,Penny,13, Yes?,3
12664,Sheldon,13, May I come in?,3
12665,Penny,13, Yeah.,3
12666,Sheldon,13, I see you‰Ûªre drinking wine.,3
12667,Leonard,13," Yes, we are. And we‰Ûªre about to go to bed.",3
12668,Sheldon,13, Uh-huh.,3
12669,Penny,13," Sheldon, do you want to sleep here tonight?",3
12670,Sheldon,13," Oh, as small as Leonard is, I don‰Ûªt think the two of you‰Ûªd be comfortable on the couch.",3
12671,Leonard,13, What do you want?,3
12672,Sheldon,13," It‰Ûªs not what I want, it‰Ûªs what evolution wants. Human beings are primates. Primates have evolved to live in groups, both for protection and support.",3
12673,Leonard,13, But you don‰Ûªt like other people.,3
12674,Sheldon,13, I do tonight. It‰Ûªs scary over there.,3
12675,Leonard,13," It‰Ûªs getting scary here, too.",3
12676,Scene,13, The apartment. Sheldon is drawing picture clues on his whiteboard. ,3
12677,Penny,13," Um‰Û_ three little kittens? Three little pigs? God, I don‰Ûªt know. Star Wars?",3
12678,Leonard,13, Did we win? Can we go to bed?,3
12679,Sheldon,13," Good Lord, I could not have made this easier. Hydrogen atom, H, plus pigs minus pea, Higgs. Bow, General Zod trapped in the Phantom Zone. Bow-zone. Pear. Tickle. Pear-tickle. Higgs Boson Particle. How could you not get that?",3
12680,Leonard,13," He‰Ûªs right, Penny. It‰Ûªs all there.",3
12681,Penny,13," Look, Sheldon, sweetie, I know you‰Ûªre feeling insecure, but we‰Ûªve really got to go to sleep.",3
12682,Sheldon,13, All right. I‰Ûªll take the first watch and wake you at 0400.,3
12683,Leonard,13, Great. Good night.,3
12684,Penny,13," Wait, wait, what‰Ûªs 0400?",3
12685,Leonard,13, 4am.,3
12686,Penny,13," That‰Ûªs, like, in 45 minutes.",3
12687,Leonard,13, Just keep walking. (Sheldon checks door then puts TV on his phone),3
12688,Woman on TV,13, It‰Ûªs quiet out there.,3
12689,Man on TV,13, Maybe a little too quiet.,3
12690,Woman on TV,13, Where are you going?,3
12691,Man on TV,13, Just gonna take a look around outside.,3
12692,Sheldon,13, Bad idea.,3
12693,Woman on TV,13," No, Jim, don‰Ûªt open the door!",3
12694,Sheldon,13," Listen to her, Jim.",3
12695,Man on TV,13," Don‰Ûªt worry, there‰Ûªs no one out here. (Sound of woman screaming. Sheldon nods, and turns off TV. Walks down to Leonard‰Ûªs room.)",3
12696,Sheldon,13," (Knock, knock, knock) Leonard and Penny! (Knock, knock, knock) Leonard and Penny! (Knock, knock, knock) Leonard and Penny!",3
12697,Leonard,13, Who is it?,3
12698,Scene,13, Outside the apartment. ,3
12699,Howard,13," All right, we‰Ûªve got a titanium dead bolt and a reinforced jamb controlled by a state-of-the-art electronic access system.",3
12700,Sheldon,13, What if they cut the power?,3
12701,Raj,13, There‰Ûªs a 200-watt uninterruptible backup power supply.,3
12702,Sheldon,13, What if someone steals my keys?,3
12703,Raj,13, There are independent voice and fingerprint scanners.,3
12704,Sheldon,13," What if someone kidnaps me, forces me to record my voice, and then cuts off my thumb?",3
12705,Leonard,13, I‰Ûªll send them a basket of muffins.,3
12706,Howard,13," Now, inside, we‰Ûªve got motion detectors, infrared sensors, and cameras connected to a server running state-of-the-art facial recognition software.",3
12707,Leonard,13, Where did you get all this stuff?,3
12708,Howard,13, I got a buddy over at the Department of Defence.,3
12709,Leonard,13, He just gave it to you?,3
12710,Howard,13," I‰Ûªm sure he would have if I had asked. Ironically, their security isn‰Ûªt all that good.",3
12711,Penny (entering),13," Raj, your car is blocking me‰Û_ (A wire net falls on her, while a computer voice repeats the words ‰ÛÏIntruder Alert‰Û) What the hell?",3
12712,Leonard,13," Sorry, let me help you.",3
12713,Sheldon,13, Wonderful security system if we‰Ûªre attacked by a school of tuna.,3
12714,Howard,13," Don‰Ûªt worry, the net‰Ûªs going to be electrified. Picture her on the floor, spasming uncontrollably.",3
12715,Sheldon,13, Better.,3
12716,Scene,13, Sheldon‰Ûªs bedroom. ,3
12717,Sheldon,13," Sheldon‰Ûªs journal. Security system in place. However, sleep continues to elude me. I‰Ûªve seen the underbelly of Pasadena, this so-called City of Roses, and it haunts me. Ah, the injustice, I lie here awake, tormented, while out there evil lurks, probably playing Donkey Kong on my classic Nintendo. (Hears a noise. Goes to check, then panics and climbs out window onto ledge.) Oh, dear. I am the master of my own bladder. (Crawls along to Leonard‰Ûªs window, where Leonard and Penny are inside being intimate. Knock, knock, knock) Leonard and Penny. (Knock, knock, knock) Leonard and Penny. (Knock, knock, knock) Leonard and Penny.",3
12718,Penny,13," Oh, my‰Û_",3
12719,Leonard,13," God, Sheldon. What the hell are you doing out there?",3
12720,Sheldon,13, I heard a noise.,3
12721,Leonard,13, It was us. We knocked over a lamp.,3
12722,Sheldon,13, Why would you knock over a lamp?,3
12723,Leonard,13, We were going to have‰Û_,3
12724,Penny,13," He doesn‰Ûªt need to know what we were doing, Leonard.",3
12725,Sheldon,13," Oh! No, she‰Ûªs right, I don‰Ûªt need to know what you were doing. Carry on. (Starts to climb back out of window)",3
12726,Leonard,13, What are you doing? Use the door.,3
12727,Sheldon,13, Good thinking. Perhaps I‰Ûªll check the perimeter and make some warm milk.,3
12728,Leonard,13," Great, you do that.",3
12729,Sheldon,13, Would you like me to bring you some warm milk?,3
12730,Leonard,13, I‰Ûªm lactose intolerant.,3
12731,Sheldon,13," And you don‰Ûªt wish to alarm me with any more loud noises, very thoughtful. Warm milk, Penny?",3
12732,Penny,13," No, thanks.",3
12733,Sheldon,13," Fine. Good night to you, sir. Miss.",3
12734,Leonard,13, Sorry about that.,3
12735,Penny,13," Ugh, what can you do? Here. (From outside there is the sound of the net falling and computer voice saying ‰ÛÏIntruder alert.‰Û Then Sheldon screaming. They run out to find Sheldon convulsing under the net.)",3
12736,Leonard,13, Looks like Wolowitz got the net electrified.,3
12737,Penny,13," Sheldon, are you okay?",3
12738,Sheldon,13, I‰Ûªm fine. Although I‰Ûªm no longer the master of my own bladder.,3
12739,Scene,13, The apartment. ,3
12740,Sheldon,13, My new computer came with Windows 7. Windows 7 is much more user-friendly than Windows Vista. I don‰Ûªt like that.,3
12741,Leonard,13, Don‰Ûªt you think looking for a new city to live in is a bit of an overreaction?,3
12742,Sheldon,13," Our apartment was broken into, our security system tried to kill me, and as a result, I‰Ûªm leaving Pasadena forever. Tell me how that‰Ûªs overreacting.",3
12743,Penny,13," Come on, Sheldon, you can‰Ûªt move. Don‰Ûªt you need to stay in one place so the mother ship can find you when it returns?",3
12744,Sheldon,13," Oh, if that were only true. Unfortunately, as I‰Ûªm earthbound for the foreseeable future, I need to find a location that‰Ûªs more hospitable than the mean streets of Pasadena. Like Enid, Oklahoma. Low crime rate and high-speed Internet connectivity, but no model train shops. Sorry, Enid.",3
12745,Penny,13, Is he quitting his job at the university?,3
12746,Leonard,13," Oh, no, he‰Ûªs going to telecommute. Everybody‰Ûªs really excited about it.",3
12747,Sheldon,13," All right. Boone, North Carolina. Every summer since 1952, Boone has hosted an outdoor amphitheater portrayal of the life and times of its namesake, Dan‰Ûªl Boone. Sounds like something that would attract the wrong crowd. Penny, you‰Ûªre from Nebraska, correct?",3
12748,Penny,13, Born and raised. (Sheldon crosses Nebraska off his map),3
12749,Scene,13, Sheldon‰Ûªs bedroom. Sheldon is packing. ,3
12750,Sheldon,13," It will take me a few days to get settled. After I do, I will e-mail you detailed PDFs containing diagrams and instructions that will guide you through packing and shipping the rest of my possessions to Bozeman, Montana. In the meantime, please forward my mail.",3
12751,Leonard,13," Any place specific or just the Bozeman, Montana Loony Bin?",3
12752,Sheldon,13," I sense you‰Ûªre making a joke, but Bozeman does have a comedy club called The Loony Bin, so do not forward my mail there.",3
12753,Howard,13," Oh, come on. So you were the victim of a crime. That‰Ûªs part of life. When my great-grandfather first came to this country, he put all his hopes and dreams into this little butcher shop he ran on the Lower East Side of New York. You know what happened? Every customer who walked into that butcher shop and asked for a pound of liver, got ripped off. But, those people moved on, and so should you.",3
12754,Sheldon,13, I am moving on. I‰Ûªm going to be a Bozite.,3
12755,Leonard,13, They call themselves Bozites?,3
12756,Sheldon,13, They should. It‰Ûªs one of the first things I plan to bring up upon arrival.,3
12757,Penny,13," Sheldon, I can‰Ûªt believe I‰Ûªm saying this, but I‰Ûªm going to miss you.",3
12758,Sheldon,13," Please, Penny, as you know, I‰Ûªm not comfortable with prolonged good-byes and maudlin displays of emotion, so I prepared a short video.",3
12759,Sheldon on laptop screen,13," Greetings. As you know, I‰Ûªm not comfortable with prolonged good-byes and maudlin displays of emotion, so I prepared this short video. The four of you are three of my closest friends and one treasured acquaintance. Though I cannot state categorically that my life will be diminished by not having you in it, I am comfortable if you choose to believe that. Since you intend to remain in this lawless metropolitan area, statistics suggest that you will succumb to tragic and gruesome ends before we meet again. Live long and prosper.",3
12760,Penny,13," Sheldon, that‰Ûªs so‰Û_ (Turns to find he has gone.)",3
12761,Sheldon (entering again),13, You might want to lock the door behind me. This isn‰Ûªt Bozeman.,3
12762,Howard (after Raj whispers to him),13, How the hell do I know who‰Ûªs the friend and who‰Ûªs the acquaintance?,3
12763,Scene,13," Bozeman, Montana bus depot. ",3
12764,Sheldon,13," That is a bracing cold, an invigorating cold. Lord, is it cold!",3
12765,Man,13," Help you with your bags, sir?",3
12766,Sheldon,13," Thank you, fellow Bozite. And may I say, you are the living embodiment of all the promises made by our lovely town‰Ûªs Chamber of Commerce. (Man picks up bags and starts running.) Wait! Wait! Excuse me! (At ticket desk) One ticket to Pasadena, California, please.",3
12767,Scene,13, The apartment. Sheldon enters.,3
12768,Howard,13," Hey, look who‰Ûªs back!",3
12769,Sheldon,13, Interesting. The acquaintance is the first to greet me.,3
12770,Scene,14, The apartment. Sheldon is stood in the middle of the room. His whiteboard is behind him. Every few moments he turns round suddently.,3
12771,Penny,14, Whatcha doing?,3
12772,Sheldon,14, I‰Ûªm attempting to view my work as a fleeting peripheral image so as to engage the superior colliculus of my brain.,3
12773,Penny,14, Interesting. I usually just have coffee. You‰Ûªve been up all night?,3
12774,Sheldon,14, Is it morning?,3
12775,Penny,14, Yes.,3
12776,Sheldon,14, Then I‰Ûªve been up all night.,3
12777,Penny,14, And you‰Ûªre stuck?,3
12778,Sheldon,14, Why else would a person try to engage their superior colliculus?,3
12779,Penny,14," Oh, sorry, sweetie, I can‰Ûªt help you till I‰Ûªve had my coffee.",3
12780,Leonard,14," Penny, I told you if you don‰Ûªt put him in his crate at night he just runs around the apartment.",3
12781,Penny,14, What is he doing now?,3
12782,Leonard,14," Mmm, he‰Ûªs either isolating the terms of his formula and examining them individually, or looking for the alligator that swallowed his hand after Peter Pan cut it off.",3
12783,Sheldon,14," Captain Hook‰Ûªs hand was eaten by a crocodile, not an alligator. If you‰Ûªre going to mock me, at least get your facts straight.",3
12784,Leonard,14," Aye, aye, Captain.",3
12785,Sheldon,14, I can‰Ûªt see it! It just won‰Ûªt coalesce.,3
12786,Leonard,14, Maybe you need a fresh start.,3
12787,Sheldon,14," You‰Ûªre right. (Takes whiteboard to window and throws it out. Picks up a new one) It‰Ûªs a great idea, Leonard. Thank you.",3
12788,Scene,14, The cafeteria.,3
12789,Sheldon,14," Electrons move through graphene, act as if they have no mass‰Û_",3
12790,Howard,14, How long has he been stuck?,3
12791,Leonard,14, Intellectually about 30 hours. Emotionally about 29 years.,3
12792,Sheldon,14, Unit cell contains two carbon atoms. Interior angle of a hexagon is 120 degrees.,3
12793,Howard,14, Have you tried rebooting him?,3
12794,Leonard,14," No, I think it‰Ûªs a firmware problem.",3
12795,Raj (arriving),14," Hey, it‰Ûªs Disco Night at the Moonlight Roller Rink in Glendale tonight. Who‰Ûªs up for getting down?",3
12796,Howard,14," Oh, that‰Ûªs perfect. Bernadette‰Ûªs been hocking me to take her roller skating.",3
12797,Leonard,14, I think Penny likes to skate. The four of us could double.,3
12798,Howard,14, What could be better? We‰Ûªre in.,3
12799,Raj,14, Great. It‰Ûªs not like I brought it up because I wanted to go.,3
12800,Howard,14, You can come with us.,3
12801,Raj,14," No, it‰Ûªs okay. I don‰Ûªt have to go. I‰Ûªm happy just to guide you and your ladies to suitable entertainment choices. I‰Ûªm a walking brown Yelp.com.",3
12802,Sheldon,14," Structure, constant structure. One atom‰Û_",3
12803,Howard,14," Boy, he‰Ûªs really gone, isn‰Ûªt he?",3
12804,Leonard,14," Yeah, this morning he used a stick of butter as deodorant.",3
12805,Howard,14, I thought I smelled popcorn.,3
12806,Sheldon,14," Pattern is the same as fermions, travels on the pathways, hexagonal, it‰Ûªs always hexagonal‰Û_",3
12807,Leonard,14, I haven‰Ûªt seen him this stuck since he tried to figure out the third Matrix movie.,3
12808,Raj (as Sheldon reaches out and grabs from his plate),14," Hey, those are my lima beans!",3
12809,Sheldon,14," Not lima beans, carbon atoms.",3
12810,Raj,14," But if I don‰Ûªt eat my lima beans, I can‰Ûªt have my cookie.",3
12811,Leonard,14," Here, you want my peas?",3
12812,Sheldon,14," Peas! Perfect, they can be electrons.",3
12813,Howard,14, Want my corn?,3
12814,Sheldon,14, Don‰Ûªt be ridiculous. What would I do with corn?,3
12815,Leonard,14," So roller skating, should we all grab a bite to eat first?",3
12816,Howard,14, Good. P.F. Chang‰Ûªs? My mom has coupons.,3
12817,Leonard,14," Great. Your mom‰Ûªs not coming, right?",3
12818,Howard,14," Not this time, I promise.",3
12819,Raj,14," Okay, just to be clear, roller skating was my idea, and I‰Ûªm very unhappy that you turned it into a double date, and I hope you both fall on your asses and break your coccyxes.",3
12820,Sheldon,14, The plural of coccyx is coccyges.,3
12821,Raj,14, Screw you. Give me back my lima beans.,3
12822,Scene,14, The stairwell.,3
12823,Bernadette,14," Oh, my God, have you ever been so embarrassed?",3
12824,Penny,14, Not recently.,3
12825,Bernadette,14," I don‰Ûªt know which was lamer, their roller-skating or their disco dancing.",3
12826,Penny,14," For me, the worst part was when people saw us leave with them.",3
12827,Leonard,14," You had some nice moves out there, Howard.",3
12828,Howard,14," Thanks. You, too.",3
12829,Leonard,14, Yeah. Did you notice all the people looking at us?,3
12830,Howard,14, Not really. I was in my boogie zone.,3
12831,Bernadette,14, When Howard tried to do the splits‰Û_,3
12832,Penny,14, Shh.,3
12833,Leonard,14, Sorry. I‰Ûªm moving a little slow. I think I bruised my coccyx.,3
12834,Penny,14," Oh, poor baby.",3
12835,Leonard,14, Don‰Ûªt tell Koothrappali. After you.,3
12836,Penny,14," Oh, what a gentleman. Hey, Sheldon. (Steps on marbles which are all over the floor, screams and falls)",3
12837,Leonard,14," Oh, my God! Are you‰Û_ (falls as well)",3
12838,Sheldon,14, Good Lord! You‰Ûªre ruining everything!,3
12839,Penny,14," Oh, damn.",3
12840,Leonard,14, Are you okay?,3
12841,Penny,14, Do I look okay?,3
12842,Leonard,14," Don‰Ûªt bark at me. I fell, too.",3
12843,Penny,14," Oh, you‰Ûªve been falling all night. You‰Ûªre used to it.",3
12844,Howard,14," Sheldon, what the hell are you doing?",3
12845,Sheldon,14, The same thing I‰Ûªve been doing for three days. Trying to figure out why electrons behave as if they have no mass when travelling through a graphene sheet.,3
12846,Bernadette,14, With marbles?,3
12847,Sheldon,14," Well, I needed something bigger than peas, now, didn‰Ûªt I?",3
12848,Bernadette,14," Sheldon, when was the last time you got any sleep?",3
12849,Sheldon,14," I don‰Ûªt know, two, three days. Not important. I don‰Ûªt need sleep, I need answers. I need to determine where in this swamp of unbalanced formulas squatteth the toad of truth.",3
12850,Penny,14, Toad of truth? Is that a physics thing?,3
12851,Leonard,14," No, that‰Ûªs a crazy thing.",3
12852,Bernadette,14," Okay, Sheldon. What happens to our neuroreceptors when we don‰Ûªt get enough REM sleep?",3
12853,Sheldon,14, They lose their sensitivity to serotonin and norepinephrine.,3
12854,Bernadette,14, Which leads to‰Û_?,3
12855,Sheldon,14, Impaired cognitive function.,3
12856,Bernadette,14," Right, so march in there, brush your teeth and go to bed.",3
12857,Sheldon,14, But I don‰Ûªt want to go to bed.,3
12858,Bernadette,14, I‰Ûªm going to count to three. One‰Û_,3
12859,Sheldon,14," Oh, all right.",3
12860,Leonard,14, That was amazing how you handled him.,3
12861,Bernadette,14, I know how to deal with stubborn children. My mother used to run an illegal day care centre in our basement.,3
12862,Scene,14, Leonard‰Ûªs bedroom.,3
12863,Penny,14," Leonard, you‰Ûªre‰Û_ you‰Ûªre giggling in your sleep.",3
12864,Leonard,14," It‰Ûªs not me, it‰Ûªs my new ringtone. The Joker from Batman.",3
12865,Penny,14," Well, it creeps me out.",3
12866,Leonard,14," Me, too, but I paid three bucks for it.",3
12867,Penny,14, Just answer the phone.,3
12868,Leonard,14," Hello. Yeah, I‰Ûªm Leonard Hofstadter. Yeah, yeah, he‰Ûªs my roommate. Oh, God, is he okay? Yeah, alright, alright, I‰Ûªll be right there.",3
12869,Penny,14, What happened?,3
12870,Leonard,14, Sheldon‰Ûªs escaped and is terrorizing the village.,3
12871,Penny,14, Okay. Have fun.,3
12872,Scene,14, A children‰Ûªs play area.,3
12873,Leonard,14, Hi. I‰Ûªm Dr. Hofstadter. Where is he?,3
12874,Security Guard,14, Ball pit.,3
12875,Leonard,14, Thanks for not calling the cops.,3
12876,Security Guard,14," Oh, hey, it‰Ûªs no big deal. My sister‰Ûªs got a kid who‰Ûªs special.",3
12877,Leonard,14," Yeah, well, he‰Ûªs extra special. Hey, Shelly. What you doing?",3
12878,Sheldon,14, Size ratio was all wrong. Couldn‰Ûªt visualize it. Needed bigger carbon atoms.,3
12879,Leonard,14," Sure, sure. How did you get into this place?",3
12880,Sheldon,14," Back door has a five-pin tumbler system, single-circuit alarm. Child‰Ûªs play. You can start sorting protons and neutrons while I build carbon atoms.",3
12881,Leonard,14," No, I don‰Ûªt think so. We need to go home now.",3
12882,Sheldon,14, But I‰Ûªm still working.,3
12883,Leonard,14," If you don‰Ûªt come out of there, I‰Ûªm going to have to drag you out.",3
12884,Sheldon,14," You can try, but you‰Ûªll never catch me. (He disappears under the balls)",3
12885,Leonard,14," For God‰Ûªs sakes. Sheldon, come here!",3
12886,Sheldon (popping his head up),14," Bazinga. (Disappears, pops up in another place) Bazinga. (And again) Bazinga. (And again) Bazinga. (And again) Bazinga.",3
12887,Scene,14, Leonard‰Ûªs bedroom. Sheldon is standing over their bed. He knocks on the wall. ,3
12888,Sheldon,14," (Knock, knock, knock) Leonard and Penny. (Knock, knock, knock) Leonard and Penny.",3
12889,Leonard (Waking up as Penny screams),14," What! What, what, what?",3
12890,Sheldon,14," (Knock, knock, knock) Leonard and Penny.",3
12891,Leonard,14, What?,3
12892,Sheldon,14, I have good news.,3
12893,Leonard,14, And you had to barge in here and wake us up in the middle of the night?,3
12894,Sheldon,14, Your cell phone was off.,3
12895,Leonard,14, Because we didn‰Ûªt want to be disturbed.,3
12896,Sheldon,14," And that didn‰Ûªt work out, did it?",3
12897,Penny,14," Sheldon, what do you want?",3
12898,Sheldon,14, I came to tell you I‰Ûªve got the answer.,3
12899,Leonard,14, Really? You figured out the graphene problem?,3
12900,Sheldon,14," No, no, I‰Ûªm still hopelessly stuck on that, but I figured out how to figure it out.",3
12901,Penny,14," Hey, you know what, Leonard, I know I said I could handle your roommate, but I was wrong. We‰Ûªre going to have to break up.",3
12902,Leonard,14, What are you talking about?,3
12903,Penny (as Sheldon sits on the bed),14, Oh.,3
12904,Sheldon,14, Einstein.,3
12905,Leonard,14," Yeah, I‰Ûªm going to need a little more.",3
12906,Sheldon,14, Albert Einstein.,3
12907,Leonard,14, Keep going.,3
12908,Sheldon,14," When Albert Einstein came up with special relativity, he was working at the patent office.",3
12909,Leonard,14," So, you‰Ûªre going to go work at the patent office?",3
12910,Sheldon,14," Don‰Ûªt be absurd. That‰Ûªs in Washington. You know I could never live in a city whose streets are laid out in a wheel-and-spoke pattern. No. I‰Ûªm going to find a similarly menial job where my basal ganglia are occupied with a routine task, freeing my prefrontal cortex to work quietly in the background on my problem.",3
12911,Leonard,14, Sounds like a great plan.,3
12912,Sheldon,14, Of course it is. Even talking to you is sufficiently menial that I can feel the proverbial juices starting to flow.,3
12913,Leonard,14," Okay, well, thanks for sharing with us. Good night.",3
12914,Sheldon,14," You‰Ûªre welcome. Good night to you, too. Oh, by the way, I was watching you sleep for a moment, and I noticed that your snoring seems to be worse when you‰Ûªre on your back.",3
12915,Penny,14, Leonard doesn‰Ûªt snore.,3
12916,Sheldon,14," No, I wasn‰Ûªt talking to Leonard.",3
12917,Leonard,14, Told you.,3
12918,Scene,14, An employment office,3
12919,Employment Office Assistant,14," So, Mr. Cooper, you‰Ûªre looking for a job.",3
12920,Sheldon,14, A menial job. Like yours.,3
12921,Assistant,14," Why, thank you for noticing. I‰Ûªm Menial Employee of the Month. Do you have a particular field in mind?",3
12922,Sheldon,14," I do. For thousands of years, the lowest classes of the human race have spent their lives labouring to erect monuments under the lash of their betters, until finally they dropped down and became one with the dust through which they trudged. Do you have anything like that?",3
12923,Assistant,14, No.,3
12924,Sheldon,14, Shouldn‰Ûªt you check your database?,3
12925,Assistant (clicks her keyboard a few times),14, No.,3
12926,Sheldon,14, You didn‰Ûªt really type.,3
12927,Assistant,14," I didn‰Ûªt really have to. So, how about construction?",3
12928,Sheldon,14," Oh, that would be good! Sawing, hammering, eating out of a lunch pail as my working-class fellows and I sit perched precariously on a girder high above the metropolis.",3
12929,Assistant,14," No, no. This is putting up sheetrock at a housing project in Rosemead.",3
12930,Sheldon,14, I could do that.,3
12931,Assistant,14, Good.,3
12932,Sheldon,14, One question.,3
12933,Assistant,14, Yes?,3
12934,Sheldon,14, What‰Ûªs sheetrock?,3
12935,Assistant,14, Moving on. How about doing deliveries for a florist?,3
12936,Sheldon,14, That seems acceptable.,3
12937,Assistant,14, Do you have your own car?,3
12938,Sheldon,14, I don‰Ûªt drive.,3
12939,Assistant,14," Of course you don‰Ûªt. Mr. Cooper, let me just ask you a question. What was your last job?",3
12940,Sheldon,14," Senior theoretical particle physicist at CalTech, focusing on M theory, or, in layman‰Ûªs terms, string theory.",3
12941,Assistant,14, I see. Just give me a second. Security!,3
12942,Scene,14, The Cheesecake Factory.,3
12943,Penny,14," Okay, I‰Ûªll get those drinks started for you.",3
12944,Sheldon (appearing in an apron and carrying a tray),14, Behind you.,3
12945,Penny,14," Sheldon, what the hell are you doing?",3
12946,Sheldon,14, I‰Ûªm trying to get these tables cleared. We‰Ûªre slammed.,3
12947,Penny,14," No, wait, wait, no, wait. Wh.. what are you doing here?",3
12948,Sheldon,14," A reasonable question. I asked myself, what is the most mind-numbing, pedestrian job conceivable, and three answers came to mind, uh, toll booth attendant, an Apple Store genius, and what Penny does. Now, since I don‰Ûªt like touching other people‰Ûªs coins, and I refuse to contribute to the devaluation of the word genius, here I am.",3
12949,Penny,14," You just, you just walked in and they hired you, just like that?",3
12950,Sheldon,14," Oh, heavens, no. Since I don‰Ûªt need to be paid, I didn‰Ûªt need to be hired. I simply came in, picked up a tray, and started working for the man. Let me get that plate out of your way.",3
12951,Penny,14," Sheldon, this is ridiculous.",3
12952,Sheldon,14," Is it? Just a moment ago I had a minor epiphany regarding the polymer degradation phenomenon while scraping congealed nachos off a plate. Bernadette, table 10 wants their check.",3
12953,Bernadette,14," Thanks, Sheldon.",3
12954,Penny,14," Sheldon, wait, this isn‰Ûªt even what I do. I‰Ûªm a waitress, not a busboy.",3
12955,Sheldon,14," You‰Ûªre right. That is more menial. Hello, I‰Ûªm Sheldon. I‰Ûªll be your server today. I don‰Ûªt recommend the salmon. I saw it in the kitchen.",3
12956,Scene,14," The same, later.",3
12957,Sheldon,14," All right, one bacon cheeseburger, breaking two Jewish dietary restrictions simultaneously, kudos. Beer-battered fish and chips. Now, here‰Ûªs your tartar sauce. I also brought you salsa. It‰Ûªs a little unconventional, but I think you‰Ûªll like it. It‰Ûªs zingy. And for you, Factory Burrito Grande, no cheese, no sour cream, no ugly consequences from your lactose intolerance. Bon appÌ©tit.",3
12958,Leonard,14," Hang on. Black beans, not pinto beans?",3
12959,Sheldon,14, Yes.,3
12960,Leonard,14, Double guacamole?,3
12961,Sheldon,14, Of course.,3
12962,Leonard,14, No cilantro?,3
12963,Sheldon,14, Nope.,3
12964,Leonard,14," Lettuce shredded, not chopped?",3
12965,Sheldon,14, Yep.,3
12966,Leonard,14, You understand why I‰Ûªm doing this to you?,3
12967,Sheldon,14, I do.,3
12968,Leonard,14, That‰Ûªll be all. That was fun.,3
12969,Raj,14, How long can he keep this up?,3
12970,Leonard,14," I heard about this professor at MIT who melted down, bought a van, and spent the rest of his life as a mobile dog groomer.",3
12971,Raj,14, He never went back to the university?,3
12972,Leonard,14, Only to shampoo Professor Chambourg‰Ûªs shih tzu.,3
12973,Raj,14, Sheesh.,3
12974,Howard,14," I bet if we all chipped in, we could buy Sheldon a van.",3
12975,Raj,14, But he‰Ûªs afraid of dogs.,3
12976,Leonard,14," Yeah, that‰Ûªs the only thing wrong with that plan.",3
12977,Penny,14," Hey, guys, sorry you had to wait, but we are swamped. What‰Ûªs this?",3
12978,Leonard,14, Sheldon took our order.,3
12979,Penny,14, Sheldon doesn‰Ûªt work here.,3
12980,Leonard,14," Well, honey, not to complain, but we were starting to think you didn‰Ûªt either.",3
12981,Sheldon (drops tray. A nearby table claps),14, Is that really necessary? Good Lord. The interference pattern in the fracture. The motion of the wave through the molecular structure. I‰Ûªve been looking at it all wrong. I can‰Ûªt consider the electrons as particles. They move through the graphene as a wave. It‰Ûªs a wave! The moment to applaud would be now. Troglodytes.,3
12982,Penny,14," Sheldon, where are you going? Aren‰Ûªt you going to clean this up?",3
12983,Sheldon,14, I‰Ûªm sorry. I don‰Ûªt work here.,3
12984,Scene,14, The roller disco. ,3
12985,Howard,14, Happy now?,3
12986,Raj,14, I‰Ûªm on a cloud. Swing me. (Howard swings Raj several times.),3
12987,Scene,14," The ball pit, presumably earlier. ",3
12988,Leonard,14," Sheldon, come here.",3
12989,Scene,15, The university cafeteria.,3
12990,Howard (on the phone),15," Yeah, I miss you, too, sweetie. Listen, I got to go, but I‰Ûªll see you tonight? Okay. Bye-bye. Yeah, bye-bye. No, you hang up first. Hello?",3
12991,Raj,15," Dude, I‰Ûªm glad you finally got a girlfriend, but do you have to do all that lovey-dovey stuff in front of those of us who don‰Ûªt?",3
12992,Sheldon,15," Actually, he might have to. There‰Ûªs an economic concept known as a positional good in which an object is only valued by the possessor because it‰Ûªs not possessed by others. The term was coined in 1976 by economist Fred Hirsch to replace the more colloquial, but less precise neener-neener.",3
12993,Howard,15, That‰Ûªs not true. My happiness is not dependent on my best friend being miserable and alone.,3
12994,Raj,15, Thank you.,3
12995,Howard,15," Although, I‰Ûªd be lying if I said it wasn‰Ûªt a little bit of a perk.",3
12996,Leonard,15, Who‰Ûªs miserable and alone?,3
12997,Raj,15, Me.,3
12998,Leonard,15, Oh. I used to be like that. Then I got a girlfriend.,3
12999,Sheldon,15," In pre-1976 terms, neener-neener.",3
13000,Leonard,15," Hey, what are you and Bernadette doing for your first Valentine‰Ûªs Day?",3
13001,Howard,15," Yeah, I am pulling out all the stops. There‰Ûªs a $39.95 lover‰Ûªs special at P.F. Chang‰Ûªs. Egg rolls, dumplings, bottomless wok, and you get your picture taken on the big marble horse out front.",3
13002,Sheldon,15," Given that Saint Valentine was a third century Roman priest who was stoned and beheaded, wouldn‰Ûªt a more appropriate celebration of the evening be taking one‰Ûªs steady gal to witness a brutal murder?",3
13003,Howard,15," I understand your point, but given a choice, Jews always go with Chinese food.",3
13004,Raj,15," Well, if anyone‰Ûªs interested, I‰Ûªll be spending this Valentine‰Ûªs Day the same way I spend every Valentine‰Ûªs Day. Buying a rotisserie chicken from the supermarket, taking it home, standing over the sink and eating it out of the package with my bare hands like an animal.",3
13005,Raj,15," Fine, tell us you‰Ûªre going to have sex with Penny.",3
13006,Leonard,15, That‰Ûªs not what I was going to tell you.,3
13007,Raj,15, It‰Ûªs okay. I don‰Ûªt mind hearing about your sex life. It‰Ûªs his that bugs me.,3
13008,Leonard,15, Guess who the university is sending to Switzerland to attend a conference and see the CERN supercollider on February 14?,3
13009,Sheldon,15," Professor Norton, although, God knows why. He hasn‰Ûªt published anything of note since he won that Nobel Prize.",3
13010,Leonard,15," Actually, Professor Norton can‰Ûªt make it. He threw his back out rock climbing.",3
13011,Howard,15, I heard he threw his back out climbing on his new girlfriend.,3
13012,Raj,15, The big-boobed weather girl on Channel 2?,3
13013,Howard,15, That‰Ûªs the one.,3
13014,Leonard,15," In any case, they‰Ûªre asking me to fill in for him.",3
13015,Sheldon,15, In Switzerland or with the big-boobed weather girl?,3
13016,Leonard,15, Switzerland. And I get to bring a guest!,3
13017,Howard,15," Oh, man!",3
13018,Raj,15," No way, dude!",3
13019,Sheldon,15," This is incredible! I‰Ûªm so happy, I‰Ûªm not even going to question their judgment in picking you. I‰Ûªm just going to run home and start packing.",3
13020,Raj,15, Why wouldn‰Ûªt you take Penny?,3
13021,Leonard,15, I am taking Penny.,3
13022,Raj,15," Oh. Well, then I anticipate an awkward situation when you get home.",3
13023,Scene,15, Sheldon‰Ûªs bedroom. ,3
13024,Leonard,15," Sheldon, you got a minute?",3
13025,Sheldon,15," Of course, my good friend. Come in. Help me out, which ski hat says aprÌ¬s supercollider?",3
13026,Leonard,15," Sheldon, I‰Ûªm not taking you to Switzerland.",3
13027,Sheldon,15," Well, of course you are. Who else would you take?",3
13028,Leonard,15, Penny.,3
13029,Sheldon,15, What? That‰Ûªs absurd. Penny has no interest in subatomic particle research.,3
13030,Leonard,15," Yes, but it‰Ûªll be Valentine‰Ûªs Day. We can go sightseeing and skiing and make love in front of a roaring fire in the shadow of the snowcapped Alps.",3
13031,Sheldon,15, But Penny has no interest in subatomic particle research.,3
13032,Leonard,15," I‰Ûªm sorry, Sheldon.",3
13033,Sheldon,15, Sorry? I‰Ûªve been dreaming about going to the Large Hadron Collider since I was nine years old.,3
13034,Leonard,15," Yeah, well, I‰Ûªve been dreaming about spending Valentine‰Ûªs Day with a girl since I was six.",3
13035,Sheldon,15, Shame on you! That‰Ûªs no dream for a scientist!,3
13036,Scene,15, The apartment.,3
13037,Penny,15," Okay, what‰Ûªs the big surprise?",3
13038,Leonard,15, Just a minute. This tray contains clues as to what you and I are going to be doing on Valentine‰Ûªs Day.,3
13039,Penny,15," Oh. Wow. Okay. Let‰Ûªs see. We‰Ûªve got, uh, milk chocolate, Swiss cheese, fondue. My lactose-intolerant boyfriend is going to eat all this, then I‰Ûªm going to climb on his back and rocket to the moon?",3
13040,Leonard,15," No. But it does involve air travel. Okay, um, let me slice this Swiss cheese with my Swiss army knife, and then you can wash it down with a cup of Swiss Miss instant cocoa.",3
13041,Penny,15," Okay, I‰Ûªm starting to think Swiss is key here.",3
13042,Leonard,15, Uh-huh.,3
13043,Penny,15, We‰Ûªre going to Disneyland and ride the Matterhorn?,3
13044,Leonard,15, How does that involve air travel?,3
13045,Penny,15, We‰Ûªre going to Disney World and ride the Matterhorn?,3
13046,Leonard,15, No.,3
13047,Penny,15," Okay, sweetie, this started out fun, but I‰Ûªm over it.",3
13048,Leonard,15, We‰Ûªre going to Switzerland to see the CERN supercollider! And ski. We‰Ûªll also go skiing.,3
13049,Penny,15, We‰Ûªre going skiing in Switzerland?!,3
13050,Leonard,15," Well, you‰Ûªll ski, I‰Ûªll fall, but, yeah, we will be in Switzerland for Valentine‰Ûªs Day.",3
13051,Penny,15," Oh, my God, Leonard! That‰Ûªs incredible!",3
13052,Sheldon,15," Not so fast. You might want to hold off on lighting your rabeliechtli, Penny.",3
13053,Penny,15, My Rabe-what-ly?,3
13054,Sheldon,15," Rabeliechtli. It means turnip light and refers to a traditional lantern hand-carved from a root vegetable and used to celebrate certain Swiss festivals. Which you will not be celebrating because, A, these festivals occur in the fall, and B, you will not be going to Switzerland.",3
13055,Leonard,15," Sheldon, we‰Ûªve been through this. I‰Ûªm taking Penny.",3
13056,Sheldon,15, Afraid not. Do you recognize this?,3
13057,Leonard,15, Not the roommate agreement.,3
13058,Sheldon,15," Indeed, the roommate agreement. I call your attention to the Friendship Rider in Appendix C, Future Commitments. Number 37, in the event one friend is ever invited to visit the Large Hadron Collider, now under construction in Switzerland, he shall invite the other friend to accompany him.",3
13059,Leonard,15," Oh, for God‰Ûªs sakes.",3
13060,Penny,15, You actually put that in an agreement?,3
13061,Leonard,15," Yeah. We also put in what happens if one of us wins a MacArthur Grant, or if one of us gets superpowers, or if one of us is bitten by a zombie.",3
13062,Sheldon,15," He can‰Ûªt kill me, even if I turn.",3
13063,Penny,15, Is there anything in there about if one of you gets a girlfriend?,3
13064,Sheldon,15," No, that seemed a little farfetched.",3
13065,Leonard,15," Sheldon, do you really expect to enforce this?",3
13066,Sheldon,15," I‰Ûªve lived up to all my commitments under the agreement. At least once a day I ask how you are, even though I simply don‰Ûªt care. I no longer stage spontaneous biohazard drills after 10 pm And I abandoned my goal to master Tuvan throat singing.",3
13067,Penny,15," Okay, I know I shouldn‰Ûªt ask, but what is‰Û_?",3
13068,Leonard,15, No.,3
13069,Sheldon (after demonstrating),15, I‰Ûªd be much further along if I‰Ûªd been allowed to practice.,3
13070,Leonard,15," Look, Sheldon, I know it‰Ûªs in the agreement, and if you turn into a zombie, I promise I will not kill you. In fact, I‰Ûªll even let you eat my brains. But I am taking Penny to Switzerland.",3
13071,Sheldon,15, Is that your final decision?,3
13072,Leonard,15, It is.,3
13073,Sheldon,15, Very well.,3
13074,Penny,15," It‰Ûªs not over, is it?",3
13075,Leonard,15, What do you think? (The sound of Tuvan throat singing comes from Sheldon‰Ûªs bedroom.),3
13076,Scene,15, Leonard‰Ûªs car.,3
13077,Leonard,15," Got a bit of traffic this morning, huh? Think it‰Ûªs gonna rain? Instead of underpants, I covered my crotch with potato salad this morning. Thoughts? Okay, I know what‰Ûªll cheer you up, let‰Ûªs play one of your driving games.",3
13078,Sheldon,15," All right. This game is called Traitors. I will name three historical figures, you put them in order of the heinousness of their betrayal. Benedict Arnold, Judas, Dr. Leonard Hofstadter.",3
13079,Leonard,15, You really think I belong with Benedict Arnold and Judas?,3
13080,Sheldon,15, You‰Ûªre right. Judas had the decency to hang himself after what he did.,3
13081,Leonard,15," Come on, Sheldon. Can‰Ûªt you at least try to understand how much this means to me?",3
13082,Sheldon,15," Round two, Leonard Hofstadter, Darth Vader, Rupert Murdoch.",3
13083,Leonard,15, Rupert Murdoch?,3
13084,Sheldon,15," He owns Fox, and they cancelled Firefly. Hint, he and Darth Vader are tied for number 2.",3
13085,Scene,15, The university cafeteria. ,3
13086,Howard,15, I‰Ûªm sorry I couldn‰Ûªt hang with you last night. I had a date with Bernadette.,3
13087,Raj,15, I know. I saw the Tweet.,3
13088,Howard,15," So, what did you end up doing?",3
13089,Raj,15, Not much. Nuked a burrito. Prayed to the Hindu god Urvashi that your bowels would loosen and your penis would droop like a willow tree.,3
13090,Leonard,15, You seen Sheldon?,3
13091,Raj,15, No. Is he still mad about the supercollider?,3
13092,Leonard,15," Yeah. He thinks I betrayed him. I mean, come on, what would you guys do if you were me?",3
13093,Howard,15, I‰Ûªd take Sheldon to Switzerland.,3
13094,Leonard,15, Seriously?,3
13095,Howard,15," Absolutely. And I‰Ûªd leave him there. (Sheldon enters, puts a tray in front of Leonard, and exits.)",3
13096,Raj,15, What the hell is that?,3
13097,Leonard,15," Uh, let‰Ûªs see. Yup, 30 pieces of silverware.",3
13098,Scene,15, Leonard‰Ûªs bedroom.,3
13099,Sheldon,15," Morning, old chum.",3
13100,Leonard,15, What‰Ûªs going on?,3
13101,Sheldon,15," I‰Ûªve made you breakfast. Juice, coffee, and pancakes in the shape of some of your favorite fictional characters. See, here‰Ûªs Frodo.",3
13102,Leonard,15, You made Frodo pancakes?,3
13103,Sheldon,15," Yeah, I used coconut shavings to do the hair on his feet. If you need to void your bladder before eating, I can keep them warm with this beret that I thoroughly laundered and pressed into service as a pancake cosy.",3
13104,Leonard,15, Why are you doing this?,3
13105,Sheldon,15, It‰Ûªs by way of an apology for my recent behaviour. I‰Ûªve had some time to reflect and I‰Ûªve come to realize that friendship is not an aggregation of written agreements. It‰Ûªs a result of two people respecting and caring for each other. Butterscotch scone?,3
13106,Leonard,15, Thanks. It‰Ûªs good.,3
13107,Sheldon,15," What you‰Ûªre tasting is respect and affection. And about a pound of Crisco. After you‰Ûªve finished breakfast, I thought we could spend the day watching the final season of Babylon 5 with director commentary.",3
13108,Leonard,15, You hate Babylon 5.,3
13109,Sheldon,15," I do. It fails as drama, science fiction, and it‰Ûªs hopelessly derivative. But you like it, and you‰Ûªre my friend.",3
13110,Leonard,15," Okay, great. Still not taking you to Switzerland.",3
13111,Sheldon,15, Drat. No Frodo for you.,3
13112,Scene,15, The laundry room.,3
13113,Sheldon,15, Hello.,3
13114,Penny,15, Hello.,3
13115,Sheldon,15," Alright, let‰Ûªs dispense with the friendly banter, I believe you know why I‰Ûªm here.",3
13116,Penny,15," Well, I always figured it was to study us, discover our weaknesses, and report back to your alien overlords.",3
13117,Sheldon,15," Yes, amusing. Extraordinary intelligence might well appear extraterrestrial to you, but let me be more specific. I believe you know why I‰Ûªm here in the laundry room.",3
13118,Penny,15, Better acoustics for your throat singing?,3
13119,Sheldon (trying it),15," It‰Ûªs actually not bad. But my true purpose in being here will be revealed in this brief PowerPoint presentation. Lights. Why Sheldon Cooper, PhD, should go to Switzerland to see the CERN supercollider. A PowerPoint presentation by Sheldon Cooper, PhD.",3
13120,Penny,15," Oh, for God‰Ûªs sakes.",3
13121,Sheldon,15, Here we have a highly gifted researcher in the field of particle physics whose work has brought him to the precipice of forever changing mankind‰Ûªs understanding of the universe. AKA me. And here we have a waitress brushing her teeth with her finger. AKA you.,3
13122,Penny,15, I‰Ûªm sorry. Is this supposed to be buttering me up?,3
13123,Sheldon,15," Please hold all questions to the end of the presentation. This is the Large Hadron Collider at CERN in Switzerland, the product of decades of planning and construction. It is a Mecca for physicists the world over. This is Bath and Body Works on Colorado Boulevard. They sell scented soaps and lotions, some of which contain glitter. Now, let‰Ûªs see if we can match the individual to the appropriate destination.",3
13124,Penny,15," Okay, show‰Ûªs over.",3
13125,Sheldon,15," No, it‰Ûªs not. I‰Ûªve got five more slides.",3
13126,Penny,15," Sheldon, this is Leonard‰Ûªs decision. He invited me to Switzerland, and I intend to go.",3
13127,Sheldon,15, Very well. Enjoy yourself. You‰Ûªre going to be in the presence of something that I‰Ûªve dreamed of seeing for decades. I just hope you‰Ûªll be able to appreciate the magnitude of where you are and what it represents.,3
13128,Penny,15, I‰Ûªll talk to Leonard.,3
13129,Sheldon,15, You will?,3
13130,Penny,15," Yes. If it means that much to you, you should go.",3
13131,Sheldon (Hugging her),15," Oh, Penny, thank you!",3
13132,Penny,15, You‰Ûªre welcome.,3
13133,Sheldon,15," Since I rarely hug, I‰Ûªm relying on your expertise regarding duration.",3
13134,Penny,15, I think we‰Ûªre there.,3
13135,Sheldon,15," Oh, good. Bye-bye.",3
13136,Scene,15, The apartment.,3
13137,Raj,15," You know what? Even though I don‰Ûªt have a girlfriend, I can still have a good time on Valentine‰Ûªs Day.",3
13138,Howard,15," Trust me, you can‰Ûªt. I‰Ûªve tried.",3
13139,Raj,15," No, no, no, I‰Ûªm going to have a me day. First I‰Ûªm going to go to one of those spas in Koreatown, take a steam and get a massage. Then I‰Ûªm going to stop at a pet store and get licked by puppies.",3
13140,Leonard,15," Sheldon, I need to talk to you.",3
13141,Sheldon,15," All right, my friend. Would you like some cholermus?",3
13142,Leonard,15, Some what?,3
13143,Sheldon,15, Cholermus. It‰Ûªs a traditional Swiss breakfast dish. I‰Ûªm preparing my gastrointestinal system for the exotic cuisine of Switzerland.,3
13144,Leonard,15, You‰Ûªre not going to Switzerland!,3
13145,Sheldon,15," Oh, but I am. Didn‰Ûªt Penny tell you the good news?",3
13146,Leonard,15, She told me that you went behind my back to guilt her into letting you go instead of her.,3
13147,Sheldon,15," Yes, that good news.",3
13148,Leonard,15," Well, forget it. I was the one who was invited, I get to decide who goes with me, and it‰Ûªs Penny, not you!",3
13149,Sheldon,15," Howard, could you lower the lights? I have a short PowerPoint presentation.",3
13150,Leonard,15, I don‰Ûªt need to see your presentation. This discussion is over!,3
13151,Sheldon,15, That‰Ûªs a somewhat ambiguous response. Am I going or not?,3
13152,Leonard,15," Sheldon, at this point, I would go by myself before I would take you.",3
13153,Sheldon,15, Really?,3
13154,Leonard,15," Yeah, really.",3
13155,Sheldon,15," Well then, you leave me no alternative. From this moment forward, we can be roommates, but we will no longer be friends.",3
13156,Leonard,15, I‰Ûªm sorry you feel that way.,3
13157,Sheldon,15," I don‰Ûªt think you‰Ûªre fully aware of the ramifications here, Leonard.",3
13158,Leonard,15, Why don‰Ûªt you enlighten me?,3
13159,Sheldon,15, With the friendship clause of our roommate agreement nullified you are no longer entitled to accompany me to go swimming at Bill Gates‰Ûª house should I be invited.,3
13160,Howard,15," Ooh, that‰Ûªs gotta sting.",3
13161,Scene,15, Penny‰Ûªs bedroom.,3
13162,Leonard,15," Just think, this time tomorrow we‰Ûªll be in Geneva, Switzerland for our first Valentine‰Ûªs Day.",3
13163,Penny,15, I know! I went shopping today and bought special undies for the occasion.,3
13164,Leonard,15, Thermal? ‰Û÷Cause it‰Ûªs gonna be cold.,3
13165,Penny,15," Think it through, Leonard.",3
13166,Leonard,15, Oh!,3
13167,Penny,15, Oh!,3
13168,Leonard (Penny sneezes),15," Gesundheit. Or as they say in Switzerland, gesundheit. You getting a cold?",3
13169,Penny,15," No, no, it‰Ûªs probably just allergies.",3
13170,Leonard,15," Do you want an allergy pill? ‰Û÷Cause I have ‰Ûªem all. Prescription, nonprescription, foreign, domestic, experimental.",3
13171,Penny,15, Do any of them work?,3
13172,Leonard,15," Not really, I‰Ûªm just an enthusiast.",3
13173,Leonard,15, Penny? You okay?,3
13174,Penny,15, Did that sound okay to you? Do not come in here!,3
13175,Leonard,15, What‰Ûªs going on?,3
13176,Penny,15, I‰Ûªm having a tea party. What do you think‰Ûªs going on? I think I might have the flu. Or the plague.,3
13177,Leonard,15," Well, our plane leaves at 9 a.m. Do you think you‰Ûªll feel better by then?",3
13178,Penny,15, Yep. ‰Û÷Cause I‰Ûªm gonna be dead.,3
13179,Scene,15, Outside Sheldon‰Ûªs bedroom.,3
13180,Leonard,15," Hey, Sheldon? Listen, Penny is pretty sick and she‰Ûªs not going to be able to go to Switzerland. So if you‰Ûªre still interested, you‰Ûªre welcome to come. (Sound of Sheldon vomiting in the bathroom)",3
13181,Sheldon,15," Great. I‰Ûªll start packing. In a minute. (Vomits again) Oh, look, it‰Ûªs the cholermus.",3
13182,Scene,15, The apartment.,3
13183,Penny,15, Here‰Ûªs your soup.,3
13184,Sheldon,15, Chicken?,3
13185,Penny,15, Yes.,3
13186,Sheldon,15, With the little stars?,3
13187,Penny,15, Yes.,3
13188,Sheldon,15, Heated to 180 degrees?,3
13189,Penny,15," Why don‰Ûªt I pour it in your lap, and you can tell me.",3
13190,Sheldon,15, You don‰Ûªt have to be mean. I‰Ûªm sick.,3
13191,Penny,15," Yeah, well, I‰Ûªm sick, too.",3
13192,Sheldon,15," Not my problem. I just don‰Ûªt understand how this happened to me. I‰Ûªm scrupulous about my hygiene. I regularly disinfect my hands, and I avoid contact with other people on general principle.",3
13193,Penny,15," I don‰Ûªt know what to tell you, Sheldon.",3
13194,Sheldon (remembering the hug),15, It‰Ûªs you! I touched you!,3
13195,Penny,15, Happy Valentine‰Ûªs Day.,3
13196,Scene,15, A Swiss hotel room. ,3
13197,Raj,15," Oh, my goodness, look at this room! Champagne! Roses! Oh, and little chocolates! This is going to be the best Valentine‰Ûªs Day ever.",3
13198,Leonard,15," Yeah, I forgot about all this.",3
13199,Raj,15, But I never will.,3
13200,Scene,16, The comic book store. Raj enters carrying an iPod with a speaker on his tee shirt. As he enters the shop he starts the iPod and the Darth Vader theme from Star Wars emerges from the speaker. ,3
13201,Leonard,16, Will you please turn your shirt off?,3
13202,Raj,16, What? I‰Ûªm giving myself dramatic entrance music. People will know I‰Ûªm awesome and to be feared.,3
13203,Howard,16," Yeah, right, there‰Ûªs nothing more awesome and frightening than a man who‰Ûªs got music blasting from between his nipples.",3
13204,Leonard,16," Hey, Stuart, what‰Ûªs going on?",3
13205,Stuart,16," Well, you might want to mark your Google calendars. Stan Lee is coming to do a signing on Thursday.",3
13206,Sheldon,16, Did he finally write a sequel to his autobiography? I‰Ûªm sure ages 79 through 87 were just action-packed.,3
13207,Stuart,16," No, just a regular comic signing. My uncle is his dermatologist and Stan‰Ûªs doing him a favour.",3
13208,Sheldon,16," Oh, I don‰Ûªt want to know that! How can I possibly discuss with Stan Lee the scientific foundations for interstellar flight on a silver surfboard when part of my brain will be scanning his face for signs of contagious skin disease?",3
13209,Leonard,16, Stan Lee does not have a contagious skin disease.,3
13210,Sheldon,16," Well, look who thinks he‰Ûªs Stuart‰Ûªs uncle now.",3
13211,Raj,16, Can‰Ûªt believe it. We‰Ûªre going to meet Stan Lee! (Presses play on his iPod. His shirt starts to play ‰ÛÏI‰Ûªm So Excited‰Û by the Pointer Sisters. He dances.),3
13212,Howard,16, I‰Ûªm sad to say I taught him those moves.,3
13213,Scene,16, The apartment.,3
13214,Leonard,16," I can‰Ûªt decide whether I want Stan Lee to autograph my Journey into Mystery 83, first appearance of Thor or my Fantastic Four number five, first appearance of Dr. Doom. (Raj presses his iPod. The theme from Jeopardy plays.) Alex, I‰Ûªm going to go with what is‰Û_ you‰Ûªre a dumbass? (Presses again, his shirt blows a raspberry.)",3
13215,Sheldon,16, I‰Ûªve decided I‰Ûªm going to have Mr. Lee sign my copy of this month‰Ûªs Batman.,3
13216,Howard,16, That‰Ûªs crazy. Stan Lee had nothing to do with Batman.,3
13217,Sheldon,16," Yes, which is why no one else will ask him to sign one, and I will be the possessor of a unique, albeit confusing, artifact, which will set me apart from the hoi polloi of comic book fandom.",3
13218,Raj,16," That‰Ûªs a great idea, I‰Ûªm going to get him to sign a Batman as well.",3
13219,Sheldon,16, What is it about the word unique you don‰Ûªt understand?,3
13220,Howard,16," Ow! Damn, paper cut. Nothing worse than a paper cut.",3
13221,Raj,16," Well, obviously you don‰Ûªt remember your circumcision.",3
13222,Sheldon,16, There‰Ûªs Neosporin and Band-Aids in my top desk drawer.,3
13223,Howard,16, Why don‰Ûªt you keep that stuff in the bathroom?,3
13224,Leonard,16, He does. And in the kitchen. And in the car. And in his pocket.,3
13225,Sheldon,16," Yeah, but the ones in my pocket are mine.",3
13226,Penny,16, Hi!,3
13227,Leonard,16, Hey. Guess who‰Ûªs going to be at the comic bookstore on Thursday?,3
13228,Penny,16," Um, can you give me a hint?",3
13229,Leonard,16, Stan Lee.,3
13230,Penny,16," Um, Stanley, Stanley, Stanley Tucci?",3
13231,Leonard,16," No, no, Stan Lee.",3
13232,Penny,16," Oh, oh, Stan Lee! Cool!",3
13233,Leonard,16," You have no idea who he is, do you?",3
13234,Penny,16, Of course I do. You‰Ûªre an important part of my life and I pay attention to the things you are interested in.,3
13235,Leonard,16," Good, good, so, who‰Ûªs Stan Lee?",3
13236,Penny,16," Um, he was on Star Trek.",3
13237,Leonard,16, Nope.,3
13238,Penny,16, Star Wars?,3
13239,Leonard,16, No.,3
13240,Penny,16," Um, uh, Stan Lee, oh, he was in those goofy kung fu movies you love so much?",3
13241,Leonard,16, That‰Ûªs Bruce Lee.,3
13242,Penny,16," Oh. So, is this Bruce Lee‰Ûªs nerdy brother, Stan?",3
13243,Howard,16," Sheldon, why do you have all these unopened paychecks in your desk?",3
13244,Sheldon,16, Because most of the things I‰Ûªm planning to buy haven‰Ûªt been invented yet.,3
13245,Howard,16, But there must be thousands of dollars here. Why don‰Ûªt you put it in the bank?,3
13246,Sheldon,16," I don‰Ûªt trust banks. I believe that when the robots rise up, ATMs will lead the charge.",3
13247,Howard,16, You‰Ûªve also got something from the Pasadena Municipal Court.,3
13248,Sheldon,16," Undoubtedly yet another snide response to my repeated letters complaining that the flags in front of the courthouse are flying in the wrong order. From left to right, it‰Ûªs supposed to be federal, state, and then city of Pasadena.",3
13249,Penny,16, I‰Ûªm sorry. You sent more than one letter about that?,3
13250,Sheldon,16, It bothers me.,3
13251,Howard,16," Sheldon, this is a summons.",3
13252,Sheldon,16, A summons for what?,3
13253,Sheldon,16," November 16? Penny, that‰Ûªs the evening you fell in your bathtub and I had to drive you to the emergency room.",3
13254,Penny,16," No, it isn‰Ûªt.",3
13255,Sheldon,16," Yes, it is.",3
13256,Penny,16," No, it isn‰Ûªt.",3
13257,Sheldon,16," Penny, I have an eidetic memory. Also, that‰Ûªs a picture of you in the passenger seat holding your dislocated shoulder.",3
13258,Penny,16," Mmm, no, it isn‰Ûªt.",3
13259,Sheldon,16," Okay, then why is a summons for a traffic violation committed in your car, bearing your license plates, coming to me?",3
13260,Penny,16," Okay, look, they sent me the ticket. I told them I wasn‰Ûªt driving and they were all, if it wasn‰Ûªt you, who was it?",3
13261,Sheldon,16, So you betrayed me?,3
13262,Penny,16, No! It wasn‰Ûªt a betrayal. It was more of a can‰Ûªt afford any more points on my license. I already have to buy my insurance from this place in the Cayman Islands.,3
13263,Sheldon,16, But the only reason I was driving your car was because you were in distress and I was rescuing you.,3
13264,Penny,16," Yes, yes, look, and now you have a photo to remember that heroic day.",3
13265,Leonard,16, It‰Ûªs not that big a deal. You just go down to the court on Thursday and you pay the fine.,3
13266,Sheldon,16, I‰Ûªm not going to pay a fine. That would imply I‰Ûªm guilty.,3
13267,Howard,16, You are guilty. (Raj‰Ûªs shirt plays the gavel sound from Law & Order) That one I liked.,3
13268,Sheldon,16," I am not guilty. I only have a learner‰Ûªs permit, Penny was the teacher. When the light turned yellow she said go, go, go, so I went, went, went.",3
13269,Penny,16," Sheldon, I‰Ûªm sorry. I‰Ûªll be happy to reimburse you for the fine. You know, as soon as I get a part in a movie or my own TV series.",3
13270,Sheldon,16," You don‰Ûªt need to reimburse me because I‰Ûªm not paying. On Thursday, I will have my day in court and justice will be done. In fact, I‰Ûªm going to begin preparing my defence right now.",3
13271,Howard,16," Okay, he‰Ûªs going to jail.",3
13272,Leonard (after Raj whispers to him),16," Oh, that‰Ûªs right. Thursday is Stan Lee Day.",3
13273,Sheldon,16," Now you see what you‰Ûªve done? Because of you, we‰Ûªre all going to miss Stan Lee.",3
13274,Leonard,16, Whoa! What do you mean all?,3
13275,Sheldon,16," Well, you‰Ûªre my friends. You‰Ûªll be standing by my side, supporting me, feeding me legal precedents, and if you had the upper body strength, carrying me out on your shoulders when I‰Ûªm victorious.",3
13276,Leonard,16," Yeah, okay. No.",3
13277,Sheldon,16, Are you saying that you will not stand beside me as I plead my case?,3
13278,Leonard,16, That‰Ûªs what I‰Ûªm saying.,3
13279,Sheldon,16, Howard?,3
13280,Howard,16," Wow. Uh, Stan Lee, or you in court? Uh, if this was Sophie‰Ûªs Choice it would‰Ûªve been a much shorter movie. No.",3
13281,Sheldon,16," Raj? You‰Ûªll be there, won‰Ûªt you? (Shirt plays ‰ÛÏincorrect‰Û quiz sound) All right, then, my so-called friends have forsaken me. So, I guess it‰Ûªll just be me and my eyewitness.",3
13282,Penny,16," Oh, balls.",3
13283,Sheldon,16, Please try to wear something appropriate. It won‰Ûªt help my case if the judge is busy trying to read the word Juicy scrawled across your buttocks.,3
13284,Scene,16, Penny‰Ûªs door. ,3
13285,Sheldon,16," (Knock, knock, knock) Penny. (Knock, knock, knock) Penny.",3
13286,Penny (opening door),16," (Knock, knock, knock) Penny.",3
13287,Sheldon,16, That‰Ûªs just wrong.,3
13288,Penny,16," All right, let‰Ûªs go.",3
13289,Sheldon,16," Wait, hold on. Before we get to the courthouse, I‰Ûªd like to call on your skills as an actress.",3
13290,Penny,16, What is this?,3
13291,Sheldon,16," I‰Ûªve taken the liberty of scripting your appearance on the witness stand because, let‰Ûªs face it, you‰Ûªre somewhat of a loose cannon. Now, don‰Ûªt worry, it‰Ûªs written in your vernacular. So shall we rehearse?",3
13292,Penny,16, Do I have a choice?,3
13293,Sheldon,16," Well, of course you have a choice. Although we live in a deterministic universe, each individual has free will. Now, sit down. I call your attention to the events of November 16. Do you remember that date?",3
13294,Penny (reading),16," Darn tootin‰Ûª, I do, if the court will excuse my homespun, corn-fed Nebraskan turn of phrase.",3
13295,Sheldon,16, Excellent. Go on.,3
13296,Penny,16," The reason that date is, like, so totally fixed in my memory is that I had the privilege to be witness to one of the most heroic acts I‰Ûªve ever seen in, like, ever.",3
13297,Sheldon,16, And who performed that heroic act?,3
13298,Penny,16," Why, you did, sir. You. Dr. Sheldon Cooper, and may I add, it is a privilege to know you.",3
13299,Sheldon,16," There‰Ûªs no need for compliments, this court is only interested in the facts.",3
13300,Penny,16, But it is a fact that it‰Ûªs a privilege to know you. Totally. A teardrop rolls down my cheek?,3
13301,Sheldon,16, Only a suggestion. A catch in your throat would work just as well.,3
13302,Penny (pretending to be close to tears),16, But it is a fact that it‰Ûªs a privilege to know you. Totally.,3
13303,Sheldon,16, Maybe you should put on your Juicy pants again.,3
13304,Scene,16, The courtroom. ,3
13305,Judge,16, Pay the cashier. Sheldon Cooper?,3
13306,Sheldon,16," Good morning, Your Honour. Dr. Sheldon Cooper appearing in pro se. That is to say, representing himself.",3
13307,Judge,16, I know what it means. I went to law school.,3
13308,Sheldon,16," And yet you wound up in traffic court. Anyway, if it would please the court, I‰Ûªd like to begin with an opening statement.",3
13309,Judge,16," The court would advise you to make it quick, as the court had a dicey-looking breakfast burrito this morning and just took an Imodium.",3
13310,Sheldon,16," Very well, a quick opening statement. Like a milking stool, my case rests on three legs. I will demonstrate that I was improperly instructed in driving by a woman whose lack of respect for society borders on the sociopathic. I will argue that the emergency met the legal doctrine of quod est necessarium est licitum, that which is necessary is legal. But first, I will raise a Sixth Amendment issue. I‰Ûªm unable to confront my accuser, a non-human entity, to wit, a camera. So, to sum up, improper instruction, quod est necessarium est licitum, Sixth Amendment. My milk stool is complete.",3
13311,Judge,16, Impressive.,3
13312,Sheldon,16, Thank you.,3
13313,Judge,16, Guilty. Pay the cashier.,3
13314,Sheldon,16, I object. You‰Ûªre completely ignoring the law.,3
13315,Judge,16," No, I‰Ûªm following the law. I‰Ûªm ignoring you.",3
13316,Sheldon,16," Really? I would point out that I am at the top of my profession, while you preside over the kiddy table of yours.",3
13317,Judge,16," Dr. Cooper, before I find you in contempt and throw you in jail, I‰Ûªm going to give you a chance to apologize for that last remark.",3
13318,Sheldon,16, I am a scientist. I never apologize for the truth.,3
13319,Scene,16, A police cell. Three people sit on a bench inside. Sheldon points at the one on the end.,3
13320,Sheldon,16, That‰Ûªs my spot.,3
13321,Scene,16, A queue outside the comic book store.,3
13322,Raj,16, I can‰Ûªt wait to ask Stan Lee why he insists on giving all his characters first and last names that start with the same letter.,3
13323,Leonard,16," Oh, come on, why would you do that?",3
13324,Raj,16," Bruce Banner, Reed Richards, Sue Storm, Stephen Strange, Otto Octavius, Silver Surfer, Peter Parker, oh, and worst of all, J. Jonah Jameson, Jr.",3
13325,Howard,16," Okay, I‰Ûªm cutting. I‰Ûªm not gonna talk to Stan Lee after you cheese him off.",3
13326,Leonard (phone rings.),16, Hey.,3
13327,Penny,16, Sheldon‰Ûªs in jail.,3
13328,Leonard,16, Sheldon‰Ûªs in jail?,3
13329,Raj,16, You called it.,3
13330,Leonard,16, For what?,3
13331,Penny,16," What do you think? For doing the same crap he always does, except to a judge. He has to stay in there until he apologizes.",3
13332,Leonard,16, So tell him to apologize.,3
13333,Penny,16," Oh, gee, thanks, Leonard. That didn‰Ûªt occur to me. If he doesn‰Ûªt apologize by 5 o‰Ûªclock he is going to spend the night in jail.",3
13334,Leonard,16," Oh, no, that‰Ûªs terrible. Ooh, the line‰Ûªs moving. Got to go. Bye.",3
13335,Scene,16, The police cell. ,3
13336,Sheldon,16," Excuse me? Excuse me, jailor?",3
13337,Guard,16, What?,3
13338,Sheldon,16, I need to use the restroom.,3
13339,Guard,16, Knock yourself out. (Points to urinal in cell),3
13340,Sheldon,16, That‰Ûªs the toilet?,3
13341,Guard,16," Well, it ain‰Ûªt a wishing well.",3
13342,Sheldon,16, Please tell the judge I‰Ûªm ready to apologize.,3
13343,Scene,16, The apartment.,3
13344,Leonard,16," Look at that. To my friend, Leonard, from Stan Lee, Excelsior!",3
13345,Howard,16," Awesome. Mine says, To my friend, Howard, from Stan Lee, Excelsior!",3
13346,Raj,16," Mine says, To Raj, from Stan Lee.",3
13347,Howard,16, That‰Ûªs ‰Ûªcause you pissed him off about his character names.,3
13348,Raj,16," Hey, I didn‰Ûªt even mention Dum Dum Dugan or Green Goblin, Matt Murdock, Pepper Potts, Victor Von Doom, oh, and worst of all, Millie the Model.",3
13349,Penny,16, We‰Ûªre home.,3
13350,Leonard,16," Oh, hey, buddy. How‰Ûªd it go?",3
13351,Sheldon,16, You know very well how it went.,3
13352,Leonard,16," Yeah, but we all want to hear it from you.",3
13353,Sheldon,16, I was found guilty and fined $533.,3
13354,Penny,16," I‰Ûªm going to write you a cheque for that. As long as you promise to put it in your drawer and never cash it, like the others.",3
13355,Sheldon,16," I also now have three points on a driver‰Ûªs licence I do not yet possess, and I was forced to issue an undeserved apology, simply because I refuse to urinate in a stainless steel bowl in front of criminals.",3
13356,Howard,16," Plus, you didn‰Ûªt get to meet Stan Lee.",3
13357,Leonard,16," Okay, that‰Ûªs enough, Howard. The poor guy‰Ûªs had a tough time. He had to spend the entire afternoon in jail wearing that suit.",3
13358,Howard,16," You‰Ûªre right, so it would be cruel to mention that after he finished signing autographs, Stan Lee took Stuart and us out for gelato.",3
13359,Sheldon,16, You had gelato with Stan Lee?,3
13360,Howard,16, He said we could call him Stan.,3
13361,Leonard,16, Except for Raj.,3
13362,Sheldon,16," Well, I hope you‰Ûªre satisfied, Penny. You are responsible for all the evil that has befallen me today.",3
13363,Penny,16," Okay, I realize that‰Û_",3
13364,Sheldon,16," Not finished. It is because of you that I now have a criminal record, and it is because of you that I missed out on having gelato with Stan Lee.",3
13365,Penny,16," Okay, maybe you‰Ûªll have another chance to have‰Û_",3
13366,Sheldon,16," No, no. I will never have another chance to have gelato with Stan Lee because opportunities to have gelato with Stan Lee come but once in a lifetime. The moving finger writes, and having writ, moves on!",3
13367,Penny,16, Did he just somehow give me the finger?,3
13368,Howard,16, Not just the finger. The moving finger.,3
13369,Scene,16, The comic book store.,3
13370,Penny,16," Hey, Stuart.",3
13371,Stuart,16," Oh, hey, Penny. Wow. Hi.",3
13372,Penny,16, What‰Ûªs going on?,3
13373,Stuart,16, Nothing. I‰Ûªm just getting ready to close up and head out.,3
13374,Penny,16, Ah. Cool. Got any fun plans?,3
13375,Stuart,16," Oh, yeah. Big night tonight. Gonna share a can of tuna with the cat.",3
13376,Penny,16," Oh, nice.",3
13377,Stuart,16, Not even my cat. I just feed it. Some nights it doesn‰Ûªt even show up.,3
13378,Penny,16," Oh, okay. Well, I was hoping, um, you could do me a favour.",3
13379,Stuart,16," Sure, yeah, name it.",3
13380,Penny,16," Well, I‰Ûªm kind of responsible for Sheldon missing Stan Lee, and I really want to make it up to him. So I was hoping you could give me his phone number so maybe I can arrange for them to meet.",3
13381,Stuart,16," Oh, I‰Ûªm sorry, I don‰Ûªt have his phone number.",3
13382,Penny,16, Hmm. Damn. All right. Thank you.,3
13383,Stuart,16, Mm-hmm. Wait. I have his address.,3
13384,Penny,16, Really? Great!,3
13385,Stuart,16, But I can‰Ûªt give it to you.,3
13386,Penny,16, Then why did you tell me you had it?,3
13387,Stuart,16, I don‰Ûªt know. Just chatting. You‰Ûªre looking at a guy who could very well get stood up by a stray cat tonight.,3
13388,Penny,16," I‰Ûªm sorry, Stuart. Thanks anyway.",3
13389,Stuart,16, Mm-hmm. Wait.,3
13390,Penny,16, Yeah?,3
13391,Stuart,16, Maybe we can make a deal.,3
13392,Penny,16, What kind of deal?,3
13393,Stuart,16, I will give you the address if you go to my cousin‰Ûªs wedding with me.,3
13394,Penny,16, You‰Ûªre extorting a date out of me?,3
13395,Stuart,16, I kind of have to. The cousin who‰Ûªs getting married is the cousin I usually go to weddings with.,3
13396,Penny,16, Can I bring Leonard?,3
13397,Stuart,16, Sure. What the hell.,3
13398,Penny,16, Deal.,3
13399,Stuart,16, We‰Ûªll tell people he‰Ûªs your cousin.,3
13400,Scene,16, Outside Stan Lee‰Ûªs house.,3
13401,Sheldon,16," This is Stan Lee‰Ûªs front door. We were on Stan Lee‰Ûªs curb, then we were on Stan Lee‰Ûªs walk, and now we‰Ûªre at Stan Lee‰Ûªs front door.",3
13402,Penny,16, Yup.,3
13403,Sheldon,16," Oh, Lord, you just rang Stan Lee‰Ûªs doorbell. At Stan Lee‰Ûªs house. We‰Ûªre about to go in and have milk and cookies with Stan Lee.",3
13404,Penny,16," Okay, sweetie, I don‰Ûªt know if we‰Ûªre gonna have cookies, or he‰Ûªs just gonna say hi, or really what‰Ûªs gonna happen, so just let me talk, and we‰Ûªll‰Û_",3
13405,Stan Lee (opening door),16, Yeah?,3
13406,Penny,16, Are you Stan Lee?,3
13407,Stan Lee,16," Oh, damn.",3
13408,Penny,16," Hi. I‰Ûªm Penny. This is my friend, Sheldon.",3
13409,Sheldon,16, We‰Ûªre not friends at the moment. Depends on how this goes.,3
13410,Penny,16," Right, right. Anyway, Sheldon here is a huge fan of yours, and he was supposed to meet you the other day at the comic book store, but he kind of ended up in jail.",3
13411,Stan Lee,16, I see. And you thought you‰Ûªd just come over to my house uninvited?,3
13412,Sheldon,16, You said we were invited.,3
13413,Penny,16," Oh, no, no, I said I‰Ûªm inviting you to come with me to Stan Lee‰Ûªs house.",3
13414,Stan Lee,16," You know, you fan boys are unbelievable. Do you think you can just ring my doorbell any time you want? I mean, why don‰Ûªt you just come on in and watch the Lakers game with me?",3
13415,Sheldon,16," Well, I‰Ûªm not much of a sports fan, but thank you.",3
13416,Penny,16, I‰Ûªm sorry. He doesn‰Ûªt really understand sarcasm.,3
13417,Stan Lee,16," Well, I‰Ûªll give him something he‰Ûªll understand. Joanie, call the police!",3
13418,Penny,16, Nice to meet you.,3
13419,Scene,16, The apartment.,3
13420,Raj,16," Fantastic Four, Daredevil, Invincible Iron Man, Happy Hogan, Curt Connors‰Û_",3
13421,Howard,16, Would you just let it go?,3
13422,Raj,16," And worst of all, Fin Fang Foom.",3
13423,Leonard (as Sheldon enters),16," Hey, where‰Ûªve you been?",3
13424,Sheldon,16," I‰Ûªll tell you where I‰Ûªve been. You boys may have had gelato with Stan Lee and gotten autographed comics, but I saw the inside of his house and got an autographed application for a restraining order.",3
13425,Howard,16, Sweet.,3
13426,Sheldon,16," Plus, I get to hang out with him again at the hearing. This is going to look great hanging next to my restraining order from Leonard Nimoy.",3
13427,Scene,17, The stairwell. Leonard is carrying a large box.,3
13428,Leonard,17, Why do I always have to carry the heavy stuff?,3
13429,Sheldon,17," Well, it‰Ûªs very simple. In our ragtag band of scientists with nothing to lose, I‰Ûªm the smart one, Wolowitz is the funny one, and Koothrappali is the lovable foreigner who struggles to understand our ways and fails. That leaves you, by default, as the muscle.",3
13430,Leonard,17," One more floor, and I‰Ûªd be the pulled muscle.",3
13431,Penny (who is inside the apartment),17," Oh, it‰Ûªs about time, I‰Ûªm starving.",3
13432,Leonard,17," Uh, well, we didn‰Ûªt actually get Chinese food.",3
13433,Penny,17, Why not?,3
13434,Leonard,17," Don‰Ûªt panic, this is better.",3
13435,Penny,17," Oh, no, you didn‰Ûªt trade the food for magic beans, did you?",3
13436,Sheldon,17," Of course not. And, technically, magic beans would be food, although eating them would be quite a waste, since you could plant them and overnight have a giant beanstalk, which would provide enough roughage for a small city.",3
13437,Penny,17," Yeah, sometimes I don‰Ûªt listen, sometimes I just watch your jaw go up and down.",3
13438,Leonard,17," We were on our way to the Chinese restaurant when we thought we saw Adam West, so we followed him.",3
13439,Penny,17, Who‰Ûªs Adam West?,3
13440,Sheldon,17," Who‰Ûªs Adam West? Leonard, what do the two of you talk about after the coitus?",3
13441,Howard,17," My guess is, ‰ÛÏHey, four minutes! New record!‰Û That‰Ûªs why I‰Ûªm the funny one.",3
13442,Leonard,17," Anyway, we followed the guy to this garage sale, and they had the coolest stuff.",3
13443,Howard,17, They were closing up. We got this whole box for sixty bucks.,3
13444,Leonard,17, We didn‰Ûªt even get to go through it all. There could be anything in here.,3
13445,Penny,17, There a new girlfriend in there? ‰Û÷Cause you might need one.,3
13446,Leonard,17," No. But there is an original final draft Ghostbusters script with actual slime stains! (Raj whispers to Leonard) Oh, you‰Ûªre right, it‰Ûªs Ghostbusters 2. Never mind.",3
13447,Howard,17," Oh, my God. An Alf doll. When I was 11 my mother got me one to help me sleep after my dad left. I used to pretend that my dad had moved to the planet Melmac, and Alf was going to bring him back to me. But he never did. Where‰Ûªs my daddy, puppet? Where is he?",3
13448,Penny,17, That is so sad.,3
13449,Sheldon,17," No, what‰Ûªs sad is that you don‰Ûªt know Adam West was TV‰Ûªs Batman.",3
13450,Scene,17, The same,3
13451,Leonard,17," Here‰Ûªs Spock‰Ûªs head with no body. Here‰Ûªs Mr. T‰Ûªs body with no head. Oh, yeah, here‰Ûªs Spock‰Ûªs body with Mr. T‰Ûªs head. I pity the fool who‰Ûªs illogical.",3
13452,Penny,17," Okay, I‰Ûªm just gonna go home and make a grilled cheese and window-shop on eHarmony.",3
13453,Leonard,17," Okay, bye.",3
13454,Penny,17, Okay.,3
13455,Leonard,17," Ooh, look, an Indiana Jones connect-the-dots.",3
13456,Raj,17, And an Aquaman action figure.,3
13457,Howard,17, Looks like someone drew a penis on him.,3
13458,Raj,17, Huh? That‰Ûªll come off.,3
13459,Howard,17, You see what you‰Ûªre doing? Stop that.,3
13460,Sheldon,17, Fascinating.,3
13461,Leonard,17, What?,3
13462,Sheldon,17, It appears to be a Lord of the Rings ring.,3
13463,Leonard,17, Oh.,3
13464,Raj,17, It‰Ûªs even got the Elvish engraving on it.,3
13465,Sheldon,17, It‰Ûªs not Elvish. It‰Ûªs the language of Mordor written in Elvish script. One Ring to,3
13466,Raj,17, One Ring to find them.,3
13467,Howard,17, One Ring to bring them all.,3
13468,Leonard,17, And in the darkness bind them.,3
13469,Raj,17," Holy crap, are we nerdy.",3
13470,Scene,17, The Cheesecake Factory,3
13471,Howard,17," So, I was doing some checking on the ring.",3
13472,Raj,17," Hold on. Sheldon, is there ketchup on that table?",3
13473,Sheldon,17," Yes, there is. Oh, here‰Ûªs a fun fact, ketchup started out as a general term for sauce, typically made of, uh, mushrooms or fish brine with herbs and spices. Some popular early main ingredients included blueberry, anchovy, oyster, kidney bean and grape.",3
13474,Raj,17," No, that‰Ûªs okay. I‰Ûªll get it.",3
13475,Howard,17," Listen, I was looking at the ring, and it seemed a little weird. No copyright notice on it. So, I took it down to this buddy of mine who deals with, shall we say, the seedy underbelly of the collectibles world.",3
13476,Leonard,17, Seedy underbelly?,3
13477,Howard,17," You know, your black market phasers, your screen-worn Lieutenant Uhura panties, that kind of stuff.",3
13478,Raj,17, Who‰Ûªs this mysterious buddy you suddenly have?,3
13479,Howard,17, Just a guy. I know a guy.,3
13480,Raj,17, Is it Eddie Crispo?,3
13481,Howard,17," No, I can‰Ûªt tell you who it is. Stop asking.",3
13482,Raj,17, Who else could it be? It has to be Eddie Crispo.,3
13483,Howard,17," I know lots of dangerous people, okay?",3
13484,Raj,17, Name one.,3
13485,Howard,17," Eddie Crispo. Anyway, he said this isn‰Ûªt a replica. It‰Ûªs the real deal.",3
13486,Sheldon,17," If you‰Ûªre suggesting that that is the actual ring of power forged by Sauron in Mount Doom, I look at you with an expression of exhaustion and ever so slight amusement.",3
13487,Leonard,17," He‰Ûªs not saying it‰Ûªs a magic ring. You‰Ûªre not, are you?",3
13488,Howard,17," No, but it‰Ûªs close. Look at the markings inside. Those are production markings. Nine rings were made for use in the Lord of the Rings movies. Three were given to members of the cast. The rest were destroyed. Except one. One was stolen. Gentlemen, this is the one ring.",3
13489,Sheldon (snatching it),17, Mine!,3
13490,Leonard,17," No, it is not yours. We all went in on the box together.",3
13491,Sheldon,17," Well, yes, but I found it in the box, and the laws of maritime salvage clearly state that the finder of a sunken treasure is the owner of the treasure.",3
13492,Leonard,17, How is this maritime salvage?,3
13493,Sheldon,17," Other than the lack of water, how is it not?",3
13494,Raj,17," Wait, wait. Sheldon, stop being crazy for a second. How much is something like this worth?",3
13495,Howard,17," Well, it‰Ûªs tough to say since it‰Ûªs hot, but on the underground market, my guy figures‰Û_",3
13496,Raj,17, Your guy Eddie Crispo?,3
13497,Howard,17," Yes. He figures ten, maybe 15 thousand.",3
13498,Raj,17," Okay, that‰Ûªs a lot of money. The wise thing to do is invest it in something practical. Like a jet ski.",3
13499,Howard,17, Why do you want a jet ski?,3
13500,Raj,17, All the wealthy and beautiful people in movies ride Jet Skis. That can‰Ûªt just be a coincidence.,3
13501,Sheldon,17," We can‰Ûªt sell it. We have to keep it and love it and polish it, and only take it out occasionally when we go to the park and re-enact our favourite scenes from the movies.",3
13502,Howard,17, It‰Ûªs sad how great that sounds.,3
13503,Leonard,17," Guys, it‰Ûªs stolen. It should go back to Peter Jackson. He made the movies, it belongs to him.",3
13504,Howard,17, Fine. He can have it back as long as he promises to make me a hobbit in his next movie.,3
13505,Raj,17, There are no Jewish hobbits.,3
13506,Howard,17," Clearly, you‰Ûªve never been to my house for dinner on Rosh Hashanah.",3
13507,Leonard,17," We are not blackmailing Peter J‰Û_ All right, where‰Ûªs the ring?",3
13508,Sheldon,17, You mean my ring?,3
13509,Leonard,17, What are you doing?,3
13510,Sheldon,17," The ring was unguarded, it was just sitting on the table, anyone could have taken it. Proof? I did.",3
13511,Leonard,17, Give me that.,3
13512,Raj,17," Look, let‰Ûªs be reasonable. We all want to do different things with the ring, but your ideas are stupid, and I want a jet ski.",3
13513,Sheldon,17, I found it. The ring is mine. I don‰Ûªt understand why in this group I never get my way.,3
13514,Leonard,17, You always get your way.,3
13515,Sheldon,17, I‰Ûªll stipulate to that if you give me the ring.,3
13516,Penny,17," Hey, guys. Enjoying your food that I actually brought you instead of promising food, but bringing you a box of random crap?",3
13517,Leonard,17," Yeah, it‰Ûªs delicious, the sarcasm‰Ûªs a little stale, though. Hey, how about this? Until we figure out what to do with the ring, Penny holds on to it.",3
13518,Penny,17, What ring?,3
13519,Leonard,17, This ring.,3
13520,Sheldon,17, Looking for something?,3
13521,Leonard,17, Will you hold on to this for a couple of days?,3
13522,Penny,17, Why?,3
13523,Leonard,17," It‰Ûªs a prop from a movie, and we‰Ûªre kind of fighting over it.",3
13524,Penny,17," Okay, just to be clear, the first piece of jewellery my boyfriend gives me is a prop from a movie, and I don‰Ûªt even get to keep it?",3
13525,Howard,17," If you had gone out with me three years ago, by now, you‰Ûªd have my great Aunt Ida‰Ûªs brooch that she smuggled out of occupied Belgium in a cat.",3
13526,Leonard,17, How am I looking now?,3
13527,Scene,17," Penny and Leonard are asleep in Leonard‰Ûªs bed. Sheldon creeps in and tries to take the ring from round Penny‰Ûªs neck, but she turns over. He tries to make buzzing fly noises to get her to turn back, but she turns all the way the other way. He then uses an extender with a claw on the end to lif the ring from Penny‰Ûªs chest. As he tries to remove it, she wakes up, screams, and punches him in the face.",3
13528,Sheldon,17, Ow! You hit me! I‰Ûªm bleeding!,3
13529,Leonard,17, What was that?,3
13530,Penny,17, Sheldon tried to take the ring and I punched him.,3
13531,Leonard,17, That‰Ûªs my girl.,3
13532,Scene,17, The cafeteria.,3
13533,Howard,17," So, Sheldon, how‰Ûªs it feel to get beaten up by a girl?",3
13534,Sheldon,17,"åÊ It‰Ûªs not the first time. I have a twin sister whose assaults began in utero. If only I‰Ûªd had the presence of mind to reabsorb her, then I‰Ûªd have a mole with hair in it instead of a tedious yearly Christmas letter.",3
13535,Raj,17," Gentlemen, have you come to the realization that the only reasonable course of action is to sell the ring and divide the money?",3
13536,Leonard,17, No.,3
13537,Raj,17, I was afraid of that. (Opens his laptop to reveal an Indian looking man on a webcam.) Go ahead.,3
13538,Man on Screen,17," Greetings from Mumbai. I am Raj‰Ûªs attorney, Venkatesh Koothrappali.",3
13539,Raj,17, Also my cousin.,3
13540,Howard,17, You brought a lawyer?,3
13541,Venkatesh,17, Don‰Ûªt answer that. I‰Ûªll get straight to the point. My client‰Ûªs prepared to surrender any interest he has in the ring in exchange for two Kawasaki Jet Skis.,3
13542,Leonard,17, We‰Ûªre not giving him two Jet Skis.,3
13543,Venkatesh,17," Look, we‰Ûªre big boys, why don‰Ûªt we just cut to the chase and meet in the middle? One Kawasaki Jet Ski, done and done.",3
13544,Leonard,17, No Jet Skis.,3
13545,Venkatesh,17," All right, forget the Jet Skis.",3
13546,Raj,17, Forget the Jet Skis? That was our line in the sand! What happened to ‰ÛÏtear them a new one?‰Û,3
13547,Venkatesh,17, What can I say? They played hardball. We lost.,3
13548,Raj,17, You‰Ûªre useless.,3
13549,Venkatesh,17, I told you that when you hired me.,3
13550,Raj,17, I‰Ûªm signing off now.,3
13551,Venkatesh,17," Call your mother, she worries.",3
13552,Howard,17," Okay, just so you know, if we‰Ûªre bringing in cousins who are lawyers, prepare for shock and awe.",3
13553,Leonard,17," You know what? I am ending this. Penny didn‰Ûªt want to hold the ring anymore. She gave it to me, I have it. I‰Ûªm sending it back. Where‰Ûªs the ring?",3
13554,Sheldon,17, You mean this ring? Next time be aware of your surroundings while urinating in a public men‰Ûªs room.,3
13555,Leonard,17, Give me that.,3
13556,Sheldon,17," No, it‰Ûªs mine.",3
13557,Raj,17, It‰Ûªs all of ours. (They begin to struggle over the ring.),3
13558,Leonard,17," Okay, now, this is ridiculous!",3
13559,Howard,17, Then let go!,3
13560,Leonard,17," I‰Ûªm not letting go, you let go.",3
13561,Howard,17, I say this ring belongs to the last person who can hold on.,3
13562,Leonard,17, Fine. But can‰Ûªt we go home and start this?,3
13563,Raj,17, Sure. Let go of the ring.,3
13564,Leonard,17," All right, it starts now.",3
13565,Howard,17, You do realize there‰Ûªs a giant bug movie marathon tonight on the Syfy Channel. (They start to move away from the table while all still holding the ring.),3
13566,Raj,17," Wait, my laptop. (They go back for it.)",3
13567,Scene,17," The stairwell. The guys are coming up the stairs, all still holding the ring.",3
13568,Howard,17," You know, there‰Ûªs a point when this becomes idiotic.",3
13569,Leonard,17, And it wasn‰Ûªt when we were driving like this?,3
13570,Sheldon,17, I would advise the three of you that resistance is futile. I have endless patience. I once spent two-and-a-half hours on hold with Hewlett-Packard customer service just to complain about their customer service.,3
13571,Leonard,17, You want to talk about endless patience? Penny made me watch all five seasons of Sex and the City.,3
13572,Raj,17," There are six seasons, dude.",3
13573,Leonard,17," Oh, crap!",3
13574,Raj,17," No, no, no, the sixth season is great. We go to Paris with Carrie and get our heart broken, and then Mr. Big shows up, we don‰Ûªt know if we can trust him again. It‰Ûªs a wild ride.",3
13575,Leonard,17, Door. (Leonard tries to unlock the door and drops the keys.),3
13576,Raj,17," Okay, everybody, and plie. And relevae.",3
13577,Penny,17, Whatcha doin‰Ûª?,3
13578,Leonard,17," Last one holding the ring decides its fate. I know, it sounds silly.",3
13579,Penny,17," No, no, no, no, no, no, you are my boyfriend. Nothing you do is silly to me.",3
13580,Leonard,17, Thank you.,3
13581,Penny,17," FYI, this is a bag from Victoria‰Ûªs Secret.",3
13582,Leonard,17, I‰Ûªm out.,3
13583,Scene,17, The apartment. The three guys are still holding the ring. Howard is on the phone. ,3
13584,Howard,17," I‰Ûªm sorry, Ma, I have to stay late at the office.",3
13585,Raj,17," No, he‰Ûªs doesn‰Ûªt! He‰Ûªs lying to you!",3
13586,Howard,17, Will you be quiet?,3
13587,Raj,17," Well, if you want privacy let go of the ring. I‰Ûªm so glad we came to this gentile strip club! Howard, here‰Ûªs more bacon to tuck into the shiksa‰Ûªs G-string!",3
13588,Howard,17, I‰Ûªll call you back.,3
13589,Raj,17," I think it‰Ûªs lovely you call your mommy and let her know you‰Ûªre going to be late for dinner. From what I know about these things, if a woman doesn‰Ûªt breast-feed on time, it‰Ûªs very uncomfortable for her boobies.",3
13590,Howard,17, Don‰Ûªt you talk about my mother‰Ûªs boobies!,3
13591,Raj,17," If you‰Ûªre offended, let go of the ring and go on home to your mother‰Ûªs boobies.",3
13592,Sheldon,17," Excellent, excellent. Tire each other out, the ring will be mine. Howard, why don‰Ûªt you go after Raj‰Ûªs mother?",3
13593,Raj,17, Why don‰Ûªt we go after your mother?,3
13594,Sheldon,17," Go ahead. I have no illusions about my mother. She is a kind, loving, religiously fanatical right-wing Texan with a slightly out-of-scale head and a mild Dr. Pepper addiction. Anything you‰Ûªd like to add?",3
13595,Howard,17, That‰Ûªs not gonna Better pull out the big gun.,3
13596,Raj,17, You‰Ûªre right. Let‰Ûªs talk about your grandmother.,3
13597,Sheldon,17, No! I call no Meemaws.,3
13598,Raj,17, Think about this. The only way your mother was born was your Meemaw had sex.,3
13599,Sheldon,17, I don‰Ûªt want to hear this.,3
13600,Howard,17, Then let go of the ring and walk away.,3
13601,Sheldon,17, Never.,3
13602,Howard,17, All right. I‰Ûªll bet your Meemaw didn‰Ûªt just have sex to have your mother. I bet she had sex because she liked it.,3
13603,Sheldon,17, Stop it!,3
13604,Raj,17," Yeah, Meemaw did the nasty.",3
13605,Sheldon,17, I said stop it!,3
13606,Howard,17, We‰Ûªre getting to him.,3
13607,Sheldon,17, Waterfalls!,3
13608,Raj,17, What?,3
13609,Sheldon,17, Waterfalls. Crashing waves. Babbling brooks.,3
13610,Howard,17, What are you doing?,3
13611,Sheldon,17, Subliminal messaging. I‰Ûªm going to make you want to pee. Dripping faucets. Leaky gutter. Peeing.,3
13612,Raj,17," It‰Ûªs, it‰Ûªs not working, dude.",3
13613,Sheldon,17," Oh-ho-ho, it‰Ûªs working all right. I have to pee.",3
13614,Raj,17, Then let go of the ring and go.,3
13615,Howard,17," No, actually, I wouldn‰Ûªt mind going, too.",3
13616,Raj,17," Fine. Um, on the count of three. One, two‰Û_",3
13617,Sheldon,17," Wait, just to clarify. When you get to three, do we stand up or do we pee?",3
13618,Howard,17, We stand up.,3
13619,Sheldon,17, Excellent choice.,3
13620,Raj,17, Three.,3
13621,Howard,17, Something tells me this was a bad day to wear suede shoes.,3
13622,Scene,17," Sometime later. The guys are on the settee. Howard is seen asleep, he is not holding the ring. The camera pans along to where Sheldon and Raj still hold the ring. Raj, also asleep, lets go and cuddles up to Howard. ",3
13623,Sheldon,17," I‰Ûªve done it! I‰Ûªve won! The ring is mine! It‰Ûªs mine! (He runs to the bathroom) We‰Ûªre going to clean it up and make it pretty. My own. My love. My precious. (He looks in the mirror and has turned into golem. He screams and wakes up, still on the settee.) Where‰Ûªs the ring?",3
13624,Leonard,17, It‰Ûªs in a FedEx box on its way back to where it came from.,3
13625,Raj,17, The fires of Mount Doom?,3
13626,Leonard,17, Peter Jackson‰Ûªs office in New Zealand. It wasn‰Ûªt ours.,3
13627,Howard,17, You quit the game! You had no right to take it.,3
13628,Leonard,17," I came in here, you guys were all sleeping. The ring was on the floor. No one was touching it.",3
13629,Raj,17," Well, so then we start the game over until there‰Ûªs a winner.",3
13630,Leonard,17," There wasn‰Ûªt ever going to be a winner. There was going to be a selfish, petty person with a ring and three people who used to be his friend. Is that really what you guys want? ‰Û÷Cause if it is, fine, I don‰Ûªt want anything to do with you. And I don‰Ûªt know what happened in that bathroom, but I am not cleaning it up! (Goes to his bedroom. Takes a box from under his bed. Takes out the ring.) My precious.",3
13631,Scene,17, Leonard and Penny are asleep in Leonard‰Ûªs bed. The extender and claw reaches across and pulls down the sheet revealing the ring on a chain round Leonard‰Ûªs neck.,3
13632,Sheldon,17, I knew it. Give us the precious!,3
13633,Leonard,17, NEVER!,3
13634,Penny,17," Ugh, gotta go back to dating dumb guys from the gym.",3
13635,Scene,18, The university cafeteria.,3
13636,Raj,18," Okay in Avatar when they have sex in Pandora they hook up their ponytails, so we know their ponytails are like their junk.",3
13637,Howard,18," Yeah, so?",3
13638,Raj,18," So, when they ride horses and fly on the birds, they also use their ponytails.",3
13639,Howard,18, What‰Ûªs your point?,3
13640,Raj,18," My point is, if I were a horse or a bird, I‰Ûªd be very nervous around James Cameron.",3
13641,Sheldon,18," It amazes me how you constantly obsess over fictional details when there are more important things in the real world to worry about. For example, why wasn‰Ûªt William Shatner in the new Star Trek movie?",3
13642,Leonard,18," Hey, Sheldon, I was up in the administration office, and I happened to overhear the name of the winner of this year‰Ûªs Chancellor‰Ûªs Award for Science.",3
13643,Sheldon,18," And you want to rub my nose in the fact that my contributions are being overlooked again? I am the William Shatner of theoretical physics. All right, I‰Ûªll play. What self-important, preening fraud are they honouring this year?",3
13644,Leonard,18," Oh, I‰Ûªm so glad you asked it like that. You.",3
13645,Sheldon,18, I won?,3
13646,Leonard,18, You won.,3
13647,Sheldon,18," I won! This is astonishing. Not that I won the award, no one deserves it more. Actually, I guess I misspoke. It‰Ûªs not astonishing, more like inevitable. I‰Ûªm not sure what to do first. Maybe I should call my mother. Wait! I know, I‰Ûªm going to conduct an interview with myself and post it online.",3
13648,Raj,18," Well, good for him.",3
13649,Howard,18," Yeah, the one thing the William Shatner of theoretical physics needed was an ego boost.",3
13650,Scene,18, The apartment. The guys are watching Avatar in 3D. All are wearing 3D glasses except Raj.,3
13651,Howard,18, Didn‰Ûªt it look like that spear was going to go right through your skull?,3
13652,Raj,18, No.,3
13653,Leonard,18," Hey, you didn‰Ûªt want a Slurpee at 7-Eleven, you don‰Ûªt get glasses.",3
13654,Sheldon (phone rings),18," Oh, that will be another congratulatory call for me. Uh, mute, please.",3
13655,Howard,18," Uh, hang on, flaming arrow.",3
13656,Sheldon,18," Hello? Oh, Chancellor Morton, how are you, sir? Yes, I was expecting your call (aside) three years ago. I see. Wait. What happens if I choose not to give a speech? Uh-huh. And if I don‰Ûªt want to forfeit the award? Well, you‰Ûªve got that tied up in a neat little bow. All right. Thank you. (Hangs up) Problem.",3
13657,Leonard,18, What?,3
13658,Sheldon,18, They expect me to give a speech at the banquet. I can‰Ûªt give a speech.,3
13659,Howard,18," Well, no, you‰Ûªre mistaken. You give speeches all the time. What you can‰Ûªt do is shut up.",3
13660,Raj,18," Yeah, before the movie, you did 20 minutes on why guacamole turns brown. It turned brown while you were talking.",3
13661,Sheldon,18, I am perfectly comfortable speaking to small groups. I cannot speak to large crowds.,3
13662,Leonard,18," What, to you, is a large crowd?",3
13663,Sheldon,18, Any group big enough to trample me to death. General rule of thumb is 36 adults or 70 children.,3
13664,Penny,18," Sheldon, congratulations. Brought you cheesecake from work. You know, ‰Ûªcause of your award, not because a busboy sneezed on it.",3
13665,Sheldon,18, I‰Ûªm not accepting the award.,3
13666,Penny,18, Why not?,3
13667,Howard,18, Turns out the great Sheldon Cooper has stage fright.,3
13668,Penny,18," That‰Ûªs no reason to back out. You know, I once got a pretty big honour in high school, and I was terrified about appearing in front of a big crowd, but I went through with it, and you know what? The world looked pretty darn good sitting on a haystack in the back of a Ford F-150 as a member of the Corn Queen‰Ûªs court.",3
13669,Sheldon,18," Thank you. Yeah, I‰Ûªll bear that in mind if I‰Ûªm ever nominated for the Hillbilly Peace Prize.",3
13670,Leonard,18," Sheldon, you‰Ûªre being ridiculous.",3
13671,Sheldon,18, Am I? Let me tell you a story.,3
13672,Howard,18, Where‰Ûªs 70 children when you need ‰Û÷em?,3
13673,Sheldon,18, I was 14 and graduating summa cum laude from college. Summa cum laude is Latin for with highest honours.,3
13674,Penny,18, I just love how you always skip over the part where no one asks.,3
13675,Sheldon,18," I was valedictorian and expected to give an address. Even now, I can remember that moment when I walked up to the podium and looked out at the crowd. There must have been thousands of people. My heart started pounding in my chest. I began to hyperventilate. My vision became blurry, and before I knew it‰Û_ oh, dear. (He faints.)",3
13676,Penny,18," Oh, my God.",3
13677,Leonard,18," Sheldon? Sheldon, are you okay?",3
13678,Sheldon,18, Don‰Ûªt trample me.,3
13679,Scene,18, The stairwell. Sheldon is on the phone.,3
13680,Sheldon,18," Come on, Mother, you know why I can‰Ûªt accept the award. With all due respect, I don‰Ûªt think praying will help. No, I have not heard the song, Jesus, Take the Wheel. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, you don‰Ûªt need to start singing it. Yes, I‰Ûªll buy it on the iTunes, Mother. Good-bye, Mother. (Enters apartment. The others are sitting as if waiting for him.) Hello.",3
13681,Leonard,18," Sit down, we want to talk to you.",3
13682,Sheldon,18, Am I in trouble? Did my mother call you?,3
13683,Penny,18, Just sit.,3
13684,Leonard,18, We think we can help you with your stage fright.,3
13685,Sheldon,18," Oh, I doubt that. I haven‰Ûªt figured out a way, and I‰Ûªm much smarter than all of you.",3
13686,Penny,18," Yes, but you‰Ûªre not smarter than all of us put together.",3
13687,Sheldon,18," Oh, I‰Ûªm sorry, that is what I meant.",3
13688,Penny,18," Okay, your problem is, you‰Ûªre trying to do this all by yourself.",3
13689,Leonard,18," We can help you. We can be your team. Like, uh, Professor Xavier and his X-Men.",3
13690,Sheldon,18, I do like the X-Men.,3
13691,Penny,18, Did I see X-Men?,3
13692,Leonard,18," Yeah, we watched it last week. You said you liked it.",3
13693,Penny,18," Oh. I say a lot of things, sweetie. So, how about it, Sheldon?",3
13694,Sheldon,18," I don‰Ûªt know. If you‰Ûªre my X-Men, what are your powers?",3
13695,Penny,18," Okay. Well, I am going to take you shopping, get you a nice suit. Might give you more confidence.",3
13696,Sheldon,18," That‰Ûªs not exactly a mutation that would get you into Xavier‰Ûªs School for Gifted Youngsters, but go on. Leonard?",3
13697,Leonard,18, I thought I could try to analyze you and get to the root of your anxiety.,3
13698,Sheldon,18, What qualifies you to attempt to understand my mind?,3
13699,Leonard,18," My mother is a highly regarded psychiatrist, and I‰Ûªve been in therapy ever since she accused me of breast-feeding co-dependently.",3
13700,Howard,18," Raj says he can teach you, what did you call it? I don‰Ûªt know, some Indian meditation crap.",3
13701,Sheldon,18," I see. Well, I assume, since the rest of you have set the bar so low, you‰Ûªre saving the most impressive contribution for last. Go ahead, Howard. Dazzle me.",3
13702,Howard,18," My power is the ability to pretend like I give a damn about your piddly-ass problems. And that‰Ûªs 24-7, buddy.",3
13703,Sheldon,18, And I appreciate the pretence.,3
13704,Penny,18," So, what do you say, Sheldon? Are we your X-Men?",3
13705,Sheldon,18," No. The X-Men were named for the X in Charles Xavier. Since I am Sheldon Cooper, you will be my C-Men.",3
13706,Howard,18," Oh, that‰Ûªs not a good name.",3
13707,Scene,18, The apartment. Raj is lighting candles. Indian music is playing.,3
13708,Raj,18," Okay, Sheldon. I‰Ûªm going to be leading you through a series of meditation exercises. These methods come from the ancient gurus of India and have helped me overcome my own fears.",3
13709,Sheldon,18," And yet, you can‰Ûªt speak to women.",3
13710,Raj,18," True, but thanks to meditation, I am able to stay in the same room with them without urinating. Now, close your eyes.",3
13711,Sheldon,18," Okay, but don‰Ûªt punch me.",3
13712,Raj,18, What?,3
13713,Sheldon,18," When I was little, my sister would say to me, close your eyes, you‰Ûªll get a surprise, and then she‰Ûªd punch me.",3
13714,Raj,18, I‰Ûªm not going to punch you.,3
13715,Sheldon,18, That‰Ûªs what my sister used to say.,3
13716,Raj,18, Do you want to do this or not?,3
13717,Sheldon,18, I‰Ûªm sorry. Proceed.,3
13718,Raj,18, All right. Imagine yourself in the one place you feel most at home. Where is that?,3
13719,Sheldon,18," Sim City. More specifically, the Sim City I designed, Sheldonopolis.",3
13720,Raj,18," Okay, you‰Ûªre in Sheldonopolis.",3
13721,Sheldon,18," Where exactly? Sheldon Square? Sheldon Towers? Sheldon Stadium, home of the Fighting Sheldons?",3
13722,Raj,18, Whatever you like.,3
13723,Sheldon,18, I thought this was supposed to be a guided meditation.,3
13724,Raj,18, Fine. You‰Ûªre in Sheldon Square.,3
13725,Sheldon,18, Really? This time of year? It‰Ûªs a bit nippy.,3
13726,Raj,18," Then, put on a sweater.",3
13727,Sheldon,18, Suppose I could run downtown and pick up something at Shel-Mart.,3
13728,Raj,18," Yeah, whatever. Just go buy a sweater.",3
13729,Sheldon,18," You know, the nice thing about Shel-Mart is I own it, so I get a 15% discount.",3
13730,Raj,18, You own the damn thing. Just take a freaking sweater!,3
13731,Sheldon,18," Look, I didn‰Ûªt turn a profit last quarter by taking product off the shelves willy-nilly.",3
13732,Raj,18," All right. You‰Ûªve paid for a sweater, and you‰Ûªre in Sheldon Square.",3
13733,Sheldon,18," Hang on. It‰Ûªs a cardigan. I have to button it. Oh, no.",3
13734,Raj,18, What now?,3
13735,Sheldon,18," A Godzilla-like monster is approaching the city. I have to get my people to safety. People of Sheldonopolis, this is your mayor. Follow me. If the children can‰Ûªt run, leave them behind. Oh, the simulated horror! (Sound of door slamming) Raj? Just as I suspected. Meditation is nothing but hokum.",3
13736,Scene,18, A clothing store.,3
13737,Sheldon,18, I question your premise. How is a new suit going to prevent me from passing out in front of a ballroom full of people?,3
13738,Penny,18," It‰Ûªll give you confidence. You know, sometimes when I‰Ûªm feeling all stressed out about something, I go out and buy a cute top or a fun skirt and I have a whole new outlook on life.",3
13739,Sheldon,18, Don‰Ûªt you eventually realize you‰Ûªre just the same stressed out person in a cute top or a fun skirt?,3
13740,Penny,18," Yeah, that‰Ûªs when I buy shoes. Now, let‰Ûªs see what we‰Ûªve got. Ooh! This is nice.",3
13741,Sheldon,18, It‰Ûªs only one colour.,3
13742,Penny,18," Yeah, so?",3
13743,Sheldon,18, That‰Ûªs a lot of money for only one colour.,3
13744,Penny,18, Fine. Why don‰Ûªt you pick out what you like.,3
13745,Sheldon,18, Hmm. (Cut to Sheldon exiting changing room in a loud check suit). This is pretty sharp.,3
13746,Penny,18," No, you‰Ûªre wrong.",3
13747,Sheldon (now in a sparkly green suit with rhinestones),18," This is great. I had a suit like this when I was six. (Cut to Sheldon exiting in a white dinner suit with tails) Okay, I think we have a winner.",3
13748,Penny,18, Where the hell d‰Ûªyou find that?,3
13749,Sheldon,18, In the prom department.,3
13750,Penny,18, It‰Ûªs ridiculous.,3
13751,Sheldon,18, Says the former member of the Corn Queen‰Ûªs Court.,3
13752,Penny,18, Please just try this one on.,3
13753,Sheldon,18, Okay. But anything I put on now is only going to suffer in comparison. (Goes into changing room. Comes out in black suit looking terrific.) This is absurd. I look like a clown.,3
13754,Scene,18, The apartment.,3
13755,Leonard,18," So, Sheldon, how you doing?",3
13756,Sheldon,18," That‰Ûªs how you start a psychotherapy session? How am I doing? I was promised a riverboat journey into the jungles of my subconscious. Instead, I get the same question I hear from the lady who slices my bologna at Ralph‰Ûªs.",3
13757,Leonard,18," I‰Ûªm sorry, I‰Ûªll start again.",3
13758,Sheldon,18, Would it be helpful to you if I told you about my dreams?,3
13759,Leonard,18," Um, I don‰Ûªt know, maybe.",3
13760,Sheldon,18," I recently had a dream that I was a giant. But everything around me was to scale, so it all looked normal.",3
13761,Leonard,18, How did you know you were a giant if everything was to scale?,3
13762,Sheldon,18, I was wearing size a million pants.,3
13763,Leonard,18, Why don‰Ûªt we just talk?,3
13764,Sheldon,18," Ah, the talking cure. Classical Freudian, good choice. If it will help speed things along, uh, my answers to the standard Rorschach ink blot test are A, a bat, B, a bat, C, a bat, and D, my father killing my mother with a hypodermic needle.",3
13765,Leonard,18," Why don‰Ûªt I just start? Sometimes people have trouble accepting accolades if, on a subconscious level, they don‰Ûªt feel they deserve them. Do you think maybe that‰Ûªs what‰Ûªs happening here?",3
13766,Sheldon,18," Really, Leonard? You‰Ûªre just going to try to recycle Adler‰Ûªs doctrine of the inferiority complex? I could probably get that from the woman at Ralph‰Ûªs. And she‰Ûªd let me taste some pieces of cheese for free.",3
13767,Leonard,18," But it could be part of your problem. Let me give you an example. When I was eight, I won a ribbon at the science fair for my project, ‰ÛÏDo Lima Beans Grow Better to Classical Music.‰Û But my mother pointed out that it was just a rehash of my brother‰Ûªs earlier ‰ÛÏDo Lima Beans Grow Worse to Rock ‰Û÷n‰Ûª Roll.‰Û I felt so guilty, I gave the ribbon back.",3
13768,Sheldon,18, And how did that make you feel?,3
13769,Leonard,18, Terrible. I worked really hard on that project. I stayed up all night singing the clown‰Ûªs aria from Pagliacci to a lima bean sprout.,3
13770,Sheldon,18, Go on.,3
13771,Leonard,18, It wasn‰Ûªt my fault. I had never seen my brother‰Ûªs project. And my mother could‰Ûªve told me before instead of at the ceremony in front of everyone.,3
13772,Sheldon,18," So, I hear you saying you‰Ûªre angry with your mother.",3
13773,Leonard,18," Damn right, I‰Ûªm angry with my mother. For God‰Ûªs sake, I was eight years old. She humiliated me. That‰Ûªs when the bed-wetting started again.",3
13774,Sheldon,18," Thank you, Leonard.",3
13775,Leonard,18, For what?,3
13776,Sheldon,18," If someone as damaged as you can find his way to crawl out of bed each morning, I think I can face a simple award ceremony.",3
13777,Leonard,18," Wait, that‰Ûªs it? I thought we had a whole hour!",3
13778,Scene,18, The award ceremony.,3
13779,Leonard,18," Good evening, ladies and gentlemen. My name is Dr. Leonard Hofstadter, and it is my very great honour to introduce the winner of this year‰Ûªs Chancellor‰Ûªs award for Science and my good friend, Dr. Sheldon Cooper. But before I do, I‰Ûªd like to share with you a letter from Sheldon‰Ûªs mother, who couldn‰Ûªt be here tonight. Isn‰Ûªt that nice? His mother sent him a letter. She‰Ûªs proud of him. I wonder what that feels like. Dear Shelly. That‰Ûªs what she calls him. Shelly, it‰Ûªs a pet name. You know what my mother‰Ûªs pet name for me is? Leonard. But I digress. Dear Shelly. I am so proud of‰Û_ (continues as background noise)",3
13780,Sheldon,18," Oh, dear.",3
13781,Penny,18, What‰Ûªs the matter?,3
13782,Sheldon,18, I‰Ûªm getting dizzy.,3
13783,Raj,18, Don‰Ûªt worry. You‰Ûªre surrounded by your C-Men.,3
13784,Sheldon,18, I can‰Ûªt do this. I‰Ûªm going to faint.,3
13785,Penny,18," Here, drink this. It‰Ûªll relax you.",3
13786,Sheldon,18, Alcohol? I don‰Ûªt drink alcohol.,3
13787,Penny,18," Fine, faint.",3
13788,Sheldon,18," I don‰Ûªt feel different, this alcohol‰Ûªs defective.",3
13789,Penny,18," Here, see if this one works.",3
13790,Leonard (still talking),18," First of all, the projects were totally different. I was showing that classical music nurtures lima beans and makes them grow, but my mother didn‰Ûªt hear me. If you‰Ûªd like to look at the relationship between nurturing and growth, I‰Ûªd like to point out that my brother is eight inches taller than me.",3
13791,Sheldon,18, I‰Ûªm ready.,3
13792,Leonard,18," Oh, right. Ladies and gentlemen, our guest of honour, Dr. Sheldon Cooper.",3
13793,Sheldon,18," Thanks, shorty,I‰Ûªll take it from here. All right, you people ready to have some fun? You have a basic understanding of differential calculus and at least one year of algebraic topology? Well, then here come the jokes. Why did the chicken cross the Mobius strip? To get to the same side, bazinga! All right, a neutron walks into a bar and asks, how much for a drink? The bartender says, for you, no charge. Hello? I know you‰Ûªre out there. I can hear you metabolizing oxygen and expelling carbon dioxide. Looks like we have some academic dignitaries in the audience. Dr. Randall from the geology department, only man who‰Ûªs happy when they take his work for granite. Ba-da cha! I kid the geologists, of course, but it‰Ûªs only ‰Ûªcause I have no respect for the field. Let‰Ûªs get serious for a moment. Why are we all here? ‰Û÷Cause we‰Ûªre scientists. And what do scientists study? The universe. And what‰Ûªs the universe made of? I am so glad you asked. (Singing) There‰Ûªs antimony, arsenic, aluminium, selenium, and hydrogen and oxygen and nitrogen and rhenium, and nickel, neodymium,",3
13794,Scene,18, The apartment.,3
13795,Sheldon,18," Penny, Leonard. Would you be able to answer some questions I‰Ûªm having about the events of last night?",3
13796,Penny,18, Sure.,3
13797,Sheldon,18," Question one, where are my pants?",3
13798,Leonard,18, You might want to check YouTube.,3
13799,Sheldon,18, What do I search?,3
13800,Leonard,18, It‰Ûªs already loaded. Just hit play.,3
13801,On-screen Sheldon,18," All right, people, let‰Ûªs get down to the math. It is only three dimensional thinking that limits our imagination. Can I take my pants off over my head? Of course not. My body‰Ûªs in the way. But if we had access to higher dimensions, we could move our pants around our bodies through the fourth dimension and our days of dropping trousers would be over.",3
13802,Sheldon,18," Oh, Lord, this couldn‰Ûªt be any more humiliating.",3
13803,Leonard,18," Uh-uh, give it a minute.",3
13804,On-screen Sheldon,18," Now, for the astronomers in the audience, get ready to see the dark side of the moon. And here‰Ûªs Uranus.",3
13805,Scene,19, Leonard and Penny are in Penny‰Ûªs bed.,3
13806,Penny,19, Having a little trouble catching your breath there?,3
13807,Leonard,19," No, no, I‰Ûªm good. If my P.E. teachers had told me this is what I was training for, I would have tried a lot harder.",3
13808,Penny,19, Do or do not. There is no try.,3
13809,Leonard,19, Did you just quote Star Wars?,3
13810,Penny,19, I believe I quoted Empire Strikes Back.,3
13811,Leonard,19," Oh, my God. I‰Ûªm lying in bed with a beautiful woman who can quote Yoda. I love you, Penny.",3
13812,Penny,19, Oh. Oh. Thank you.,3
13813,Leonard,19, You‰Ûªre welcome. I just wanted to put that out there.,3
13814,Penny,19," Oh, yeah, no, I, I‰Ûªm, I‰Ûªm glad.",3
13815,Leonard,19, Good. Glad is good.,3
13816,Penny,19," Yeah. Yeah. No, no. Um. So, it‰Ûªs getting pretty late. We should probably go to sleep.",3
13817,Leonard,19, Yeah.,3
13818,Penny,19, Okay.,3
13819,Leonard,19, Yeah.,3
13820,Penny,19, Hmm.,3
13821,Leonard,19," Yeah, probably.",3
13822,Penny,19," Okay, good night, sweetie.",3
13823,Leonard,19, Good night.,3
13824,Scene,19, The apartment.,3
13825,Howard,19," Hey, Leonard, where do you come down on giant ants?",3
13826,Raj,19," Sheldon says impossible. Howard and I say not only possible, but as a mode of transportation, way cooler than a Batmobile.",3
13827,Sheldon,19," You are ignoring the square-cube law. The giant ant would be crushed under the weight of its own exoskeleton. And for the record, the appropriate ranking of cool modes of transportation is jet pack, hoverboard, transporter, Batmobile, and then giant ant.",3
13828,Leonard,19, Seriously? You have nothing better to do than sit around and discuss the possibility of giant ants?,3
13829,Howard,19, What‰Ûªs with him?,3
13830,Sheldon,19, Perhaps he‰Ûªs at a sensitive point in his monthly cycle.,3
13831,Howard,19, Are you saying he‰Ûªs man-struating?,3
13832,Sheldon,19," Not literally. But as far back as the 17th century, scientists observed a 33-day fluctuation in men‰Ûªs hormone levels.",3
13833,Raj,19, Interesting. That might explain my weepy days in the middle of the month. You know what I‰Ûªm talking about.,3
13834,Scene,19, The comic book store.,3
13835,Howard,19," Okay, forget giant ants. How about giant rabbits?",3
13836,Raj,19," Big or small, I don‰Ûªt like rabbits. They always look like they‰Ûªre about to say something, but they never do.",3
13837,Sheldon,19," Rabbits do have a respiratory system that would support great size. And on a side note, they are one of the few mammals whose scrotum is in front of the penis.",3
13838,Raj,19, Maybe that‰Ûªs what they want to talk about.,3
13839,Howard,19," Leonard, where do you stand on giant rabbits and scrotal position?",3
13840,Leonard,19, I honestly don‰Ûªt care.,3
13841,Raj,19," Really? Because every time we‰Ûªve talked about unusual animal genitals, you‰Ûªve always had some pretty strong and controversial opinions.",3
13842,Leonard,19, What do you want from me? I just don‰Ûªt give a rat‰Ûªs ass.,3
13843,Howard,19, Would that be a giant rat‰Ûªs ass?,3
13844,Sheldon,19," For the record, giant rats are possible.",3
13845,Leonard,19, Can we please talk about something else? Maybe something vaguely related to life as we know it on this planet?,3
13846,Howard,19," Okay, how about this for a topic, why is Leonard being a giant douche? Assuming giant douches are possible.",3
13847,Sheldon,19, Of course they are. Leonard‰Ûªs being one.,3
13848,Raj,19, Maybe he‰Ûªs having a lover‰Ûªs spat with Penny.,3
13849,Leonard,19," No, there was no spat.",3
13850,Howard,19," Oh, but something happened.",3
13851,Leonard,19, I don‰Ûªt want to talk about it.,3
13852,Sheldon,19, But I sense you‰Ûªre going to and I don‰Ûªt want to hear about it. Excuse me.,3
13853,Howard,19," What‰Ûªd you do, Romeo? You pour maple syrup all over your body and ask her if she was in the mood for a short stack?",3
13854,Raj,19," Did you think it would be funny to put on a pair of her panties and jump around, but it wound up just creeping her out?",3
13855,Leonard,19, What? No.,3
13856,Raj,19," I‰Ûªm just asking, dude. It happens.",3
13857,Stuart,19, You guys still on for bowling tonight?,3
13858,Sheldon,19," Oh, yes. In fact, I‰Ûªve prepared some trash talk for the occasion. You bowl like your mama. Unless, of course, she bowls well. In which case, you bowl nothing like her.",3
13859,Stuart,19, Oh. Ouch.,3
13860,Sheldon,19, That is what is referred to as a burn on you.,3
13861,Howard,19, Did you ask her to start waxing?,3
13862,Leonard,19, No.,3
13863,Raj,19, Did you start waxing?,3
13864,Leonard,19, No.,3
13865,Howard,19," While making love, did you accidentally spank your own ass and cry out Mommy?",3
13866,Leonard,19, I‰Ûªm walking away from you now.,3
13867,Howard,19, That wasn‰Ûªt a no.,3
13868,Raj,19," Yeah, I think we‰Ûªre getting close.",3
13869,Scene,19, The stairwell.,3
13870,Howard,19, Did you take a Benadryl and fall asleep while pleasuring her? Because you can die that way.,3
13871,Raj,19," Oh, that would be a good way to go.",3
13872,Penny,19, Hi.,3
13873,Leonard,19," Oh, hey.",3
13874,Sheldon,19," Good, Penny, reminder, bowling tonight at seven o‰Ûªclock.",3
13875,Penny,19," Oh, right, bowling.",3
13876,Leonard,19, You don‰Ûªt have to come if you don‰Ûªt want to.,3
13877,Penny,19," No, no, it‰Ûªs okay. I mean, let‰Ûªs face it, you guys would get creamed without me.",3
13878,Sheldon,19," We would indeed. In this particular case, your lack of femininity works to our advantage.",3
13879,Penny,19," It‰Ûªs always nice chatting with you, Sheldon.",3
13880,Sheldon,19, Sarcasm?,3
13881,Penny,19, Thinly veiled contempt.,3
13882,Sheldon,19," Remember, seven o‰Ûªclock.",3
13883,Penny,19, Got it.,3
13884,Sheldon,19, Pacific Daylight time!,3
13885,Penny,19, Bite me!,3
13886,Sheldon,19, Please reserve that butch spirit for the lanes.,3
13887,Scene,19, The bowling alley.,3
13888,Howard,19, I thought you were bringing your own bowling shoes.,3
13889,Sheldon,19, These are my own bowling shoes.,3
13890,Howard,19, Then what‰Ûªs with the disinfectant?,3
13891,Sheldon,19, I know where my feet have been.,3
13892,Stuart,19," Hey, Penny! And you guys. Albino Bob couldn‰Ûªt make it, so I brought a substitute. I believe some of you know Wil Wheaton.",3
13893,Wil,19," Hi, Sheldon. How‰Ûªs it going?",3
13894,Sheldon,19," Well, well, well. If it isn‰Ûªt Wil Wheaton, the Green Goblin to my Spider-Man, the Pope Paul the fifth to my Galileo, the Internet Explorer to my Firefox.",3
13895,Wil,19," You‰Ûªre not still carrying a grudge because I beat you at that card tournament, are you?",3
13896,Sheldon,19," I‰Ûªm the proud owner of Wil Wheaton stinks dot com, dot net, and dot org. What does that tell you?",3
13897,Wil,19, It tells me that I am living rent-free right here (pointing at Sheldon‰Ûªs head). You ready to bowl?,3
13898,Sheldon,19," Oh, I‰Ûªm ready. I don‰Ûªt know if Stuart told you what you‰Ûªre up against tonight, but before you stands the co-captain of the East Texas Christian Youth Holy Roller Bowling League championship team. Seven to twelve year-old division. Also, Penny‰Ûªs pretty good.",3
13899,Wil,19, Great. Then it‰Ûªs on.,3
13900,Sheldon,19," Oh, foolish Wil Wheaton, it was never off.",3
13901,Wil,19, Yes!,3
13902,Sheldon,19," A common spare. The Miss Congeniality of the bowling pageant. Before you jump on Twitter to tout your modest accomplishment, watch how it‰Ûªs really done. I am the ball. My thoughts are its thoughts. Its holes are my holes. (Gets a strike) Yes. Tweet that, Tweety Bird.",3
13903,Howard,19," Hey, I just wanted to tell you I‰Ûªm a big fan.",3
13904,Wil,19," Oh, thanks.",3
13905,Howard,19," I‰Ûªm sure you‰Ûªre probably sick of Star Trek questions, but, Whoopi Goldberg, you ever hit that?",3
13906,Raj,19," Ah, beer. The magic elixir that can turn this poor, shy Indian boy into the life of the party. Oh, yeah.",3
13907,Leonard,19, Chilli cheese fry?,3
13908,Penny,19, Yes. I love chilli cheese fries.,3
13909,Leonard,19, Really? You love them?,3
13910,Penny,19," Yeah, why?",3
13911,Leonard,19, No reason. I‰Ûªm just glad to hear you‰Ûªre comfortable saying you love something.,3
13912,Penny,19, Do you really want to get into this right now?,3
13913,Leonard,19, Get into what? Why wouldn‰Ûªt you love the chilli cheese fries? They‰Ûªve been in your life a long time. They make you happy. They deserve to know.,3
13914,Penny,19," Okay, look, you just caught me by surprise last night. I didn‰Ûªt know what to say.",3
13915,Leonard,19," Okay, well, now you‰Ûªve had some time to think about it. So, what do you want to say?",3
13916,Penny,19, I‰Ûªm not sure.,3
13917,Leonard,19, How can you not be sure?,3
13918,Penny,19," Okay, this isn‰Ûªt the place to have this conversation.",3
13919,Leonard,19," No, the place to have the conversation was in bed after I said, I love you, and you said, Thank you, good night.",3
13920,Penny,19," Don‰Ûªt push it, Leonard.",3
13921,Leonard,19, I am not pushing anything.,3
13922,Penny,19, You are. You don‰Ûªt get to decide when I‰Ûªm ready to say I love you!,3
13923,Raj,19," Ah, the premature I love you.",3
13924,Howard,19, I guessed premature. Does that count?,3
13925,Scene,19, Penny‰Ûªs apartment door.,3
13926,Sheldon,19," (Knock, knock, knock) Penny, (knock, knock, knock) Penny, (knock, knock, knock) Penny.",3
13927,Penny,19, What?,3
13928,Sheldon,19, This is for you.,3
13929,Penny,19, Ice cream?,3
13930,Sheldon,19," I‰Ûªve been familiarizing myself with female emotional crises by studying the comic strip Cathy. When she‰Ûªs upset, she says Ach and eats ice cream.",3
13931,Penny,19," Um, Ach.",3
13932,Sheldon,19," If you were a cat, I would have brought you a lasagna.",3
13933,Penny,19, Did Leonard send you over here?,3
13934,Sheldon,19," No, we haven‰Ûªt spoken since your abrupt departure last night caused us to forfeit to Stuart and his dastardly ringer Wil Wheaton.",3
13935,Penny,19," Yeah, I‰Ûªm sorry about that.",3
13936,Sheldon,19, I‰Ûªm not too proud to admit that I cried myself to sleep.,3
13937,Penny,19," Again, I‰Ûªm sorry.",3
13938,Sheldon,19, And let me tell you sleep did not come easily with Leonard in the next room singing along with Alanis Morrisette.,3
13939,Penny,19, You‰Ûªre kidding.,3
13940,Sheldon,19, No. Clearly another woman in dire need of ice cream.,3
13941,Penny,19," All right, Sheldon, what part of this is supposed to make me feel better?",3
13942,Sheldon,19, The part where I tell you I‰Ûªve engineered a rematch with Stuart‰Ûªs team for tonight.,3
13943,Penny,19," Oh, honey, I don‰Ûªt know. Things are a little weird with Leonard right now.",3
13944,Sheldon,19," You want me to remove him from the team? I‰Ûªm the captain, I can do that.",3
13945,Penny,19," No, no, that‰Ûªs okay. Just let me talk to him, and I‰Ûªll get back to you.",3
13946,Sheldon,19, When are you going to talk to him?,3
13947,Penny,19, I don‰Ûªt know.,3
13948,Sheldon,19, He‰Ûªs in the laundry room now. Now would be a good time.,3
13949,Penny,19," You‰Ûªre not gonna leave me alone until I do it, are you?",3
13950,Sheldon,19," Oh, I think we both know the answer to that question.",3
13951,Scene,19, The laundry room.,3
13952,Penny,19, I think we should talk now.,3
13953,Leonard,19," What? No, it‰Ûªs okay. We don‰Ûªt have to talk ‰Ûªcause there‰Ûªs nothing to talk about. Everything‰Ûªs good.",3
13954,Penny,19," Really? So, you didn‰Ûªt get all snarky ‰Ûªcause I said something nice to a bowl of chilli fries?",3
13955,Leonard,19," All right, maybe I overreacted. So we‰Ûªre in two different places emotionally. So what? And maybe I‰Ûªm a little ahead of you. That‰Ûªs fine. You know. In fact, it makes sense, ‰Ûªcause let‰Ûªs face it, I‰Ûªve been in this relationship two years longer than you.",3
13956,Penny,19," Look, Leonard, you have to know how much I care about you. It‰Ûªs just that I‰Ûªve said the L word too soon before, and it didn‰Ûªt work out very well.",3
13957,Leonard,19, Really? I wouldn‰Ûªt know what that‰Ûªs like.,3
13958,Penny,19," I‰Ûªm sorry. You know what I‰Ûªm talking about, though.",3
13959,Leonard,19," Yeah, I do.",3
13960,Penny,19," So, we‰Ûªre good?",3
13961,Leonard,19," Yes, that‰Ûªs what I‰Ûªm telling you. We are good. We are great.",3
13962,Sheldon,19," All right! Fence mended, problem swept under the rug. Time to bowl! Yes, I was eavesdropping, there‰Ûªs a lot at stake here.",3
13963,Scene,19, The bowling alley.,3
13964,Sheldon,19," Attention, all bowlers. I‰Ûªve taken the liberty of having these made for our rematch.",3
13965,Penny,19, The Wesley Crushers?,3
13966,Sheldon,19," No, not the Wesley Crushers. The Wesley ‰ÛÏCrushers.‰Û",3
13967,Penny,19, I don‰Ûªt get it.,3
13968,Leonard,19, Wesley Crusher was Wil Wheaton‰Ûªs character on Star Trek.,3
13969,Penny,19, Still don‰Ûªt get it.,3
13970,Sheldon,19," It‰Ûªs a blindingly clever play on words. By appropriating his character‰Ûªs name and adding the S, we imply that we we‰Ûªll be the crushers of Wesley.",3
13971,Penny,19," Okay, I‰Ûªm sorry, honey, but the Wesley Crushers sounds like a bunch of people who like Wesley Crusher.",3
13972,Sheldon,19," What? No! Again, it‰Ûªs not the Wesley Crushers. It‰Ûªs the Wesley ‰ÛÏCrushers.‰Û",3
13973,Howard,19," You know, if you want it to mean you‰Ûªre crushing Wesley, it‰Ûªd be the ‰ÛÏWesley‰Û Crushers.",3
13974,Sheldon,19, Do you people even hear yourselves? It‰Ûªs not the Wesley Crushers. It‰Ûªs not the ‰ÛÏWesley‰Û Crushers. It‰Ûªs the Wesley ‰ÛÏCrushers.‰Û,3
13975,Wil,19," Hey, look. They named their team after me.",3
13976,Sheldon,19," No, it‰Ûªs not the‰Û_ Never mind.",3
13977,Stuart,19," So, we‰Ûªre all clear on the bet and the stakes?",3
13978,Sheldon,19," Oh, yes. The losers will be publicly humiliated in a fashion to be chosen by the victor. FYI, I plan on having you publish a scientific paper expounding the discredited Velikovsky hypothesis.",3
13979,Stuart,19, Ouch again.,3
13980,Wil,19," Hey, Sheldon, I just wanted you to know that I‰Ûªm really looking forward to wiping the floor with you.",3
13981,Sheldon,19," Oh, yes? Well, before I respond, let me ask you a question. Is your mother a good or poor bowler?",3
13982,Wil,19, After you.,3
13983,Sheldon,19," No, after you, as we are currently crushing you, Wesley.",3
13984,Wil,19, It‰Ûªs customary for the player on the right-hand lane to bowl first.,3
13985,Sheldon,19, All right.,3
13986,Wil,19," It‰Ûªs a custom, not a rule.",3
13987,Sheldon,19, I so loathe you.,3
13988,Wil,19," That‰Ûªs right, Sheldon. Embrace the dark side.",3
13989,Sheldon,19, That‰Ûªs not even from your franchise!,3
13990,Stuart,19," I, um, I want you to know that even though we‰Ûªre on opposite sides, I, I bear you no ill will.",3
13991,Penny,19," Thank you, Stuart. It‰Ûªs nice to know.",3
13992,Stuart,19," Mmm, mmm. People from opposite sides often have good relationships. You know, Romeo and Juliet, Tony and Maria from West Side Story, what‰Ûªs-his-name and the big blue chick in Avatar. I‰Ûªm gonna bowl now.",3
13993,Sheldon,19," Be the ball, Howard.",3
13994,Howard,19," Leave me alone, Sheldon.",3
13995,Sheldon,19, You weren‰Ûªt the ball.,3
13996,Penny,19," Hey, thanks.",3
13997,Leonard,19," This is fun, huh?",3
13998,Penny,19, Yeah.,3
13999,Leonard,19, It‰Ûªs good that we got out and did something physical.,3
14000,Penny,19, Mm-hmm.,3
14001,Leonard,19," Gets us out of our heads. You get in your head, you start to overthink, overanalyze, obsess, you worry. That‰Ûªs not what we‰Ûªre doing tonight. Tonight we‰Ûªre just throwing a ball at some pins.",3
14002,Penny,19," Yeah, that‰Ûªs right.",3
14003,Leonard,19," Mm-hmm, and someday, we don‰Ûªt know when, maybe you‰Ûªll love me back. Ooh, I‰Ûªm up.",3
14004,All (chanting),19, Shel-don! Shel-don! Shel-don! Shel-don!,3
14005,Sheldon,19, Excuse me. I don‰Ûªt know who you‰Ûªre chanting for as I am currently the ball.,3
14006,All (chanting),19, The ball! The ball! The ball! The ball! The ball! The ball!,3
14007,Sheldon,19," Thank you, Jesus! As my mother would say.",3
14008,Wil,19, I‰Ûªm glad you patched things up with your boyfriend.,3
14009,Penny,19," Oh, yeah, me, too.",3
14010,Wil,19, It‰Ûªs always tough when the L bomb gets dropped and you‰Ûªre not ready for it.,3
14011,Penny,19, Tell me about it.,3
14012,Wil,19," I dated this one girl, and I told her that I loved her, and she said she wasn‰Ûªt sure. And she strung me along for almost two years. It was brutal.",3
14013,Penny,19," Oh, I‰Ûªm sorry.",3
14014,Wil,19," Thanks. Yeah, I wish she had just broken up with me right there, put me out of my misery.",3
14015,Penny,19, Really?,3
14016,Wil,19," Yeah, would have been kinder.",3
14017,Stuart,19," Wil, you‰Ûªre up.",3
14018,Wil,19," Oh, that‰Ûªs me.",3
14019,Sheldon,19, Did you let Wil Wheaton get in your head?,3
14020,Penny,19, What are you talking about?,3
14021,Sheldon,19, He‰Ûªs evil. He plays evil mind games. Did he tell you his grandmother died?,3
14022,Penny,19, No!,3
14023,Sheldon,19," Well, if he does, don‰Ûªt believe it. He‰Ûªs not above playing the dead meemaw card.",3
14024,Wil,19, Yes!,3
14025,Leonard,19," Penny, you‰Ûªre up.",3
14026,Sheldon,19," All right, remember, his meemaw‰Ûªs alive and be the ball.",3
14027,Penny,19," Yeah, I got it.",3
14028,Leonard,19, We really need a strike here.,3
14029,Penny,19, I know.,3
14030,Leonard,19, So just take your time and concentrate.,3
14031,Penny,19," Leonard, stop pressuring me.",3
14032,Leonard,19, I‰Ûªm not pressuring you.,3
14033,Penny,19," Yeah, you are! Just back off!",3
14034,Leonard,19," Okay, I‰Ûªm sorry. I‰Ûªll shut up.",3
14035,Penny,19, I didn‰Ûªt mean shut up.,3
14036,Leonard,19," Fine. Just tell me what to do, and I‰Ûªll do it.",3
14037,Penny,19," No, this isn‰Ûªt fair to you, Leonard. I‰Ûªm sorry.",3
14038,Sheldon,19," Wait! Where are you going? Penny, come back! I‰Ûªll get you ice cream!",3
14039,Leonard,19," No, let her go.",3
14040,Sheldon,19," Are you insane? If she leaves, it‰Ûªs over!",3
14041,Leonard,19, I‰Ûªm pretty sure it‰Ûªs already over.,3
14042,Wil,19," Tough luck, Sheldon.",3
14043,Sheldon,19," You did this, didn‰Ûªt you?",3
14044,Wil,19, Do you think I would really break up a couple just to win a bowling match?,3
14045,Sheldon,19," No, I suppose not.",3
14046,Wil,19, Good. Keep thinking that.,3
14047,Sheldon,19, Wheaton!,3
14048,Scene,19, The comic book store.,3
14049,Stuart,19," Mm-hmm, mm-hmm, yeah, I‰Ûªm telling you the Match.com chicks are much looser than on eHarmony. You know, I, I gotta call you back. I won a bet, and it‰Ûªs time to collect.",3
14050,Raj,19," I don‰Ûªt know about you, but I feel empowered.",3
14051,Scene,20, The lobby.,3
14052,Penny,20," Oh, damn, they cancelled my Visa. Oh, yay, a new MasterCard!",3
14053,Sheldon,20, Uh-oh.,3
14054,Penny,20, What?,3
14055,Sheldon,20, I was going to get my mail.,3
14056,Penny,20," Okay. Are, are you hoping to get it telepathically?",3
14057,Sheldon,20," I think you mean telekinetically. And no, I just wasn‰Ûªt sure of the proper protocol now that you and Leonard are no longer having coitus.",3
14058,Penny,20," God, can we please just say no longer seeing each other?",3
14059,Sheldon,20," Well, we could if it were true. But as you live in the same building, you see each other all the time. The variable which has changed is the coitus.",3
14060,Penny,20," Okay, here‰Ûªs the protocol, you and I are still friends, and you stop saying coitus.",3
14061,Sheldon,20," Good, good. I‰Ûªm glad we‰Ûªre still friends.",3
14062,Penny,20, Really?,3
14063,Sheldon,20," Oh, yes. It was a lot of work to accommodate you in my life. I‰Ûªd hate for that effort to have been in vain.",3
14064,Penny,20, Right.,3
14065,Sheldon,20, Just to be clear do I have to stop saying coitus with everyone or just you?,3
14066,Penny,20, Everyone.,3
14067,Sheldon,20," Harsh terms. But all right, I‰Ûªll just substitute intercourse.",3
14068,Penny,20, Great.,3
14069,Sheldon,20," Or fornication. Yeah. But that has judgmental overtones, so I‰Ûªll hold that in reserve.",3
14070,Penny,20," So, how you been?",3
14071,Sheldon,20," Well, my existence is a continuum, so I‰Ûªve been what I am at each point in the implied time period.",3
14072,Penny,20," You‰Ûªre just coitusing with me, aren‰Ûªt you?",3
14073,Sheldon,20, Bazinga.,3
14074,Penny,20, Mmm. How‰Ûªs Leonard doing?,3
14075,Sheldon,20," He seems all right. Although he does spend a disturbing amount of time looking at photographs of you and smelling the pillow you slept on. Oh, but now that I think of it, he asked me not to tell you that.",3
14076,Penny,20, I‰Ûªll pretend I didn‰Ûªt hear it.,3
14077,Sheldon,20, I‰Ûªd rather you pretend I didn‰Ûªt say it. I see you bought Mama Italia marinara spaghetti sauce.,3
14078,Penny,20, Yep.,3
14079,Sheldon,20," That‰Ûªs the sauce my mother uses. She likes cooking Italian because according to her, that‰Ûªs what the Romans made Jesus eat.",3
14080,Penny,20, Interesting. I‰Ûªll have to have you over for spaghetti some night.,3
14081,Sheldon,20, I‰Ûªm hungry now.,3
14082,Penny,20," Oh. Um, okay. Why don‰Ûªt you give me an hour and come over?",3
14083,Sheldon,20, Will you cut up hot dogs into little chunks and mix them in with the sauce?,3
14084,Penny,20, I don‰Ûªt have hot dogs.,3
14085,Sheldon,20," Oh, it‰Ûªs all right, I do. Oh! You‰Ûªre in for what my mother calls a real Eye-talian treat. (Enters apartment).",3
14086,Leonard,20," Hey, where you been?",3
14087,Sheldon,20, I was talking with Penny.,3
14088,Howard,20, What‰Ûªs wrong with you? You can‰Ûªt hang out with your roommate‰Ûªs ex. That‰Ûªs totally uncool.,3
14089,Leonard,20," No, no, it‰Ûªs fine. I don‰Ûªt care. I‰Ûªm over it.",3
14090,Raj,20," Yeah, he‰Ûªs over it, that‰Ûªs why he‰Ûªs been whining all day about trying to invent that memory-wiper gizmo from Men in Black.",3
14091,Sheldon,20, Is he making any progress? Because I‰Ûªd like to erase Ben Affleck as Daredevil.,3
14092,Howard,20," So would Ben Affleck. The point is, in a situation like this you got to pick sides. You‰Ûªre either on Team Leonard or Team Penny.",3
14093,Sheldon,20, Which one picks last?,3
14094,Howard,20, What?,3
14095,Sheldon,20," Well, usually I‰Ûªm on the team that picks last. Unless there‰Ûªs a kid in a wheelchair.",3
14096,Leonard,20," Sheldon, I got you your tangerine chicken. I hope you‰Ûªre hungry.",3
14097,Sheldon,20," Well, of course I‰Ûªm hungry. And as I have no plans to eat with any other team, I will consume my tangerine chicken with the appropriate gusto. Mm, mm, mm!",3
14098,Leonard,20, Okay.,3
14099,Sheldon,20," Just out of curiosity, do we still have hot dogs?",3
14100,Leonard,20, I don‰Ûªt know. Why?,3
14101,Sheldon,20," Just making dinner conversation. Go, Team Leonard!",3
14102,Scene,20, A few moments later.,3
14103,Howard,20," Oh, God, this is good.",3
14104,Raj,20, Let me ask you a question. Do you believe you‰Ûªre going to go to hell for eating sweet and sour pork?,3
14105,Howard,20, Jews don‰Ûªt have hell. We have acid reflux.,3
14106,Leonard,20," Do you want the last dumpling, Sheldon?",3
14107,Sheldon,20," Certainly. It‰Ûªs not like I have to moderate my food intake because I‰Ûªm planning on eating again very shortly. Mm, mm, mm!",3
14108,Leonard,20," So, you guys want to do something tonight?",3
14109,Howard,20," Nah, I can‰Ûªt. I got to pick up my mom from her water aerobics class. 18 overweight women flapping their arm fat in a swimming pool. Looks like the manatee tank at Sea World.",3
14110,Leonard,20," What about you, Raj?",3
14111,Raj,20," Oh, there it is, now that you don‰Ûªt have a girlfriend, you want to hang out with me again.",3
14112,Leonard,20, I never stopped hanging out with you.,3
14113,Raj,20," Oh, please, we all know I‰Ûªm the friend you call when you have no other options. If we were the Justice League, I‰Ûªd be Aquaman.",3
14114,Howard,20, I wish you were Aquaman. Then I could send you to scoop my mom out of the old lady tank.,3
14115,Sheldon,20," Excuse me, I‰Ûªm thirsty, so I‰Ûªm going to go to the refrigerator and get myself a refreshing beverage.",3
14116,Leonard,20, You know what? I‰Ûªll just spend the evening alone.,3
14117,Raj,20," What, suddenly I‰Ûªm not good enough for you?",3
14118,Sheldon,20," Ah, I do so love beverages. Now I think I‰Ûªll take my after-dinner walk.",3
14119,Leonard,20, Since when do you take after-dinner walks?,3
14120,Howard,20," Yeah, since when do you take walks?",3
14121,Sheldon,20," I read a study online that walking after a meal not only aids in digestion, but increases serotonin, and you know me, if there‰Ûªs one thing I like more than a refreshing beverage, it‰Ûªs serotonin. Bye-bye.",3
14122,Howard,20, Hold on. I‰Ûªll walk down with you.,3
14123,Sheldon,20," Oh, that‰Ûªs not necessary. You can go first.",3
14124,Howard,20, Or we could go together.,3
14125,Sheldon,20, I can‰Ûªt think of a reason why not.,3
14126,Howard,20, Let‰Ûªs go.,3
14127,Sheldon,20," Hold on. Nope, no reason.",3
14128,Raj,20, I‰Ûªve missed you.,3
14129,Scene,20, The lobby.,3
14130,Sheldon,20," All right, say hello to your mother for me.",3
14131,Howard,20, Okay.,3
14132,Sheldon,20, What?,3
14133,Howard,20, You said you were going for a walk.,3
14134,Sheldon,20, I didn‰Ûªt say outside.,3
14135,Howard,20," So what, you‰Ûªre just gonna walk up and down the stairs?",3
14136,Sheldon,20," No, of course not. That would be odd and suspicious behavior.",3
14137,Woman‰Ûªs voice,20, Here Bubbles. Here boy.,3
14138,Howard,20, Which way are you going?,3
14139,Sheldon,20, Which way are you going?,3
14140,Howard,20, I parked my scooter down the block.,3
14141,Sheldon,20, I‰Ûªm going the other way. Bye.,3
14142,Howard,20," Bye. Actually, I‰Ûªm this way. Do I smell hot dogs?",3
14143,Sheldon,20," No. I mean, I have no idea what you smell.",3
14144,Howard,20, I definitely smell raw hot dog.,3
14145,Sheldon,20, Perhaps you‰Ûªre getting a brain tumour.,3
14146,Howard,20," All right, have a nice walk.",3
14147,Sheldon,20, I shall. Have a nice scoot.,3
14148,Howard,20, You might want to stand back. I‰Ûªm sitting on top of 13 horses here.,3
14149,Sheldon,20," Oh. Hello, doggie. Nice doggie. I bet you think you smell hot dogs. Look, a cat!",3
14150,Scene,20, Penny‰Ûªs apartment.,3
14151,Sheldon,20," (Knock, knock, knock) Penny, (knock, knock, knock) Penny. (Long pause, knock, knock, knock) Penny. (Penny opens door. A dishevelled Sheldon is holding up one hot dog.) Here. I had to trade the others for my life.",3
14152,Scene,20, The apartment.,3
14153,Raj,20," Hey, Leonard?",3
14154,Leonard,20, Yeah?,3
14155,Raj,20, I haven‰Ûªt had sex in a year.,3
14156,Leonard,20," Where you going with this, Raj?",3
14157,Raj,20," Don‰Ûªt flatter yourself, dude. I want to go out and meet a woman.",3
14158,Leonard,20," So, go.",3
14159,Raj,20," Well, I need a wingman. I don‰Ûªt want to come off like a lonely loser.",3
14160,Leonard,20, And you think my presence will help with that?,3
14161,Raj,20," Well, I do. Next to you, I‰Ûªll look like a catch.",3
14162,Leonard,20," I‰Ûªm not going out tonight, Raj.",3
14163,Raj,20, All right. Would you mind if I went to your room and downloaded some Asian pornography?,3
14164,Leonard,20, Very much.,3
14165,Raj,20, Doesn‰Ûªt have to be Asian.,3
14166,Leonard,20, Don‰Ûªt worry. You‰Ûªll meet a girl someday.,3
14167,Raj,20," No, I won‰Ûªt.",3
14168,Leonard,20," Yes, you will, and she‰Ûªll be beautiful, and kind and sexy and funny and everything you ever wanted in a woman.",3
14169,Raj,20, You really think so?,3
14170,Leonard,20," I do, and you‰Ûªll fall hopelessly in love and give her your heart. And she‰Ûªll take it and grind it into pathetic, little pieces.",3
14171,Raj,20," But we‰Ûªll have sex first, right?",3
14172,Scene,20, Penny‰Ûªs apartment.,3
14173,Sheldon,20," Mmm, mmm, mmm. That‰Ûªs Eye-talian.",3
14174,Penny,20," So, um, was Leonard okay with you coming over?",3
14175,Sheldon,20," Oh, yes. In fact, he said, I‰Ûªm fine, I don‰Ûªt care. And he in no way said it in a manner which would lead one to believe that he was covering up feelings of anguish and betrayal.",3
14176,Penny,20," Well, good.",3
14177,Sheldon,20, I‰Ûªm also pleased to report that he‰Ûªs all cried out over you.,3
14178,Penny,20, He‰Ûªs been crying?,3
14179,Sheldon,20," Oh, I believe that was something else I wasn‰Ûªt supposed to mention.",3
14180,Penny,20," Oh, God, I feel terrible.",3
14181,Sheldon,20," Do you have a stomach ache, too?",3
14182,Penny,20," No. Why, do you?",3
14183,Sheldon,20, No.,3
14184,Penny,20," Why did you ask if I had one, too?",3
14185,Sheldon,20, Just making polite dinner conversation. Your turn.,3
14186,Penny,20," All right. So, what‰Ûªs new in your life?",3
14187,Sheldon,20," Well, my new shoes are not made for running.",3
14188,Penny,20, Have you been running?,3
14189,Sheldon,20," No. It‰Ûªs just a suspicion I have. Mmm, mmm, mmm.",3
14190,Penny,20, I‰Ûªm so glad you like it.,3
14191,Sheldon,20, I do. Leonard never cooks for me.,3
14192,Penny,20," Well, maybe that‰Ûªs ‰Ûªcause Leonard can‰Ûªt cook.",3
14193,Sheldon,20, You can‰Ûªt cook and you made me this.,3
14194,Penny,20," Whatever. Ooh, I‰Ûªm gonna get the cheesecake out of the fridge.",3
14195,Sheldon,20," Oh, Lord, I‰Ûªm in Jewish hell.",3
14196,Scene,20, The apartment.,3
14197,Raj,20, Look at this. Do you think she‰Ûªs really doing that or is it PhotoShop?,3
14198,Leonard,20," I‰Ûªm pretty sure Martha Stewart never got naked with a room full of big, fat Japanese guys.",3
14199,Raj,20, You don‰Ûªt know that. Prison changes people.,3
14200,Leonard,20," Hey, where you been?",3
14201,Sheldon,20," I told you, walking.",3
14202,Leonard,20, For an hour and a half?,3
14203,Sheldon,20, I got lost.,3
14204,Leonard,20, How could you get lost? Your phone has GPS.,3
14205,Sheldon,20, Satellites are down. Solar flares.,3
14206,Raj,20, There are no solar flares right now.,3
14207,Sheldon,20," Yes, there are.",3
14208,Raj,20," Dude, I‰Ûªm an astrophysicist. If there were solar flares, I‰Ûªd be all up in it.",3
14209,Sheldon,20, I‰Ûªm sorry. I misspoke. What I meant to say was my battery died.,3
14210,Leonard,20, What the hell was that about?,3
14211,Raj,20, I don‰Ûªt know. Do you think this is really Hillary Clinton doing it with Oprah?,3
14212,Leonard,20," Oh, we really need to get you a girl.",3
14213,Scene,20, Leonard‰Ûªs bedroom. Leonard is asleep.,3
14214,Sheldon,20," (Knock, knock, knock) Leonard, (knock, knock, knock) Leonard, (knock, knock, knock) Leonard.",3
14215,Leonard,20," Oh, just come in!",3
14216,Sheldon,20, Thanks for seeing me on such short notice.,3
14217,Leonard,20," What do you want, Sheldon?",3
14218,Sheldon,20, Maybe this isn‰Ûªt a good time.,3
14219,Leonard,20, Tell me why you woke me up or I swear to God I will kill you.,3
14220,Sheldon,20, Do you really think death threats are an appropriate way to begin this conversation? Sometimes your lack of social skills astonishes me.,3
14221,Leonard,20, What do you want?,3
14222,Sheldon,20, You may want to sit down.,3
14223,Leonard,20, I‰Ûªm in bed!,3
14224,Sheldon,20, Point taken. You may want to sit up.,3
14225,Leonard,20, Sheldon!,3
14226,Sheldon,20, I‰Ûªve been seeing Penny behind your back.,3
14227,Leonard,20," Okay, when you say seeing Penny, what exactly does that mean?",3
14228,Sheldon,20," We had dinner last night. She made me spaghetti with little hot dogs cut up in it. Well, little hot dog. I gave up the other five hot dogs to a real dog. A real, big dog. A hell hound. Tangential to the primary story. How about I circle back to it?",3
14229,Leonard,20, Fine. Why did you have dinner with Penny?,3
14230,Sheldon,20," I told you, she made spaghetti with little hot dogs. I like spaghetti with little hot dogs.",3
14231,Leonard,20, Then why did you have Chinese food with us?,3
14232,Sheldon,20, I didn‰Ûªt want to upset you. Howard made it very clear that my allegiance should be to male comrades before women who sell their bodies for money.,3
14233,Leonard,20, Is it possible he said Bros before Hos?,3
14234,Sheldon,20," Yes, but I rephrased it to avoid offending the hos.",3
14235,Leonard,20," Sheldon, I don‰Ûªt care if you want to be friends with Penny.",3
14236,Sheldon,20," Oh. Well, so the emotional turmoil that‰Ûªs been keeping me from achieving REM sleep was entirely unjustified?",3
14237,Leonard,20, Yes.,3
14238,Sheldon,20," Well then as my meemaw would say, looks like we butchered a pig, but nobody wanted bacon.",3
14239,Leonard,20, I guess not.,3
14240,Sheldon,20," And now, as promised, the tangent. Sheldon and the Hell Hound, or How I Lost My Hot Dogs.",3
14241,Scene,20, The laundry room.,3
14242,Penny,20," Oh, um, I, I can come back.",3
14243,Leonard,20," D-don‰Ûªt be silly. We‰Ûªre neighbours, we‰Ûªre going to run into each other, may as well get used to it.",3
14244,Penny,20," Yeah, I guess you‰Ûªre right.",3
14245,Leonard,20, You used to it yet?,3
14246,Penny,20, Nope.,3
14247,Leonard,20," Me neither. Oh, Sheldon seemed think that I would be upset about you hanging out with him. But I just want you to know it‰Ûªs fine.",3
14248,Penny,20," Oh, oh, good, because, um, his mother called me.",3
14249,Leonard,20, His mother?,3
14250,Penny,20," Yeah, she wants me to take him shopping for sheets and towels.",3
14251,Leonard,20, I was going to do that.,3
14252,Penny,20," Oh, well, then you, you do it.",3
14253,Leonard,20," No, I don‰Ûªt want to do it. You can do it.",3
14254,Penny,20," Okay, you can take him for shoes.",3
14255,Leonard,20, I just took him for shoes.,3
14256,Penny,20," Well, all I know is he says they hurt his feet.",3
14257,Leonard,20, Fine. I‰Ûªll take him for shoes next Saturday.,3
14258,Penny,20," Oh, no, no, no, a bunch of us from work are going to Disneyland next Saturday and Sheldon wants to come.",3
14259,Leonard,20, You‰Ûªre taking him to Disneyland?,3
14260,Penny,20," Well, he heard me making plans on the phone. Was I going to say no?",3
14261,Leonard,20, All right. But let me know if you‰Ûªre going to stuff him with junk food. I don‰Ûªt want to bring home a nice dinner for him and see it go to waste.,3
14262,Penny,20, We‰Ûªre going to Disneyland. He‰Ûªs going to eat junk food.,3
14263,Leonard,20, All I‰Ûªm saying is give me a heads-up.,3
14264,Penny,20," Okay, whatever.",3
14265,Leonard,20," And don‰Ûªt let him go on Space Mountain after he eats. He‰Ûªll say he can handle it, but I promise you‰Ûªll end up with churro puke on your shoes.",3
14266,Penny,20," All right, got it. Is there anything else?",3
14267,Leonard,20," Yeah, don‰Ûªt let Goofy near him. He‰Ûªll have nightmares and I‰Ûªll have to deal with it.",3
14268,Penny,20, What‰Ûªs the problem with Goofy?,3
14269,Leonard,20, Wish I knew. He‰Ûªs fine with Pluto.,3
14270,Scene,20, The apartment. ,3
14271,Raj,20," Hey, do you think the elastic woman in The Incredibles needs to use birth control or can she just be a diaphragm?",3
14272,Howard,20," Well, that‰Ûªs it. We‰Ûªre officially out of things to talk about.",3
14273,Penny,20, We‰Ûªre home.,3
14274,Leonard,20," It‰Ûªs ten o‰Ûªclock, where have you been?",3
14275,Sheldon,20, We stayed for the California Adventure water show. It was pure Disney magic.,3
14276,Leonard,20, I was going to see that with him.,3
14277,Penny,20, How was I supposed to know that?,3
14278,Sheldon,20, It‰Ûªs all right. I‰Ûªll see it again with you.,3
14279,Leonard,20, And I have food here. You said you were going to call.,3
14280,Penny,20," I know, I know.",3
14281,Sheldon,20, I can still eat.,3
14282,Penny,20," No, you already threw up once. Go put on your PJs and brush your teeth.",3
14283,Sheldon,20," Okay, but just don‰Ûªt fight",3
14284,Leonard,20, We‰Ûªre not fighting.,3
14285,Penny,20, Just go.,3
14286,Leonard,20, Aren‰Ûªt you going to thank Penny for taking you to Disneyland?,3
14287,Sheldon,20," Thank you, Penny.",3
14288,Penny,20," You‰Ûªre welcome, sweetie.",3
14289,Leonard,20, Want a cup of coffee?,3
14290,Penny,20," Oh, um, I should probably get going.",3
14291,Leonard,20, Come on. It‰Ûªs just a cup of coffee.,3
14292,Penny,20," Yep, okay.",3
14293,"Howard (to Raj, who has whispered to him)",20," Oh, yeah, the whole thing seems a little twisted to me, too.",3
14294,Leonard,20, What am I smelling?,3
14295,Penny,20, Sheldon‰Ûªs churro on my shoes.,3
14296,Scene,20, Sheldon‰Ûªs bedroom.,3
14297,Penny,20, He‰Ûªs such an angel when he‰Ûªs asleep.,3
14298,Leonard,20, Yeah. Shame he has to wake up.,3
14299,Penny,20, I think we can do it.,3
14300,Leonard,20, Smother Sheldon in his sleep? Wouldn‰Ûªt that be wrong?,3
14301,Penny,20," No, be friends. You and me.",3
14302,Leonard,20, Oh. Sure. Absolutely.,3
14303,Penny,20, Good. I‰Ûªm glad.,3
14304,Leonard,20," Here‰Ûªs an idea. I‰Ûªm just throwing it out there, friends who have sex.",3
14305,Penny,20," Good night, Leonard.",3
14306,Leonard,20, Kidding. Just a couple of friends goofin‰Ûª around.,3
14307,Sheldon (in his sleep),20," No, Goofy, no.",3
14308,Scene,21, The university cafeteria.,3
14309,Sheldon,21, Hold.,3
14310,Raj,21, What?,3
14311,Sheldon,21, Explain your sneeze.,3
14312,Raj,21, I‰Ûªm sorry?,3
14313,Sheldon,21, Do you have allergies?,3
14314,Raj,21, No.,3
14315,Sheldon,21, Is there too much pepper on your salad?,3
14316,Raj,21, I don‰Ûªt put pepper on salads.,3
14317,Sheldon,21, I‰Ûªve heard enough. Sit over there.,3
14318,Raj,21," Oh, come on. I don‰Ûªt want to sit by myself.",3
14319,Sheldon,21," That‰Ûªs what Typhoid Mary said, and clearly, her friends buckled.",3
14320,Raj,21," Guys, help me.",3
14321,Howard,21," Sheldon, come on.",3
14322,Leonard,21," Yeah, it‰Ûªs just one sneeze. (Raj sneezes) You‰Ûªre on your own.",3
14323,Howard,21," See you, buddy.",3
14324,Sheldon,21," Oh, Leonard, I have something for you. Per our roommate agreement, this is your 24-hour notice that I will be having a non-related female spending two nights in our apartment.",3
14325,Leonard,21," When you say non-related female, you still mean human, right?",3
14326,Sheldon,21," Of course. Pets are banned under the roommate agreement, with the exception of service animals, such as seeing eye dogs and, one day, cybernetically-enhanced helper monkeys.",3
14327,Howard,21, Are you planning on kidnapping a woman?,3
14328,Sheldon,21, Sarcasm?,3
14329,Howard,21," Yes, but mixed with genuine concern.",3
14330,Sheldon,21," For your information, I‰Ûªll be playing host to Dr. Elizabeth Plimpton.",3
14331,Raj,21, The cosmological physicist from Princeton?,3
14332,Sheldon,21," Yes. And until you acquire a surgical mask, please address your comments to me through a napkin. We‰Ûªve been corresponding for years about our mutual interest in gravitational wave signatures of inflatons in the early universe. And now she‰Ûªs under consideration for a position at our university.",3
14333,Leonard,21, Why didn‰Ûªt you tell me you knew Elizabeth Plimpton? I am a huge fan of hers!,3
14334,Sheldon,21," I didn‰Ûªt realize I was obligated to share my connection with things you‰Ûªre a fan of, but very well. You enjoy Canadian bacon. I‰Ûªve been to Toronto.",3
14335,Leonard,21," Okay, fine. Where is she going to sleep?",3
14336,Sheldon,21," My room, of course.",3
14337,Raj,21, Holy crap! (Through napkin) Holy crap!,3
14338,Howard,21," Yeah, um, I have a two-part question.",3
14339,Sheldon,21, Go ahead.,3
14340,Howard,21," A, are you kidding me? And B, seriously, are you freaking kidding me?",3
14341,Sheldon,21," A, I rarely kid. And B, when I do kid, you will know it by my use of the word bazinga.",3
14342,Howard,21, So you‰Ûªre saying the two of you are going to be sleeping in the same bed?,3
14343,Sheldon,21, Yes. Bazinga. Leonard?,3
14344,Leonard,21, Thank you. Why is a world-renowned scientist staying in our apartment instead of a hotel?,3
14345,Sheldon,21," Well, she doesn‰Ûªt care for hotels. And who can blame her? Windows that don‰Ûªt open, multi-user linens, keys shaped like credit cards, as if one walks around with unassigned slots in one‰Ûªs wallet. All right, I believe I have time for one more question. Yes, Raj?",3
14346,Raj,21, When can I sit with you again?,3
14347,Sheldon,21," When I‰Ûªve seen two consecutive negative throat cultures spaced 12 hours apart. You know the drill. All right, if you‰Ûªll excuse me, I am off to start a prophylactic course of antibiotics.",3
14348,Leonard,21, I can‰Ûªt believe he‰Ûªs friends with Elizabeth Plimpton.,3
14349,Raj,21, I can‰Ûªt believe they let him into Canada.,3
14350,Howard,21," Whoa, whoa, whoa. You heard the man. Where‰Ûªs your throat cultures? Kidding. Sit down.",3
14351,Scene,21, The lobby,3
14352,Penny,21," Hey, Sheldon.",3
14353,Sheldon,21," Oh, Penny, excellent. I have a question about these maxi pads. Are the wings truly functional or have I fallen victim to marketing hype?",3
14354,Penny,21," What? What are you doing with, what?",3
14355,Sheldon,21, The stock boy at Walgreens was frustratingly uninformed on the subject.,3
14356,Penny,21," Sheldon, what are you doing with maxi pads?",3
14357,Sheldon,21, I have a lady friend who will be staying with me for a few days.,3
14358,Penny,21, Oh. What?,3
14359,Sheldon,21," I want her to feel at home. I also bought scented soaps, pantyhose, Midol, calcium chews and what is apparently a yogurt specifically designed to regulate the female bowel.",3
14360,Penny,21," Wait, wait, hold on, back up. You‰Ûªre having a woman stay with you?",3
14361,Sheldon,21, Yes. Why does that seem to flabbergast everybody?,3
14362,Penny,21," Oh, no, no, no, no. I‰Ûªm not flabbergasted. I‰Ûªm puzzled. Yeah, let‰Ûªs go with puzzled.",3
14363,Sheldon,21," A word of warning. My guest is a noted physicist and the leading expert on quantum cosmology, so please try to avoid wasting her time with female jibber jabber.",3
14364,Penny,21, Female jibber jabber?,3
14365,Sheldon,21," Shoe sales, hair styles, mud masks, gossip about your friends Brad and Angelina.",3
14366,Penny,21," Oh, they‰Ûªre not my friends.",3
14367,Sheldon,21," I‰Ûªm not surprised, considering the way you talk about them behind their backs.",3
14368,Scene,21, The apartment. ,3
14369,Leonard,21," She‰Ûªs here, she‰Ûªs here. How do I look? Do I look smart?",3
14370,Sheldon,21," Oh, good grief. This isn‰Ûªt about you. Coming! Now listen, one of the great minds of the 21st century is about to play host to one of the other great minds of the 21st century. So pay attention. Years from now, my biographer might ask you about this event.",3
14371,Leonard,21," Oh, I have so many things to tell your biographer.",3
14372,Elizabeth,21," Ah, Dr. Cooper, thank goodness. I completely forgot your address. But then I remembered that I‰Ûªd written it on my hand. Lucky for me, I didn‰Ûªt confuse it with what I‰Ûªd written on my other hand, which are the coordinates for a newly discovered neutron star. ‰Û÷Cause if I tried to go there, I‰Ûªd be crushed by hypergravity. Anyway, hello.",3
14373,Sheldon,21, Hello.,3
14374,Elizabeth,21, Nice to finally meet you in person.,3
14375,Sheldon,21," I would imagine it is. This is my friend and roommate, Dr. Leonard Hofstadter.",3
14376,Leonard,21," Hi-lo. Oops. I started to say hi, and then I switched to hello in the middle. It came out hi-lo. Duh. Uh, it‰Ûªs nice to meet you. I‰Ûªve read both your books and most of your papers. I‰Ûªm Leonard, I live",3
14377,Sheldon,21, I apologize. He‰Ûªs only an experimental physicist.,3
14378,Elizabeth,21," No need to apologize. Some of my best friends are experimental physicists. Well, not my best friends, but I know them. My best friend is a molecular chemist named Wendy. I‰Ûªm sorry, I‰Ûªm rambling. Hi-lo.",3
14379,Leonard,21," Are you hungry, thirsty? Can I offer you anything?",3
14380,Sheldon,21," No, she‰Ûªs my guest. If anyone should offer her anything, it should be me. Elizabeth, can I get you something? Perhaps a feminine hygiene product or a bowel-regulating yogurt?",3
14381,Elizabeth,21," Interesting choices. Based on my current needs, I guess I‰Ûªd pick the yogurt.",3
14382,Sheldon,21," Excellent. If the yogurt works, I bought some delightful scented candles.",3
14383,Leonard,21," Look, it‰Ûªs you.",3
14384,Scene,21, A little later.,3
14385,Elizabeth,21, Thank you so much for opening up your home to me.,3
14386,Leonard,21," Well, who wants to stay in a hotel? With windows that don‰Ûªt open, those crazy card-shaped keys.",3
14387,Elizabeth,21, I‰Ûªm so glad you understand.,3
14388,Sheldon,21," No, he doesn‰Ûªt understand. I understand.",3
14389,Leonard,21," Well, I understand, too.",3
14390,Sheldon,21, You‰Ûªre just misappropriating my understanding.,3
14391,Leonard,21," Oh, (blows a raspberry). I think any university would want you. Except, of course, any university that had already had you. Because they would‰Ûªve already wanted you before they, you know, got you.",3
14392,Sheldon,21, From the mind that brought you hi-lo. Let me show you to your room.,3
14393,Elizabeth,21," All right. I guess I am tired. Good night, Leonard.",3
14394,Leonard,21," Uh, sleep night. I mean, obviously, good night. I started to say sleep tight, then I changed my mind in the middle. I swear to God, I‰Ûªm smart.",3
14395,Sheldon,21," Get it together, man.",3
14396,Scene,21, Sheldon‰Ûªs bedroom. ,3
14397,Sheldon,21," All right, let me show you some of the features of the room. First, windows. Conventional. Open, closed, open, closed, halfway open, or halfway closed, depending on your philosophical bent. Over here is my comic book collection. Feel free to browse. There‰Ûªs a box of disposable reading gloves on the night stand.",3
14398,Elizabeth,21, Good to know.,3
14399,Elizabeth,21, What if there‰Ûªs a disaster that destroys all the USB ports?,3
14400,Sheldon,21," Then there‰Ûªs really no reason to live, is there?",3
14401,Elizabeth,21, Can I ask a question about your roommate?,3
14402,Sheldon,21," He‰Ûªs an odd duck, isn‰Ûªt he?",3
14403,Elizabeth,21, What‰Ûªs his relationship status?,3
14404,Sheldon,21," Well, there was a misbegotten adventure with a waitress who lives across the hall. It ended as inexplicably as it began. They had very little in common, except for carnal activity. That‰Ûªs why I acquired these noise-cancelling headphones. If you decide to use them, please clean the ear pieces afterwards with the Wet Wipes you‰Ûªll find in the bathroom. They‰Ûªre in the drawer labelled Wet Wipes.",3
14405,Elizabeth,21, Okay.,3
14406,Sheldon,21, Good. I‰Ûªll leave you to your night time ablutions. I‰Ûªve e-mailed you the morning bathroom schedule. You‰Ûªll also find a laminated copy in your welcome packet. It‰Ûªs on the back of the emergency escape route diagram.,3
14407,Elizabeth,21, How thoughtful.,3
14408,Sheldon,21," Sleep well, my friend.",3
14409,Elizabeth,21," You, too.",3
14410,Sheldon,21," Oh, let me just get one thing. It‰Ûªs my backup emergency supply kit. The living room escape route doesn‰Ûªt pass through here. Now, good night. And if there‰Ûªs an apocalypse, good luck.",3
14411,Scene,21, Leonard‰Ûªs bedroom. There is a knock on the door.,3
14412,Leonard,21, Yes?,3
14413,Elizabeth,21, I saw your light on.,3
14414,Leonard,21, Is everything all right?,3
14415,Elizabeth,21," Yeah, I just couldn‰Ûªt sleep.",3
14416,Leonard,21," Me neither. Oh, look what I‰Ûªm reading. It‰Ûªs you.",3
14417,Elizabeth,21, I thought you already read it.,3
14418,Leonard,21," I did, but it‰Ûªs been a while, and I wanted to sound smart over breakfast.",3
14419,Elizabeth,21," Aw, you‰Ûªre smart.",3
14420,Leonard,21," Oh, good. Wasn‰Ûªt sure it was coming across.",3
14421,Elizabeth,21, What chapter are you on?,3
14422,Leonard,21," Uh, six.",3
14423,Elizabeth,21," Oh, the extragalactic distance ladder. Want to know a little secret?",3
14424,Leonard,21, Sure.,3
14425,Elizabeth,21, I wrote the section on the Wilson-Bappu Effect completely naked.,3
14426,Leonard,21," Really? Uh, sure doesn‰Ûªt read that way.",3
14427,Elizabeth,21," Here, let me show you. When we consider the brightness of pulsating variable stars, we start to see (removes robe) a possible explanation for some of the discrepancies found in Hubble‰Ûªs constant.",3
14428,Leonard,21, Wow. You really make science come alive.,3
14429,Scene,21, The living room.,3
14430,Sheldon,21, Vocal test. Morning vocal test. Second vocal test. Second morning vocal test.,3
14431,Leonard,21," Morning, Sheldon.",3
14432,Sheldon,21, Morning.,3
14433,Elizabeth,21," Morning, Sheldon.",3
14434,Sheldon,21, Morning. I trust you had a pleasant night.,3
14435,Elizabeth,21, More than pleasant.,3
14436,Sheldon,21," Excuse me, I‰Ûªm going to relieve myself.",3
14437,Leonard,21, How do you take your coffee?,3
14438,Elizabeth,21, Black.,3
14439,Leonard,21, Okeydoke.,3
14440,Sheldon (in bathroom),21," Pee for Houston, pee for Austin, pee for the state my heart got lost in. And shake twice for Texas.",3
14441,Leonard,21, Something his mother taught him.,3
14442,Sheldon,21," All right, Elizabeth, the bathroom is yours. The seat is down, and has been sanitized for your protection.",3
14443,Elizabeth,21," That‰Ûªs very thoughtful, but I think I‰Ûªll finish my coffee first.",3
14444,Sheldon,21," Ah, so the yogurt didn‰Ûªt work. I‰Ûªll fire off a critical e-mail to the manufacturer.",3
14445,Penny,21," Oh, good, you‰Ûªre up. Look, my car won‰Ûªt start. I need a ride to work.",3
14446,Sheldon,21, Did you once again ignore your check engine light?,3
14447,Penny,21," No, Mr. smarty-pants. I ignored the fill gas tank light.",3
14448,Sheldon,21," Leonard, Penny wants to exploit any residual feelings you have for her in order to get a ride to work.",3
14449,Leonard,21," Oh, yeah, sure, let me just put this in a travel mug.",3
14450,Penny,21, Hello.,3
14451,Elizabeth,21, Hi.,3
14452,Penny,21," Oh, Penny, this is Dr. Plimpton, a leading expert on quantum cosmology. Dr. Plimpton, Penny is a waitress who doesn‰Ûªt understand the role gasoline plays in the internal combustion engine.",3
14453,Elizabeth,21, Nice to meet you.,3
14454,Penny,21," Nice to meet you, too. Are you enjoying your stay?",3
14455,Elizabeth,21," Yes, very much.",3
14456,Penny,21, Good.,3
14457,Sheldon,21," Wonderful. Meaningless pleasantries accomplished. Elizabeth, Leonard‰Ûªs bathroom time is coming up, and believe me, you do not want to follow him.",3
14458,Elizabeth,21, Excuse me.,3
14459,Leonard,21," Okay, well, I guess I should get dressed so I can take everyone to work. You and Sheldon and Sheldon‰Ûªs friend, Dr. Plimpton, who you just met. It‰Ûªll be fun. Like a clown car.",3
14460,Penny,21, Hang on.,3
14461,Leonard,21, Hmm? Yeah? What? Huh?,3
14462,Penny,21, We just broke up.,3
14463,Leonard,21," What, uh, you and me? Yeah, we did. Not too long ago. How are you doing with it?",3
14464,Penny,21, Not as good as you apparently.,3
14465,Leonard,21," I, um, I don‰Ûªt follow.",3
14466,Penny,21," You know what? It‰Ûªs, it‰Ûªs none of my business. If you want to sleep with Sheldon‰Ûªs doctor buddy right after we stopped seeing each other, go for it.",3
14467,Leonard,21," Well, now‰Û_",3
14468,Sheldon,21," Excuse me. I‰Ûªm uncomfortable with you recommending that Leonard pursue having intercourse with Dr. Plimpton, who I assure you has better things to do.",3
14469,Penny,21, I‰Ûªm not recommending it. I‰Ûªm saying it already happened.,3
14470,Sheldon,21," That‰Ûªs preposterous. Tell her, Leonard.",3
14471,Leonard,21, Well‰Û_,3
14472,Sheldon,21, No.,3
14473,Leonard,21, Come on. It wasn‰Ûªt my fault.,3
14474,Sheldon,21, The implication being that you somehow tripped and fell into her lady parts?,3
14475,Penny,21, You know what? I‰Ûªm just gonna take the bus to work.,3
14476,Leonard,21," Penny, I can still drive you.",3
14477,Penny,21," Oh, no, no, it‰Ûªs okay. You might slip on a banana peel and get me pregnant.",3
14478,Sheldon,21," I must say, I‰Ûªm shocked by this betrayal.",3
14479,Leonard,21, I didn‰Ûªt betray Penny.,3
14480,Sheldon,21," Not Penny, me!",3
14481,Leonard,21, How am I betraying you?,3
14482,Sheldon,21," Elizabeth‰Ûªs my friend, and you‰Ûªre playing with her!",3
14483,Leonard,21," Yeah, I guess I did.",3
14484,Scene,21, The cafeteria. Raj drinks from a hip flask.,3
14485,Howard,21, What the hell are you doing?,3
14486,Raj,21," Relax, it‰Ûªs Nyquil.",3
14487,Leonard,21, You still have a cold?,3
14488,Raj,21," Maybe, but I don‰Ûªt care. That‰Ûªs the great thing about Nyquil, it‰Ûªs like ten-percent booze. I call it the nighttime sniffling, sneezing, coughing, so you can talk to girls medicine.",3
14489,Leonard,21," Are you having trouble sleeping? ‰Û÷Cause, boy, I was up all night.",3
14490,Raj,21," Did you get a cold, too?",3
14491,Leonard,21," No, but I was awake all night.",3
14492,Howard,21," If you want, I can give you some of my mom‰Ûªs sleeping pills.",3
14493,Raj,21, She won‰Ûªt notice they‰Ûªre missing?,3
14494,Howard,21, She doesn‰Ûªt know she takes them.,3
14495,Leonard,21," No, that‰Ûªs okay. It was something else keeping me up last night. And again this morning. And, I didn‰Ûªt mind. I was up last night. I was up this morning. I didn‰Ûªt mind. Those are your clues.",3
14496,Raj,21," Ooh, ooh. Did the pigeon on your windowsill have more babies?",3
14497,Leonard,21, No.,3
14498,Howard,21, Were you up making another stop-motion Lego movie?,3
14499,Leonard,21, No.,3
14500,Howard,21," ‰Û÷Cause let me tell you, it‰Ûªs not enough to make the Legos move, they also have to capture your heart.",3
14501,Leonard,21," Okay, I‰Ûªll give you one more clue. It involved another person.",3
14502,Raj,21, Did you get a Japanese love pillow?,3
14503,Howard,21, How is a Japanese love pillow another person?,3
14504,Raj,21, It is if you love her and give her a name.,3
14505,Sheldon,21," Dr. Plimpton, I‰Ûªd like you to meet my colleagues, Dr. Rajesh Koothrappali",3
14506,Raj,21, Hi.,3
14507,Sheldon,21, And not-a-doctor Howard Wolowitz.,3
14508,Howard,21, Hi.,3
14509,Raj,21, I‰Ûªm a big fan of your work.,3
14510,Elizabeth,21, Thank you.,3
14511,Sheldon,21," And of course, you‰Ûªve already introduced yourself to Dr. Hofstadter.",3
14512,Leonard,21," Hey, you.",3
14513,Elizabeth,21," Hey, you.",3
14514,Leonard,21," Boy, I‰Ûªm kind of tuckered out. How are you feeling, Elizabeth?",3
14515,Elizabeth,21, You know what? I am a little tired. Would you be a dear and get me a cup of coffee?,3
14516,Leonard,21," Sure. Black, right?",3
14517,Elizabeth,21," Actually, now I think I want it hot, brown and sweet.",3
14518,Leonard,21, Coming right up.,3
14519,Scene,21, Raj‰Ûªs apartment.,3
14520,Raj,21, What?,3
14521,Howard,21, What do you mean what? It‰Ûªs Halo night.,3
14522,Raj,21, I can‰Ûªt. I‰Ûªm too sick. Go away.,3
14523,Howard,21," That‰Ûªs why we moved Halo night here. Look, I brought my mom‰Ûªs chicken soup.",3
14524,Raj,21, I‰Ûªm not hungry.,3
14525,Elizabeth,21, Don‰Ûªt send him away. Let him in.,3
14526,Howard,21, Who‰Ûªs that,3
14527,Raj,21, I bought a parrot.,3
14528,Howard,21," Yeah, right. Dr. Plimpton?",3
14529,Elizabeth,21," Hi. Howard, right?",3
14530,Howard,21," Uh, yeah.",3
14531,Elizabeth,21," Can I ask you a question, Howard? Do you like role-playing games?",3
14532,Howard,21," Yeah, sure. In fact, I‰Ûªm a dungeon master.",3
14533,Elizabeth,21," Not tonight. Tonight you are a delivery man. You brought soup, but uh-oh, Raj and I don‰Ûªt have enough money to pay you. So we‰Ûªll have to come to some other kind of arrangement.",3
14534,Howard,21, Beg pardon?,3
14535,Elizabeth,21," You two figure out the details, I‰Ûªm going to go change into something I don‰Ûªt mind getting ripped off my milky flesh.",3
14536,Howard,21, What the frak?,3
14537,Raj,21," Go away. She wants New Delhi, not Kosher deli. Besides, you have a girlfriend.",3
14538,Howard,21, We broke up weeks ago.,3
14539,Raj,21, Why didn‰Ûªt you say anything?,3
14540,Howard,21, I was waiting for the right time. This is the right time.,3
14541,Leonard,21," Hey, who‰Ûªs ready for Halo?",3
14542,Raj,21," Oh, this is like a nightmare. Get lost!",3
14543,Howard,21, He‰Ûªs right. The numbers are shaky enough as it is.,3
14544,Leonard,21, I don‰Ûªt understand.,3
14545,Elizabeth,21," Oh, good. Leonard‰Ûªs here.",3
14546,Raj,21, Good?,3
14547,Leonard,21, Elizabeth? What‰Ûªs going on?,3
14548,Elizabeth,21, What‰Ûªs going on is you and Howard are my moving men and Raj is my new landlord and I don‰Ûªt have enough money to pay any of you.,3
14549,Leonard,21, Is she suggesting what I think she‰Ûªs suggesting?,3
14550,Howard,21, Yep. Welcome to the Penthouse Forum.,3
14551,Raj,21," Okay, show of hands. Who‰Ûªs up for this? (Only Howard raises his hand.)",3
14552,Leonard,21, We‰Ûªll all be naked in front of each other.,3
14553,Howard,21, I‰Ûªm out.,3
14554,Elizabeth,21, Everybody ready?,3
14555,Raj,21," Follow my lead. Almost. We‰Ûªre, we‰Ûªre going to go out into the hallway and, uh, make a dramatic entrance.",3
14556,Elizabeth,21," Oh, good. It‰Ûªs so much better when everyone commits.",3
14557,Raj,21," Run. Run, run, run. Don‰Ûªt look back.",3
14558,Leonard,21, I thought we had something special.,3
14559,Raj (locks door),21," So, you say you can‰Ûªt pay your rent?",3
14560,Scene,21, The lobby. ,3
14561,Penny,21," Oh, Leonard?",3
14562,Leonard,21, Hey.,3
14563,Penny,21, I found these in the dryer. I‰Ûªm assuming they belong to Sheldon.,3
14564,Leonard,21," Thanks. It‰Ûªs really hard to find these in his size. So, listen. I‰Ûªve been meaning to talk to you about the other morning.",3
14565,Penny,21, You mean you and Dr. Slutbunny?,3
14566,Leonard,21," Yeah, I wanted to explain.",3
14567,Penny,21," Well, you don‰Ûªt owe me an explanation.",3
14568,Leonard,21, I don‰Ûªt?,3
14569,Penny,21," No, you don‰Ûªt.",3
14570,Leonard,21, So you‰Ûªre not judging me?,3
14571,Penny,21," Oh, I‰Ûªm judging you nine ways to Sunday, but you don‰Ûªt owe me an explanation.",3
14572,Leonard,21," Nevertheless, I‰Ûªd like to get one on the record so you can understand why I did what I did.",3
14573,Penny,21, I‰Ûªm listening.,3
14574,Leonard,21, She let me.,3
14575,Scene,22, Penny‰Ûªs apartment.,3
14576,Penny,22," Okay, Babydoll Pink, let‰Ûªs see if you can cover up the fact that I got my dad‰Ûªs feet.",3
14577,Leonard (voice off),22," It‰Ûªs just two degrees, Sheldon. I just want to turn up the thermostat two degrees!",3
14578,Leonard (voice off),22," Yes, if we lived in a teakettle.",3
14579,Leonard (voice off),22," Aw, screw the roommate agreement!",3
14580,Leonard (voice off),22," You know what, go to Hell and set their thermostat.",3
14581,Penny (after a knock on the door),22, Who is it?,3
14582,Leonard,22, Leonard.,3
14583,Penny,22, Hang on.,3
14584,Leonard,22, Can I sleep on your couch tonight?,3
14585,Penny,22," Uh, well, you can try, but the people across the hall are being very noisy.",3
14586,Leonard,22," You heard that, huh?",3
14587,Penny,22," Apparently, the one fella tried to adjust the thermostat, then the other fella went bat-crap crazy.",3
14588,Leonard,22," So you agree, he‰Ûªs nuts.",3
14589,Penny,22," Well, not as nuts as the guy who chooses to live with him.",3
14590,Leonard,22," Believe it or not, he was worse when I met him.",3
14591,Penny,22," Oh, I do not believe that.",3
14592,Past Leonard,22," Excuse me, I‰Ûªm looking for Sheldon Cooper‰Ûªs apartment.",3
14593,Man with a box,22," Oh, I bet you‰Ûªre here to check out the room for rent.",3
14594,Past Leonard,22, Yeah.,3
14595,Man,22," Run away, dude.",3
14596,Past Leonard,22, What?,3
14597,Man,22," Run fast, run far. (End of flashback.)",3
14598,Leonard,22, That should have been my first clue.,3
14599,Scene,22, Moments later.,3
14600,Penny,22, So Sheldon‰Ûªs last roommate tried to warn you off?,3
14601,Leonard,22," For all I knew, he was the crazy one. He had this really deranged look.",3
14602,Penny,22," Well, yeah, he‰Ûªd been living with Sheldon.",3
14603,Leonard,22," Sure, it makes sense now. (Flashback. Past Leonard is getting out of the lift). Anyway, I went upstairs and knocked on the door.",3
14604,Large Black Transvestite,22, Yeah?,3
14605,Past Leonard,22, Dr. Cooper?,3
14606,Transvestite,22," No, you want the crazy guy across the hall.",3
14607,Leonard,22," In retrospect, that was clue number two.",3
14608,Past Sheldon,22, Yes?,3
14609,Past Leonard,22, I‰Ûªm Leonard Hofstadter. I called you about the apartment. You said‰Û_,3
14610,Past Sheldon,22," I know what I said. I know what you said. I know what my mother said on March 5, 1992. What is the sixth noble gas?",3
14611,Past Leonard,22, What?,3
14612,Past Sheldon,22, You said you‰Ûªre a scientist. What is the sixth noble gas?,3
14613,Past Leonard,22," Uh, radon?",3
14614,Past Sheldon,22, Are you asking me or telling me?,3
14615,Past Leonard,22, Telling you? Telling you.,3
14616,Past Sheldon,22," All right, next question. Kirk or Picard?",3
14617,Past Leonard,22," Oh, uh, well, that‰Ûªs tricky. Um, well, uh, Original Series over Next Generation, but Picard over Kirk.",3
14618,Past Sheldon,22, Correct. You‰Ûªve passed the first barrier to roommate-hood. You may enter.,3
14619,"Past Leonard (Enters apartment. It is bare except for two lawn chairs, a television and some whiteboards)",22," Oh, this is pretty nice. Uh, the bedrooms are back there?",3
14620,Past Sheldon,22, That depends.,3
14621,Past Leonard,22," I don‰Ûªt understand, their, their existence is conditional?",3
14622,Past Sheldon,22," No, but your ability to perceive their existence is conditional on you passing the second and third barriers.",3
14623,Past Leonard,22, There‰Ûªs three?,3
14624,Past Sheldon,22, Each more daunting than the last. Have a seat.,3
14625,Past Leonard,22, Okay.,3
14626,Past Sheldon,22, No! That‰Ûªs where I sit!,3
14627,Past Leonard,22, What‰Ûªs the difference?,3
14628,Past Sheldon,22," This seat is ideally located both in relation to the heat source in the winter and a cross breeze in the summer. It also faces the television at a direct angle allowing me to immerse myself in entertainment or game play without being subjected to conversation. As a result, I‰Ûªve placed it in a state of eternal dibs.",3
14629,Past Leonard,22, Can you do that?,3
14630,Past Sheldon,22," Cathedra mea, regulae meae. That‰Ûªs Latin for my chair, my rules. Now, you said on the phone that your area of study is physics.",3
14631,Past Leonard,22," Uh, yeah, experimental physics.",3
14632,Past Sheldon,22, Hmm.,3
14633,Past Leonard,22, What is that?,3
14634,Past Sheldon,22, Doesn‰Ûªt concern you. You‰Ûªll be going to the university every day?,3
14635,Past Leonard,22, Yes.,3
14636,Past Sheldon,22, And you have a vehicle?,3
14637,Past Leonard,22," A car, yeah.",3
14638,Past Sheldon,22, And you‰Ûªll be willing to drive me?,3
14639,Past Leonard,22," Well, can‰Ûªt you drive?",3
14640,Past Sheldon,22, I can. I choose not to.,3
14641,Past Leonard,22," Okay, I suppose I could drive you. Well that‰Ûªs a point in my favour, right?",3
14642,Past Sheldon,22, Why don‰Ûªt you let me do this.,3
14643,Past Leonard,22," Come on, I just asked.",3
14644,Past Sheldon,22," Last question. In a post-apocalyptic world, which task would you assign the highest priority? Locating a sustainable food source, re-establishing a functioning government, procreating, or preserving the knowledge of mankind?",3
14645,Past Leonard,22," Uh, I‰Ûªm gonna go with preserving the knowledge.",3
14646,Past Sheldon,22," That‰Ûªs correct. FYI, I would have accepted any answer other than procreating. Come, I‰Ûªll show you the rest of the apartment.",3
14647,Past Leonard,22," Oh, good. I passed the barriers.",3
14648,Past Sheldon,22, The second barrier. Don‰Ûªt get cocky. This is the bathroom. Are you fairly regular?,3
14649,Past Leonard,22," Uh, I guess.",3
14650,Past Sheldon,22, This isn‰Ûªt going to work if you‰Ûªre guessing. When do you evacuate your bowels?,3
14651,Past Leonard,22, When I have to.,3
14652,Past Sheldon,22," When you have to? I‰Ûªm sorry, I don‰Ûªt rent to hippies.",3
14653,Past Leonard,22," I, I‰Ûªm sorry, uh, in the morning. Around eight.",3
14654,Past Sheldon,22, I can‰Ûªt give you eight. I can give you seven thirty.,3
14655,Past Leonard,22, Fine. I‰Ûªll take it.,3
14656,Past Sheldon,22, Third barrier passed. You have won the right to see your room. Huzzah!,3
14657,Past Leonard,22, Is this it?,3
14658,Past Sheldon,22," No, this is my room. People don‰Ûªt go in my room.",3
14659,Past Leonard,22, So where do you sleep?,3
14660,Past Sheldon,22, I don‰Ûªt understand.,3
14661,Past Leonard,22," If people don‰Ûªt go in there, and you‰Ûªre people, and‰Û_ You are people, aren‰Ûªt you? Making a joke.",3
14662,Past Sheldon,22, Do you do this often?,3
14663,Past Leonard,22, On occasion.,3
14664,Past Sheldon,22, Your room. You may want to repaint. (End of Flashback),3
14665,Penny,22," Okay, and after all that, you just moved in?",3
14666,Past Sheldon,22, Roommates agree that Friday nights shall be reserved for watching Joss Whedon‰Ûªs brilliant new series Firefly.,3
14667,Past Leonard,22, Does that really need to be in the agreement?,3
14668,Past Sheldon,22," We might as well settle it now, it‰Ûªs going to be on for years. Initial here. All right, that‰Ûªs television and movies. Section nine, miscellany. The apartment‰Ûªs flag is a gold lion rampant on a field of azure.",3
14669,Past Leonard,22, We have a flag?,3
14670,Past Sheldon,22," Never fly it upside down unless the apartment‰Ûªs in distress. And next, if either of us ever invents time travel, we agree our first stop will be this meeting today in precisely five seconds.",3
14671,Past Leonard,22, Okay.,3
14672,Past Sheldon,22, Well that‰Ûªs disappointing. (End of flashback.),3
14673,Penny,22, Why on earth did you agree to all that?,3
14674,Leonard,22," It was the best apartment I‰Ûªd seen, the rent was very reasonable and after you‰Ûªve passed the first three barriers you kind of want to take it all the way.",3
14675,Penny,22," Well, I‰Ûªm sorry, Leonard, it‰Ûªs very hard to feel sympathy for you.",3
14676,Leonard,22," Okay, how about this? Let me tell you about the first time I brought a girl over. (Flashback to Leonard‰Ûªs bedroom.)",3
14677,Past Sheldon,22," (Knock, knock, knock) Leonard?",3
14678,Past Leonard,22, Shh. Just pretend we‰Ûªre not here.,3
14679,Past Sheldon,22," (Knock, knock, knock) Leonard?Leonard?",3
14680,Past Leonard,22, I‰Ûªm sure he‰Ûªll go away.,3
14681,Past Sheldon,22," I‰Ûªm just going to keep knocking till you answer. (Knock, knock, knock) Leonard? (Knock, knock, knock) Leonard? (Knock, knock, knock) Leonard?",3
14682,Past Leonard,22, What do you want? I didn‰Ûªt say come in!,3
14683,Past Sheldon,22," You asked what I wanted. I wanted to come in. I‰Ûªm here because you violated our roommate agreement. Specifically, section eight, visitors, subsection C, females, paragraph four, coitus. Roommates shall give each other 12 hours notice of impending coitus.‰Û",3
14684,Past Leonard,22, I didn‰Ûªt even know her 12 hours ago.,3
14685,Joyce Kim,22, That‰Ûªs it! I‰Ûªm out of here!,3
14686,Past Leonard,22," But, Joyce, come on.",3
14687,Past Sheldon,22, 12 hours? (End of flashback.),3
14688,Penny,22," Oh, my God.",3
14689,Leonard,22, Do I get some sympathy now?,3
14690,Penny,22," A little bit. Okay. Let me get this straight. You move in with this guy, he makes you sign a ridiculous roommate agreement, then he walks into your bedroom while you‰Ûªre doing this Joyce Kim, and you still stay?",3
14691,Leonard,22," Actually, I couldn‰Ûªt get too mad at him about Joyce Kim.",3
14692,Penny,22, Why not?,3
14693,Leonard,22," Well, I was doing some government research at the time, you know, military, rocket fuel. It‰Ûªs kind of secret.",3
14694,Penny,22, What does that have to do with Joyce Kim?,3
14695,Leonard,22," As it turns out, she was a North Korean spy. Luckily, Sheldon drove her out before I revealed anything important. Which I‰Ûªm not saying I would have.",3
14696,Penny,22," So, what, that‰Ûªs it? You‰Ûªve stayed with Sheldon all this time because he kept you from going to federal prison?",3
14697,Leonard,22, That was part of it. The other part is what happened with the elevator.,3
14698,Penny,22," Oh, yeah, I‰Ûªm wondering about that. You said it was working when you moved in.",3
14699,Leonard,22," It was, but one night, Sheldon came home from work‰Û_ (Flashback, the apartment. The settee has now appeared. Leonard, Howard and Raj are playing a video game.)",3
14700,Past Sheldon,22, What is going on here?,3
14701,Past Leonard,22," Hey, Sheldon. This is Howard and Raj. They work at the university, too.",3
14702,Past Howard,22, Hey.,3
14703,Past Raj,22, Hey.,3
14704,Past Sheldon,22, I‰Ûªll get to you later. What are you sitting on?,3
14705,Past Howard,22," I can‰Ûªt speak for these guys, but I‰Ûªm sitting on my tushie. It‰Ûªs a joke.",3
14706,Past Leonard,22," Yeah, not a good idea.",3
14707,Past Raj,22," Tushie is buttocks, right?",3
14708,Past Howard,22, Right.,3
14709,Past Raj,22, Hilarious.,3
14710,Past Sheldon,22, Explain the couch.,3
14711,Past Leonard,22," Oh, well, there were some people on the first floor moving out, and they sold it to me for a hundred dollars. Howard and Raj helped me bring it up.",3
14712,Past Sheldon,22, But what‰Ûªs wrong with the furniture we have?,3
14713,Past Leonard,22, They‰Ûªre lawn chairs. And there was no place for company.,3
14714,Past Sheldon,22, Did it occur to you that was by design?,3
14715,Past Leonard,22," According to the roommate agreement, I‰Ûªm entitled to allocate 50% of the cubic footage of the common areas.",3
14716,Past Sheldon,22," But you didn‰Ûªt notify me by e-mail, so this is still a breach.",3
14717,Past Leonard,22, I did notify you.,3
14718,Past Sheldon,22," Oh, you did, did you? Oh, drat! Hoisted by my own spam filter.",3
14719,Past Leonard,22, What am I doing in your spam folder?,3
14720,Past Sheldon,22," I put you there after you forwarded me a picture of a cat playing the piano, entitled this is funny.",3
14721,Past Raj,22," Oh, yeah, I saw that. That was hilarious. (End of flashback.)",3
14722,Penny,22," Okay, what does all this have to do with the elevator?",3
14723,Leonard,22, I‰Ûªm getting to it. (Back to flashback.),3
14724,Past Sheldon,22," I assure you, you‰Ûªll be sorry you wasted your money on an iPod when Microsoft comes out with theirs.",3
14725,Past Raj,22," Okay, do you have an opinion about everything?",3
14726,Past Sheldon,22, Yes.,3
14727,Past Howard,22, And you just assume you‰Ûªre always right?,3
14728,Past Sheldon,22, It‰Ûªs not an assumption. Change seats with me.,3
14729,Past Raj,22, Why?,3
14730,Past Sheldon,22, I don‰Ûªt like this spot. I have to keep turning my head.,3
14731,Past Raj,22, Fine.,3
14732,Past Leonard,22," Ooh, it‰Ûªs time for Babylon 5!",3
14733,Past Sheldon,22, We don‰Ûªt watch Babylon 5 in this apartment.,3
14734,Past Leonard,22, Why not?,3
14735,Past Sheldon,22, Because no one likes Babylon 5.,3
14736,Past Leonard,22, I like it.,3
14737,Past Raj,22," Me, too.",3
14738,Past Howard,22, So do I.,3
14739,Past Leonard,22, There you go‰ÛÒ three against one.,3
14740,Past Sheldon,22," They don‰Ûªt get a vote. It‰Ûªs one against one. And according to the roommate agreement, all ties will be settled by me.",3
14741,Past Leonard,22, But I said no to that.,3
14742,Past Sheldon,22, And I said yes. And I settle all ties. Change seats with me.,3
14743,Past Howard,22, Why?,3
14744,Past Sheldon,22, There‰Ûªs a draft on my neck over here.,3
14745,Past Howard,22," So, I get the draft?",3
14746,Past Sheldon,22, You‰Ûªre protected by your turtleneck.,3
14747,Past Howard,22, Fine. And it‰Ûªs a dickey.,3
14748,Past Sheldon,22," Hmm, I‰Ûªm still not comfortable. Of course. There‰Ûªs too many people here.",3
14749,Past Leonard,22, We can fix that. Let‰Ûªs leave.,3
14750,Past Howard,22," Yeah, we can go over to my place.",3
14751,Past Sheldon,22, Wait. Let me get my jacket.,3
14752,Past Howard,22, You‰Ûªre not going with us.,3
14753,Past Sheldon,22, Why not?,3
14754,Past Raj,22, You‰Ûªre the guy we‰Ûªre trying to get away from.,3
14755,Past Sheldon,22," Oh. Well, in that case, I don‰Ûªt need my jacket. And for the record, the correct syntax is I‰Ûªm the guy from whom you‰Ûªre trying to get away. Oh, yes, this is definitely going to be my spot. (End of flashback.)",3
14756,Penny,22," Okay, how do you know he said that? You left the room.",3
14757,Leonard,22," Hey, do you want me to finish working on your man feet or not?",3
14758,Penny,22, Fine. Go ahead. (Flashback to Howard‰Ûªs bedroom.),3
14759,Mrs Wolowitz,22," Howard, are you having a playdate?",3
14760,Past Howard,22, I don‰Ûªt have playdates! I have colleagues!,3
14761,Mrs Wolowitz,22, Do their parents know they‰Ûªre here?,3
14762,Past Howard,22," No, but if you keep screaming, maybe they‰Ûªll hear you!",3
14763,Past Leonard,22, That your dad?,3
14764,Past Howard,22," She grows any more hair on her face, yes.",3
14765,Past Leonard,22," Oh, man. Is that a two-stage rocket?",3
14766,Past Howard,22, Three. I designed the engine myself.,3
14767,Past Raj,22, Cool. Can it break Mach 1?,3
14768,Past Howard,22," Oh, probably, if I could get my hands on that new fuel the government‰Ûªs been working on.",3
14769,Past Leonard,22," Oh, this just might be your lucky day.",3
14770,Mrs Wolowitz,22," Howard, what happened to the Oreos I left on the counter?!",3
14771,Past Howard,22, I haven‰Ûªt seen your Oreos! Just take your bath without them! (End of flashback.),3
14772,Penny,22," So, why was it his lucky day?",3
14773,Leonard,22," Well, it turns out I had a little rocket fuel in the apartment.",3
14774,Penny,22, What were you doing with rocket fuel in your apartment?,3
14775,Leonard,22," Mm, Joyce Kim was kind of curious about what I did for a living, and I was going to kind of show it to her. It‰Ûªs not important. The point is, the guys and I went back to the apartment.",3
14776,Penny,22, Are we ever going to get to the elevator?,3
14777,Leonard,22," Yeah, we‰Ûªre really close. Uh, uh, we‰Ûªre at the apartment. (Flashback.)",3
14778,Past Leonard,22," The trick is to mix it into Tovex in order to create a combustible gel that will generate over 8,000 kilonewtons of thrust.",3
14779,Past Howard,22, Nice.,3
14780,Past Raj,22, Cool.,3
14781,Past Sheldon,22, Won‰Ûªt work.,3
14782,Past Leonard,22," Excuse me, but I‰Ûªve been working on this a long time. Trust me, it‰Ûªll work.",3
14783,Past Sheldon,22," You don‰Ûªt see your mistake, do you?",3
14784,Past Leonard,22, There‰Ûªs no mistake.,3
14785,Past Sheldon,22," This is for a full-scale rocket, not a model.",3
14786,Past Leonard,22," Well, I‰Ûªve adjusted the formula.",3
14787,Past Sheldon,22, Not correctly.,3
14788,Past Leonard,22," Okay, I‰Ûªve had it with you. You might be an expert on theoretical physics and science-fiction programs and where to sit on a freaking couch, but this is applied physics. And when it comes to applied physic‰Û_ uh-oh.",3
14789,Past Howard,22, What‰Ûªs happening?,3
14790,Past Leonard,22, A bad thing. A very bad thing. Get the door. Get the door! Get the door! Get the door! Get the door!,3
14791,Past Howard,22, You‰Ûªre waiting for the elevator?,3
14792,Past Leonard,22, Oh. Right.,3
14793,Past Raj,22, Wait. It‰Ûªs here.,3
14794,Past Sheldon,22, Give me that. (Takes the rocket fuel. Puts it in elevator. Presses button and jumps out.),3
14795,Past Leonard,22, What‰Ûªd you do that for? I had plenty of time. (Elevator explodes.),3
14796,Past Sheldon,22, You‰Ûªre welcome. (End of flashback.),3
14797,Leonard,22," Not only did Sheldon save my life, he didn‰Ûªt rat me out to the landlord. Or the police. Or Homeland Security.",3
14798,Penny,22," Okay, so, basically, you‰Ûªre the reason I have to walk up and down three flights of stairs every day?",3
14799,Leonard,22, So I did something stupid. I‰Ûªm sure you did stupid things when you were younger. What were you doing seven years ago?,3
14800,Penny,22," Excuse me, I was in high school. Studying, keeping my nose clean, doing volunteer work for the community. (Flashback. Penny is in her bedroom, sitting on the bed with a guy, looking at a pregnancy tester.)",3
14801,Past Penny,22, Not pregnant. Yes!,3
14802,Scene,22, The apartment. ,3
14803,Sheldon,22," Oh, Ubuntu, you are my favourite Linux-based operating system.",3
14804,Leonard,22, Hey.,3
14805,Sheldon,22, Hello. Why do I smell methacrylate?,3
14806,Leonard,22," Oh, uh, clear nail polish. I had a mani-pedi. Men can get those. Anyway, I may owe you an apology.",3
14807,Sheldon,22, There‰Ûªs doubt?,3
14808,Leonard,22," I did agree to the thermostat setting, and I shouldn‰Ûªt have tried to change it.",3
14809,Sheldon,22," That‰Ûªs not an apology, simply an acknowledgement that I was right.",3
14810,Leonard,22," Okay, I‰Ûªm sorry.",3
14811,Sheldon,22, There you go.,3
14812,Leonard,22," So, we‰Ûªre good?",3
14813,Sheldon,22, Good what?,3
14814,Leonard,22, Never mind. Okay if I watch some TV?,3
14815,Sheldon,22, Go ahead.,3
14816,Television voice,22, Up next Babylon 5.,3
14817,Scene,22, Penny‰Ûªs apartment.,3
14818,Leonard (voice off),22, You‰Ûªre not even watching!,3
14819,Sheldon (voice off),22, I can hear it!,3
14820,Leonard (voice off),22," Oh, so the dialogue offends you?",3
14821,Sheldon (voice off),22, I would hardly call that dialogue!,3
14822,Leonard (voice off),22," You‰Ûªre insane, you know that?!",3
14823,Sheldon (voice off),22," Don‰Ûªt make me turn that flag upside down, ‰Ûªcause you know I‰Ûªll do it!",3
14824,Scene,23, On the roof of the apartment building.,3
14825,Leonard,23," Okay, we‰Ûªve got power to the laser.",3
14826,Sheldon,23, I should‰Ûªve brought an umbrella.,3
14827,Leonard,23, What for? It‰Ûªs not going to rain.,3
14828,Sheldon,23," I know that, but with skin as fair as mine, moon burn is a real possibility.",3
14829,Howard,23," That‰Ûªs a bazinga, right?",3
14830,Sheldon,23," One of my best, don‰Ûªt you think?",3
14831,Leonard,23," Howard, do you want to double-check the equatorial mount on the laser? We need it locked onto the Sea of Tranquility.",3
14832,Howard,23," You got it. Oh, Raj, no. Billions of dollars have gone into inventing the Internet and filling it with pictures of naked women, so we don‰Ûªt have to peep through windows.",3
14833,Raj,23," It‰Ûªs not like that, I‰Ûªm watching someone‰Ûªs TV. The Good Wife is on. I tell you, this is my new Grey‰Ûªs Anatomy.",3
14834,Sheldon,23," Leonard, Leonard. What is that? What is that?",3
14835,Leonard,23," Relax, it‰Ûªs just a dirty sock.",3
14836,Sheldon,23, How on earth can you say dirty sock and relax in the same sentence?,3
14837,Leonard,23," Sheldon, the world is filled with dirty discarded socks.",3
14838,Sheldon,23, Not my world.,3
14839,Leonard,23," Hey, you know who‰Ûªd really dig seeing this experiment? Penny.",3
14840,Sheldon,23," I wasn‰Ûªt aware that lunar ranging was her thing. Although, I suppose the retro-reflector left on the moon by Neil Armstrong does qualify as a shiny object.",3
14841,Raj,23, Why don‰Ûªt you ask her to come up?,3
14842,Leonard,23," I don‰Ûªt know, it‰Ûªs still a little weird since, you know‰Û_",3
14843,Howard,23, She dumped you?,3
14844,Leonard,23, She didn‰Ûªt dump me. We were just in different places in the relationship.,3
14845,Sheldon,23, I fail to see how a relationship can have the qualities of a geographic location.,3
14846,Howard,23," Oh, it‰Ûªs very simple. Leonard was living in a little town called please don‰Ûªt leave me, while Penny had just moved to the island of bye-bye.",3
14847,Leonard,23, Screw you guys. I‰Ûªm gonna go see if she‰Ûªs home.,3
14848,Howard,23," If it‰Ûªs not too much trouble, I‰Ûªd like to point this at the moon now.",3
14849,Raj,23," Wait a second, the good wife is crying. Something‰Ûªs very wrong.",3
14850,Scene,23, Penny‰Ûªs door.,3
14851,Penny,23," Oh, hi. What‰Ûªs going on?",3
14852,Leonard,23, We‰Ûªre up on the roof bouncing laser beams off the moon.,3
14853,Penny,23," I‰Ûªm sorry, what?",3
14854,Leonard,23, It‰Ûªs pretty cool. We‰Ûªve got a two-meter parabolic reflector and everything. I thought you might want to see it.,3
14855,Man in Penny‰Ûªs Apartment,23, That makes no sense.,3
14856,Penny,23, Um‰Û_,3
14857,Man,23, How can you bounce stuff off the moon? There‰Ûªs no gravity.,3
14858,Penny,23," Uh, Leonard, this is Zack. Zack, Leonard.",3
14859,Zack,23, Hey.,3
14860,Leonard,23," Oh, sorry, I didn‰Ûªt know you were busy. Maybe another time.",3
14861,Penny,23," Yeah, maybe.",3
14862,Zack,23," Hey, I want to see this laser thing.",3
14863,Penny,23," Oh, but what about the party?",3
14864,Zack,23," It‰Ûªs a surprise party, doesn‰Ûªt matter when we get there.",3
14865,Penny,23," Oh, right.",3
14866,Leonard,23," Okay, well, yeah, come on up. So, how‰Ûªd you two guys meet?",3
14867,Zack,23, My company designs the menus for the Cheesecake Factory.,3
14868,Leonard,23, Your company?,3
14869,Zack,23," Well,, my dad, but me and my sister are VPs.",3
14870,Leonard,23," So, menus.",3
14871,Zack,23, I know it sounds easy but there‰Ûªs a lot of science that goes in designing them.,3
14872,Scene,23, The roof.,3
14873,Howard,23, Happy now? I‰Ûªm moving the dirty sock.,3
14874,Sheldon,23," Thank you. Raj, keep an eye out for the other one.",3
14875,Penny,23," Hey, guys, this is my friend Zack.",3
14876,Zack,23, Hey.,3
14877,Sheldon,23, Hello.,3
14878,Zack,23, Whoa! Is that the laser? It‰Ûªs bitchin‰Ûª.,3
14879,Sheldon,23," Yes. In 1917, when Albert Einstein established the theoretic foundation for the laser in his paper Zur Quantentheorie der Strahlung, his fondest hope was that the resultant device be bitchin‰Ûª.",3
14880,Zack,23," Well, mission accomplished.",3
14881,Leonard,23," Let me explain what we‰Ûªre doing here. Um, in 1969, the astronauts on Apollo 11 positioned reflectors on the surface of the moon, and we‰Ûªre going to shoot a laser off one of them and let the light bounce back into this photomultiplier.",3
14882,Penny,23, Oh! That‰Ûªs very cool.,3
14883,Zack,23, One question. How can you be sure it won‰Ûªt blow up?,3
14884,Leonard,23, The laser?,3
14885,Zack,23, The moon.,3
14886,Sheldon,23," See, now this is a man for Penny.",3
14887,Leonard,23," Uh, that‰Ûªs a great question, Zack.",3
14888,Sheldon,23," No, it‰Ûªs not.",3
14889,Penny,23, Sheldon! Play nice.,3
14890,Sheldon,23, Well it‰Ûªs not a great question. How could somebody possibly think we‰Ûªre going to blow up the moon? That‰Ûªs a great question.,3
14891,Leonard,23," Don‰Ûªt worry about the moon. We, we set our laser to stun.",3
14892,Zack,23, Smart.,3
14893,Leonard,23," Now, we‰Ûªll be able to see the beam when it leaves, but it won‰Ûªt be strong enough when it comes back to be seen by the naked eye.",3
14894,Zack,23, Naked.,3
14895,Leonard,23," Right. Uh yeah, funny. Uh, that device there will measure the photons that return and let us see it on this computer. Raj, get them some glasses.",3
14896,Zack,23," Cool, it‰Ûªs gonna be in 3-D?",3
14897,Howard,23, Preparing to fire laser at the moon.,3
14898,Sheldon,23, Make it so.,3
14899,Howard,23, There it is. There‰Ûªs the spike!,3
14900,Leonard,23, 2.5 seconds for the light to return. That‰Ûªs the moon! We hit the moon!,3
14901,Zack,23, That‰Ûªs your big experiment? All that for a line on the screen?,3
14902,Leonard,23," Yeah, but, uh, think about what this represents. The fact that we can do this is the only way of definitively proving that there are man-made objects on the moon, put there by a member of a species that only 60 years before had just invented the airplane.",3
14903,Zack,23, What species is that?,3
14904,Sheldon,23, I was wrong. Penny can do better.,3
14905,Penny,23," Okay, guys, thank you, it‰Ûªs been fun.",3
14906,Zack,23," Yeah, thanks. Should we invite them to the party?",3
14907,Penny,23," No, just keep walking.",3
14908,Sheldon,23, He must be very skilled at coitus.,3
14909,Scene,23, The apartment. ,3
14910,Raj,23," I‰Ûªm telling you, dude, the only way to feel better about Penny going out with other guys is for you to get back on the whores.",3
14911,Howard,23, Horse.,3
14912,Raj,23, What?,3
14913,Howard,23," The phrase is get back on the horse, not whores.",3
14914,Raj,23," That‰Ûªs disgusting, dude.",3
14915,Howard,23," No, it‰Ûªs not‰Û_ Never mind. He is right, though. If you want, I can turn you on to this great new dating site I found.",3
14916,Leonard,23," No, thanks.",3
14917,Howard,23, You sure? They say they can find a match for anybody.,3
14918,Leonard,23, Have they found a match for you?,3
14919,Howard,23," Tons. I‰Ûªve had, like, eight dates in the last month. And twelve if you count the ones who showed up and left.",3
14920,Sheldon,23, I can‰Ûªt bring the nitrogen tank down.,3
14921,Leonard,23, Why not?,3
14922,Sheldon,23," All right, let me restate that. It‰Ûªs very heavy, and I don‰Ûªt want to.",3
14923,Leonard,23, I‰Ûªll help you.,3
14924,Sheldon,23," Thank you. Lift with your knees, not your back. Good night.",3
14925,Raj,23, You know what would be fun? Signing Sheldon up for online dating.,3
14926,Howard,23," Yeah, right.",3
14927,Raj,23," No, think about it. We make it an experiment. Like when Frankenstein‰Ûªs monster was lonely and he found a wife.",3
14928,Howard,23, He didn‰Ûªt find a wife. They built him a wife out of dead body parts.,3
14929,Raj,23," Okay, we‰Ûªll call that plan B.",3
14930,Scene,23, The apartment. It is night and the lights are off. Knocking.,3
14931,Leonard,23, Coming!,3
14932,Penny,23," Damn you, you rat bastard.",3
14933,Leonard,23, Are you drunk?,3
14934,Penny,23," Zack was a perfectly nice guy, and then you ruined him!",3
14935,Leonard,23, How did I ruin him?,3
14936,Penny,23," ‰Û÷Cause in the olden days, I never would‰Ûªve known he was so stupid.",3
14937,Leonard,23," Come on, he wasn‰Ûªt that stupid.",3
14938,Penny,23," Yes, he was! He thought you were gonna blow up the moon!",3
14939,Leonard,23," Okay, yeah, he‰Ûªs stupid.",3
14940,Penny,23, He spent the entire night bragging about how he invented the word appe-teasers.,3
14941,Leonard,23, How is that my fault?,3
14942,Penny,23," You have destroyed my ability to tolerate idiots. Now, come with me.",3
14943,Leonard,23, Where are we going?,3
14944,Penny,23, We‰Ûªre gonna have sex.,3
14945,Leonard,23," Why? I mean, okay.",3
14946,Sheldon,23, What‰Ûªs going on?,3
14947,Penny,23," Put on your noise-cancelling headphones, ‰Ûªcause it‰Ûªs gonna get loud.",3
14948,Sheldon,23, Oh! Not this again.,3
14949,Scene,23, The next morning.,3
14950,Sheldon,23," In what universe is this low-pulp? Good morning, Penny.",3
14951,Penny,23," What, do you have eyes in the back of your head?",3
14952,Sheldon,23," When one gets beaten up every other day in school, one of necessity develops a keen sense of hearing. Incidentally, one can get beaten up in school simply by referring to oneself as one. I‰Ûªm making English muffins. Would you like an English muffin?",3
14953,Penny,23," Oh, thanks, I‰Ûªm not hungry.",3
14954,Sheldon,23," FYI, my noise-cancelling headphones proved ineffective last night.",3
14955,Penny,23," Yeah, sorry about that.",3
14956,Sheldon,23," As a native Texan, I must say I‰Ûªve never heard the phrase yee-haw used in quite that context.",3
14957,Penny,23," Oh, God.",3
14958,Sheldon,23," Oh, God. That I‰Ûªve heard on multiple occasions. In what universe is that lightly toasted? This has to be the worst day of my life. Good morning, Leonard.",3
14959,Leonard,23, How many times have I asked you not to do that?,3
14960,Sheldon,23, Counting this instance? 317.,3
14961,Leonard,23, Where‰Ûªs Penny?,3
14962,Sheldon,23, She returned to her apartment. I presume to shower and vomit. Not necessarily in that order.,3
14963,Leonard,23, I wonder why she didn‰Ûªt say good-bye.,3
14964,Sheldon,23, Are you expecting me to offer an explanation of human behaviour?,3
14965,Leonard,23," I know. I just thought as an outsider, you might be able to provide a fresh perspective.",3
14966,Sheldon,23, I have no difficulty believing you‰Ûªre not butter.,3
14967,Scene,23, Penny‰Ûªs door.,3
14968,Leonard,23," Oh, hey.",3
14969,Penny,23," Oh, hi. Um, I gotta run. Early shift.",3
14970,Leonard,23," Okay, I‰Ûªll walk down with you. So, last night was fun, huh?",3
14971,Penny,23," Yeah, it must have been. I just threw up in my closet.",3
14972,Leonard,23," Bummer. Anyway, I was thinking tonight maybe we could catch a movie.",3
14973,Penny,23," Oh, yeah, tonight‰Ûªs not great for me.",3
14974,Leonard,23, Doesn‰Ûªt have to be tonight. I‰Ûªm free pretty much always.,3
14975,Penny,23," Leonard, last night was a mistake.",3
14976,Leonard,23," When you say mistake, do you mean a fortunate mistake, like the discovery of penicillin?",3
14977,Penny,23," Look, I‰Ûªm sorry. I was drunk, I was lonely, I hated Zack. Can we just forget it ever happened?",3
14978,Leonard,23," No, it‰Ûªs pretty well imprinted on my brain. Especially the whole rodeo thing.",3
14979,Penny,23," Oh, God!",3
14980,Leonard,23," So, that‰Ûªs it? Wham, bam, thank you, Leonard?",3
14981,Penny,23," Look, I said I‰Ûªm sorry. Can‰Ûªt u please let it go?",3
14982,Leonard,23," How am I supposed to let it go? You used me for sex! Morning, Mrs. Gunderson.",3
14983,Mrs Gunderson,23," Good morning, Leonard. Or should I say yee-haw?",3
14984,Scene,23, The apartment. ,3
14985,Raj,23, Holy crap.,3
14986,Howard,23, What?,3
14987,Raj,23, We finally have proof that aliens walk among us.,3
14988,Howard,23, Excuse me?,3
14989,Raj,23, The dating site matched a woman with Sheldon.,3
14990,Howard,23, You‰Ûªre kidding. An actual woman?,3
14991,Raj,23," Yeah, look. Breasts and everything.",3
14992,Howard,23," Trust me, breasts doesn‰Ûªt necessarily mean woman.",3
14993,Raj,23, Since when?,3
14994,Howard,23," I‰Ûªll show you a picture of my Uncle Louie in a bathing suit sometime. Leonard, you gotta see this, we found a match for Sheldon.",3
14995,Leonard,23," Great. Maybe she can have sex with him, and then walk out on him the next morning without so much as a how do you do?",3
14996,Raj,23, Do you know what he‰Ûªs talking about?,3
14997,Howard,23, Nope. Why don‰Ûªt you ask him?,3
14998,Raj,23," Leonard, what are you talking about?",3
14999,Leonard,23, I don‰Ûªt want to talk about it.,3
15000,Raj,23, That was a lousy suggestion.,3
15001,Howard,23," Whatever. Right now, Dr. Sheldon Cooper has to send an e-mail to his perfect match. Greetings, fellow life-form‰Û_",3
15002,Scene,23, A building corridor.,3
15003,Leonard,23," If she can do it, I can do it. If she can do it, I can do it. If she can do it, I can do it. (Knocks on door) I can‰Ûªt do it.",3
15004,Leslie Winkle,23, Hello?,3
15005,Leonard,23," Oh, hi. Hey. Hi, Leslie.",3
15006,Leslie,23, Leonard Hofstadter. What‰Ûªre you doing here?,3
15007,Leonard,23," Uh, I know! It‰Ûªs been a while!",3
15008,Leslie,23," Yeah, 18 months.",3
15009,Leonard,23, Right. Right. So how you doing?,3
15010,Leslie,23, Fine. You?,3
15011,Leonard,23," Uh, not bad. You remember when we used to have sex and you said that it didn‰Ûªt mean anything, it was just for fun?",3
15012,Leslie,23, Yeah.,3
15013,Leonard,23," Uh, do you, uh, want to do that again?",3
15014,Leslie,23, What happened? Blondie dumped you?,3
15015,Leonard,23, She didn‰Ûªt dump me. We were just in different places in the relationship.,3
15016,Leslie,23, Right.,3
15017,Leonard,23," Um, anyway, apparently, it‰Ûªs okay to go back to people you‰Ûªre no longer seeing and have recreational sex with them.",3
15018,Leslie,23, Uh-huh.,3
15019,Leonard,23," So, what do you say?",3
15020,Leslie,23, Let me think about it. (Slams door.),3
15021,Leonard,23, She‰Ûªs not coming back.,3
15022,Scene,23, The apartment. ,3
15023,Raj,23, Uh-oh. She wants to meet us.,3
15024,Howard,23, Not us. Him.,3
15025,Raj,23," Yes, but him doesn‰Ûªt even know about her.",3
15026,Howard,23," Well, him about to find out about her.",3
15027,Raj,23, Really? Us gonna tell him?,3
15028,Sheldon,23, Who‰Ûªs going to tell whom about what?,3
15029,Howard,23, Sheldon. Hey.,3
15030,Raj,23, Hi.,3
15031,Sheldon,23, Your surprise confuses me. I live here.,3
15032,Howard,23," Right. So, listen, what are you doing tomorrow afternoon?",3
15033,Sheldon,23, Be more specific.,3
15034,Howard,23, Four thirty.,3
15035,Sheldon,23, That‰Ûªs not afternoon. That‰Ûªs preevning.,3
15036,Howard,23, What?,3
15037,Sheldon,23, It‰Ûªs a time of day I invented. It better defines the ambiguous period between afternoon and evening. Preevning. I‰Ûªm fairly certain it will catch on as it fills a desperate need.,3
15038,Raj,23," Right, okay. What are you doing tomorrow preevning?",3
15039,Sheldon,23," Well, tomorrow‰Ûªs Saturday. Saturday night is laundry night, so I‰Ûªll be spending the preevning pre-sorting and pre-soaking.",3
15040,Sheldon,23," I would snort in derision and throw my arms in the air, exhausted by your constant tomfoolery.",3
15041,Raj,23," But it‰Ûªs true. But we-we put all your vital information into this dating site, answered all their questions just like you would, and they found a match for you. Her name is Amy Farrah Fowler.",3
15042,Sheldon,23," Please. Even assuming you could answer any question the way I would, the algorithms used by matchmaking sites are complete hokum.",3
15043,Howard,23," And that‰Ûªs exactly the answer we gave to the question, what is your attitude towards online dating‰Û",3
15044,Raj,23," Howard wanted to write mumbo jumbo, but I said no, our Sheldon would say hokum.",3
15045,Howard,23," Well, come on, where‰Ûªs your scientific curiosity?",3
15046,Sheldon,23," Well, most of it is being applied to unravelling the secrets of the universe while the rest of it‰Ûªs wondering why I‰Ûªm having this conversation with you.",3
15047,Raj,23," Okay, how about this. Even Spock had a date once every seven years.",3
15048,Sheldon,23, He didn‰Ûªt date. It was pon farr. His blood boiled with mating lust.,3
15049,Howard,23," Okay, well, why don‰Ûªt you start with a cup of coffee, and you can pon farr Amy Farrah Fowler later.",3
15050,Sheldon,23, I don‰Ûªt drink coffee.,3
15051,Howard,23," All right, you can have a hot chocolate.",3
15052,Sheldon,23," As I will not be engaging in this nonsense, my choice of beverage is moot. But for the record, I only drink hot chocolate in months with an R in them.",3
15053,Howard,23, Why?,3
15054,Sheldon,23, What‰Ûªs life without whimsy?,3
15055,Howard,23," Okay, I‰Ûªm out.",3
15056,Raj,23," Sheldon, I‰Ûªve hidden the dirty sock from the roof somewhere in your apartment. Unless you are willing to come with us to meet this girl, it will remain there forever.",3
15057,Sheldon,23, You‰Ûªre bluffing.,3
15058,Raj,23, Are you willing to risk it?,3
15059,Sheldon,23, Curse you.,3
15060,Scene,23, The hallway. Leonard is finishing off a bottle of spirits. He opens the lift and drops the bottle inside.,3
15061,Leonard,23, Thirty feet.,3
15062,Penny,23," Oh. Hey, Leonard.",3
15063,Leonard,23," I was a perfectly happy, geeky, little lonely guy, and you ruined me!",3
15064,Penny,23, Are you drunk?,3
15065,Leonard,23," Come on. We‰Ûªre gonna have sex, and it‰Ûªs not gonna mean a thing!",3
15066,Penny,23, Are you out of your mind?!,3
15067,Leonard,23, I‰Ûªm really starting to think there‰Ûªs a double standard here.,3
15068,Scene,23, A coffee shop.,3
15069,Sheldon,23," In a few minutes, when I gloat over the failure of this enterprise, how would you prefer I do it? The standard I told you so? The classic neener-neener? Or just my normal look of haughty derision?",3
15070,Raj,23, You don‰Ûªt know we‰Ûªre wrong yet.,3
15071,Sheldon,23, Haughty derision it is.,3
15072,Amy,23, Excuse me. I‰Ûªm Amy Farrah Fowler. You‰Ûªre Sheldon Cooper.,3
15073,Sheldon,23," Hello, Amy Farrah Fowler. I‰Ûªm sorry to inform you that you have been taken in by unsupportable mathematics designed to prey on the gullible and the lonely. Additionally, I‰Ûªm being blackmailed with a hidden dirty sock.",3
15074,Amy,23," If that was slang, I‰Ûªm unfamiliar with it. If it was literal, I share your aversion to soiled hosiery. In any case, I‰Ûªm here because my mother and I have agreed that I will date at least once a year.",3
15075,Sheldon,23, Interesting. My mother and I have the same agreement about church.,3
15076,Amy,23," I don‰Ûªt object to the concept of a deity, but I‰Ûªm baffled by the notion of one that takes attendance.",3
15077,Sheldon,23," Well, then you might want to avoid East Texas.",3
15078,Amy,23," Noted. Now, before this goes any further, you should know that all forms of physical contact up to and including coitus are off the table.",3
15079,Sheldon,23, May I buy you a beverage?,3
15080,Amy,23," Tepid water, please.",3
15081,Howard,23," Good God, what have we done?",3
15082,Scene,1, The apartment. A robotic arm is extracting some Chinese takeaway from a bag controlled by Howard.,4
15083,Howard,1, And now the kung pao chicken.,4
15084,Leonard,1, Alright.,4
15085,Raj,1, Smooth.,4
15086,Howard,1," And finally, my moo shu pork.",4
15087,Raj,1, Whoo-hoo!,4
15088,Howard,1," Ah, there you have it, gentlemen. Our entire dinner unpacked by robot.",4
15089,Raj,1, And it only took 28 minutes.,4
15090,Sheldon,1," Impressive, but we must be cautious.",4
15091,Howard,1, Why?,4
15092,Sheldon,1," Today, it‰Ûªs a Chinese food retrieval robot. Tomorrow, it travels back in time and tries to kill Sarah Connor.",4
15093,Leonard,1," I don‰Ûªt think that‰Ûªs going to happen, Sheldon.",4
15094,Sheldon,1, No one ever does. That‰Ûªs why it happens.,4
15095,Penny (arriving),1, Hey. Is the food here? Ooh. What‰Ûªs that?,4
15096,Howard,1," That, dear lady, is the Wolowitz Programmable Hand, designed for extravehicular repairs on the International Space Station.",4
15097,Penny,1," Ah, cool.",4
15098,Howard,1, Ask me to pass the soy sauce.,4
15099,Penny,1," Oh, does that come up much on the space station?",4
15100,Howard,1, Mostly with Asian and Jewish astronauts.,4
15101,Penny,1, All right. Pass the soy sauce.,4
15102,Howard,1, Coming up. (Starts typing rapidly),4
15103,Leonard,1, So how‰Ûªs work?,4
15104,Penny,1," Oh, it‰Ûªs not bad. Kind of hungry.",4
15105,Leonard,1," Yeah, we all are.",4
15106,Howard,1, Just wait.,4
15107,Sheldon,1," You realize, Penny, that the technology that went into this arm will one day make unskilled food servers such as yourself obsolete.",4
15108,Penny,1, Really? They‰Ûªre going to make a robot that spits on your hamburger?,4
15109,Sheldon,1, I thought you broke up with her. Why is she here?,4
15110,Howard,1," Okay, here we go. Passing the soy sauce. Put out your hand.",4
15111,Penny,1," Oh ha-ha, oh. That‰Ûªs amazing.",4
15112,Sheldon,1," I wouldn‰Ûªt say amazing. At best, it‰Ûªs a modest leap forward from the basic technology that gave us Country Bear Jamboree.",4
15113,Howard,1," Hey, Sheldon?",4
15114,Sheldon,1, Yes? (Howard types. The hand puts up two fingers to Sheldon.) Peace?,4
15115,Howard,1," No, not peace. Hang on.",4
15116,Scene,1, A few moments later.,4
15117,Penny,1, Does NASA know you‰Ûªre using that thing as a napkin holder?,4
15118,Howard,1, You kidding? They still think it‰Ûªs in a secure locker at JPL.,4
15119,Penny,1, You stole it?,4
15120,Howard,1, Borrowed. The trick is to carry it out to your car like you own it.,4
15121,Sheldon (phone gives text alert),1," Excuse me. Oh. Amy‰Ûªs at the dry cleaners, and she‰Ûªs made a very amusing pun. ‰ÛÏI don‰Ûªt care for perchloroethylene, and I don‰Ûªt like glycol ether.‰Û Get it? She doesn‰Ûªt like glycol ether. Sounds like either. (Taps in reply) L-O-L.",4
15122,Penny,1, Who‰Ûªs Amy?,4
15123,Leonard,1, His girlfriend.,4
15124,Penny,1, Sheldon has a girlfriend?,4
15125,Sheldon,1, She‰Ûªs not my girlfriend.,4
15126,Penny,1, How long has this been going on?,4
15127,Leonard,1, Four months.,4
15128,Sheldon,1, She‰Ûªs not my girlfriend.,4
15129,Penny,1," Are you telling me, for the past four months I have been asking you what‰Ûªs new and you never thought to go with Sheldon has a girlfriend?",4
15130,Sheldon,1, She‰Ûªs not my girlfriend.,4
15131,Penny,1," Ah, du-du-du-du-du. How did they meet?",4
15132,Howard,1," Raj and I entered Sheldon‰Ûªs information on a dating site, and it spit out Amy Farrah Fowler.",4
15133,Penny,1," Oh, my God! Sheldon and Amy.",4
15134,Howard,1," Or, as we call them, Shamy.",4
15135,Penny (squeals),1, Shamy. I am so digging the Shamy.,4
15136,Sheldon,1," All right, everyone pay attention. Yes, I have a friend named Amy Farrah Fowler. Yes, she is female. Yes, we communicate on a daily basis, but no, she is not my girlfriend.",4
15137,Penny,1," Okay, well, what do you communicate about?",4
15138,Sheldon,1," Well, my work in physics, her work in neurobiology, and most recently, the possibility of our having a child together.",4
15139,Penny (spits out drink explosively. Howard types. Robot arm hands Penny a napkin),1, Thank you.,4
15140,Leonard,1, Wait a minute‰ÛÒ a child? You never see this girl. You just e-mail and text and Twitter. Now you‰Ûªre considering having a baby?,4
15141,Sheldon,1," Amy pointed out that between the two of us, our genetic material has the potential of producing the first in a line of intellectually superior, benign overlords to guide humanity to a brighter tomorrow.",4
15142,Howard,1, I‰Ûªm guessing that future historians will condemn us for not taking this opportunity to kill Sheldon.,4
15143,Penny,1," Okay, I have a question.",4
15144,Sheldon,1," Yes, Penny.",4
15145,Penny,1, You don‰Ûªt even like people touching you. How are you going to have sex?,4
15146,Sheldon,1, Why on Earth would we have sex?,4
15147,Penny,1," Oh, honey, did your mom not have the talk with you? You know, when your private parts started growing?",4
15148,Sheldon,1," I‰Ûªm quite aware of the way humans usually reproduce, which is messy, unsanitary, and based on living next to you for three years, involves loud and unnecessary appeals to a deity.",4
15149,Penny,1," Oh, God.",4
15150,Sheldon,1," Yes, exactly. Consequently, if Amy and I choose to bring new life into this world, it will be accomplished clinically, with fertility experts in a lab with petri dishes. Which reminds me, you have broad hips and a certain corn-fed vigour. Is your womb available for rental?",4
15151,Leonard,1, Still digging the Shamy?,4
15152,Penny,1," Look, Sheldon, before you race off to the fertility clinic, you might want to think about, uh gee, I don‰Ûªt know, maybe actually spending some time with her.",4
15153,Sheldon,1, You mean dating?,4
15154,Penny,1, Yeah.,4
15155,Sheldon,1, I can‰Ûªt date Amy.,4
15156,Penny,1, Why not?,4
15157,Sheldon,1, She‰Ûªs not my girlfriend.,4
15158,Penny,1," Okay, look, don‰Ûªt think of it as dating a girlfriend. Think of it as, uh, getting to know the future mother of your child.",4
15159,Sheldon,1, Oh. I hadn‰Ûªt considered that. I suppose she will have to have access to our progeny. And you don‰Ûªt think I can achieve the required intimacy via text messaging?,4
15160,Penny,1, Probably not.,4
15161,Sheldon,1, Huh. It would appear as if the phone companies have been lying to me.,4
15162,Scene,1, The hallway.,4
15163,Sheldon,1," (Knock, knock, knock) Penny. (Knock, knock, knock) Penny. (Knock, knock, knock) Penny.",4
15164,Penny,1, You do realize I stand on the other side of the door waiting for you to finish knocking three times.,4
15165,Sheldon,1, I know. I can see the shadow of your feet under the door.,4
15166,Penny,1," Yeah, my point is it‰Ûªs a waste of time.",4
15167,Sheldon,1," If you‰Ûªre looking for an example of a waste of time, I would refer you to the conversation we‰Ûªre having right now.",4
15168,Penny,1, What do you want?,4
15169,Sheldon,1, I‰Ûªve decided to take your advice and have arranged to go on a date with Amy Farrah Fowler.,4
15170,Penny,1," Oh, that‰Ûªs great. Have fun.",4
15171,Sheldon,1, Wait. You have to drive me.,4
15172,Penny,1, What?,4
15173,Sheldon,1, You know I don‰Ûªt drive.,4
15174,Penny,1," Well, go ask Leonard.",4
15175,Sheldon,1," I did. He said, and I quote, ask Penny, it was her cockamamie idea.",4
15176,Penny,1, Leonard said cockamamie?,4
15177,Sheldon,1," Actually, I‰Ûªm paraphrasing. Having been raised in a Christian household, I‰Ûªm uncomfortable with the language he used. And to be honest, I‰Ûªm not entirely comfortable with cockamamie.",4
15178,Penny,1," Okay, fine. When‰Ûªs the date?",4
15179,Sheldon,1, Now.,4
15180,Penny,1, Now?,4
15181,Sheldon,1, Hurry. We‰Ûªre going to be late.,4
15182,Penny,1," Sheldon, did it ever occur to you that I might have other plans?",4
15183,Sheldon,1, I‰Ûªm sorry. Do you have other plans?,4
15184,Penny,1," Well, no, not per se, but‰Û_",4
15185,Sheldon,1, So this conversation is as pointless as your door-knocking soliloquy?,4
15186,Penny,1, Let me get my cockamamie keys.,4
15187,Scene,1, Howard‰Ûªs bedroom. Howard is being massaged by the robot hand.,4
15188,Howard,1," Oh, God, that feels so good. Yeah, that‰Ûªs the spot. Oh, baby.",4
15189,Mrs Wolowitz (off),1," Howard, dinner‰Ûªs ready!",4
15190,Howard,1," I‰Ûªll eat later. I‰Ûªm busy! Oh, yeah. Just like a real hand. Hmm.",4
15191,Scene,1, Penny‰Ûªs car.,4
15192,Sheldon,1, Thank you for driving me.,4
15193,Penny,1, You‰Ûªre welcome.,4
15194,Sheldon,1, I wish you weren‰Ûªt wearing flip-flops. It‰Ûªs dangerous to drive in flip-flops.,4
15195,Penny,1, Sheldon.,4
15196,Sheldon,1, Sorry. I just don‰Ûªt want to be yet another flip-flop fatality.,4
15197,Penny,1, Can I ask you a question?,4
15198,Sheldon,1," Given your community college education, I encourage you to ask me as many as possible.",4
15199,Penny,1," Yeah. Well, my question is, and I‰Ûªm pretty sure I know the answer, is this your first date?",4
15200,Sheldon,1, That depends. Does square-dancing with my sister at a Teens for Jesus Fourth of July Hoedown count as a date?,4
15201,Penny,1, No.,4
15202,Sheldon,1," Then, this is my first date.",4
15203,Penny,1," Okay. Well, then, there‰Ûªs a couple of things you should probably know.",4
15204,Sheldon,1," I have a master‰Ûªs degree and two doctorates. The things I should know, I do know.",4
15205,Penny,1," My point is, I know more about dating than you, and if you were as smart as you think you are, you would listen to me.",4
15206,Sheldon,1," If you know so much, how come I have a date tonight and you have nothing better to do than drive me to it?",4
15207,Penny,1, Fair point.,4
15208,Scene,1, The apartment.,4
15209,Raj,1," You know, there‰Ûªs something I‰Ûªve always wondered about Aquaman.",4
15210,Leonard,1, Yeah?,4
15211,Raj,1, Where does he poop?,4
15212,Leonard,1, What?,4
15213,Raj,1," What would a toilet look like in Atlantis? How would you flush it? And when you did flush it, where would the poop go?",4
15214,Leonard (phone rings),1," Hold that thought. Hey, Howard, what‰Ûªs going on? What? Hold on, Howard, Howard, slow down. The robot hand is stuck on your what? (To Raj) You‰Ûªre not going to believe this.",4
15215,Scene,1, Penny‰Ûªs car. Amy is now in the back seat.,4
15216,Penny,1," So, um, Amy, Sheldon tells me you‰Ûªre a neuro something-or-other.",4
15217,Amy,1, Neurobiologist. Your check engine light is on.,4
15218,Penny,1," Yeah, it‰Ûªs okay.",4
15219,Amy,1, But the light indicates‰Û_,4
15220,Sheldon,1, Don‰Ûªt bother. I‰Ûªve wasted many an hour tilting at that particular windmill.,4
15221,Penny,1," Um, what is that scent you‰Ûªre wearing? It smells great.",4
15222,Amy,1, Dandruff shampoo. I have dry scalp.,4
15223,Penny,1," Ah. Well, your hair looks very nice.",4
15224,Amy,1, Are you a homosexual?,4
15225,Penny,1," No, no, I was just giving you a compliment.",4
15226,Amy,1, Hmm. Would have been more flattered if you were a homosexual.,4
15227,Penny,1," Guys, how ‰Ûªbout some music?",4
15228,Sheldon,1," Oh, no, I wouldn‰Ûªt care for that. Amy?",4
15229,Amy,1," No, thank you.",4
15230,Penny,1," Okay. Uncomfortable silence it is. Hey, Sheldon, have you told Amy what it was like for you growing up in Texas?",4
15231,Sheldon,1, No.,4
15232,Penny,1," Well, why don‰Ûªt you tell her?",4
15233,Sheldon,1, All right. It was hell.,4
15234,Penny,1," Any follow up, Amy?",4
15235,Amy,1, No.,4
15236,Penny,1," I myself grew up in Nebraska. Small town outside of Omaha. You know, nice place, mostly family farms, a few meth labs.",4
15237,Sheldon,1," I‰Ûªm sorry, how is this better than uncomfortable silence?",4
15238,Penny,1, I don‰Ûªt know. I was just trying something.,4
15239,Sheldon,1, Muggles.,4
15240,Scene,1, Howard‰Ûªs bedroom.,4
15241,Raj,1, You slipped and fell into a robot hand?,4
15242,Howard,1, Yes.,4
15243,Raj,1, Penis first?,4
15244,Howard,1," Yes. Now, help me!",4
15245,Leonard,1," I‰Ûªd suggest a lubricant, but I have a feeling you fell on some of that as well.",4
15246,Howard,1," Not funny, Leonard.",4
15247,Raj,1," Really? A robot hand‰Ûªs got a death grip on your junk, dude. That‰Ûªs funny, ask anyone.",4
15248,Howard,1," Please, before my mother walks in, just get this off me!",4
15249,Leonard,1," Okay, let‰Ûªs see.",4
15250,Howard,1," No, no! Don‰Ûªt touch, the program is paused.",4
15251,Leonard,1," Well, then let‰Ûªs un-pause it.",4
15252,Howard,1," No, no! I loaded the wrong program. The hand thinks it‰Ûªs holding a screwdriver in outer space. If you continue the program, it‰Ûªs gonna start twisting.",4
15253,Raj,1," A-All right, um, how about this. When, when Winnie the Pooh got his head stuck in the honey tree, his friends all grabbed onto him and pulled and pulled.",4
15254,Leonard,1," You do what you want, I‰Ûªm not touching another man‰Ûªs honey tree.",4
15255,Raj,1," All right, uh, forget pulling. How about we get an electric saw and cut it off?",4
15256,Howard,1, What? No saws! One circumcision was enough.,4
15257,Leonard,1, How about an acetylene torch?,4
15258,Howard,1," Okay, I can‰Ûªt believe this needs to be said out loud. No pulling, no saws, no torches.",4
15259,Leonard,1," Well, then what do you want us to do?",4
15260,Howard,1, I‰Û_,4
15261,Mrs Wolowitz (off),1," Howard, I made cookies for you and your little friends!",4
15262,Howard,1," That‰Ûªs great, Mom, thanks!",4
15263,Mrs Wolowitz (off),1, I‰Ûªll bring them up with some Hawaiian Punch!,4
15264,Howard,1, Don‰Ûªt come up here!,4
15265,Mrs Wolowitz (off),1, Why not?! Are you ashamed of your mother?!,4
15266,Howard,1," Yes, but that‰Ûªs not the point! Get me out of here.",4
15267,Leonard,1," You have any ideas, Raj?",4
15268,Raj,1," Right now, all I can think about is cookies and Hawaiian Punch.",4
15269,Scene,1, A restaurant.,4
15270,Penny,1," Hey, here‰Ûªs another possible topic of conversation. This is a big night for Sheldon. Right, Sheldon?",4
15271,Sheldon,1, Big night? The winter solstice is a big night. It‰Ûªs over 14 hours in Southern California.,4
15272,Amy,1, That‰Ûªs an amusing factoid.,4
15273,Sheldon,1, Thank you.,4
15274,Penny,1," No, no. My point is, uh, tonight is Sheldon‰Ûªs first official date. Discuss.",4
15275,Amy,1, Is this true?,4
15276,Sheldon,1," Apparently, a semi-incestuous Teens for Jesus Fourth of July Hoedown didn‰Ûªt count.",4
15277,Penny,1," So, um, Amy, what about you? Do you date much?",4
15278,Amy,1," Once a year. It‰Ûªs a deal I made with my mother in exchange for her silence on the matter, as well as the occasional use of her George Foreman Grill that seals in the flavour without the fat. How about you, Penny? Do you go on many dates?",4
15279,Penny,1," Uh, yeah, I wouldn‰Ûªt say many. A few. (Sheldon laugh‰Ûªs strangely). What‰Ûªs (imitates Sheldon‰Ûªs laugh)",4
15280,Sheldon,1, Your characterization of approximately 171 different men as a few.,4
15281,Penny,1, What? Where did you get 171 men?,4
15282,Sheldon,1," Simple extrapolation. In the three years that I‰Ûªve known you, you were single for two. During that time, I saw 17 different suitors. If we work backwards, correcting for observation bias and postulate an initial dating age of 15‰Û_",4
15283,Penny,1," Whoa, wait, wait, wait. I did not start dating at 15.",4
15284,Sheldon,1, I‰Ûªm sorry. 16?,4
15285,Penny,1,14,4
15286,Sheldon,1," My mistake. Now, assuming the left side of a bell curve peaking around the present, that would bring the total up to 193 men. Plus or minus eight men.",4
15287,Amy,1, Remarkable. Did you have sexual intercourse with all of these men?,4
15288,Penny,1, No.,4
15289,Sheldon,1, Although that number would be fairly easy to calculate.,4
15290,Penny,1, Oh.,4
15291,Sheldon,1," Based on the number of awkward encounters I‰Ûªve had with strange men leaving her apartment in the morning, plus the number of times she‰Ûªs returned home wearing the same clothes she wore the night before‰Û_",4
15292,Penny,1," Okay, Sheldon, I think you‰Ûªve made your point.",4
15293,Sheldon,1," So we multiply 193, minus 21 men before the loss of virginity, so 172 times 0.18 gives us 30.96 sexual partners. Let‰Ûªs round that up to 31.",4
15294,Penny,1," Okay, Sheldon, you are so wrong. That is not even close to the real number. I‰Ûªm gonna need a drink over here.",4
15295,Amy,1," This is very interesting. Cultural perceptions are subjective. Penny, to your mind, are you a slut?",4
15296,Penny,1," No! No! No. Let‰Ûªs just all finish our dinners, okay?",4
15297,Sheldon,1, This is an interesting topic. How many sexual encounters have you had?,4
15298,Amy,1, Does volunteering for a scientific experiment in which orgasm was achieved by electronically stimulating the pleasure centres of the brain count?,4
15299,Sheldon,1, I should think so.,4
15300,Amy,1, Then 128.,4
15301,Scene,1," A hospital,=.",4
15302,Leonard,1," Okay, come on. Almost there.",4
15303,Howard,1, Don‰Ûªt tug. No tugging.,4
15304,Raj,1," Next time, take your own advice.",4
15305,Leonard,1," Excuse me, could you help us out?",4
15306,Nurse,1," My, my, my. What do we have here?",4
15307,Howard,1, I slipped and fell.,4
15308,Nurse,1," Yeah, we get that a lot. What is this?",4
15309,Howard,1, It‰Ûªs a robot arm.,4
15310,Nurse,1, Where‰Ûªs the rest of the robot?,4
15311,Howard,1, I only built the arm.,4
15312,Nurse,1," ‰Û÷Cause that‰Ûªs all you needed, right?",4
15313,Howard,1, Can you please just help me?,4
15314,Nurse,1," All right, all right. Hang on, stay calm. (Over PA system)  I need an orderly with a wheelchair. I got a robot hand grasping a man‰Ûªs penis out here.",4
15315,Howard,1, You think you could be a little more discreet?,4
15316,Nurse,1," I‰Ûªm sorry, we don‰Ûªt have a code for robot hand grasping a man‰Ûªs penis. Why is it hooked up to a computer?",4
15317,Leonard,1," Uh, it‰Ûªs what controls the arm.",4
15318,Howard,1, But it‰Ûªs frozen.,4
15319,Nurse,1, Did you try turning it off and back on again?,4
15320,Howard,1," No, you see, it‰Ûªs more complicated than that. (Nurse switches off computer) No, wait! (The hand lets go) Winnie the Pooh is out of the honey tree.",4
15321,Raj,1, Now can we have cookies and Hawaiian Punch?,4
15322,Scene,1, The stairwell. ,4
15323,Sheldon,1, You were right. This was a very productive evening. I saw a whole new side of Amy Farrah Fowler tonight.,4
15324,Penny,1, I did not have sex with 31 guys.,4
15325,Sheldon,1," I‰Ûªll be happy to check the math, but numbers don‰Ûªt lie, Penny. In any event, now that Amy and I have spent quality time together, I feel much more confident proceeding to the next stage of our relationship.",4
15326,Penny,1, And that is?,4
15327,Sheldon,1, Using in vitro fertilization and a surrogate uterus to gift humanity with our progeny.,4
15328,Penny,1, You‰Ûªre still on that?,4
15329,Sheldon,1," In these uncertain times, doesn‰Ûªt humanity deserve a gift?",4
15330,Penny,1," Okay, you know what? I‰Ûªm gonna come at this in a whole new way. Sheldon, if you try to make a baby with Amy in a petri dish, I‰Ûªm gonna tell your mother on you.",4
15331,Sheldon,1, That‰Ûªs no threat. My mother‰Ûªs always wanted a grandchild.,4
15332,Penny,1, Really? Your deeply religious born-again Christian mother wants a test-tube grandbaby born out of wedlock?,4
15333,Sheldon,1, Curses.,4
15334,Penny,1," If I‰Ûªd thought of that in the first place, I could‰Ûªve saved myself this whole night.",4
15335,Sheldon,1," Well, it‰Ûªs not that late. You could still go out and look for number 32. Good night.",4
15336,Leonard (on phone),1," Hey, Howard, what‰Ûªs up?",4
15337,Sheldon,1, I‰Ûªve decided not to procreate.,4
15338,Leonard,1," Yeah, yeah, great. Howard, uh, slow down. What do you mean it happened again?",4
15339,Scene,2, The apartment. Sheldon has a series of whiteboards across the room.,4
15340,Leonard,2, Whatcha doin‰Ûª there? Working on a new plan to catch the roadrunner?,4
15341,Sheldon,2, The humorous implication being that I am Wile E. Coyote?,4
15342,Leonard,2, Yes.,4
15343,Sheldon,2, And this is a schematic for a bird-trapping device that will ultimately backfire and cause me physical injury?,4
15344,Leonard,2, Yes.,4
15345,Sheldon,2, What I‰Ûªm doing here is trying to determine when I‰Ûªm going to die.,4
15346,Leonard,2, A lot of people are working on that research. So what is all this?,4
15347,Sheldon,2," My family history factoring in longevity, propensity for disease, et cetera.",4
15348,Leonard,2, Interesting. Cause of death for Uncle Carl was KBB. What‰Ûªs KBB?,4
15349,Sheldon,2, Killed by badger.,4
15350,Leonard,2, How‰Ûªs that?,4
15351,Sheldon,2," It was Thanksgiving. Uncle Carl said, I think there‰Ûªs a badger living in our chimney. Hand me that flashlight. Those were the last words he ever spoke to us.",4
15352,Leonard,2, I don‰Ûªt think you need to worry about death by badgers being hereditary.,4
15353,Sheldon,2," Not true. The fight or flight instinct is coded genetically. Instead of fleeing, he chose to fight barehanded against a brawny member of the weasel family. Who‰Ûªs to say that I don‰Ûªt share that flawed DNA?",4
15354,Leonard,2, You can always get a badger and find out.,4
15355,Sheldon,2," But seriously, even if I disregard the Uncle Carl factor, at best I have 60 years left.",4
15356,Leonard,2," That long, huh?",4
15357,Sheldon,2, 60 only takes me to here. I need to get to here.,4
15358,Leonard,2, What‰Ûªs there?,4
15359,Sheldon,2," The earliest estimate of the singularity, when man will be able to transfer his consciousness into machines and achieve immortality.",4
15360,Leonard,2," So, you‰Ûªre upset about missing out on becoming some sort of freakish self-aware robot?",4
15361,Sheldon,2, By this much.,4
15362,Leonard,2, Tough break. You want eggs?,4
15363,Sheldon,2," You don‰Ûªt get it, Leonard. I‰Ûªm going to miss so much, the unified field theory,åÊ cold fusion, the dogapus.",4
15364,Leonard,2, What‰Ûªs a dogapus?,4
15365,Sheldon,2, A hybrid dog and octopus. Man‰Ûªs underwater best friend.,4
15366,Leonard,2, Is somebody working on that?,4
15367,Sheldon,2, I was going to. I planned on giving it to myself on my 300th birthday.,4
15368,Leonard,2, Wait a minute. You hate dogs.,4
15369,Sheldon,2, A dogapus can play fetch with eight balls. No one can hate that.,4
15370,Scene,2, The apartment.,4
15371,Howard,2, What do we owe you?,4
15372,Leonard,2, It came to $28.17. Let‰Ûªs say six bucks apiece.,4
15373,Howard,2, Here you go.,4
15374,Leonard,2, Thank you.,4
15375,Penny,2, What?,4
15376,Leonard,2, Never mind. I got it.,4
15377,Penny,2," Oh, you wanted me to pay.",4
15378,Leonard,2, It‰Ûªs no big deal.,4
15379,Penny,2," No, no, no, no. You‰Ûªre right. We‰Ûªre not going out anymore, I should pay for myself. (After Raj whispers to Howard, and Howard laughs) What?",4
15380,Howard,2," He said if he had woman parts, he‰Ûªd eat for free the rest of his life.",4
15381,Penny,2," Yeah, but you wouldn‰Ûªt be able to talk to yourself. I‰Ûªm a little low on cash.",4
15382,Leonard,2, Hmm? How much you got?,4
15383,Penny,2, Nothing.,4
15384,Leonard,2, How can you walk around with no money?,4
15385,Penny,2, I‰Ûªm cute. I get by.,4
15386,Leonard,2," It‰Ûªs okay, you can owe me.",4
15387,Penny,2, Okay.,4
15388,Leonard,2," Sheldon, six bucks.",4
15389,Sheldon,2," No, thank you. I‰Ûªm not eating pizza tonight.",4
15390,Penny,2, But it‰Ûªs Thursday. Thursday‰Ûªs pizza night.,4
15391,Sheldon,2," Not for me. Thursday is now Cruciferous Vegetable Night. Tonight‰Ûªs selection, brussels sprouts.",4
15392,Howard,2, Really? You‰Ûªre changing the Sheldonian calendar?,4
15393,Sheldon,2, It‰Ûªs a small price to pay.,4
15394,Penny,2, For what?,4
15395,Leonard,2," No, no, don‰Ûªt ask.",4
15396,Penny,2," Sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry.",4
15397,Sheldon,2," In order to live long enough to fuse my consciousness with cybernetics, I need to change my diet.",4
15398,Penny,2," Wait. Cybernetics is robot stuff, right?",4
15399,Sheldon,2, Correct.,4
15400,Penny,2, So you want to turn yourself into some sort of robot?,4
15401,Sheldon,2," Essentially, yes.",4
15402,Penny,2," Okay, here‰Ûªs my question. Didn‰Ûªt you already do that?",4
15403,Sheldon,2," Flattering, but sadly, no. I‰Ûªm also planning to begin an exercise regimen designed to strengthen my cardiovascular system. AKA jogging.",4
15404,Penny,2," Wait. Honey,have you ever run before?",4
15405,Sheldon,2," Certainly. I‰Ûªve run from bullies, dogs, angry chickens, and one particularly persistent P.E. teacher determined to bend me over and give me a scoliosis test.",4
15406,Howard (after Raj whispers to him),2," You‰Ûªre right, Penny jogs. Maybe you guys can run together.",4
15407,Sheldon,2," That‰Ûªs an excellent idea. Yeah, if we chat, it will create the illusion of time going faster.",4
15408,Penny,2," No, it won‰Ûªt. Um, how does he know I jog?",4
15409,Howard,2," Oh, he watches you from his car with high-powered binoculars.",4
15410,Penny,2," Oh, my God, that is so creepy!",4
15411,Howard,2, I know! (Raj whispers to him) And he says he‰Ûªs not gonna stop. (Raj whispers to him urgently) Then see a shrink and figure out how to talk to women.,4
15412,Scene,2, Leonard‰Ûªs bedroom,4
15413,Sheldon (off),2," (Knock, knock, knock) Ugh. (Knock, knock, knock) U-u-ugh. (Knock, knock, knock) Lenu-u-ugh.",4
15414,Leonard,2, What the hell? What‰Ûªs the matter?,4
15415,Sheldon,2, I have pain radiating from my navel to my lower right abdomen. I‰Ûªm nauseated and feverish. I believe I may have cholera.,4
15416,Leonard,2," There‰Ûªs no cholera in Pasadena. Just like last summer, when there was no malaria in Pasadena.",4
15417,Sheldon,2," Well, if it‰Ûªs not cholera, then based on a quick Internet search, the other explanations in decreasing order of likelihood are Hirschsprung‰Ûªs Disease, botulism, a 30-foot tapeworm or accidental ingestion of chrysanthemum blossoms.",4
15418,Leonard,2, When would you have accidentally eaten chrysanthemum blossoms?,4
15419,Sheldon,2," It‰Ûªs part of an unlikely scenario that involves sleepwalking and a 24-hour flower mart with a less-than-vigilant proprietor. Oh, Lord, my belly!",4
15420,Leonard,2, Have you had your appendix out?,4
15421,Sheldon,2," I haven‰Ûªt. I‰Ûªve been meaning to, but who has the time?",4
15422,Leonard,2, Let‰Ûªs get you to the hospital.,4
15423,Sheldon,2," So this is how it ends, with cruel irony. Just as I make the commitment to preserving my body, I am betrayed by my appendix, a vestigial organ. Do you know the original purpose of the appendix, Leonard?",4
15424,Leonard,2, No.,4
15425,Sheldon,2, I do. And yet I‰Ûªm doomed while you live on.,4
15426,Leonard,2," Funny how things work out, isn‰Ûªt it?",4
15427,Sheldon,2," Oh, Lord, I think it‰Ûªs about to burst! (Loud sound of farting) On the other hand, it might have been the Brussels sprouts.",4
15428,Leonard,2, Good night.,4
15429,Sheldon,2, Good night. Appendicitis. What a nervous Nelly.,4
15430,Scene,2, The hallway.,4
15431,Sheldon,2," (Knock, knock, knock) Penny. (Knock, knock, knock) Penny. (Knock, knock, knock) Penny.",4
15432,Penny,2," Coming, coming. Hey, nice knees.",4
15433,Sheldon,2, Thank you. They‰Ûªre my mother‰Ûªs.,4
15434,Penny,2, Oh. And the Flash shirt is what? Because you‰Ûªre gonna run really fast?,4
15435,Sheldon,2," No, the Flash shirt is because it‰Ûªs Friday, but it‰Ûªs nice when things work out. Where‰Ûªs your heart rate monitor?",4
15436,Penny,2, I don‰Ûªt have one.,4
15437,Sheldon,2, What about your pedometer?,4
15438,Penny,2, Don‰Ûªt have one.,4
15439,Sheldon,2, Do you have telematics in your shoes connected to an iPod?,4
15440,Penny,2," Uh, no.",4
15441,Sheldon,2," What do you do, you just go out there and gambol about like a bunny?",4
15442,Penny,2," No. I just run till I‰Ûªm hungry, then I stop for a bear claw.",4
15443,Sheldon,2, Why are you doing that?,4
15444,Penny,2, It‰Ûªs good to stretch your muscles before you run.,4
15445,Sheldon,2, All right.,4
15446,Penny,2," All right, let‰Ûªs start with a toe touch. Okay, you do it.",4
15447,Sheldon,2, I am doing it.,4
15448,Penny,2," Oh. Wow. Good job. Okay, um, can you do this?",4
15449,Sheldon,2, We‰Ûªll never know.,4
15450,Penny,2," Okay, let‰Ûªs just warm up on the run.",4
15451,Sheldon,2, Okay.,4
15452,Penny,2," Okay, let‰Ûªs go.",4
15453,Sheldon,2," Yeah, I‰Ûªve been reading up on biomechanics. I think you‰Ûªll be surprised at my‰Û_ Wah! Oh!",4
15454,Penny (squealing),2," Oh, my God, are you okay?",4
15455,Sheldon,2, I think so.,4
15456,Penny,2," Oh, let me help you up.",4
15457,Sheldon,2, Thank you. (Loud sound of farting),4
15458,Penny,2," Oh, Sheldon!",4
15459,Sheldon,2," If it makes you feel any better, Thursday is no longer Cruciferous Vegetable Night.",4
15460,Scene,2, The apartment. ,4
15461,Leonard,2," Here‰Ûªs my chicken curry. Howard, your shrimp biryani.",4
15462,Howard,2," Thank you, sir.",4
15463,Leonard,2," Palak paneer, that‰Ûªs Penny.",4
15464,Penny,2, Thanks.,4
15465,Leonard,2," And for Rajesh Koothrappali, from whose homeland these tasty dishes originate, one large order of chicken McNuggets.",4
15466,Penny,2," Hey, what‰Ûªs my share?",4
15467,Leonard,2," Uh, 12 bucks.",4
15468,Penny,2," Okay, can I get you after Friday when I get paid?",4
15469,Leonard,2, Sure.,4
15470,Penny,2, What am I up to now?,4
15471,Leonard,2," Well, okay, with the Indian food, the pizza, the Thai food, the tank of gas, the frozen yogurt and your rent, uh, a little over fourteen hundred dollars.",4
15472,Penny (after Raj whispers to Howard and they both laugh),2, What now?,4
15473,Howard,2, He‰Ûªs just expressing his admiration that you don‰Ûªt even have to put out to get free stuff.,4
15474,Penny,2," It‰Ûªs not free, I‰Ûªm gonna pay him back. (Raj whispers. Both laugh again) Shut up!",4
15475,Leonard,2," Sheldon, are you gonna join us?",4
15476,Sheldon,2," Coming! (From the bedroom area, a wheeled device consisting of a base, a tee-shirt on a coat hanger, and a computer monitor with Sheldon‰Ûªs face, appears). Greetings, friends.",4
15477,Leonard,2," Greetings, whatever the hell you are.",4
15478,Sheldon-bot,2," I am a mobile virtual presence device. Recent events have demonstrated to me that my body is too fragile to endure the vicissitudes of the world. Until such time as I am able to transfer my consciousness, I shall remain in a secure location and interact with the world in this manner.",4
15479,Howard (after Raj whispers to him),2, Really? That‰Ûªs your question? When did he put a ramp in?,4
15480,Sheldon-bot,2," You‰Ûªre in my spot. This may seem a little odd at first, but over time you‰Ûªll grow accustomed to dealing with me in this configuration.",4
15481,Penny,2," Yeah, to be honest, I don‰Ûªt see much difference.",4
15482,Sheldon-bot,2," Thank you. That‰Ûªs what I was going for. Now, Leonard, tomorrow, when we go to work, you‰Ûªll need to allow some extra time to get me down the stairs. For your convenience, I disassemble into four pieces.",4
15483,Leonard,2, This is ridiculous. I‰Ûªm coming to talk to you.,4
15484,Sheldon-bot,2," You don‰Ûªt know where I am. My physical body is safely ensconced in a secure, undisclosed location.",4
15485,Leonard,2, You‰Ûªre in your bedroom.,4
15486,Sheldon-bot,2," No, I‰Ûªm not.",4
15487,Leonard,2, I can hear your voice coming from your bedroom.,4
15488,Sheldon-bot,2," No, you can‰Ûªt. Wait. Come back. Halt. Authorized personnel only!",4
15489,Penny,2," So, either one of you weirdos want to buy my underwear? Only fourteen hundred bucks.",4
15490,Scene,2, Sheldon‰Ûªs bedroom.,4
15491,Leonard,2," Sheldon, this is ridiculous.",4
15492,Sheldon,2, I‰Ûªm behind you. Please look at me when you‰Ûªre talking to me.,4
15493,Leonard,2, I am looking at you.,4
15494,Sheldon,2," No, you‰Ûªre not. Pay no attention to that man in the bed.",4
15495,Leonard,2," You cannot exist as a virtual presence. Not here and certainly not at work. Oh, good God.",4
15496,Sheldon,2," At my age, do you know how I‰Ûªm statistically most likely to die?",4
15497,Leonard,2, At the hands of your roommate?,4
15498,Sheldon,2, An accident.,4
15499,Leonard,2, That‰Ûªs how I‰Ûªm going to make it look.,4
15500,Sheldon,2," Until I can transfer my intellect to a more durable container, my body will remain safely ensconced in my bed.",4
15501,Leonard,2," Fine, but don‰Ûªt expect my help.",4
15502,Sheldon,2," You have to help, it‰Ûªs in the roommate agreement.",4
15503,Leonard,2," No, it‰Ûªs not.",4
15504,Sheldon,2, Section 74.C. The various obligations and duties of the parties in the event one of them becomes a robot.,4
15505,Leonard,2, I‰Ûªll be damned.,4
15506,Scene,2, Leonard‰Ûªs car,4
15507,Sheldon-bot,2, This is delightful.,4
15508,Leonard,2, Uh-huh.,4
15509,Sheldon-bot,2, It‰Ûªs much easier to enjoy the picturesque route we travel to work when you remove the spectre of fiery vehicular death.,4
15510,Leonard,2, Refresh my memory. Why didn‰Ûªt I just put you in the trunk?,4
15511,Sheldon-bot,2, Because I called shotgun. Remember?,4
15512,Leonard,2, Right.,4
15513,Sheldon-bot,2, You seem tense. Perhaps this will relax you.,4
15514,Leonard,2," I don‰Ûªt want to listen to music, Sheldon.",4
15515,Sheldon-bot,2," Very well. I don‰Ûªt understand why you‰Ûªre not enjoying this. Together, in this car, with my enhanced capabilities, we‰Ûªre like Knight Rider.",4
15516,Leonard,2," Except in Knight Rider, the car isn‰Ûªt a yammering sphincter.",4
15517,Sheldon-bot,2," You mock the sphincter, but the sphincter is a class of muscle without which human beings couldn‰Ûªt survive. There are over 50 different sphincters in the human body. How many can you name?",4
15518,Leonard,2," I was wrong, this is exactly like Knight Rider.",4
15519,Sheldon-bot,2, Perhaps you‰Ûªd be interested in a different game.,4
15520,Leonard,2, No.,4
15521,Sheldon-bot,2," This is a photograph of the 1911 Solvay Conference on the theory of radiation and quanta. Using Photoshop, I‰Ûªve introduced a few anachronisms. See if you can spot all 24. I‰Ûªll give you the first one. Madame Curie should not be wearing a digital watch. And go.",4
15522,Leonard,2, That‰Ûªs it. Bye-bye. (Turns off screen.),4
15523,Sheldon-bot (screen switching itself back on),2, Bazinga.,4
15524,Leonard,2, Whoa!,4
15525,Sheldon-bot,2, I have an override switch.,4
15526,Leonard,2, I almost died!,4
15527,Sheldon-bot ,2, And I‰Ûªm safe and sound in bed. Who‰Ûªs crazy now?,4
15528,Leonard,2, I‰Ûªm still going to go with you.,4
15529,Scene,2, A corridor at the university.,4
15530,Sheldon-bot ,2," Hello, Professor Hoskins. Nice to see you, Mindy. Konichi-wa Dr. Nakamora. Sorry the Swedes disproved your theory. Leonard, my door.",4
15531,Leonard,2, What about it?,4
15532,Sheldon-bot ,2, Be a lamb and open it for me.,4
15533,Leonard,2, Why? What‰Ûªs the problem?,4
15534,Sheldon-bot ,2," You think you have me stymied, don‰Ûªt you?",4
15535,Leonard,2," No, I think a doorknob has you stymied.",4
15536,Howard,2," Oh, look, it‰Ûªs Leonard and R2-D-Bag.",4
15537,Raj,2, That‰Ûªs my joke. I told it last night. You can‰Ûªt just use it.,4
15538,Sheldon-bot ,2," Raj, be a lamb and open the door for me.",4
15539,Raj,2," Oh, sure.",4
15540,Sheldon-bot ,2, He‰Ûªs a lamb. You‰Ûªre not.,4
15541,Raj,2, I‰Ûªm a lamb.,4
15542,Scene,2, The Cheesecake Factory,4
15543,Sheldon-bot ,2, Isn‰Ûªt this nice? The pleasures of fellowship and camaraderie without having to tolerate your germy breath on my skin.,4
15544,Howard,2, I say we just take him to Tatooine and sell him to some Jawas.,4
15545,Raj,2," That‰Ûªs two, dude. Write your own jokes.",4
15546,Penny,2," Oh, great. Hi, I‰Ûªm Penny, I‰Ûªll be your waitress.",4
15547,Leonard,2, Why are you introducing yourself?,4
15548,Penny,2, I‰Ûªd rather people not know I have any prior connection to you whatsoever.,4
15549,Sheldon-bot ,2, Can you tell me the specials this evening?,4
15550,Penny,2," Sheldon, I‰Ûªm not waiting on you.",4
15551,Sheldon-bot,2, Obviously. I don‰Ûªt even have water yet.,4
15552,Penny,2, Because you‰Ûªre not here.,4
15553,Sheldon-bot,2," That‰Ûªs discrimination against the otherwise located. I‰Ûªm going to have to go over your head. Manager, manager. Oh, Lord, look who it is.",4
15554,Howard,2, Is that Steve Wozniak?,4
15555,Leonard,2, I think it is.,4
15556,Sheldon-bot ,2, The Great and Powerful Woz.,4
15557,Leonard,2," Penny, Steve Wozniak was one of the cofounders of Apple Computer. He and Steve Jobs started it‰Û_",4
15558,Penny,2," Yeah, I know who he is. I watch Dancing with the Stars.",4
15559,Sheldon-bot ,2, I must speak to him.,4
15560,Leonard,2, Of course you must.,4
15561,Penny,2," You know, there‰Ûªs an Olive Garden down the street. You guys should try it sometime.",4
15562,Sheldon-bot ,2," Excuse me, Mr. Wozniak?",4
15563,Steve Wozniak,2," Oh, hey. Nice virtual presence device.",4
15564,Sheldon-bot ,2, Thank you. I just want to say I‰Ûªm a big fan. You‰Ûªre my fifteenth favourite technological visionary.,4
15565,Steve Wozniak,2, Only fifteenth?,4
15566,Sheldon-bot ,2, It‰Ûªs still six spots above Steve Jobs. I care neither for turtlenecks nor showmanship.,4
15567,Steve Wozniak,2," Yeah, I never got that turtleneck thing.",4
15568,Sheldon-bot ,2," One of my proudest possessions is a vintage 1977 Apple Two. Despite the file system limitations of Apple DOS 3.3, it was a pretty nifty little achievement.",4
15569,Steve Wozniak,2," Thanks, we were shooting for nifty. You know, if you had it here, I‰Ûªd autograph it for you.",4
15570,Sheldon-bot,2," Don‰Ûªt move for 15 to 30 minutes, depending on how the buses are running.",4
15571,Steve Wozniak,2, Nerds.,4
15572,Scene,2, The hallway. Sheldon exits carrying the Apple 2.,4
15573,Sheldon,2," I‰Ûªm coming, Woz, I‰Ûªm coming. (Trips on stairs.) Ow! Aw.",4
15574,Scene,2, The hallway. Sheldon-bot approaches Penny‰Ûªs door and starts bashing into it.,4
15575,Sheldon-bot ,2, (Bash) Penny. (Bash) Penny. (Bash) Penny.,4
15576,Penny,2," What up, Shel-Bot?",4
15577,Sheldon-bot,2, I can‰Ûªt get out of bed. I hurt my ankle.,4
15578,Penny,2, What do you want me to do?,4
15579,Sheldon-bot,2, Sing me Soft Kitty.,4
15580,Penny,2," Really, you want me to sing Soft Kitty to a computer monitor?",4
15581,Sheldon-bot,2, Would you rather come over and sing it to me in person?,4
15582,Penny,2," Soft kitty, warm kitty, little ball of fur.",4
15583,Sheldon-bot,2, Closer to the microphone.,4
15584,Penny,2," Happy kitty, sleepy‰Û_",4
15585,Sheldon-bot,2, No. You have to start over.,4
15586,Penny,2," Soft kitty, warm kitty, little ball of fur. Happy kitty, sleepy kitty, purr, purr, purr.",4
15587,Scene,3, The apartment. ,4
15588,Sheldon,3," All right, I‰Ûªm ready for my next question.",4
15589,Amy,3," In a world where rhinoceroses are domesticated pets, who wins the Second World War?",4
15590,Sheldon,3, Uganda.,4
15591,Amy,3, Defend.,4
15592,Sheldon,3," Kenya rises to power on the export of rhinoceroses. A Central African power block is formed, colonizing North Africa and Europe. When war breaks out, no one can afford the luxury of a rhino. Kenya withers, Uganda triumphs.",4
15593,Amy,3, Correct. My turn.,4
15594,Sheldon,3," In a world where a piano is a weapon, not a musical instrument, on what does Scott Joplin play The Maple Leaf Rag?",4
15595,Amy,3, Tuned bayonets.,4
15596,Sheldon,3, Defend.,4
15597,Amy,3, Isn‰Ûªt it obvious?,4
15598,Sheldon,3, You‰Ûªre right. My apologies.,4
15599,Leonard,3, What the hell are you guys playing?,4
15600,Sheldon,3, It‰Ûªs a game we invented. It‰Ûªs called Counterfactuals.,4
15601,Amy,3, We postulate an alternate world that differs from ours in one key aspect and then pose questions to each other.,4
15602,Sheldon,3, It‰Ûªs fun for ages eight to eighty. Join us.,4
15603,Leonard,3, All right. I like a good brainteaser. Give it a whirl.,4
15604,Sheldon,3," You‰Ûªre in luck, this is an easy one. In a world where mankind is ruled by a giant intelligent beaver, what food is no longer consumed?",4
15605,Leonard,3," Uh, a BLT where the B stands for beaver? I don‰Ûªt know.",4
15606,Sheldon,3," Leonard, be serious. We‰Ûªre playing a game here.",4
15607,Leonard,3," I can figure this out, let‰Ûªs see. Um, well, beavers eat tree bark. The only tree bark I know that humans consume is cinnamon. So, I‰Ûªll say cinnamon.",4
15608,Sheldon,3," Incorrect. Obviously, the answer is cheese Danish.",4
15609,Leonard,3, What?,4
15610,Amy,3," In a world ruled by a giant beaver, mankind builds many dams to please the beaver overlord. The low-lying city of Copenhagen is flooded. Thousands die. Devastated, the Danes never invent their namesake pastry. How does one miss that?",4
15611,Leonard,3, This is ridiculous. You‰Ûªre just making stuff up.,4
15612,Amy,3, Is he always like this when he loses?,4
15613,Sheldon,3," Oh, yes. You should‰Ûªve been here for the great Jenga tantrum of 2008.",4
15614,Leonard,3, You bumped the table and you know it.,4
15615,Amy,3, Perhaps it would be kinder to play a game more suited to his abilities. We‰Ûªll close our eyes and count to ten while you hide.,4
15616,Leonard,3, I‰Ûªm going to my room.,4
15617,Amy,3," Very good, Leonard. But next time, don‰Ûªt tell us where you‰Ûªre hiding.",4
15618,Scene,3, The Cheesecake Factory,4
15619,Leonard,3, Did you guys see the paper in The American Physics Journal on supersolids? It‰Ûªs pretty interesting. This guy‰Ûªs working from a hypothesis where‰Û_,4
15620,Raj,3, Spoiler alert! Spoiler alert.,4
15621,Leonard,3, What?,4
15622,Raj,3," Don‰Ûªt ruin it for me, man. I printed out a PDF to read on the potty.",4
15623,Howard,3," On the potty? What are you, five?",4
15624,Raj,3, It‰Ûªs a potty. What do you call it?,4
15625,Howard,3, Toilet.,4
15626,Raj,3," That‰Ûªs a little vulgar for the dinner table, don‰Ûªt you think?",4
15627,Howard,3," Oh, and potty is okay?",4
15628,Raj,3, Potty is innocent. Potty is adorable.,4
15629,Howard,3," What do you do in the potty, wee-wee?",4
15630,Raj,3, If I don‰Ûªt have to boom-boom.,4
15631,Sheldon,3, Greetings. You all remember Amy Farrah Fowler.,4
15632,Leonard,3, Sure.,4
15633,Howard,3, Nice to see you.,4
15634,Amy,3, Hello.,4
15635,Sheldon,3, Sorry we‰Ûªre late.,4
15636,Amy,3, I must take responsibility. I had to stop for feminine hygiene supplies.,4
15637,Howard,3," Ah, ah.",4
15638,Leonard,3, Okay.,4
15639,Sheldon,3, I believe she‰Ûªs experiencing her menses.,4
15640,Amy,3," Actually, I‰Ûªm not. In order to avoid surprises, I wear them all the time.",4
15641,Leonard,3," Ah, ah.",4
15642,Howard,3," Okay. Toilet‰Ûªs sounding pretty good now, huh?",4
15643,Penny,3," Hey, look, it‰Ûªs Shamy.",4
15644,Amy,3, Shamy?,4
15645,Sheldon,3," A juvenile amalgamation of our names. Sheldon and Amy, åÊShamy.",4
15646,Amy,3, Oh. I don‰Ûªt like that. Don‰Ûªt do that.,4
15647,Penny,3, All righty. What‰Ûªs new?,4
15648,Amy,3," Well, just recently, I learned that you refer to us as Shamy, and I don‰Ûªt like that.",4
15649,Penny,3," I got it. But what I was going for was, you know, how‰Ûªs your life?",4
15650,Amy,3," Like everybody else‰Ûªs. Subject to entropy, decay and eventual death. Thank you for asking. Why is she not taking our order?",4
15651,Sheldon,3," I should‰Ûªve warned you, one has to navigate a labyrinth of social nonsense before one can be fed here.",4
15652,Amy,3, Really? I assumed an establishment called the Cheesecake Factory would function more efficiently.,4
15653,Sheldon,3, It‰Ûªs how they lure you in. I believe it‰Ûªs called bait and switch.,4
15654,Penny,3," Okay, I‰Ûªm just gonna walk away, ‰Ûªcause I don‰Ûªt want to be here.",4
15655,Leonard,3," So, this is nice. First time we‰Ûªve all gotten together to eat.",4
15656,Amy,3," You‰Ûªre right, he‰Ûªs a festival of humdrum chitchat.",4
15657,Leonard,3," Okay, that‰Ûªs all I got. Howard, you‰Ûªre up.",4
15658,Howard,3," Um, tell us about your work, Amy.",4
15659,Amy,3, I doubt you‰Ûªd understand. Sheldon tells me you only have a master‰Ûªs degree.,4
15660,Howard,3," Raj, do you have any questions for Amy?",4
15661,Amy,3, I‰Ûªm curious as to why we‰Ûªre not eating alone.,4
15662,Sheldon,3, They can‰Ûªt function without me. I‰Ûªm the social glue that holds this little group together. You‰Ûªre welcome.,4
15663,Scene,3, The stairwell.,4
15664,Leonard,3," Listen, can I talk to you about your girlfriend?",4
15665,Sheldon,3," She‰Ûªs not my girlfriend. She‰Ûªs a girl and she‰Ûªs my friend, but there‰Ûªs no touching or unsanitary exchange of saliva.",4
15666,Leonard,3, Got it.,4
15667,Sheldon,3," Although, for the record, on one occasion, she licked her thumb to remove raspberry jelly from the corner of my mouth. It‰Ûªs an action we both regret to this day.",4
15668,Leonard,3," Uh-huh. Anyway, I‰Ûªm not sure she‰Ûªs the best fit for our little, how should we call it, rebel alliance.",4
15669,Sheldon,3," Oh, I never identified with the rebel alliance. Despite their tendency to build Death Stars, I‰Ûªve always been more of an empire man.",4
15670,Leonard,3," Yeah, not my point.",4
15671,Sheldon,3," I know what your point is. You‰Ûªre intimidated by Amy‰Ûªs intellect. To that I say, buck up.",4
15672,Leonard,3," Okay, let me just get right to it. Amy is judgmental, sanctimonious and frankly just obnoxious.",4
15673,Sheldon,3, So?,4
15674,Leonard,3, So we already have you for all that.,4
15675,Sheldon,3, Are you suggesting I terminate my relationship with Amy?,4
15676,Leonard,3," No, no, of course not. Just have your relationship someplace else.",4
15677,Sheldon,3," May I point out that for eight long months, I suffered in silence as your female companion filled our apartment with her off-key country music caterwauling, the unappetizing spectacle of her grinding a pumice stone against her calloused feet in our living room, and night after night of uninformative TV documentaries about the Jersey Shore.",4
15678,Leonard,3, Suffered in silence?,4
15679,Sheldon,3, Yes. And I‰Ûªd thank you to do the same.,4
15680,Leonard,3, Really? Silence?,4
15681,Scene,3, Penny‰Ûªs apartment. ,4
15682,Raj,3," Ah. Nothing makes beer taste better than cool clear Rocky Mountain spring water. Where are the Rocky Mountains, anyway?",4
15683,Howard,3, Philadelphia.,4
15684,Raj,3, Really? I thought they were out West someplace.,4
15685,Howard,3," Think about it, Raj. Where did the movie Rocky take place?",4
15686,Raj,3," Philadelphia. Okay, now I get it.",4
15687,Penny,3," So this is the plan? From now on, we‰Ûªre just gonna hide out in here to avoid the Shamy?",4
15688,Raj,3," I‰Ûªm very comfortable here. Penny, dear, why don‰Ûªt you shoot another silver bullet my way?",4
15689,Penny,3, Get one yourself.,4
15690,Raj,3," Ooh, somebody‰Ûªs been taking bitchy pills.",4
15691,Penny,3," God, he‰Ûªs an ass when he drinks.",4
15692,Howard,3," Oh, he‰Ûªs an ass when he doesn‰Ûªt. You just don‰Ûªt hear it.",4
15693,Leonard,3, I think we need to start entertaining the possibility that the Shamy could go on for years.,4
15694,Raj,3," Well, if that‰Ûªs the case, Penny will have to get satellite TV and maybe once a week run a vacuum through this place.",4
15695,Penny,3, I thought you were going to talk to Sheldon.,4
15696,Leonard,3, I did.,4
15697,Penny,3," Well, what‰Ûªd he say?",4
15698,Leonard,3," Well, he pointed out that he kinda, sorta had to put up with you.",4
15699,Penny,3," Kinda, sorta had to?",4
15700,Leonard,3, I didn‰Ûªt agree with him.,4
15701,Penny,3," Well, you defended me, right?",4
15702,Leonard,3," I tried, but (Penny starts rubbing her foot with a pumice stone) he made a fairly well-reasoned argument.",4
15703,Howard,3, You‰Ûªre not doing that right.,4
15704,Penny,3, What?,4
15705,Howard,3, Gimme.,4
15706,Penny,3, No.,4
15707,Howard,3, Trust me.,4
15708,Penny,3, No!,4
15709,Howard,3, I do this for my mom all the time. See? With the grain.,4
15710,Penny,3," Wow, that is better.",4
15711,Howard,3," And someday, when you have varicose veins, I‰Ûªll show you how to massage them.",4
15712,Scene,3, The University Cafeteria.,4
15713,Raj,3," Oh, God, never again.",4
15714,Leonard,3," I assume by never again, you mean never again will you drink all of Penny‰Ûªs beer, then run down to the gas station for a couple of 40s, a box of Slim Jims and the latest issue of Bombay Badonkadonks.",4
15715,Raj,3, I was homesick.,4
15716,Howard,3, The highlight of the evening was when you showed us your Bollywood break dancing skills. (Does a stereotyped impersonation of Bollywood dancing.),4
15717,Raj,3, That‰Ûªs very offensive.,4
15718,Howard,3," Yeah, we all thought so.",4
15719,Leonard,3," Oh, no.",4
15720,Howard,3, What?,4
15721,Leonard,3, John and Yoko.,4
15722,Howard,3, More like Yoko and Yoko.,4
15723,Sheldon,3, Greetings.,4
15724,Leonard,3, Hey.,4
15725,Sheldon,3, I brought Amy here to show her some of the work I‰Ûªm doing.,4
15726,Amy,3," It‰Ûªs very impressive, for theoretical work.",4
15727,Sheldon,3, Do I detect a hint of condescension?,4
15728,Amy,3," I‰Ûªm sorry, was I being too subtle? I meant compared to the real-world applications of neurobiology, theoretical physics is, what‰Ûªs the word I‰Ûªm looking for? Hmm, cute.",4
15729,Leonard and Howard together,3, Oooh!,4
15730,Sheldon,3, Are you suggesting the work of a neurobiologist like Babinski could ever rise to the significance of a physicist like Clarke-Maxwell or Dirac?,4
15731,Amy,3, I‰Ûªm stating it outright. Babinski eats Dirac for breakfast and defecates Clarke-Maxwell.,4
15732,Sheldon,3, You take that back.,4
15733,Amy,3," Absolutely not. My colleagues and I are mapping the neurological substrates that subserve global information processing, which is required for all cognitive reasoning, including scientific inquiry, making my research ipso facto prior in the ordo cognoscendi. That means it‰Ûªs better than his research, and by extension, of course, yours.",4
15734,Leonard,3," I‰Ûªm sorry, I‰Ûªm-I‰Ûªm still trying to work on the defecating Clark Maxwell, so‰Û_",4
15735,Sheldon,3," Excuse me, but a grand unified theory, insofar as it explains everything, will ipso facto explain neurobiology.",4
15736,Amy,3," Yes, but if I‰Ûªm successful, I will be able to map and reproduce your thought processes in deriving a grand unified theory, and therefore, subsume your conclusions under my paradigm.",4
15737,Sheldon,3," That‰Ûªs the rankest psychologism, and was conclusively revealed as hogwash by Gottlob Frege in the 1890s!",4
15738,Amy,3, We appear to have reached an impasse.,4
15739,Sheldon,3, I agree. I move our relationship terminate immediately.,4
15740,Amy,3, Seconded.,4
15741,Sheldon,3, There being no objections‰Û_,4
15742,All,3," No, uh-uh.",4
15743,Sheldon,3," The motion carries. Good day, Amy Farrah Fowler.",4
15744,Amy,3," Good day, Sheldon Cooper.",4
15745,Howard,3," Women, huh? Can‰Ûªt live with them, can‰Ûªt successfully refute their hypotheses.",4
15746,Sheldon,3, Amen to that.,4
15747,Scene,3, The laundry room. ,4
15748,Penny,3," Hey, Sheldon.",4
15749,Sheldon,3, Hello.,4
15750,Penny,3, I hear you broke up with Amy.,4
15751,Sheldon,3, A breakup would imply she was my girlfriend. She was a girl who was my friend who is now a girl who is not my friend.,4
15752,Penny,3," Wow. That‰Ûªs like the worst country song ever. So, how are you doing?",4
15753,Sheldon,3, Regarding what?,4
15754,Penny,3, Amy.,4
15755,Sheldon,3, I don‰Ûªt follow.,4
15756,Penny,3," Well, breakups, or whatever the hell this is, can be tough.",4
15757,Sheldon,3," Penny, I assure you, I‰Ûªm fine. My relationship with Amy was purely intellectual. There were no emotional bonds, the severing of which would cause me any discomfort. The relationship simply outlived its utility, and I‰Ûªm continuing on with my life as before.",4
15758,Penny,3, Okay. Good.,4
15759,Sheldon,3," Now, if you‰Ûªll excuse me, I‰Ûªm off to buy a pussycat.",4
15760,Scene,3, The cafeteria.,4
15761,Leonard,3," I gotta tell you guys, I‰Ûªm a little worried about Sheldon.",4
15762,Howard,3, We‰Ûªre all a little worried about Sheldon.,4
15763,Leonard,3," No, I mean since the Shamy hit a reef.",4
15764,Howard,3," Oh, I thought you were just making a generalization, you know, I‰Ûªm worried about Sheldon someday setting off a low-yield nuclear device because the cafeteria ran out of lime Jell-O.",4
15765,Raj,3, What does hit a reef mean?,4
15766,Leonard,3," Uh, went splitsville.",4
15767,Raj,3, Pardon?,4
15768,Leonard,3, Turned to boom-boom.,4
15769,Raj,3, Ah.,4
15770,Leonard,3, I think Sheldon really misses Amy.,4
15771,Howard,3, You should lend him your copy of Bombay Badonkadonks.,4
15772,Leonard,3, He got a cat to keep him company.,4
15773,Raj,3, You‰Ûªre kidding.,4
15774,Leonard,3," He takes it everywhere, to bed, to the bathroom.",4
15775,Raj,3, He takes the kitty to the potty?,4
15776,Howard,3, I thought we discussed the P-word.,4
15777,Raj,3," Don‰Ûªt try to change me, dude. I am what I am.",4
15778,Sheldon,3," Oh, gentlemen.",4
15779,Howard,3, Hey. Aren‰Ûªt you going to introduce us to your little friend?,4
15780,Sheldon,3," My apologies. Raj, Howard, I‰Ûªd like you to meet Dr. Robert Oppenheimer.",4
15781,Howard,3, Hello.,4
15782,Raj,3, Hi.,4
15783,Sheldon,3," Now, if you‰Ûªll excuse me, the father of the atomic bomb wants a saucer of milk.",4
15784,Howard,3," Okay, I get it. We‰Ûªre worried about Sheldon.",4
15785,Leonard,3, Yeah.,4
15786,Scene,3, The apartment. Leonard arrives.,4
15787,Leonard,3," Hey. (Turns to see Sheldon now has five cats) Oh, no.",4
15788,Sheldon,3, Robert Oppenheimer was lonely.,4
15789,Leonard,3, So you decided to get the whole Manhattan Project?,4
15790,Sheldon,3," Yes. This is Enrico Fermi, Richard Feynman, Edward Teller, Otto Frisch, and Zazzles.",4
15791,Leonard,3, Zazzles?,4
15792,Sheldon,3," I was going to name him Herman von Helmholtz, but he‰Ûªs so zazzy.",4
15793,Leonard,3," Okay, we need to talk.",4
15794,Sheldon,3, About what?,4
15795,Leonard,3," Cats, Sheldon. You‰Ûªre clearly upset about Amy being gone, and you‰Ûªre trying to replace her with a bunch of cats.",4
15796,Sheldon,3, Clowder.,4
15797,Leonard,3, What?,4
15798,Sheldon,3, A group of cats is a clowder. Or a glaring.,4
15799,Leonard,3," Okay, yeah, fine.",4
15800,Sheldon,3, It‰Ûªs the kind of thing you ought to know now that we have one.,4
15801,Leonard,3, Terrific. My-my point is you need to face up to what you‰Ûªre feeling with this breakup.,4
15802,Sheldon,3, It wasn‰Ûªt a breakup. A breakup would imply that Amy was my girlfriend.,4
15803,Leonard,3," Okay, I got it, I got it, she‰Ûªs not your girlfriend. Now listen to me. I know about loneliness. I know about trying to replace someone with other stuff. When I broke up with Penny, I got back into my cello, I built a bunch of model rockets, I got those weightlifting gloves and that five-pound dumbbell.",4
15804,Sheldon,3," You didn‰Ûªt break up, she dumped you.",4
15805,Leonard,3, She didn‰Ûªt dump me. It was mutual!,4
15806,Sheldon,3, I was there. She dumped you.,4
15807,Leonard,3," Okay, fine. Live with cats. Be like my Aunt Nancy. She had dozens of them. And do you know what happened after she died? They ate her.",4
15808,Sheldon,3," You don‰Ûªt have to sell me on cats, Leonard. I‰Ûªm already a fan. All right, fellas, who‰Ûªs in the mood for Fancy Feast? Well, that‰Ûªs not fancy at all.",4
15809,Scene,3, The apartment.,4
15810,Leonard,3," Hi, Mrs. Cooper. Thanks for coming.",4
15811,Mrs Cooper,3, Where is he?,4
15812,Leonard,3, He‰Ûªs in his bedroom.,4
15813,Mrs Cooper,3," Now, when you said on the phone he broke up with a girl, you meant an actual girl, not something you kids whipped up in a lab?",4
15814,Leonard,3," No, she‰Ûªs real.",4
15815,Mrs Cooper,3, Did they sin?,4
15816,Leonard,3," No, no, it‰Ûªs not like that. It‰Ûªs, uh, I don‰Ûªt know what it‰Ûªs like. But there is something I should prepare you for.",4
15817,Mrs Cooper,3," Oh, relax, Leonard, I have raised that boy. I‰Ûªve seen him at his best, I‰Ûªve seen him at his worst. There‰Ûªs nothing he can do that‰Ûªll surprise me.",4
15818,Leonard,3, Hold on to that thought. (Knocks on Sheldon‰Ûªs bedroom door),4
15819,Sheldon,3, Come in. (They enter. The room is full of cats.),4
15820,Leonard,3, Surprise.,4
15821,Sheldon,3," Mom, what an unexpected pleasure.",4
15822,Mrs Cooper,3," My, my, that‰Ûªs a powerful smell.",4
15823,Sheldon,3," I‰Ûªd like you to meet Oppenheimer, Frisch, Panofsky, Feynman, Weisskopf‰Û_",4
15824,Mrs Cooper,3," Yeah, I get it. You got a lot of cats and you gave ‰Ûªem cute Jewish names.",4
15825,Sheldon,3, What are you doing here?,4
15826,Mrs Cooper,3," Leonard called, and he said that you were pining for a young lady.",4
15827,Sheldon,3," Oh, that‰Ûªs preposterous. I‰Ûªm not pining over anyone.",4
15828,Mrs Cooper,3," Oh, lambchop, we can quibble what to call it, but I think we can both agree it‰Ûªs creepy.",4
15829,Sheldon,3," I do not agree. Cats make wonderful companions. They don‰Ûªt argue or question my intellectual authority, and this little guy here, I think you‰Ûªll find to be quite zazzy.",4
15830,Mrs Cooper,3, You should have called sooner.,4
15831,Scene,3, The kitchen.,4
15832,Mrs Cooper,3, Shelly! Dinner‰Ûªs ready!,4
15833,Sheldon,3, Coming!,4
15834,Mrs Cooper,3, No cats!,4
15835,Sheldon,3, Aw.(Enters to find Amy) What is she doing here?,4
15836,Mrs Cooper,3, I called her.,4
15837,Amy,3," Your mother thinks you might be losing your mind over me. As a neurobiologist, I was curious.",4
15838,Sheldon,3," Well, rest assured, I am in full possession of my faculties.",4
15839,Leonard (pretending to sneeze),3, 25 cats!,4
15840,Mrs Cooper,3," Oh, God bless you, dear. Sheldon, sit down. Let‰Ûªs talk.",4
15841,Sheldon,3," All right, but you‰Ûªre not fooling me. Whenever you say we have to talk, it means you want me to listen.",4
15842,Mrs Cooper,3, Then stop talking.,4
15843,Sheldon,3," Yes, ma‰Ûªam.",4
15844,Mrs Cooper,3," Now, the reason I called Amy over was to find out what type of person she is. And after chatting a bit, I have to say that while she is a perfectly unique young woman, you two are definitely not suited for each other.",4
15845,Sheldon,3," That‰Ûªs a peculiar conclusion. By any standard, Amy is more similar to me than anyone I‰Ûªve ever met.",4
15846,Mrs Cooper,3," Oh, I‰Ûªm sorry, Shelly, I can‰Ûªt see it.",4
15847,Sheldon,3," Well, whether you see it or not is irrelevant. I can‰Ûªt see subatomic particles, but nevertheless, they‰Ûªre there.",4
15848,Amy,3, Excellent point.,4
15849,Sheldon,3, A physics point.,4
15850,Amy,3, Touche.,4
15851,Mrs Cooper,3," Well, putting aside the pig Latin, it‰Ûªs a good thing that you two decided to end the relationship so I didn‰Ûªt have to end it for you.",4
15852,Sheldon,3," Amy, after consideration, I believe we may have acted rashly. I propose we resume our relationship and attempt to resolve our differences.",4
15853,Amy,3, I‰Ûªll agree to that only if you‰Ûªll stipulate that 80% of our difficulties were caused by you.,4
15854,Sheldon,3, I‰Ûªll go as high as 40.,4
15855,Amy,3, Sixty-five.,4
15856,Sheldon,3," Done. You understand that moving forward, we deal with the fact that my mother does not approve of you?",4
15857,Amy,3, I do. I find being cast in the role of bad girl oddly titillating.,4
15858,Sheldon,3, Would you like to see my cats?,4
15859,Amy,3, I would. I love cats. They‰Ûªre the epitome of indifference.,4
15860,Sheldon,3," Ah, then you may find Zazzles a little cloying.",4
15861,Leonard,3, I saw what you did there.,4
15862,Mrs Cooper,3," He thinks he‰Ûªs such a smarty pants. He‰Ûªs no different from any man. You tell ‰Ûªem not to do something, that‰Ûªs all they want to do. If I hadn‰Ûªt told my brother Stumpy not to clear out the wood chipper by hand, we‰Ûªd still be calling him Edward. Now, don‰Ûªt you move. I‰Ûªll bring over all the food.",4
15863,Leonard,3," No, no, no, I can do it.",4
15864,Mrs Cooper,3," Well, isn‰Ûªt that sweet?",4
15865,Scene,3, Outside. Sheldon is sitting at a table with a sign reading ‰ÛÏCats $20‰Û),4
15866,Sheldon,3," Thank you, Amy. Here‰Ûªs your cat. And here‰Ûªs your $20.",4
15867,Amy,3, Next!,4
15868,Sheldon,3," Thank you, Amy. Here‰Ûªs your cat. And here‰Ûªs your $20.",4
15869,Amy,3, Next!,4
15870,Scene,4, The Cheesecake Factory.,4
15871,Raj,4," I‰Ûªm telling you, if xenon emits ultraviolet light, then those dark matter discoveries must be wrong.",4
15872,Sheldon,4," Yes, well, if we lived in a world where slow-moving xenon produced light, then you‰Ûªd be correct. Also, pigs would fly, my derriere would produce cotton candy, and The Phantom Menace would be a timeless classic.",4
15873,Raj,4," Oh, you‰Ûªre so arrogant. If you were a superhero, your name would be Captain Arrogant. And you know what your superpower would be? Arrogance.",4
15874,Sheldon,4," You‰Ûªre wrong again. If my superpower were arrogance, my name would be Dr. Arroganto.",4
15875,Howard (laughs),4, I love watching Raj and Sheldon try to work together.,4
15876,Leonard,4," Yeah, it‰Ûªs like if Alien and Predator decided to go partners in a Jamba Juice.",4
15877,Raj,4, Has it occurred to you you‰Ûªre missing the big picture? If you look at neutron scattering data‰Û_,4
15878,Sheldon,4," Oh, Penny? Penny?",4
15879,Penny,4, What‰Ûªs up?,4
15880,Sheldon,4, Nothing. I just wanted to make Raj stop talking.,4
15881,Howard (after Raj whispers to him),4," No, no, no. He won. Suck it up.",4
15882,Penny,4," Well, I‰Ûªd ask you guys if you want dessert, but I know Sheldon doesn‰Ûªt eat dessert on Tuesdays. And even if Raj wanted something, he couldn‰Ûªt tell me. Howard won‰Ûªt order anything, but he will come up with some sort of skeevy comment involving the words pie or cheesecake. And Leonard‰Ûªs lactose intolerant, so he can‰Ûªt eat anything here without his intestines blowing up like a balloon animal.",4
15883,Leonard,4, Hang on a second. I could have the fruit platter.,4
15884,Penny,4, You want the fruit platter?,4
15885,Leonard,4, Does it have melon on it?,4
15886,Penny,4, Yeah.,4
15887,Leonard,4," No, I can‰Ûªt eat melon.",4
15888,Penny,4," Oh, Howard, heads up. Your ex-girlfriend just came in for her shift.",4
15889,Leonard,4, When was the last time you saw her?,4
15890,Howard,4," Oh, not since we broke up. Wow. How am I going to play this? Sophisticated and relaxed? Friendly, noncommittal? Cold and distant? (Hides under table).",4
15891,Bernadette,4," Hi, guys.",4
15892,Leonard,4, Hey.,4
15893,Sheldon,4, Hello. I see you decided to go with pathetic and frightened.,4
15894,Raj,4, It‰Ûªs one of his best moves.,4
15895,Scene,4," Howard‰Ûªs bedroom. Howard enters in a silk dressing gown, puts on romantic music and sets up mood lighting. Gets onto bed.",4
15896,Howard,4," So, my dear, we meet again.",4
15897,Katee Sackhoff,4," Hello, Howard. I‰Ûªve missed you.",4
15898,Howard,4," I‰Ûªve missed you, Katee Sackhoff.",4
15899,Katee Sackhoff,4, One question.,4
15900,Howard,4, Anything.,4
15901,Katee Sackhoff,4, Why am I wearing my Battlestar Galactica flight suit in bed?,4
15902,Howard,4," Why are you in bed with me? If we start to question this, it all falls apart.",4
15903,Katee Sackhoff,4," Sorry. Oh, ravish me, Howard. My loins ache for you.",4
15904,Howard,4," Okay, if you insist.",4
15905,Mrs Wolowitz (off),4," Howard, have you seen my girdle?!",4
15906,Howard,4," No, Ma!",4
15907,Mrs Wolowitz,4," I can‰Ûªt find it, and I‰Ûªm late for my Weight Watchers meeting!",4
15908,Howard,4," Maybe it committed suicide! Leave me alone! Now, where were we?",4
15909,Bernadette,4, I believe you were about to rip off my uniform with your teeth.,4
15910,Howard,4, Bernadette? What are you doing here?,4
15911,Katee Sackhoff,4," Well, if I had to guess, I‰Ûªd say I‰Ûªm here because you saw me earlier this evening, and you‰Ûªre still hung up on me.",4
15912,Howard,4," No, I‰Ûªm not.",4
15913,Bernadette,4," Clearly you are. Otherwise, based on past experience, we‰Ûªd be done by now.",4
15914,Howard,4," Okay, I‰Ûªm a little confused here.",4
15915,George Takei,4," Oh, my. Can I help?",4
15916,Howard,4, Not that kind of confused.,4
15917,Bernadette,4, What‰Ûªs George Takei doing here?,4
15918,Katee Sackhoff,4," Howard, do you have latent homosexual tendencies?",4
15919,Howard,4," No, of course not.",4
15920,George Takei,4," So you say. Yet, here I am.",4
15921,Katee Sackhoff,4," George, let me ask you something. How did you deal with being typecast as a science fiction icon?",4
15922,George Takei,4," It‰Ûªs difficult. You try and stretch as an actor, do Strindberg, O‰ÛªNeill, but all they want is, Course laid in, Captain.",4
15923,Katee Sackhoff,4, Tell me about it. It‰Ûªs frackin‰Ûª frustrating.,4
15924,Howard,4," Wait. Katee, why are you leaving?",4
15925,Bernadette,4, She‰Ûªs leaving because you really want to be with me.,4
15926,Mrs Wolowitz,4," Howard, I found my girdle! It was in the dryer!",4
15927,Howard,4," Great, Ma!",4
15928,Mrs Wolowitz,4, I think it shrunk! I‰Ûªm spilling out like the Pillsbury Doughboy here!,4
15929,Howard,4," And with that mental picture, I think we‰Ûªre done for the evening.",4
15930,Scene,4, The university cafeteria.,4
15931,Leonard,4," You know, you never told me what happened between you and Bernadette.",4
15932,Howard,4, I did a stupid thing.,4
15933,Leonard,4," Yeah, I guessed that.",4
15934,Howard,4, It was the kind of thing that makes it kind of hard to face her now.,4
15935,Leonard,4," That covers anything from farting in bed to killing a homeless guy. Oh, my God. You ran over a hobo.",4
15936,Howard,4, No. Stop asking.,4
15937,Leonard,4," All right, fine. So you want to get back together with her, but you‰Ûªre too ashamed to face her because of whatever it is you did.",4
15938,Howard,4, In a nutshell.,4
15939,Leonard,4," Okay. Well, how about this? Kidnap Bernadette from the opera wearing a creepy mask so she doesn‰Ûªt know it‰Ûªs you.",4
15940,Howard,4," Now, you see, I don‰Ûªt know if you‰Ûªre kidding or not.",4
15941,Raj,4, You‰Ûªre being unreasonable. Why can‰Ûªt I have a desk?,4
15942,Sheldon,4, Our collaboration is a work of the mind. We don‰Ûªt need desks.,4
15943,Raj,4, You have a desk.,4
15944,Sheldon,4, Correct.,4
15945,Raj,4, But I can‰Ûªt have one.,4
15946,Sheldon,4, You‰Ûªre two for two.,4
15947,Leonard,4," Why can‰Ûªt he have a desk, Sheldon?",4
15948,Sheldon,4," Oh, Lord, will this day never end? As I‰Ûªve explained repeatedly to Dr. Koothrappali, whose ability to comprehend the American idiom fails him when it‰Ûªs convenient, there‰Ûªs absolutely no money in my budget for additional office furniture.",4
15949,Raj,4," Oh, but there‰Ûªs money for a drawer full of Red Vines, a marshmallow shooting rifle, and a super executive ant farm with glow-in-the-dark sand?",4
15950,Sheldon,4, Yes.,4
15951,Howard,4," Okay, what if he buys his own desk?",4
15952,Raj,4," Yeah, what if I buy my own desk?",4
15953,Sheldon,4, That‰Ûªs ridiculous.,4
15954,Howard,4, Why?,4
15955,Sheldon,4, Because‰Û_,4
15956,Raj,4, Yes?,4
15957,Sheldon,4, It‰Ûªs my office.,4
15958,Leonard,4, Sheldon.,4
15959,Sheldon,4," All right, all right. He can buy his own desk.",4
15960,Raj,4, And I can put it in your office?,4
15961,Sheldon,4," Well, you really want to dot the I‰Ûªs and cross the T‰Ûªs, don‰Ûªt you?",4
15962,Leonard,4, Why would you want a glow-in-the-dark ant farm?,4
15963,Sheldon,4, They do some of their best work at night.,4
15964,Scene,4, Penny‰Ûªs apartment. Penny is gathering laundry.,4
15965,Penny (picking up a top and sniffing it),4," Ah, it‰Ûªs okay.",4
15966,Sheldon (voice),4," (Knock, knock, knock) Penny? (Knock, knock, knock) Penny? (Knock, knock, knock) Penny? (Penny opens door. Howard is stood outside with a hand-held voice recorder.) Penny?",4
15967,Howard,4, Would you have opened the door if you knew it was me?,4
15968,Penny,4, Not since I found out the teddy bear you gave me had a webcam in it.,4
15969,Howard,4, I just have a question. Does Bernadette ever talk about me?,4
15970,Penny,4," Oh, absolutely.",4
15971,Howard,4, She does?,4
15972,Penny,4," Yeah, sure. Just yesterday, she asked, why is Howard hiding under the table?",4
15973,Howard,4," She saw that, huh?",4
15974,Penny,4," Oh, no, not at first. Right after I pointed it out.",4
15975,Howard,4, Let me ask you something else. Is she seeing anybody?,4
15976,Penny,4," Uh, not that I know of. Hey, while we‰Ûªre on the subject, why did you guys break up anyway?",4
15977,Howard,4," Oh, I‰Ûªd rather not say.",4
15978,Penny,4," Howard, if you want my help, I‰Ûªve got to know what happened.",4
15979,Howard,4, But it‰Ûªs embarrassing.,4
15980,Penny,4," Yeah, that‰Ûªs what I‰Ûªm counting on. Spill.",4
15981,Howard,4," Okay. Well, you know World of Warcraft?",4
15982,Penny,4," Um, the online game? Sure.",4
15983,Howard,4," Well, did you know that the characters in the game can have sex with each other?",4
15984,Penny,4," Oh, God. I think I see where this is going.",4
15985,Howard,4, Her name was Glissinda the Troll. Bernadette walked in on me while we were doing the cyber-nasty under the Bridge of Souls.,4
15986,Penny,4," Oh, you‰Ûªre right. That is so embarrassing.",4
15987,Howard,4, Would you talk to her?,4
15988,Penny,4, Bernadette or the troll?,4
15989,Howard,4," Bernadette. She was so mad at me, she wouldn‰Ûªt even listen to my side of the story.",4
15990,Penny,4," Well, what was your side?",4
15991,Howard,4," Well, for all we know, Glissinda the Troll wasn‰Ûªt even a real woman. I mean, she could‰Ûªve been a 50-year-old truck driver in New Jersey.",4
15992,Penny,4, Really? And that didn‰Ûªt make her feel better?,4
15993,Howard,4," Will you talk to her, see if there‰Ûªs any chance at all we could get back together?",4
15994,Penny,4," Oh, gee, Howard, I really don‰Ûªt want to get in the middle of this.",4
15995,Howard,4," No. Why would you? I‰Ûªm just another lonely nerd, living with his mother, trying to find any scrap of happiness he can. You know, maybe to make up for the fact that his dad left him when he was 11.",4
15996,Penny,4," Okay, I will think about it.",4
15997,Howard,4," You know, I‰Ûªve always blamed myself for him leaving. I always thought it was because I wasn‰Ûªt the son he wanted.",4
15998,Penny,4," Yeah, I said I‰Ûªd think about it.",4
15999,Howard,4," I wasn‰Ûªt athletic, yeah, I was kind of sickly.",4
16000,Penny,4," Okay, fine. Look, look, I‰Ûªm calling her now! See?",4
16001,Howard,4, Thank you.,4
16002,Scene,4, A corridor at the university.,4
16003,Leonard,4," So anyway, Howard asked Penny to talk to Bernadette, and she did, and Bernadette agreed to meet him for a cup of coffee.",4
16004,Sheldon,4, One question.,4
16005,Leonard,4, Yeah?,4
16006,Sheldon,4, Why on earth are you telling me all this?,4
16007,Leonard,4," I don‰Ûªt know. Sometimes your movements are so lifelike, I forget you‰Ûªre not a real boy.",4
16008,Raj,4, You said I could buy a desk.,4
16009,Sheldon,4, This isn‰Ûªt a desk. This is a Brobdingnagian monstrosity.,4
16010,Raj,4," Is that the American idiom for giant, big-ass desk?",4
16011,Sheldon,4, It‰Ûªs actually British.,4
16012,Raj,4, Can you say it again for me?,4
16013,Sheldon,4, Brobdingnagian.,4
16014,Raj,4, One more time?,4
16015,Sheldon,4, Brobdingnagian.,4
16016,Raj,4, Now three times fast?,4
16017,Sheldon,4," Brobdingnagian, Brobdingna‰Û_ How did you even get it in here?",4
16018,Raj,4," That‰Ûªs for me, Ramon, Julio, Jesus and Rodrigo to know and you to find out.",4
16019,Sheldon,4," All right, you‰Ûªve made your point. A fine prank, very amusing. Now get it out.",4
16020,Raj,4, No.,4
16021,Sheldon,4, Yes.,4
16022,Raj,4, No.,4
16023,Sheldon,4, Yes.,4
16024,Raj,4, No.,4
16025,Sheldon,4, Yes.,4
16026,Raj,4," I have three brothers and two sisters, Sheldon, I can do this all day.",4
16027,Sheldon,4," All right, if you‰Ûªre not going to remove it, I‰Ûªll remove it for you.",4
16028,Raj,4, Knock yourself out.,4
16029,Sheldon,4, Help me move my desk.,4
16030,Raj,4, No.,4
16031,Sheldon,4, Yes.,4
16032,Raj,4, No.,4
16033,Sheldon,4, Yes.,4
16034,Raj,4, No. It‰Ûªs too Brobdingnagian.,4
16035,Sheldon,4, Why do you even want this here? Its size is completely disproportionate to its purpose.,4
16036,Raj,4," Well, seeing as its purpose was to piss you off, I‰Ûªd say it‰Ûªs spot-on.",4
16037,Sheldon,4," All right, I see what‰Ûªs going on. This is the opening salvo in what will be an escalating series of juvenile tit-for-tat exchanges. Well titted.",4
16038,Raj,4, Thank you.,4
16039,Sheldon,4, Stand by for my upcoming tat.,4
16040,Raj,4," Hey, Sheldon?",4
16041,Sheldon,4, Yes?,4
16042,Raj,4, No. See what I did there? I turned it around.,4
16043,Scene,4, The Cheesecake Factory,4
16044,Bernadette,4," Sorry, I had to clock out.",4
16045,Howard,4," Oh, no, that‰Ûªs okay. How have you been?",4
16046,Bernadette,4," Okay. You know, busy, school, work. You?",4
16047,Howard,4," Same. I took a scuba-diving course over the summer, but it turns out I‰Ûªm terrified of the ocean.",4
16048,Bernadette,4, Too bad.,4
16049,Howard,4," You wouldn‰Ûªt know anybody who wants to buy a wet suit, boy‰Ûªs large? Yeah, forget it. Not important. So, are you seeing anyone?",4
16050,Bernadette,4," Well, to be honest, I‰Û_",4
16051,Penny,4," Hey, how are we doing over here? Can I get you something to drink?",4
16052,Howard,4," Not for me, thanks.",4
16053,Bernadette,4, I‰Ûªm okay.,4
16054,Penny,4, Are you gonna want to order food?,4
16055,Howard,4, Maybe later.,4
16056,Penny,4, Okay.,4
16057,Howard,4," So, are you seeing anybody?",4
16058,Bernadette,4, No.,4
16059,Penny,4, That‰Ûªs what I told him when he asked me. I hope that‰Ûªs not out of line.,4
16060,Bernadette,4," No, it‰Ûªs fine.",4
16061,Howard,4," Penny, can we have a little privacy?",4
16062,Penny,4, Oh. I‰Ûªm sorry.,4
16063,Bernadette,4," What about you, have you been seeing anybody?",4
16064,Howard,4," Well, you know how it is with guys. I mean, we have needs and‰Û_",4
16065,Bernadette,4, So you‰Ûªve been seeing other girls?,4
16066,Howard,4," Well, not real girls.",4
16067,Bernadette,4, Does that mean slutty trolls?,4
16068,Penny,4," You know, you look thirsty. I brought you some iced tea.",4
16069,Bernadette,4, Thank you.,4
16070,Penny,4," It‰Ûªs passion fruit, new on the menu.",4
16071,Howard,4, Isn‰Ûªt there somewhere else you can be?,4
16072,Penny,4, Not where I can hear you guys.,4
16073,Howard,4," Okay, fine. I‰Ûªll admit, there are dark, sordid little corners of the Internet where the name Wolowizard is whispered in hushed tones. But the only reason I go there, the only reason I‰Ûªve ever gone there is because I don‰Ûªt have a real woman in my life. You happy?",4
16074,Penny,4," Yeah, that‰Ûªll hold me for a while.",4
16075,Bernadette,4," Howard, you did have a real woman. I was right there in the next room while you were clicking that troll‰Ûªs brains out.",4
16076,Howard,4," Yeah, but we weren‰Ûªt, I-I mean, you and I never‰Û_",4
16077,Bernadette,4, Had sex?,4
16078,Howard,4, Yeah.,4
16079,Bernadette,4," Well, whose fault was that?",4
16080,Penny,4, Complimentary nachos! You enjoy. Never had sex? Wow.,4
16081,Howard,4," What do you mean, whose fault was that?",4
16082,Bernadette,4," Well, we could‰Ûªve been having sex, but you never made the move.",4
16083,Howard,4, I didn‰Ûªt think you wanted me to make the move.,4
16084,Bernadette,4," Howard, a girl doesn‰Ûªt go out with a man like you, with your looks, your fancy patter and your tight hoochie pants if she‰Ûªs not expecting him to eventually make the move.",4
16085,Howard,4, Really?,4
16086,Bernadette,4, Really.,4
16087,Howard,4, Son of a bitch.,4
16088,Penny,4," Hey, this is a little awkward, but my manager says I can‰Ûªt actually give nachos away. So, just take that when you‰Ûªre ready.",4
16089,Scene,4, University corridor.,4
16090,Howard,4," Yeah, we had a really great talk, and we‰Ûªre gonna start seeing each other again.",4
16091,Leonard,4," Oh, congratulations. Have you broken it to the troll yet?",4
16092,Howard,4, Did Penny tell you about that?,4
16093,Leonard,4, No. Steve Patterson told me.,4
16094,Howard,4, The greasy old fat guy in Facilities Management?,4
16095,Leonard,4, Yeah.,4
16096,Howard,4, How‰Ûªd he know about it?,4
16097,Leonard,4, He‰Ûªs Glissinda the troll.,4
16098,Raj (voice),4," Sorry, dude, the thermostat‰Ûªs on my side of the room, so it stays Mumbai hot in here until you turn off that stupid Indian music!",4
16099,Sheldon (voice),4, I‰Ûªll turn off the music when you get rid of that salmonella-ridden parakeet!,4
16100,Raj (voice),4," Oh, too bad! Sheldon‰Ûªs pathologically afraid of birds! Hey, look, Sheldon! Birdie, birdie, birdie!",4
16101,Sheldon (voice),4, That‰Ûªs it! Prepare for marshmallow death!,4
16102,Raj (voice),4, Eat flaming Nerf! (Imitates gunfire),4
16103,Leonard,4," So anyway, that‰Ûªs great news about you and Bernadette.",4
16104,Howard,4, Yeah. I think I‰Ûªm gonna take her to miniature golf.,4
16105,Leonard,4," Ah. Well, I guess for you guys that‰Ûªs like regular golf.",4
16106,Howard,4," Short jokes? Really? You‰Ûªre, like, a quarter of an inch taller than me.",4
16107,Leonard,4," Yeah, and don‰Ûªt you forget it.",4
16108,Scene,4, Bernadette‰Ûªs car. ,4
16109,Howard,4, I had a good time.,4
16110,Bernadette,4," Me, too.",4
16111,Katee Sackhoff,4," Kiss her good night. All right, now a little tongue.",4
16112,George Takei,4, Hold on there. We‰Ûªve only just rekindled the romance. Let‰Ûªs not sully the moment with the exchange of saliva.,4
16113,Katee Sackhoff,4, Don‰Ûªt listen to him. She wants it. Tongue. Luh-luh-luh-luh-luh. See? Now make the move.,4
16114,George Takei,4, Mm-mmm. Too soon.,4
16115,Katee Sackhoff,4," Trust me, she‰Ûªs ready. Make the move.",4
16116,George Takei,4," No, no, no. A lady wants to be wooed, courted slowly.",4
16117,Katee Sackhoff,4, How would you know?,4
16118,George Takei,4, I read.,4
16119,Katee Sackhoff,4," Listen to me, Howard, it‰Ûªs time. Make the move, now.",4
16120,Bernadette,4, Mm! What are you doing?,4
16121,Howard,4," You said, well, the move, remember?",4
16122,Bernadette,4," Oh, not now. We‰Ûªre starting a new relationship. I need to get to know you again.",4
16123,Howard,4," No, you don‰Ûªt. It‰Ûªs me. The lusty charmer with the fancy patter and the hoochie pants.",4
16124,Bernadette,4," Be patient, we‰Ûªll get there.",4
16125,George Takei,4, Told you.,4
16126,Scene,4, University corridor. ,4
16127,Leonard,4," Oh, God, what‰Ûªs that smell? (Knocks on Sheldon‰Ûªs door. Sheldon answers in a gas mask). Oh-ho-hoo!",4
16128,Sheldon,4, Yes?,4
16129,Leonard,4, What are you doing in there?,4
16130,Sheldon,4, I‰Ûªm making hydrogen sulphide and ammonia gas. Just a little experiment in pest control.,4
16131,Raj,4," It‰Ûªs not gonna work, dude, I grew up in India, an entire subcontinent where cows walk in the street, and nobody has ever had a solid bowel movement.",4
16132,Sheldon,4," Well, we‰Ûªll just see how long you can hold out.",4
16133,Raj,4," Well, we‰Ûªll just see how your noxious gas fares against my cinnamon-apple-scented aroma therapy candles.",4
16134,Leonard,4, Didn‰Ûªt you say you‰Ûªre making hydrogen sulphide gas?,4
16135,Sheldon,4, Yes.,4
16136,Leonard,4, Isn‰Ûªt that flammable?,4
16137,Sheldon,4," Highly. Oh, dear. (Explosion)",4
16138,Raj,4, This is not over.,4
16139,Scene,5, The apartment.,4
16140,Leonard,5," All I‰Ûªm saying is, if they took all the money they spent trying to make a decent Hulk movie, they could probably just make an actual Hulk.",4
16141,Sheldon,5, That is apt and amusing. I think I shall share that with Amy Farrah Fowler. She‰Ûªll appreciate the witticism.,4
16142,Leonard,5, Thank you.,4
16143,Sheldon,5, It‰Ûªll also help improve her initial impression of you.,4
16144,Leonard,5, So what‰Ûªs going on with you two?,4
16145,Sheldon,5," Well, the status is as it always was. She‰Ûªs a girl. She‰Ûªs a friend. She is not my, please forgive me for doing this, girlfriend.",4
16146,Leonard,5," Right, right. So you‰Ûªre still just texting and emailing? You don‰Ûªt feel any need to hang out with her, you know, be in the same room?",4
16147,Sheldon,5," Leonard, you are my best friend. I‰Ûªve known you for seven years, and I can barely tolerate sitting on the couch with you. Imagine my attitude regarding prolonged physical proximity to Amy Farrah Fowler.",4
16148,Leonard,5, Got it.,4
16149,Sheldon,5, I sense judgment on your part.,4
16150,Leonard,5," No, no. Maybe a little.",4
16151,Sheldon,5, May I suggest that your criticism is based on jealousy.,4
16152,Leonard,5, Jealousy? What do I have to be jealous of?,4
16153,Sheldon,5, I have a functioning and satisfying relationship with a female. You have none.,4
16154,Leonard,5," Oh, right. That.",4
16155,Sheldon,5," Jealousy is an ugly green-eyed monster, not unlike the Hulk, who, by the way, also has a girlfriend. In this iteration, Jennifer Connelly, whom you may recall as the girlfriend of Russell Crowe in A Beautiful Mind, a feel-good romp if there ever was one.",4
16156,Leonard,5, I‰Ûªm not jealous.,4
16157,Sheldon,5, Hu-u-urgh! Leonard not jealous.,4
16158,Scene,5, The apartment.,4
16159,Sheldon,5," You know, it just occurred to me, if there are an infinite number of parallel universes, in one of them, there‰Ûªs probably a Sheldon who doesn‰Ûªt believe parallel universes exist.",4
16160,Leonard,5, Probably. What‰Ûªs your point?,4
16161,Sheldon,5," No point. It‰Ûªs just one of the things that makes one of the mes chuckle. What makes you chuckle, Leonard?",4
16162,Leonard,5," Hmm, recently? Not much.",4
16163,Sheldon,5," Is it because of the conflict that arises from your desperate need to pair-bond with a woman, and the apparent collective decision of all womankind to deny you that opportunity?",4
16164,Leonard,5," Um, shut up.",4
16165,Sheldon,5," You know, when my grandfather died, and Meemaw was alone, my mom arranged for her to visit a centre three times a week where she could socialize with other lonely people. It‰Ûªs very nice. They discuss current events, play bridge, get a hot meal.",4
16166,Leonard,5, That sounds lovely.,4
16167,Sheldon,5," It is if you like bridge. Do you like bridge, Leonard?",4
16168,Leonard,5," Sheldon, I‰Ûªm just not dating someone right now. I don‰Ûªt need to go to a senior centre.",4
16169,Sheldon,5," Meemaw resisted at first, but now she loves it.",4
16170,Leonard,5," Fine. If I don‰Ûªt meet someone soon, you can put me in a home.",4
16171,Sheldon,5, It‰Ûªs not a home. It‰Ûªs a senior centre.åÊ We‰Ûªd never put Meemaw in a home!,4
16172,Scene,5, The comic book store.,4
16173,Leonard,5," Hey, guys.",4
16174,Howard,5, Hey.,4
16175,Raj,5, Hey.,4
16176,Sheldon,5," All right, I‰Ûªll bow to social pressure. Hey!",4
16177,Howard (phone rings),5," Excuse me. That‰Ûªs my girlfriend, Bernadette. I assigned her her own ringtone, Bernadette by The Four Tops. Hello, Bernadette.",4
16178,Raj,5," When I call him, his phone plays Brown Eyed Girl. Which, now that I think about it, is not so good.",4
16179,Leonard,5," You realize he‰Ûªs just rubbing our noses in the fact that he has a girlfriend, and we don‰Ûªt.",4
16180,Rai,5," You mean, you don‰Ûªt.",4
16181,Leonard,5, You have a girlfriend? How could you have a girlfriend? You can‰Ûªt even speak to women.,4
16182,Raj,5," Two words, deaf chick. It doesn‰Ûªt matter if I can‰Ûªt talk, because she can‰Ûªt hear me.",4
16183,Leonard,5, What?,4
16184,Raj,5, That‰Ûªs what she said.,4
16185,Leonard,5," Great. You have a girlfriend, Howard‰Ûªs got a girlfriend, Sheldon‰Ûªs got a girl‰Û_",4
16186,Sheldon,5," No, no, no, no!",4
16187,Leonard,5, ‰Û_who‰Ûªs a friend.,4
16188,Sheldon,5, Thank you.,4
16189,Leonard,5," What about you, Stuart? You have a girlfriend yet?",4
16190,Stuart,5," Oh, yeah. Yeah. I met her at Comic-Con, the one place in the world where saying I own a comic bookstore is an actual pickup line.",4
16191,Leonard,5," Oh. Well, good for you.",4
16192,Stuart,5," Not really. She‰Ûªs horrible. When she wants to have sex, she puts on her plus-size Wonder Woman costume and shouts who wants to take a ride in my invisible plane?",4
16193,Leonard,5, Why don‰Ûªt you just break up with her?,4
16194,Stuart,5," No, no, I can‰Ûªt.",4
16195,Leonard,5, Why not?,4
16196,Stuart,5," ‰Û÷Cause then I‰Ûªd be alone, like you.",4
16197,Raj,5," Dude, why don‰Ûªt you just invoke your girlfriend pact with Wolowitz?",4
16198,Leonard,5, Because I don‰Ûªt need his girlfriend to set me up with one of her girlfriends. I‰Ûªm perfectly capable of finding a girl on my own.,4
16199,Raj,5," Oh, Leonard, you remind me of the funny old story about a man who walks into a women‰Ûªs correctional institution with a stack of paperwork that will allow the female convicts to go free.",4
16200,Leonard,5, You‰Ûªre saying I couldn‰Ûªt get laid in a women‰Ûªs prison with a handful of pardons.,4
16201,Raj,5, Are you going to let me tell the story or not?,4
16202,Scene,5, The apartment. Leonard is stretched face down on the sofa.,4
16203,Sheldon,5, Leonard? Are you sleeping?,4
16204,Leonard,5, No.,4
16205,Sheldon,5, Are you ill?,4
16206,Leonard,5, No.,4
16207,Sheldon,5," Are you still depressed because you‰Ûªre alone, and no one loves you?",4
16208,Leonard,5, I don‰Ûªt know. Maybe.,4
16209,Sheldon,5, I want you to know that I‰Ûªm genuinely concerned about your well-being.,4
16210,Leonard,5, Thank you.,4
16211,Sheldon,5, You‰Ûªre welcome. But it‰Ûªs still no reason to have your feet in my spot.,4
16212,Amy (on webcam),5, May I offer an observation?,4
16213,Leonard,5, What the hell? How long has she been here?,4
16214,Sheldon,5, Since we got home from the comic bookstore.,4
16215,Leonard,5, That was two hours ago.,4
16216,Sheldon,5," As per your suggestion, we‰Ûªre hanging out. Quite frankly, I don‰Ûªt see what all the hoopla‰Ûªs about. Go on, Amy.",4
16217,Amy,5," From a neurobiological standpoint, Leonard, you may be alone because your psychological state is causing an actual pheromone-based stink of desperation.",4
16218,Sheldon,5," Did you know that, Leonard?",4
16219,Leonard,5, No.,4
16220,Sheldon,5, I did.,4
16221,Amy,5, I understand that some people find mates in social gathering places such as bars or taverns. Have you tried a bar or tavern?,4
16222,Leonard,5," No, I‰Ûªm not gonna try to pick up a woman in a bar.",4
16223,Sheldon,5," Wise decision. You see, Amy, success at a bar is based on classic male attributes such as height, strength, attractiveness, the ability to hold one‰Ûªs liquor and throw darts, separately or together. Leonard has none of these attributes, right, Leonard?",4
16224,Leonard,5, Right.,4
16225,Amy,5," That‰Ûªs not true of all bars. Juice bars, for example.",4
16226,Sheldon,5," Oh! Good point, Amy. Yeah, building on your premise, Leonard could frequent sushi bars, salad bars, oyster bars, the Apple Genius Bar, what are you doing?",4
16227,Leonard (exiting the apartment),5, Keep going. I‰Ûªm listening.,4
16228,Amy,5, That was rude.,4
16229,Sheldon,5, He does it all the time. He‰Ûªs a cornucopia of social awkwardness.,4
16230,Amy,5, Cornucopia. What a mellifluous word.,4
16231,Sheldon,5, Let‰Ûªs make that our word of the day.,4
16232,Amy,5, Agreed. And we‰Ûªll use mellifluous tomorrow.,4
16233,Sheldon,5," Well, I have to void my bladder. It was nice spending this time with you.",4
16234,Amy,5, Wait. I have a request.,4
16235,Sheldon,5, Yes?,4
16236,Amy,5, I‰Ûªd like you to meet my mother.,4
16237,Sheldon,5, I see. Can I get back to you on that?,4
16238,Amy,5, Certainly. Good night.,4
16239,Sheldon,5," Good night. (Closing laptop, and running down stairs in panic) Leonard, Leonard, Leonard,",4
16240,Leonard,5," Yeah, what?",4
16241,Sheldon,5, Amy Farrah Fowler has asked me to meet her mother.,4
16242,Leonard,5, Yeah. So?,4
16243,Sheldon,5, What does that mean?,4
16244,Leonard,5," Well, you know how you‰Ûªre always saying that Amy is a girl who‰Ûªs your friend, and not your girlfriend?",4
16245,Sheldon,5, Uh-huh.,4
16246,Leonard,5, You can‰Ûªt say that anymore.,4
16247,Sheldon,5, Wait. What?,4
16248,Leonard,5," Look, she obviously wants to take your relationship to the next level.",4
16249,Sheldon,5, I don‰Ûªt want the next level. I like this level. Fix it for me!,4
16250,Leonard,5," Me? Well, how am I supposed to fix it?",4
16251,Sheldon,5," Simple! You want a girlfriend, Amy wants to be someone‰Ûªs girlfriend. Take her off my hands. I give you my blessing.",4
16252,Leonard,5, That is insane.,4
16253,Sheldon,5, You‰Ûªre right. It would never work. Amy finds you tedious.,4
16254,Leonard,5," Okay, good luck.",4
16255,Sheldon,5, Wait! What am I supposed to do?,4
16256,Leonard,5," Well, have you considered telling her how you feel?",4
16257,Sheldon,5," Leonard, I‰Ûªm a physicist, not a hippie.",4
16258,Leonard,5," All right, well, let me see if I can explain your situation using physics. What would you be if you were attached to another object by an inclined plane wrapped helically around an axis?",4
16259,Sheldon,5, Screwed.,4
16260,Leonard,5, There you go.,4
16261,Sheldon,5, Amy‰Ûªs right. He is tedious.,4
16262,Scene,5, Outside Howard‰Ûªs house. Leonard rings bell.,4
16263,Mrs Wolowitz (off),5," Howard, get the door!",4
16264,Howard (off),5, Why can‰Ûªt you get it?,4
16265,Mrs Wolowitz (off),5, You know I‰Ûªm doing a bowel cleanse for my colonoscopy! I‰Ûªm like an upside-down volcano here.,4
16266,Howard,5," Oh, hey. I hope you didn‰Ûªt hear that.",4
16267,Leonard,5, The volcano thing? No.,4
16268,Howard,5, What‰Ûªs with the T-shirt? You working at the Apple store now?,4
16269,Leonard,5," No, it‰Ûªs just something I threw on.",4
16270,Howard,5," I know all your shirts. That‰Ûªs not one of them. You were pretending to work at the Genius Bar to pick up women, weren‰Ûªt you?",4
16271,Leonard,5," Yeah. Turns out, they guard the iPods, but they don‰Ûªt guard the shirts.",4
16272,Howard,5," So, how‰Ûªd it go?",4
16273,Leonard,5," It was going well. I was showing this super hot girl how to boot up in Safe Mode. The manager got suspicious, and, well, long story short, they really do have a little jail in the mall.",4
16274,Howard,5," Just FYI, don‰Ûªt try to go back with a fake moustache. I mean, they may not really be geniuses, but they see right through that.",4
16275,Leonard,5," I want to invoke the girlfriend pact, Howard.",4
16276,Howard,5, You that desperate?,4
16277,Leonard,5," No, I just, I want what you have. You know, I want a woman in my life.",4
16278,Mrs Wolowitz (off),5," Holy Moses, how much liquid can be in one tukus?",4
16279,Leonard,5," To be clear, I meant like Bernadette, not your mother.",4
16280,Howard,5," Yeah, I know what you mean.",4
16281,Scene,5, The apartment.,4
16282,Leonard,5," Well, I‰Ûªm off to meet Bernadette‰Ûªs friend. How do I look?",4
16283,Sheldon,5," As if one of the plants from Invasion of the Body Snatchers duplicated you in every way, only with an absurd amount of hair gel.",4
16284,Leonard,5, What are you working on?,4
16285,Sheldon,5, I‰Ûªm removing my digital footprint from the Internet so Amy Farrah Fowler can‰Ûªt find me and compel me to meet her mother.,4
16286,Leonard,5," Ah, you‰Ûªre going off the grid.",4
16287,Sheldon,5, Exactly.,4
16288,Leonard,5, The old Unabomber approach. Kudos.,4
16289,Sheldon,5, Thank you. I‰Ûªve also sent Amy a relationship termination notice and changed my cell phone number and e-mail address.,4
16290,Leonard,5, What if she just comes over?,4
16291,Sheldon,5, She‰Ûªll get lost. We no longer live at 2311 Los Robles. We now live at 311 Los Robles.,4
16292,Leonard,5, You changed the address on the building? What about mail?,4
16293,Sheldon,5," Oh, no worries, I explained my predicament to our letter carrier. He was sympathetic. His exact words were, Got your back, Jack. Bitches be crazy.",4
16294,Leonard (there is a knock on the door),5, Who is it?,4
16295,Amy (off),5, Amy Farrah Fowler.,4
16296,Sheldon,5, Darn! She found me!,4
16297,Leonard,5, She‰Ûªs been here before.,4
16298,Sheldon,5," The only flaw in an otherwise perfect plan. Now, get my back, Jack.",4
16299,Leonard,5, What do you want to do?,4
16300,Sheldon,5, Tell her I‰Ûªm not here.,4
16301,Leonard,5," Okay, where are you?",4
16302,Sheldon,5," I don‰Ûªt know. You‰Ûªll have to devise a scenario that plausibly explains my absence, keeping in mind that the key to a good lie lies in the details.",4
16303,Leonard,5," Hi, Amy. Sheldon‰Ûªs not here.",4
16304,Amy,5, All right. (Leaves),4
16305,Sheldon,5, Way to go on the details.,4
16306,Scene,5, A restaurant.,4
16307,Leonard,5," Thanks again for doing this, Bernadette.",4
16308,Bernadette,5," Oh, I take pacts very seriously. One time at my lab, a petri dish of genetically modified super-virus went missing. That day we made a pinky swear never to admit we crossed Ebola with the common cold.",4
16309,Howard,5, Why the hell would you cross Ebola with the common cold?,4
16310,Bernadette,5," We never did. That would be a terrible, terrible thing.",4
16311,Girl (arriving),5," Hi. Sorry I‰Ûªm late, I was at the gym. Spin class. Worked up quite a sweat.",4
16312,Bernadette,5," Joy, this is Leonard. Leonard, this is Joy.",4
16313,Leonard,5, Hi.,4
16314,Joy,5," Hi. You don‰Ûªt look like a genius. Go ahead, say something smart.",4
16315,Leonard,5, Uh‰Û_,4
16316,Joy,5," Aah! Time‰Ûªs up. Just kidding. First thing you need to know about me, I‰Ûªm hilarious.",4
16317,Leonard,5," Yeah. So, Bernadette tells me she knows you from self-defence classes?",4
16318,Joy,5," Yeah. Israeli Krav Maga. Lots of fun. Basically, a hundred different ways to rip a guy‰Ûªs nuts off.",4
16319,Leonard,5, Wow. Wouldn‰Ûªt think there‰Ûªd be that many.,4
16320,Joy,5, Number 42!,4
16321,Leonard,5, Whoa!,4
16322,Bernadette,5, Isn‰Ûªt she a pip?,4
16323,Scene,5, The stairwell.,4
16324,"Sheldon (rhythmically, while walking down the stairs)",5," Proxima Centauri‰Ûªs the nearest star. The celestial bodies that follow are Alpha Centauri A, Toli, Barnard‰Ûªs Star, Wolf 359, Lalande 21185, Sirius A, Sirius B, BL-Ceti, UV-Ceti, Ross 154, Ross 248, Epsilon Eridani, Lac-9352, Ross 128, Procyon A, oh, darn, that‰Ûªs wrong! (Heads back up stairs) EZ Aquarii A, EZ Aquarii B, EZ Aquarii C, Procyon A. Those are the stars that are nearest to me. Tra-la-la and fiddle-dee-dee. (Sees Amy standing in lobby) Oh, dear.

16329,Leonard,5," Yep, it is.",4
16330,Joy,5, 73!,4

16332,Joy,5," Excuse me, I have to go to the little girls‰Ûª room and take a wicked whiz.",4
16333,Bernadette,5, I‰Ûªll go with you.,4
16334,Joy,5," Fair warning, I had the asparagus. My pee is gonna stink up the place.",4
16335,Howard,5, I think she likes you.,4
16336,Scene,5, The stairwell. Amy is sitting on the bottom step.,4
16337,Sheldon (wearing a heavy coat and false nose and glasses),5," EZ Aquarii B, EZ Aquarii C, excuse me, madam.",4
16338,Amy,5, Sheldon?,4
16339,Sheldon,5, Rats!,4
16340,Amy,5, I believe a misunderstanding may have occurred when I asked you to meet my mother.,4
16341,Sheldon,5," No misunderstanding. I‰Ûªve learned what that request actually means, and I don‰Ûªt want to be joined to another object by an inclined plane wrapped helically around an axis.",4
16342,Amy,5, In what way are you screwed? All I want to do is present you as my boyfriend to my mother so she‰Ûªll be satisfied that I‰Ûªm in a relationship.,4
16343,Sheldon,5, So we‰Ûªd be perpetrating a ruse?,4
16344,Amy,5, Precisely.,4
16345,Sheldon,5, And you haven‰Ûªt fallen hopelessly in love with me?,4
16346,Amy,5, Don‰Ûªt be absurd. I find the notion of romantic love to be an unnecessary cultural construct that adds no value to human relationships.,4
16347,Sheldon,5," Amy Farrah Fowler, that‰Ûªs the most pragmatic thing anyone has ever said to me.",4
16348,Amy,5, I trust this clarification allows us to return to boy-slash-friend-slash-girl-slash-friend status.,4
16349,Sheldon,5, Of course. Would you like to join me for Chinese food?,4
16350,Amy,5," Sheldon, please, you‰Ûªre suffocating me.",4
16351,Sheldon,5," My apologies. Good night, Amy.",4
16352,Amy,5," Good night, Sheldon.",4
16353,Scene,5, The restaurant. ,4
16354,Howard,5," Come on, just give her a chance. Maybe she‰Ûªll grow on you.",4
16355,Leonard,5," Or maybe she‰Ûªll finally succeed in ripping my nuts off. There are still 93 ways she hasn‰Ûªt tried yet. Look, Howard, I appreciate the effort, but this is, like, the worst date of my life.",4
16356,Howard,5," Seriously? I was once robbed by a pre-op transsexual I met on J-Date, and that didn‰Ûªt even crack my top ten.",4
16357,Leonard,5," I guess the difference is, I have some self-respect.",4
16358,Howard,5, Not that I‰Ûªve ever seen.,4
16359,Leonard,5, It‰Ûªs relatively new. I just know that I‰Ûªm not gonna spend time with someone I don‰Ûªt like simply to have a girlfriend. I‰Ûªm okay on my own.,4
16360,Joy,5," Good news, I made lots of room for dessert.",4
16361,Leonard,5," Look, uh, Joy, it was nice to meet you, but‰Û_",4
16362,Joy,5," Yeah, you, too. Hey, you got anything for next weekend? I need a date for my cousin‰Ûªs wedding.",4
16363,Leonard,5, You‰Ûªre asking me out?,4
16364,Joy,5," Yeah. And it‰Ûªs an open bar, so I‰Ûªll probably be giving it away.",4
16365,Leonard,5, I look forward to it.,4
16366,Scene,5, The apartment. ,4
16367,Mrs Fowler (on webcam),5," It‰Ûªs nice to meet you, too, Sheldon. I honestly didn‰Ûªt believe Amy when she told me she had a boyfriend.",4
16368,Sheldon,5, I assure you I am quite real and I‰Ûªm having regular intercourse with your daughter.,4
16369,Mrs Fowler,5, What?,4
16370,Sheldon,5," Oh, yes. We‰Ûªre like wild animals in heat. It‰Ûªs a wonder neither of us has been hurt.",4
16371,Mrs Fowler,5," Amy, what is he saying?",4
16372,Amy,5," You wanted me to have a boyfriend, Mother. Well, here he is. Have to sign off now. My hunger for Sheldon is stirring in my loins.",4
16373,Sheldon,5," Oh, yes, it‰Ûªs time for me to make love to your daughter‰Ûªs vagina.",4
16374,Mrs Fowler,5, Oh!,4
16375,Amy,5," Thank you, Sheldon, that went very well.",4
16376,Sheldon,5," Agreed. Amy, I find myself wondering if we should actually engage in coitus at least one time in our relationship. Bazinga. Bedtime. Please show yourself out.",4
16377,Scene,6, The university cafeteria. ,4
16378,Howard,6, Gagh!,4
16379,Leonard,6, Problem?,4
16380,Howard,6, This is the worst cobbler I‰Ûªve ever eaten. I mean it tastes like it was made of actual ground-up shoemaker.,4
16381,Sheldon,6, Amusing. A play on the two meanings of cobbler.,4
16382,Raj,6," Hey guys, guess who I found at LAX. My baby sister Priya.",4
16383,Sheldon,6," Excuse me. I object. You propose a guessing game, yet you don‰Ûªt give me enough time to guess. For the record, I was going to say your sister Priya.",4
16384,Priya,6," Oh, Sheldon. You haven‰Ûªt changed a bit, have you?",4
16385,Sheldon,6, Why would I change?,4
16386,Leonard,6," The hope has been that you‰Ûªd eventually bend to public opinion. So, Priya, what brings you back to LA?",4
16387,Priya,6, I have a one day layover on my way to Toronto. Corporate merger.,4
16388,Raj,6, Can you believe it? Little Priya‰Ûªs one of the lead attorneys for the biggest car company in India.,4
16389,Sheldon,6," Given that when we met her she was finishing law school and planning an internship at a large Indian car company, it‰Ûªs actually extremely plausible.",4
16390,Leonard,6, And your poll numbers just keep dropping.,4
16391,Priya,6," I want to catch up with all of you, but first I really must visit the loo.",4
16392,Leonard,6," I‰Ûªm going too, I‰Ûªll show you where it is.",4
16393,Raj,6," Alright, this goes without saying, but I‰Ûªm just going to say it anyway. Hands off my sister.",4
16394,Sheldon,6," Why would I touch her, she‰Ûªs covered with airplane germs.",4
16395,Raj,6, I‰Ûªm so not talking to you. I‰Ûªm talking to him.,4
16396,Howard,6," Hey, I‰Ûªve got a girlfriend now.",4
16397,Raj,6, Oh please. My sister‰Ûªs much hotter than your girlfriend and you know it.,4
16398,Howard,6, Let‰Ûªs just agree they‰Ûªre both hot.,4
16399,Raj,6," Dude, that‰Ûªs my sister you‰Ûªre talking about.",4
16400,Howard,6," Okay, forget who‰Ûªs hotter. The first time Priya came to LA, Leonard and I made a pact out of respect to our friendship, and to you, that neither of us would hit on her.",4
16401,Raj,6, Did you pinky swear?,4
16402,Howard,6, Yes.,4
16403,Raj,6, Okay then.,4
16404,Sheldon,6, Cobbler. I‰Ûªm still laughing.,4
16405,Scene,6, A corridor.,4
16406,Priya,6, It‰Ûªs really nice to see you again Leonard.,4
16407,Leonard,6, Yeah. It‰Ûªs good to see you too. Here you go.,4
16408,Priya,6, Thanks. (Grabs him and kisses him.) ,4
16409,Leonard,6, Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa. (Looks around.) Okay.,4
16410,Scene,6, The cafeteria.,4
16411,Howard,6," So, you got any special plans with your sister?",4
16412,Raj,6," Oh, not really, just hang out.",4
16413,Sheldon,6," I always tell people, if you have only one day in Los Angeles, make it a train day.",4
16414,Raj,6, Train day?,4
16415,Sheldon,6," The fun starts with brunch at Carney‰Ûªs in Studio City, a hot dog stand in a converted railroad dining car. Next stop, Travel Town, an outdoor museum featuring 43 railroad engines, cars and other rolling stock from the 1880s to the 1930s. Finally, we‰Ûªre off to the glitz and glamour of Hollywood for dinner at, that‰Ûªs right, the Hollywood Carney‰Ûªs, a hot dog stand in a different converted railroad dining car.",4
16416,Raj,6, I don‰Ûªt think we‰Ûªre going to do that.,4
16417,Sheldon,6," Well then apparently, you hate fun.",4
16418,Leonard,6," Hmm, Priya‰Ûªs not back yet? Well, I guess that‰Ûªs not unusual, women, men, the whole sitting, standing deal, so, what are we talking about?",4
16419,Raj,6," Uh, my plans with Priya.",4
16420,Sheldon,6, He rejected train day.,4
16421,Leonard,6, Did you make it clear that it‰Ûªs two different train cars turned into hot dog stands?,4
16422,Sheldon,6, Abundantly.,4
16423,Leonard,6, I guess he just hates fun.,4
16424,Sheldon,6, That‰Ûªs what I said.,4
16425,Priya,6," Okay, so, what‰Ûªs new with you guys.",4
16426,Howard,6, I have a girlfriend now.,4
16427,Priya,6," Hey, good for you.",4
16428,Howard,6," Yeah, I just wanna put it out there in case I inadvertently squirt any pheromones in your direction. Happy? (Raj nods). ",4
16429,Leonard,6," So, uh, Priya, what are your plans while you‰Ûªre here.",4
16430,Priya,6," I don‰Ûªt know, I just have the one day.",4
16431,Sheldon,6, Do you like trains?,4
16432,Priya,6, Not particularly.,4
16433,Sheldon,6, You might as well just wait at the airport for your flight.,4
16434,Scene,6, The apartment. Sheldon is on his laptop.,4
16435,Sheldon,6," You are in a forest. There is quicksand to the west, a path leads to the east. Go east. An iron gate blocks your way. Open gate. It‰Ûªs locked. Hmm, well, so much for that.",4
16436,Leonard,6," It‰Ûªs getting pretty late, how come you‰Ûªre still up?",4
16437,Sheldon,6, I‰Ûªve found an emulator online that lets you play classic text based computer games from the 1980s.,4
16438,Leonard,6, That‰Ûªs pretty cool.,4
16439,Sheldon,6," Oh yes. It runs on the world‰Ûªs most powerful graphics chip, imagination.",4
16440,Leonard,6, You‰Ûªve really got to get out more.,4
16441,Sheldon,6," Go north. You can‰Ûªt go that way. Go west. A troll blocks your passage. Okay, fasten your seatbelts, kill troll. With what? With sword. (There is a knock on the door.) You don‰Ûªt have the sword. Good golly, it‰Ûªs as if it‰Ûªs actually happening to me.",4
16442,Priya (at door),6, Raj finally went to bed.,4
16443,Leonard,6," Yeah, well, (kissing her) Sheldon‰Ûªs still up.",4
16444,Priya,6, You said he goes to bed at nine.,4
16445,Leonard,6," Yeah, he does but he got caught up in a computer game and‰Û_",4
16446,Sheldon,6," Hit troll with axe. Hit troll with axe. Hit troll with axe. Oh my, this is one tough troll.",4
16447,Priya,6, Can‰Ûªt you get rid of him?,4
16448,Leonard,6," If the past is any indication, no.",4
16449,Sheldon,6," Leonard, I‰Ûªm trapped in quicksand, the axe is dragging me down.",4
16450,Leonard,6, Drop axe.,4
16451,Sheldon,6, Drop axe. Brilliant.,4
16452,Leonard,6," Give me a minute. Sheldon,",4
16453,Sheldon,6," Hold on. I have to figure out how to get the bucket, so I can carry the mud past the dragon.",4
16454,Leonard,6," Sheldon, you need to work in the morning.",4
16455,Sheldon,6, I know.,4
16456,Leonard,6," Well then, bed mister.",4
16457,Sheldon,6, Five more minutes.,4
16458,Leonard,6, Really? You‰Ûªre going to risk getting sleepy in the middle of your thermodynamic fluctuations seminar? You know what happens when you yawn in public.,4
16459,Sheldon,6, Everyone will see my oddly shaped uvula.,4
16460,Leonard,6," You don‰Ûªt want that, do you?",4
16461,Sheldon,6, No. But it‰Ûªs a shame our society mocks the differently uvulated. Who was at the door?,4
16462,Leonard,6," Oh, uh, building manager. They have to fix a pipe so the water will be off tomorrow from noon to two.",4
16463,Sheldon,6, That‰Ûªs unacceptable. We‰Ûªre supposed to be given written notice.,4
16464,Leonard,6," No, no, it doesn‰Ûªt matter, we‰Ûªll be at work.",4
16465,Sheldon,6," Well, what if I spill tomato soup on my shirt and have to come home to change, only to find there‰Ûªs no water for an enzyme soak.",4
16466,Leonard,6," Bifurcated uvula, Sheldon!",4
16467,Sheldon,6, I‰Ûªll have the chicken noodle. Goodnight.,4
16468,Leonard (to Priya),6, We‰Ûªre going to have to be very quiet.,4
16469,Sheldon,6," I know how to get the bucket! I can turn the axe around and use the handle to reach it. Let‰Ûªs see. Go north. You are in a forest. Go north. You are in a forest. Go north. You are in a forest. Oh dear, I believe I‰Ûªm lost. Well, I‰Ûªll just have to get a fresh start tomorrow.",4
16470,Leonard,6," No, no, no, no, no. You just need, you just need, you just need to map it out. Come on, I‰Ûªll help you. So, uh, you stopped at the stream and you turned north three times?",4
16471,Sheldon,6, Yes.,4
16472,Leonard,6," You‰Ûªre right, you‰Ûªre lost, good luck.",4
16473,Scene,6, Leonard‰Ûªs bedroom. Morning. ,4
16474,Priya,6," Oh! Leonard, wake up.",4
16475,Leonard,6, Huh! Sorry!,4
16476,Priya,6, For what?,4
16477,Leonard,6," I don‰Ûªt know. When I‰Ûªm in bed with a girl, it‰Ûªs just, it‰Ûªs my go to response.",4
16478,Priya,6," It‰Ûªs six o‰Ûª clock, I have to get back to Raj‰Ûªs before he wakes up and realises I‰Ûªm gone.",4
16479,Leonard,6," Oh, right, sure. I wish you could stay in LA a while longer.",4
16480,Priya,6, Mmm. Me too.,4
16481,Leonard,6," You know, I was thinking, there are some great research facilities in India.",4
16482,Priya,6," Where are you going with this, Leonard?",4
16483,Leonard,6," Well, I‰Ûªm just saying, I don‰Ûªt have any real ties here, so if I were to move to New Delhi we could, you know, go out.",4
16484,Priya,6," Leonard, didn‰Ûªt we have this conversation five years ago.",4
16485,Leonard,6," Well, yes, but, things have changed, you know, you‰Ûªre older, I‰Ûªm older. Look, no more superhero bedsheets.",4
16486,Priya,6," Sweetheart, just because we have fun when I come to town doesn‰Ûªt mean I want to have a serious relationship.",4
16487,Leonard,6, It doesn‰Ûªt?,4
16488,Priya,6," Mm-mm. And besides, I could never bring a white boy home to my parents. They‰Ûªd have a cow. Which is a much bigger deal in India.",4
16489,Leonard,6, I‰Ûªm not that white. My great-great grandmother was half Cherokee. I know that‰Ûªs not the right kind of Indian but it is something.,4
16490,Priya,6," Aha, you‰Ûªre funny.",4
16491,Sheldon,6," (Knock, knock, knock) Leonard. (Knock, knock, knock) Leonard. (Knock, knock, knock) Leonard.",4
16492,Leonard,6, What?,4
16493,Sheldon,6, I heard a woman laughing.,4
16494,Leonard,6," Oh, uh, yeah, I was trying to see if I could laugh as a woman.",4
16495,Sheldon,6," Oh. Well, good job, quite convincing. I smell perfume.",4
16496,Leonard,6, Air freshener.,4
16497,Sheldon,6, And is that lipstick on your cheek and neck.,4
16498,Leonard,6," Uh, rash, that‰Ûªs a bad rash.",4
16499,Sheldon,6, My sympathies. I am no stranger to the crimson scourge that is dermatitis. Can I interest you in a topical steroid from my lotion and unguent collection?,4
16500,Leonard,6," Uh, yeah, yeah, that sounds great.",4
16501,Sheldon,6," Very well, I‰Ûªm sure I can find something that will help you ditch that itch.",4
16502,Leonard,6," Okay, he‰Ûªs in the bathroom, let‰Ûªs go.",4
16503,Sheldon,6, Do you prefer ointment or cream?,4
16504,Leonard,6," Uh, cream.",4
16505,Sheldon,6, With or without a numbing agent?,4
16506,Leonard,6, Without.,4
16507,Sheldon,6," Really? Leonard, there are no heroes when it comes to dermatitis.",4
16508,Leonard,6, Fine. With.,4
16509,Sheldon,6, Prescription or non-prescription strength.,4
16510,Leonard,6, Use your best judgement.,4
16511,Sheldon,6," Well, I think I have a nice 2009 AnaMantle HC. It‰Ûªs usually indicated for acutely inflamed haemorrhoids, but it also goes nicely with non mucosal body parts.",4
16512,Leonard,6, Sounds great.,4
16513,Sheldon,6, Excellent choice.,4
16514,Leonard (whispering),6," Right, right, alright. (They creep almost to the apartment door.)",4
16515,Sheldon,6, Priya?,4
16516,Priya,6," Good morning, Sheldon.",4
16517,Sheldon,6," For shame, Leonard. For shame. And to think I was ready to waste the last of my good haemorrhoid cream on you.",4
16518,Scene,6, Leonard‰Ûªs car. ,4
16519,Leonard,6," Making pretty good time, huh?",4
16520,Sheldon,6," Is that really what you want to talk about, Leonard?",4
16521,Leonard,6, No.,4
16522,Sheldon,6, What do you want to talk about?,4
16523,Leonard,6, Please don‰Ûªt tell anyone I spent the night with Raj‰Ûªs sister.,4
16524,Sheldon,6, There it is. What if someone asks?,4
16525,Leonard,6, No-one‰Ûªs going to ask if I spent the night with Raj‰Ûªs sister.,4
16526,Sheldon,6, Perhaps. But they might ask me something else.,4
16527,Leonard,6, Like what?,4
16528,Sheldon,6," Like, has Leonard betrayed any of his friends recently?",4
16529,Leonard,6, Priya and I are both adults. We didn‰Ûªt betray Raj.,4
16530,Sheldon,6," In fact, you did, but I was referring to Howard.",4
16531,Leonard,6, What are you talking about?,4
16532,Sheldon,6," April 12th, 2005, Bob‰Ûªs Big Boy, Toluca Lake. Raj had just introduced us to Priya for the first time, and she was enjoying the sweet taste of Hindu rebellion in the form of a Bob‰Ûªs Super Big Boy hamburger. In order to preserve your friendship, you and Howard made a pinky swear that neither of you would attempt to woo her. I had a patty melt.",4
16533,Leonard,6," Okay, fine, I betrayed Howard.",4
16534,Sheldon,6, And Raj.,4
16535,Leonard,6," Alright, and Raj.",4
16536,Sheldon,6, And me.,4
16537,Leonard,6, You?,4
16538,Sheldon,6," Violation of the roommate agreement, overnight guest notification clause.",4
16539,Leonard,6," Okay fine, I‰Ûªm, I‰Ûªm a horrible human being, I‰Ûªm the Darth Vader of Pasadena.",4
16540,Sheldon,6, You‰Ûªre far too short to be Darth Vader. At best you might be a turncoat Ewok.,4
16541,Leonard,6," My point is, Priya‰Ûªs gone. And it would be much better if no-one else found out about this.",4
16542,Sheldon,6," You mean, you want me to keep a secret.",4
16543,Leonard,6, Yes.,4
16544,Sheldon,6, You know I can‰Ûªt keep a secret.,4
16545,Leonard,6," You can if you try. Think about it this way, if I were Batman and you were Alfred, you‰Ûªd keep that secret. Right?",4
16546,Sheldon,6, Why do you get to be Batman?,4
16547,Leonard,6," Because, well, Batman has the secret.",4
16548,Sheldon,6, Well Alfred has secrets too.,4
16549,Leonard,6, Like what?,4
16550,Sheldon,6," Alfred knows that Barbara Gordon is Batgirl. Which I‰Ûªve now just told to Batman. See, I can‰Ûªt keep a secret.",4
16551,Scene,6, Leonard‰Ûªs lab.,4
16552,Sheldon,6, Ta-da!,4
16553,Leonard,6, What.,4
16554,Sheldon,6, Ta-da. It‰Ûªs short for da-da-da-da!,4
16555,Leonard,6," Kind of busy here, Sheldon.",4
16556,Sheldon,6," I know, that‰Ûªs why I shortened it.",4
16557,Leonard,6, What do you want.,4
16558,Sheldon,6, I came to go over your alibi for last night.,4
16559,Leonard,6, What alibi?,4
16560,Sheldon,6," You‰Ûªve asked me to lie on your behalf, and as you know, I am deeply uncomfortable with impromptu dishonest, so I‰Ûªve provided you with an iron clad alibi. You couldn‰Ûªt have spent last night with Priya, because you were with another woman.",4
16561,Leonard,6," Oh, I‰Ûªm so sure I‰Ûªm going to regret this, but, who was I with?",4
16562,Sheldon,6," The fun loving, and morally loose, Miss Maggie McGeary.",4
16563,Leonard,6," Oh, God.",4
16564,Sheldon,6," You met her at Pasadena‰Ûªs most popular Irish watering hole, Lucky Baldwin‰Ûªs, where Maggie spends her nights tending bar, with a head full of curls and a heart full of dreams.",4
16565,Leonard (reading a napkin Sheldon has handed him),6," Leonard, call me if you‰Ûªre interested in coitus. Sincerely, Maggie McGeary.",4
16566,Sheldon,6, And if anyone were to actually call that number they will hear this.,4
16567,Mechanical voice on Sheldon‰Ûªs phone,6, Top of the morning to you. You‰Ûªve reached Maggie McGeary. Leave a message after the wee little beep.,4
16568,Sheldon,6," It‰Ûªs pretty convincing, huh? And it wasn‰Ûªt even a real person. And here is the clincher. A lock of Maggie‰Ûªs flaming auburn hair.",4
16569,Leonard,6, Where did you get that?,4
16570,Sheldon,6, From an orang-u-tan in the primate lab.,4
16571,Leonard,6, An orang-u-tan?,4
16572,Sheldon,6," Well, no-one‰Ûªs going to run a DNA test on it, Leonard, honestly you over-think everything.",4
16573,Leonard,6," Sheldon, I don‰Ûªt need an alibi. Nobody‰Ûªs going to ask about last night as long as you just zip your lip. (Sheldon makes lip zipping movement.) Thankyou. Now don‰Ûªt worry, everything is going to be fine. (Sheldon writes ‰ÛÏI doubt it‰Û on Leonard‰Ûªs whiteboard.",4
16574,Scene,6, The cafeteria.,4
16575,Leonard,6, Hey.,4
16576,Raj,6," Hey, Leonard, will you please tell Howard my sister‰Ûªs never been attracted to him.",4
16577,Leonard,6," C‰Ûªmon Raj, how am I supposed to know who she‰Ûªs attracted to. Or was attracted to. Or who she might be attracted to. In the future.",4
16578,Sheldon,6," And I have nothing to contribute to this conversation. Because I too know absolutely nothing about Priya‰Ûªs preferences in male companionship. And with that, I will re-zip my lip.",4
16579,Raj,6," Hey, so what did you guys think of the new episode of Caprica last night?",4
16580,Leonard,6, I didn‰Ûªt see it.,4
16581,Howard,6, Didn‰Ûªt see it? What were you doing?,4
16582,Leonard,6," Uh, I was out.",4
16583,Raj,6, On Caprica night?,4
16584,Leonard,6," Yeah, I, uh, went for a drink.",4
16585,Howard,6," Really, you, and where, where did you go?",4
16586,Leonard,6," To, uh, Lucky Baldwin‰Ûªs.",4
16587,Sheldon,6," Oh, I‰Ûªve heard of that place, isn‰Ûªt that Pasadena‰Ûªs favourite Irish watering hole.",4
16588,Leonard,6, Yes.,4
16589,Sheldon,6," Did you meet anyone interesting there, perhaps a promiscuous redheaded barmaid?",4
16590,Leonard,6, As a matter of fact I.. I‰Û_ I can‰Ûªt‰Û_ I can‰Ûªt‰Û_ I can‰Ûªt do it.,4
16591,Sheldon,6," Sure you can, you‰Ûªre doing fine, it‰Ûªs very believable.",4
16592,Leonard,6," Look, I‰Ûªm sorry Raj, but the truth is I was with Priya last night.",4
16593,Sheldon,6," Don‰Ûªt listen to him, he‰Ûªs still light headed from all the Irish whiskey and pickled eggs in his system.",4
16594,Raj,6, What were you doing with Priya?,4
16595,Sheldon,6," I believe they engaged in coitus but, more importantly, if Leonard had not abandoned his story, would you have found it plausible?",4
16596,Raj,6, What? You slept with my sister?,4
16597,Leonard,6, Yeah.,4
16598,Howard,6, How could you? We had a pact!,4
16599,Raj,6," Excuse me, I think how could you she‰Ûªs my sister takes precedence over a five year old pinky swear!",4
16600,Sheldon,6," May I point out, in a parallel universe, your friends are saying Maggie McGeary, she sounds lovely.",4
16601,Leonard,6," Look, I admit it, I may have crossed a line here, but come on, Raj, your sister is a grown woman. To her, I‰Ûªm a forbidden piece of white chocolate.",4
16602,Raj,6," I‰Û_ I don‰Ûªt believe it, this is a terrible betrayal of my trust.",4
16603,Leonard,6," No, no, no, would it help if I told you that I offered her my heart and she kind of stomped on it.",4
16604,Raj,6, How hard did she stomp?,4
16605,Leonard,6, Very hard.,4
16606,Raj,6," Okay, I‰Ûªm good.",4
16607,Howard,6," Yeah, well, Raj, I just want to say that I‰Ûªd never betray your trust. Unlike Leonard, I respect you.",4
16608,Leonard,6, Really?,4
16609,Howard,6, Mmm.,4
16610,Leonard,6, Was it out of respect that you didn‰Ûªt tell Raj about the time you dropped his iPhone in a urinal?,4
16611,Raj,6, Dude! I put that thing on my face!,4
16612,Sheldon,6, I think a more amusing violation of Raj‰Ûªs trust is when Howard convinced him that foreigners give presents to Americans on Thanksgiving.,4
16613,Howard,6," Hey, I didn‰Ûªt see you giving back your Snoopy snowcone maker.",4
16614,Raj,6, That was all a lie? This year‰Ûªs gifts are already wrapped!,4
16615,Howard,6," And as long as we‰Ûªre talking about betraying our friends, how about the month Sheldon spent grinding up insects and mixing them into Leonard‰Ûªs food.",4
16616,Sheldon,6," Well, excuse me. That was not a betrayal, that was an experiment to determine at what concentration food starts tasting mothy.",4
16617,Leonard,6, You put moths in my food?,4
16618,Sheldon,6, For science.,4
16619,Raj,6, I can‰Ûªt believe you kissed my sister with moth mouth.,4
16620,Leonard,6," Well, uh, I can‰Ûªt believe you used Sheldon‰Ûªs toothbrush.",4
16621,Sheldon,6, You used my toothbrush?,4
16622,Raj,6," Not the brush part, just the little rubber thing to pick food from my teeth and massage my gums.",4
16623,Leonard,6," Okay, I, I, I think it‰Ûªs safe to say that we‰Ûªve all done some things we‰Ûªre not particularly proud of. But come on, we‰Ûªre friends. Friends overlook each other‰Ûªs minor lapses. For the record, Howard, I‰Ûªm sorry that I broke our pact.",4
16624,Howard,6," Thankyou, and I‰Ûªm sorry about your phone. And Thanksgiving. And while we‰Ûªre at it, you don‰Ûªt have to wash our clothes on the fourth of July.",4
16625,Raj,6," As long as we‰Ûªre apologising, Sheldon, I, I‰Ûªm sorry I used your toothbrush.",4
16626,Sheldon,6, And I‰Ûªm sorry. But that behaviour is beyond the pale and cannot be tolerated. We are no longer friends.,4
16627,Raj,6, I got you a talking Thomas the Tank Engine for Thanksgiving.,4
16628,Sheldon,6, With real puffing smoke?,4
16629,Raj,6, Yes.,4
16630,Sheldon,6, Alright. But I‰Ûªm watching you.,4
16631,Scene,6, The apartment. Sheldon is making snowcones.,4
16632,Leonard,6," Hey, you got Snoopy out. Can I have a snowcone?",4
16633,Sheldon,6," Well, sure.",4
16634,Leonard,6," These are pretty god, what flavour is this?",4
16635,Sheldon,6, Guess.,4
16636,Leonard,6, Papaya?,4
16637,Sheldon,6, No.,4
16638,Leonard,6, Guava?,4
16639,Sheldon,6, You‰Ûªre so close.,4
16640,Leonard,6, I give up.,4
16641,Sheldon,6," Mango, caterpillar. What are you doing? You said you liked it!",4
16642,Scene,7, The University Cafeteria.,4
16643,Leonard,7," No, seriously, I think I‰Ûªve finally figured out my problem with women.",4
16644,Sheldon,7, The capybara is the largest member of the rodent family.,4
16645,Leonard,7, What does that have to do with me and women?,4
16646,Sheldon,7, Nothing. It was a desperate attempt to introduce an alternate topic of conversation.,4
16647,Leonard,7," My problem is, I don‰Ûªt project confidence. So I decided that the next time I meet a woman I think is attractive, rather than holding back and being cautious, I‰Ûªm going to assume the mantle of self-assurance.",4
16648,Raj,7," Oh, yeah? What‰Ûªs that look like?",4
16649,Leonard,7," Hi. I‰Ûªm Leonard. And you are beautiful. You pop, sparkle and buzz electric. I‰Ûªm going to pick you up at eight, show you a night you will never forget.",4
16650,Raj,7, Where are we going?,4
16651,Howard,7, Good news. I made it onto the team for the new Defence Department laser-equipped surveillance satellite.,4
16652,Sheldon,7," Excuse me. If we‰Ûªre changing topics, I believe I have first dibs with capybara, a rodent the size of a baby hippo.",4
16653,Leonard,7, Congratulations Howard.,4
16654,Howard,7," Thanks. Listen, I have to get a security clearance, so you guys might be hearing from the FBI.",4
16655,Raj,7," Whoa, whoa, whoa! I don‰Ûªt want to speak to the FBI.",4
16656,Leonard,7, Why not?,4
16657,Raj,7, I‰Ûªm brown and I talk funny.,4
16658,Howard,7, They‰Ûªre just doing a background check on me.,4
16659,Raj,7," It doesn‰Ûªt matter. They‰Ûªll find a reason to give me a one-way ticket back to Gandhi-ville. By the way, when I say that, it‰Ûªs not offensive.",4
16660,Leonard,7," Don‰Ûªt be ridiculous, Raj. You‰Ûªre here legally.",4
16661,Raj,7, Nobody cares. Do you know how long it‰Ûªs been since I got through airport security without being given a colonoscopy?,4
16662,Sheldon,7," You know, I try very hard to make our lunch hours educational and informative, but your insistence on talking about your own lives stymies me at every turn.",4
16663,Leonard,7," Fine, Sheldon, tell us about your giant rodents.",4
16664,Sheldon,7," No, you squandered your time with me, and the moment has now passed. Feast on your disappointment, much as the capybara feasts on its own waste.",4
16665,Scene,7, Raj‰Ûªs apartment. Raj is reading New Moon.,4
16666,Raj,7," Oh, Bella, don‰Ûªt you see? Edward‰Ûªs only pushing you away because he loves you. (Knock on door) Coming.",4
16667,Woman at Door,7," Dr. Koothrappali? (Raj nods) I‰Ûªm Special Agent Page, FBI. May I come in? (Nods again) I‰Ûªd like to talk to you about Howard Wolowitz. (Indicates sofa) Oh, thank you. All right. Well, how long have you known Mr. Wolowitz?",4
16668,Raj (Holds up finger to indicate he will be right back. Runs to kitchen. Tries to drink wine but bottle is empty. Looks in fridge and finds rum cake. Comes back stuffing a piece in his mouth),7, Rum cake?,4
16669,Page,7," No, thanks. Now, about Mr. Wolowitz.",4
16670,Raj,7, Seven years.,4
16671,Page,7, I see.,4
16672,Raj,7," I‰Ûªm in this country legally, you know.",4
16673,Page,7," I‰Ûªm sure you are. Now, to your knowledge, has Mr. Wolowitz ever committed a crime?",4
16674,Raj,7," Of course not. I‰Ûªm here on an H-1B visa, which means I can‰Ûªt be associated in any way with crime or criminal activity. And I‰Ûªm not.",4
16675,Page,7," Good. To your knowledge, does Mr. Wolowitz have any foreign contacts?",4
16676,Raj,7," No, just me. Oh, there it is. Here comes a cavity search.",4
16677,Page,7, Excuse me?,4
16678,Raj,7," Please don‰Ûªt send me back to India, it‰Ûªs so crowded. It‰Ûªs like the whole country is one endless Comic-Con, except everybody‰Ûªs wearing the same costume, Indian Guy.",4
16679,Page,7," Dr. Koothrappali, I‰Ûªm not‰Û_",4
16680,Raj,7," I love this country! The-the baseball, the freedom, the rampant morbid obesity! From California to the New York Island, I‰Ûªm a real Yankee Doodle boy!",4
16681,Page,7," Dr. Koothrappali, please.",4
16682,Raj,7," My country ‰Ûªtis of thee, duh duh duh liberty, It‰Ûªs really great.",4
16683,Scene,7, Leonard‰Ûªs lab. ,4
16684,Leonard,7," So, when Howard said the FBI would be contacting me, I was expecting Mulder. Glad to see I got Scully.",4
16685,Page,7, Who?,4
16686,Leonard,7," Mulder and Scully. X-Files. The truth is out there. Never mind. Uh, so, what would you like to know?",4
16687,Page,7," You work with Mr. Wolowitz here at the university, correct?",4
16688,Leonard,7," Yes. Of course, we‰Ûªre in different departments. He‰Ûªs an engineer and I‰Ûªm an experimental physicist. You know, one of those guys who examines the building blocks of creation and says, Hello, maker of the universe, I see what you did there. Good one.",4
16689,Page,7," Right. Now, how would you characterize your relationship with Mr. Wolowitz?",4
16690,Leonard,7," Good. It‰Ûªs a good relationship. Of course, most of my relationships are good. Probably because I exude confidence. People are drawn to that, you know? Confidence, not exuding.",4
16691,Page,7, Do you know of any groups Mr. Wolowitz is a member of?,4
16692,Leonard,7," You are beautiful, you know that? You pop, sparkle and buzz electric. I‰Ûªm going to pick you up at eight, show you a night you will never forget.",4
16693,Page,7, Sounds great.,4
16694,Leonard,7, Really?,4
16695,Page,7, Yeah. Can my six-foot-two Navy SEAL husband come with us?,4
16696,Leonard,7," Is that, oh, my, I didn‰Ûªt see the ring with my glasses off, so, look at that, I‰Ûªm starting to exude.",4
16697,Scene,7, The apartment. There is a knock on the door.,4
16698,Leonard,7, Want to get that?,4
16699,Sheldon,7, Not particularly.,4
16700,Leonard,7, Could you get that?,4
16701,Sheldon,7, I suppose I could if I were asked.,4
16702,Leonard,7, Would you please get that?,4
16703,Sheldon,7, Of course. Why do you have to make things so complicated?,4
16704,Page,7, Dr. Cooper?,4
16705,Sheldon,7, Yes.,4
16706,Page,7," I‰Ûªm Special Agent Page, FBI.",4
16707,Sheldon,7," You say you‰Ûªre Special Agent Page, FBI.",4
16708,Page,7, Here‰Ûªs my I.D.,4
16709,Sheldon,7, And here is my Justice League membership card. But that doesn‰Ûªt prove I know Batman.,4
16710,Page,7, I just want to ask you a few questions about Howard Wolowitz.,4
16711,Sheldon,7, Oh. All right. I doubt anyone would risk the stiff penalties for impersonating a federal officer just to ask questions about a minor league engineer with an unresolved Oedipal complex.,4
16712,Page,7, Thank you.,4
16713,Sheldon,7," For the record, I truly support the FBI in the mission which is expressed through their motto?",4
16714,Page,7," Fidelity, bravery, integrity?",4
16715,Sheldon,7," Correct. Now to business. 18 years ago, I sent the FBI Crime Lab samples from a bag of excrement that had been lit on fire on my front porch for fingerprinting and DNA analysis. Why haven‰Ûªt I heard back yet?",4
16716,Page,7," Well, the FBI Crime Lab does have a lot on its plate.",4
16717,Sheldon,7, That‰Ûªs of little comfort to a nation attempting to scrape burning feces off its shoes.,4
16718,Page,7, Would you mind if we talked about Mr. Wolowitz now?,4
16719,Sheldon,7," A little, but go on.",4
16720,Page,7, Thank you. Would you characterize him as responsible?,4
16721,Sheldon,7," I‰Ûªm going to answer that with a visual aid. This is my nine-disc complete Lord of the Rings trilogy blu-ray set.åÊ Mr. Wolowitz borrowed it, damaged plastic retention hub number three, and then returned it to me, hoping I wouldn‰Ûªt notice. Would you characterize that as responsible?",4
16722,Page,7, That‰Ûªs really not the sort of thing we‰Ûªre interested in.,4
16723,Sheldon,7," You heard me say blu-ray, right?",4
16724,Page,7, I did.,4
16725,Sheldon,7, Very well. Would you be interested in knowing that Mr. Wolowitz once snuck onto my World of Warcraft account and changed the name of a certain level-80 warlock from Sheldor to Smeldor?,4
16726,Page,7, I‰Ûªm afraid not. Is there anything else?,4
16727,Sheldon,7," Is there anything else? Where would you like to start? He refuses to pay fines when he‰Ûªs overdue with books I lend him. He crashed the Mars Rover while attempting to impress a woman. He recommended that I go see the third Matrix movie because it was, and I quote, just as good as the first one. If that‰Ûªs not irresponsible, I don‰Ûªt know what is.",4
16728,Page,7, The Mars Rover?,4
16729,Sheldon,7, Did I say Mars Rover?,4
16730,Page,7, You did.,4
16731,Sheldon,7," That was actually a poorly chosen example, as it had nothing to do with me.",4
16732,Page,7," Yes, well, let‰Ûªs talk about it anyway.",4
16733,Sheldon,7, I don‰Ûªt want to. Not that my disinclination to discuss the topic should be interpreted as evidence of Howard Wolowitz‰Ûªs culpability in the destruction of government property worth millions of dollars.,4
16734,Page,7," Thank you, Dr. Cooper. I think I have all I need.",4
16735,Sheldon,7," Oh, good. I was afraid you were going to fixate on that Mars Rover incident.",4
16736,Scene,7, The cafeteria.,4
16737,Howard,7," Hey, buddies. Guess who didn‰Ûªt get security clearance to work on the giant space laser?",4
16738,Leonard,7, What happened?,4
16739,Howard,7," Apparently, the background interviews didn‰Ûªt go well. You guys wouldn‰Ûªt know anything about that, would you?",4
16740,Raj,7," Well, actually, I may have gotten a little tipsy when I talked to her.",4
16741,Leonard,7, And I may have hit on her a little bit.,4
16742,Raj,7, I may have thrown up rum cake on her shoes.,4
16743,Howard,7," I see. Well, it‰Ûªs good to know, when I need you guys, I can always count on you to step up and ruin everything.",4
16744,Leonard,7, I feel awful.,4
16745,Raj,7," Ah, me, too.",4
16746,Leonard,7," To tell you the truth, I thought if anyone was going to screw things up for Howard, it‰Ûªd be Sheldon.",4
16747,Sheldon,7," Well, your expectations have been subverted. Aha.",4
16748,Scene,7, The apartment.,4
16749,Leonard,7, What are you doing up?,4
16750,Sheldon,7," Sleep eludes me, Leonard.",4
16751,Leonard,7, Really? Maybe sleep has met you before.,4
16752,Sheldon,7, Mockery? That‰Ûªs all you have to offer?,4
16753,Leonard,7, I‰Ûªm sorry. Why can‰Ûªt you sleep?,4
16754,Sheldon,7, Who knows? I haven‰Ûªt watched any scary movies recently. I‰Ûªm no longer obsessing over why the predicted mass of the quantum vacuum has little effect on the expansion of the universe. And it‰Ûªs been weeks since I took that accidental sip of Red Bull.,4
16755,Leonard,7, Did something happen today that‰Ûªs bothering you?,4
16756,Sheldon,7," Well, I did mention the Mars Rover incident to that FBI agent and probably cost Howard his security clearance.",4
16757,Leonard,7, What?,4
16758,Sheldon,7, But why should that keep me up?,4
16759,Leonard,7, Because you feel guilty?,4
16760,Sheldon,7, Interesting. So you‰Ûªre saying my insomnia is caused by a guilty conscience.,4
16761,Leonard,7," Actually, you don‰Ûªt have insomnia. You‰Ûªre sleeping now.",4
16762,Sheldon,7, Excuse me?,4
16763,Leonard,7, You‰Ûªre having a guilt-ridden dream.,4
16764,Sheldon,7, Do you have any evidence to support that hypothesis?,4
16765,Leonard,7, How about that Gorn sitting on the couch?,4
16766,Sheldon,7," That seems fairly conclusive. (In his bed) No, Gorn, no. That‰Ûªs where I sit.",4
16767,Scene,7, Agent Page‰Ûªs Office.,4
16768,Sheldon,7," Thank you for agreeing to see me, Agent Page.",4
16769,Page,7," Thank you for filing a complaint with my superior, Dr. Cooper. I understand you want to recant your statement about Howard Wolowitz.",4
16770,Sheldon,7, Yes.,4
16771,Page,7, Was your statement untrue?,4
16772,Sheldon,7, No.,4
16773,Page,7, Then I‰Ûªm afraid you can‰Ûªt withdraw it.,4
16774,Sheldon,7, I‰Ûªm sorry. I don‰Ûªt recall you saying no backsies.,4
16775,Page,7, Is there anything else?,4
16776,Sheldon,7," Yes. I‰Ûªd like to offer a laudatory statement about Howard‰Ûªs many excellent qualities that I believe will tip the scales back in his favour. Howard Joel Wolowitz. H is for honesty, of which he has much. O‰Ûªs for outstanding, which he is such. W‰Ûªs for witty, he‰Ûªs quick with a joke. A‰Ûªs for artistic, his ability‰Û_",4
16777,Page,7," I‰Ûªm sorry, Dr. Cooper, this matter is already closed.",4
16778,Sheldon,7, But I still have rd Joel Wolowitz left to go.,4
16779,Page,7, It‰Ûªs closed.,4
16780,Sheldon,7," I don‰Ûªt understand why you people are picking on my friend, Howard, when there are much more serious security threats to pursue. For instance, when I first met Leonard, he was on the verge of giving away rocket secrets to a North Korean spy, and not one agent ever investigated that.",4
16781,Page,7, This is Leonard Hofstadter?,4
16782,Sheldon,7," No, it‰Ûªs a different Leonard. He‰Ûªs Chinese, red hair, six fingers. Good-bye.",4
16783,Scene,7, A corridor at the university.,4
16784,Sheldon,7, Raj. Have you seen Howard?,4
16785,Raj,7," I think he‰Ûªs eating lunch. Uh, Sheldon, I want you to meet Neil deGrasse Tyson from the Hayden Planetarium in New York.",4
16786,Sheldon,7, I‰Ûªm quite familiar with Dr. Tyson. He‰Ûªs responsible for the demotion of Pluto from planetary status. I liked Pluto. Ergo I do not like you.,4
16787,Dr Tyson,7, But I actually didn‰Ûªt demote Pluto. That was a vote of the International Astronomical Union.,4
16788,Sheldon,7," If ifs and buts were candy and nuts, we‰Ûªd all have a merry Christmas. Think about that, Dr. Tyson.",4
16789,Dr Tyson,7, Is that the guy you were telling me about?,4
16790,Raj,7," Oh, yeah.",4
16791,Scene,7, The cafeteria.,4
16792,Sheldon,7, Howard. The person at fault for you not getting a security clearance is me.,4
16793,Howard,7, You?,4
16794,Sheldon,7," Yes, but before you get upset, I want you to know I went to the FBI and retracted my statement.",4
16795,Howard,7, And they were okay with that?,4
16796,Sheldon,7," No. If anything, I made it worse. In any case, I have been riddled with guilt, which is causing Gorn-infested REM sleep. So, I‰Ûªm here now to say I‰Ûªm sorry.",4
16797,Howard,7," Are you kidding me? You‰Ûªve set my career back at least two years, and you think you can make it right with I‰Ûªm sorry?",4
16798,Sheldon,7," Yes. I followed the social protocol. I attempted to right the wrong, and when I failed to do so I delivered a heartfelt apology. Now you say apology accepted, and I will offer you a one-time-only high five.",4
16799,Howard,7, Your apology is not accepted.,4
16800,Sheldon,7," You‰Ûªre tricking me. It really is, isn‰Ûªt it?",4
16801,Howard,7," Leave me alone, Sheldon.",4
16802,Dr Tyson,7," Dr. Cooper, I just wanted you to know I‰Ûªm sorry for the role I played in the Pluto matter.",4
16803,Sheldon,7," Oh, shut up.",4
16804,Scene,7, The bar of the Cheesecake Factory.,4
16805,Penny,7, Sheldon?,4
16806,Sheldon,7, Hello.,4
16807,Penny,7, What are you doing here?,4
16808,Sheldon,7," I have troubles, Penny. I‰Ûªve come to pour them out to the sympathetic ear of the local barkeep.",4
16809,Penny,7," You know, they have a really nice bar over at the Olive Garden.",4
16810,Sheldon,7, I don‰Ûªt like the Olive Garden. They treat me like family.,4
16811,Penny,7," Okay, Sheldon. What can I get you?",4
16812,Sheldon,7, Alcohol.,4
16813,Penny,7, Could you be a little more specific?,4
16814,Sheldon,7, Ethyl alcohol. 40 millilitres.,4
16815,Penny,7," I‰Ûªm sorry, honey, I don‰Ûªt know millilitres.",4
16816,Sheldon,7, Ah. Blame President James ‰ÛÏJimmy‰Û Carter. He started America on a path to the metric system but then just gave up. He wonders why he was a one-term president.,4
16817,Penny (pouring out a shot of tequila),7, Would you say that‰Ûªs about 40 milliliters?,4
16818,Sheldon,7, More or less.,4
16819,Penny,7," Great. (Drinks the tequila) Now, where were we?",4
16820,Sheldon,7," I believe you were about to ask me to choose a cocktail. Fortunately, thanks to computer-savvy alcoholics, there‰Ûªs an app for that. Let‰Ûªs see. Harvey Wallbanger. Eh. Sex on the Beach. I hardly think so. Rob Roy, Silk Slipper, Mad Hatter. Ooh! I‰Ûªll have a Rosewater Ricky.",4
16821,Penny,7, A what?,4
16822,Sheldon,7," You‰Ûªll need pitted, brandied cherries, gin, rosewater, angostura bitters and overproofed rum. Now, first, dust the cherries with sugar, then spray them with a mixture of rum and bitters. Then ignite the rum, caramel‰Û_",4
16823,Penny (pouring out a shot of tequila),7," Here you go, one Rosewater Ricky.",4
16824,Sheldon,7, That‰Ûªs not how it looks in the picture.,4
16825,Penny,7," Oh, yeah, you know, every bartender makes it differently. Why don‰Ûªt you give it a try.",4
16826,Sheldon,7, All right. To the metric system. (Knocks back drink. Spits it all back into glass.) I can‰Ûªt taste the cherries.,4
16827,Penny,7," All right. Sheldon, what‰Ûªs on your mind?",4
16828,Sheldon,7," I wronged Howard, and he won‰Ûªt accept my apology.",4
16829,Penny,7," Oh, right, that. Yes, Leonard told me. Sorry, honey.",4
16830,Sheldon,7," Penny, you face failure on a daily basis. How do you cope?",4
16831,Penny,7, I drink.,4
16832,Sheldon,7," To drinking. (Knocks back drink and spits it out again.) Nope. Oh, if only there were some way to force Howard to accept my apology so I could escape this miasma of guilt.",4
16833,Penny,7," You know, sometimes stuff just happens, and there‰Ûªs nothing you can do about it. For example, Lisa Peterson hasn‰Ûªt talked to me since the 11th grade, because no matter how much you apologize, you can‰Ûªt go back and un-dry-hump someone‰Ûªs boyfriend.",4
16834,Sheldon,7," I see. You‰Ûªre saying I‰Ûªm facing Starfleet Academy‰Ûªs unwinnable command scenario, the Kobayashi Maru.",4
16835,Penny,7, Exactly. Sometimes you can‰Ûªt win.,4
16836,Sheldon,7, Captain Kirk won.,4
16837,Penny,7, Kirk cheated.,4
16838,Sheldon,7, Impressive that you know that. It‰Ûªs hard to believe I‰Ûªm actually having this conversation with you.,4
16839,Penny,7, Right there with you.,4
16840,Sheldon,7, Kirk beat the Kobayashi Maru by reprogramming the simulator. That‰Ûªs it.,4
16841,Penny,7, What?,4
16842,Sheldon,7, I‰Ûªll reprogram Howard.,4
16843,Penny,7," What? Sheldon, you can‰Ûªt reprogram people.",4
16844,Sheldon,7," No, you can‰Ûªt reprogram people. To James Tiberius Kirk. (Drinks. Leaves. Comes back and spits it out again.)",4
16845,Scene,7, The cafeteria.,4
16846,Sheldon,7," Hello, all.",4
16847,Raj,7, Hello.,4
16848,Leonard,7, Hey.,4
16849,Sheldon,7," Howard, you‰Ûªre feeling better about me today, aren‰Ûªt you?",4
16850,Howard,7, Not really.,4
16851,Sheldon,7," Yes, you are. I‰Ûªm using neurolinguistic programming to modify your thought patterns.",4
16852,Howard,7," Oh. Go away, Sheldon.",4
16853,Sheldon,7, There‰Ûªs a nine ninety five e-book down the drain.,4
16854,Raj,7, What‰Ûªs in the bag?,4
16855,Sheldon,7, It‰Ûªs for Howard.,4
16856,Howard,7," Oh. Sheldon, you can‰Ûªt fix this with gifts.",4
16857,Sheldon,7," Nevertheless, I‰Ûªve hurt you, and whether you forgive me or not, I want you to have this.",4
16858,Howard,7, You‰Ûªre giving me a couch cushion?,4
16859,Sheldon,7, No. The cushion is merely symbolic. I‰Ûªm giving you my spot on the couch.,4
16860,Howard,7, But you love that spot.,4
16861,Sheldon,7, No. I love my mother. My feelings for my spot are much greater. It is the singular location in space around which revolves my entire universe. And now it‰Ûªs yours.,4
16862,Raj,7," Oh, my God, dude. Now you have to forgive him.",4
16863,Howard,7, All right. Apology accepted.,4
16864,Sheldon,7, High five. Not too hard. Thank you.,4
16865,Raj,7, I haven‰Ûªt cried like this since Toy Story 3.,4
16866,Scene,7, The apartment. ,4
16867,Howard,7," I got to tell you, Sheldon, I understand why you chose this spot. I mean, the temperature is good, but there‰Ûªs no draft. I can see the television, but I can still talk to‰Û_",4
16868,Sheldon,7, I changed my mind. Get out of my spot.,4
16869,Penny,7, How long?,4
16870,Leonard,7, 94 seconds.,4
16871,Scene,8, The apartment.,4
16872,Penny,8," Okay, help me out here. How does an archaeology professor get that good with a whip?",4
16873,Howard,8, Maybe he took a class at the adult bookstore. That‰Ûªs how I learned.,4
16874,Leonard,8, I can‰Ûªt believe you‰Ûªve never seen Raiders of the Lost Ark.,4
16875,Penny,8," And I can‰Ûªt believe you‰Ûªve never read Eat, Pray, Love.",4
16876,Leonard,8," When she comes out with Eat, Pray, Run Away From A Giant Boulder, I‰Ûªll read it.",4
16877,Howard (after Raj whispers to him),8," I don‰Ûªt care if Eat, Pray, Love changed your life, I‰Ûªm not reading it.",4
16878,Penny,8," You know, I could totally rock a hat like that.",4
16879,Sheldon,8," That‰Ûªs the work of noted Hollywood costume designer Deborah Nadoolman. She also designed the iconic red and black jacket in Michael Jackson‰Ûªs Thriller video, which I‰Ûªve never viewed in its entirety, as I find zombies dancing in choreographed synchronicity implausible. And also, it‰Ûªs really scary.",4
16880,Leonard,8, Would someone please turn off the Sheldon commentary track?,4
16881,Sheldon,8, There‰Ûªs no switch. Just listen and learn.,4
16882,Howard,8," Penny, if you think this is good, you should come with us Friday to see it on the big screen at the Colonial.",4
16883,Penny,8," Well, I‰Ûªm watching it now. Why would I want to see it again on Friday?",4
16884,Sheldon,8, Because the print they‰Ûªre showing on Friday has an additional 21 seconds of previously unseen footage.,4
16885,Penny,8," What, 21 seconds? That‰Ûªll be like seeing a whole new movie!",4
16886,Leonard,8, Exactly. They say it finally solves the submarine controversy.,4
16887,Sheldon,8," Did Leonard? I‰Ûªm no expert, but I believe what we just heard from Penny was sarcasm. (She indicates it was) Oh, good. I‰Ûªm eight for 26 this month.",4
16888,Penny,8," Yeah, I think I‰Ûªll pass. But you guys enjoy your extra 21 seconds.",4
16889,Leonard,8," Bet if I could make you understand why this is such a cool thing, we‰Ûªd still be together.",4
16890,Penny,8," Mm, yeah, no, we wouldn‰Ûªt.",4
16891,Howard,8," Uh-huh. I‰Ûªm guessing 21 seconds had something to do with that, too.",4
16892,Scene,8, The Cheesecake Factory.,4
16893,Sheldon,8," May I point out to you all that the screening is first come, first served?",4
16894,Leonard,8," Relax, it‰Ûªs five o‰Ûªclock. The movie doesn‰Ûªt start till midnight.",4
16895,Sheldon,8," Another way of saying that is the movie starts at midnight, and it‰Ûªs already five o‰Ûªclock. Let‰Ûªs go.",4
16896,Howard,8," You know, if we miss it, we‰Ûªll have the fun of listening to Sheldon whine about it for the rest of our lives.",4
16897,Sheldon,8, See? Howard‰Ûªs on my side.,4
16898,Howard,8," Actually, I‰Ûªm not. I‰Ûªm using sarcasm to mock you.",4
16899,Sheldon,8, Drat. Now I‰Ûªm 8 for 27.,4
16900,Leonard,8," Don‰Ûªt worry, Sheldon. We‰Ûªll be fine.",4
16901,Sheldon,8, But how were our seats?,4
16902,Leonard,8, Excellent.,4
16903,Sheldon,8," I rest my case. Amy, don‰Ûªt you agree we should leave now and get in line?",4
16904,Amy,8," Actually, as the newest member of your social group, I believe I‰Ûªll gain more acceptance by arbitrarily siding with your friends from time to time.",4
16905,Sheldon,8, Shrewd.,4
16906,Amy,8," Leonard, you‰Ûªre right. We should enjoy our meal, arrive late, and risk winding up with terrible seats, assuming we get in at all.",4
16907,Leonard,8," Thank you, Amy.",4
16908,Amy,8, See? It‰Ûªs working.,4
16909,Bernadette,8, Knock-knock.,4
16910,Howard,8, Who‰Ûªs there?,4
16911,Bernadette,8, Olive.,4
16912,Howard,8," Olive you, too.",4
16913,Leonard,8," Guys, that‰Ûªs really starting to get old.",4
16914,Howard,8, Knock-knock.,4
16915,Leonard,8, Who‰Ûªs there?,4
16916,Howard,8, I have a girlfriend and you don‰Ûªt.,4
16917,Leonard,8, Hysterical!,4
16918,Sheldon,8," Wait, now, we don‰Ûªt know that yet. He isn‰Ûªt finished. I have a girlfriend and you don‰Ûªt who?",4
16919,Howard,8, So. Are you sure you don‰Ûªt want to come with us to Raiders?,4
16920,Bernadette,8," Oh, no. That movie has melting faces. It reminds me too much of the time I dropped that vial of flesh-eating bacteria into the Rhesus monkey lab. Besides, Penny and I are having a girls‰Ûª night tonight.",4
16921,Amy,8, Girls‰Ûª night? What does that entail?,4
16922,Bernadette,8," Oh, you know, girls get together, hang out, share girl talk.",4
16923,Amy,8, I‰Ûªm a girl.,4
16924,Bernadette,8," Oh. Well, maybe you can join us. I‰Ûªll ask Penny.",4
16925,Amy,8, No need. Penny and I are very close.,4
16926,Bernadette,8, You are?,4
16927,Amy,8," Yes. In fact, our menses are synchronized. Penny. Bernadette tells me you‰Ûªre planning a girls‰Ûª night.",4
16928,Penny,8, Yeah?,4
16929,Amy,8, I‰Ûªm a girl.,4
16930,Penny,8," Oh. Um, it was, it was just going to be me and Bernadette. Besides, I thought you were going to the movies with Sheldon and the guys.",4
16931,Amy,8," Yes, but they‰Ûªre not girls. I‰Ûªm a girl.",4
16932,Penny,8," Yeah, no, no, I-I-I got that.",4
16933,Amy,8, What‰Ûªs the dress code?,4
16934,Penny,8," Uh, just wear something comfortable.",4
16935,Amy,8, All right. I‰Ûªll have to go shopping.,4
16936,Sheldon,8, Knock-knock.,4
16937,Leonard,8, Who‰Û÷s there?,4
16938,Sheldon,8, Hugh.,4
16939,Leonard,8, Hugh who?,4
16940,Sheldon,8, Hugh people need to listen to me. It‰Ûªs time to get in line for the movie. And that‰Ûªs how you tell a knock-knock joke.,4
16941,Scene,8, The movie theatre. The line is incredibly long.,4
16942,Sheldon,8," Under normal circumstances I‰Ûªd say, I told you so. But as I have told you so with such vehemence and frequency already, the phrase has lost all meaning. Therefore, I will be replacing it with the phrase I informed you thusly.",4
16943,Howard,8, Ooh. Can‰Ûªt wait for that to start.,4
16944,Sheldon,8, I informed you thusly.,4
16945,Raj,8, Eight for 28.,4
16946,Sheldon,8, This is where we could have been if we hadn‰Ûªt stopped for dinner. This is where we could have been if Koothrappali hadn‰Ûªt ordered dessert.,4
16947,Raj,8," Well I earned it, dude, I ate all my broccoli.",4
16948,Sheldon,8," And here‰Ûªs where we are. The runts in a large litter, unlikely to ever reach the nourishing teats of Indiana Jones.",4
16949,Leonard,8, So I guess it‰Ûªs a good thing we stopped for dinner.,4
16950,Raj,8," You know, guys, when facing disappointment, Eat, Pray, Love teaches us‰ÛÒ",4
16951,Howard,8," Oh, shut up.",4
16952,Scene,8, Penny‰Ûªs apartment.,4
16953,Amy,8," So anyway, to make a long story short, turns out I have an unusually firm cervix.",4
16954,Penny,8," You know Amy, when we say girl talk, it doesn‰Ûªt just have to be about our lady parts.",4
16955,Amy,8, Shame. ‰Û÷Cause I have a real zinger about my titled uterus.,4
16956,Bernadette,8," Penny, your nails look great.",4
16957,Penny,8," Oh, thanks. I found this place in Alhambra. It‰Ûªs in a woman‰Ûªs basement. I think it‰Ûªs a front",4
16958,Amy,8, A colleague of mine did her graduate thesis on the fungus that grows on improperly sterilized manicure implements. Well don‰Ûªt tell me that‰Ûªs not girl talk.,4
16959,Penny,8, So where should we go tonight? A bar? A club? A movie?,4
16960,Bernadette,8, Or we could just stay here.,4
16961,Amy,8," Yes, and continue to bond. I have a feeling that after tonight, one of you will become my best friend forever. Or BFF, if you prefer. Which I don‰Ûªt.",4
16962,Penny,8," All right, time to open Bachelor Number Two.",4
16963,Bernadette,8," Gee, I don‰Ûªt know if I should drink more. I have to drive home, and I‰Ûªve got enough trouble seeing over the dashboard as it is.",4
16964,Penny,8, That‰Ûªs okay. Y ou can just sleep here.,4
16965,Amy,8," Oh, good, a slumber party! We‰Ûªll do makeovers, initiate phony phone calls, and have spirited pillow fights in our frilly nighties!",4
16966,Penny,8," Oh, gosh, Amy. I don‰Ûªt know if I would call this an actual slumber party.",4
16967,Amy,8," Well, that‰Ûªs disappointing. I‰Ûªve always wanted to be invited to a slumber party.",4
16968,Bernadette,8," Oh, you never were?",4
16969,Penny,8, Not even when you were a kid?,4
16970,Amy,8," Well, there was the time I had my tonsils out, and I shared a room with a little Vietnamese girl. She didn‰Ûªt make it through the night, but up till then, it was kind of fun.",4
16971,Penny,8," Okay. Well, I guess we‰Ûªre having a slumber party. Oh!",4
16972,Amy,8, Pillow fight!,4
16973,Scene,8, The movie line. ,4
16974,Leonard,8," Oh, I hope they let us in soon. I‰Ûªm tired of running to the gas station to use the bathroom. The guy makes me buy a Gatorade every time. It‰Ûªs a vicious circle.",4
16975,Howard,8, Too bad you don‰Ûªt have a stadium pal like me.,4
16976,Leonard,8, What‰Ûªs a stadium pal?,4
16977,Howard,8," Let me put it this way, takes care of the bathroom problem, and it keeps your calf warm.",4
16978,Raj,8," Hey, guys, bad news. I just did a quick calculation. Given the size of the theatreåÊ and the length of this line, we might not get seats.",4
16979,Sheldon,8, What did he say?,4
16980,Leonard,8," Nice going, Raj, just got him down for his nap.",4
16981,Sheldon,8, We might not get seats?,4
16982,Leonard,8," It‰Ûªs fine, it‰Ûªs fine. Go back to sleep.",4
16983,Sheldon,8," Oh, I informed you thusly. I so informed you thusly.",4
16984,Leonard,8," Howard, you talk to him. Howard? You‰Ûªre peeing, aren‰Ûªt you?",4
16985,Wil Wheaton,8," Hey, look who‰Ûªs here! Hey, buddies!",4
16986,Sheldon,8," Well, if it isn‰Ûªt Wil Wheaton, the Jar Jar Binks of the Star Trek universe.",4
16987,Wil,8, Mee-sa think that very funny.,4
16988,Sheldon,8," Well, you-sa can go think that at the back of the line. No cuts, no buts, no coconuts.",4
16989,Theatre Staff,8, Wil Wheaton.,4
16990,Wil,8, Yeah.,4
16991,Theatre Staff,8, I‰Ûªm a big fan.,4
16992,Sheldon,8, Of what? Poorly executed beards?,4
16993,Wil,8, Do you think you could get me and my friends into the movie? We got here a little late.,4
16994,Theatre Staff,8," No problem. Come on, I‰Ûªll hook you up.",4
16995,Wil,8," Oh, awesome. We-sa gonna go into the movie now. Bye-bye.",4
16996,Sheldon,8," This is Indiana Jones, not Star Trek. There should be no value to his pseudo-celebrity here. And even at Star Trek conventions, they only let him in if he helps set up.",4
16997,Leonard,8," Calm down, Sheldon.",4
16998,Sheldon,8," I will not calm down. This affront to justice and decency cannot go unanswered. As Captain Jean-Luc Picard once said, the line must be drawn here! This far, no farther!",4
16999,Leonard,8," Had to wake him up from his nap, didn‰Ûªt you?",4
17000, Scene,8, Penny‰Ûªs apartment. ,4
17001,Bernadette,8, You know what I really love about Howard? His chest hair.,4
17002,Penny,8, Howard has a hairy chest?,4
17003,Bernadette,8," No, just the one. But it‰Ûªs really long.",4
17004,Penny,8," Okay, there you go, Sultry Sunrise Red. What do you think?",4
17005,Amy,8, My nails have never looked so pretty before. Get it off.,4
17006,Scene,8, The movie line. ,4
17007,Raj,8," Oh, oh, uh, looks like they‰Ûªre getting ready to let people in.",4
17008,Sheldon,8," Listen to what Mr. Wil Wheaton is tweeting. Best seats in house for Raiders screening. Suck on that, Sheldon Cooper.",4
17009,Leonard,8, Why do you read his Twitter feed? You know it‰Ûªs only going to upset you.,4
17010,Sheldon,8," I believe in knowing my enemy, Leonard. Had Twitter existed at the time, would not General Custer have followed the tweets of Sitting Bull? Would not Lee have followed Grant? Would not Spy have followed Spy? I have more examples, but excuse me. (On phone) Hello. Well, this seems like an odd time to test my cell phone quality, but go on. Test phrases? All right. Imatote. Ulbu. Twad. All together? I‰Ûªm a total buttwad. Why are you laughing? Hello?",4
17011,Scene,8, Penny‰Ûªs apartment.,4
17012,Penny,8," And that, girls, is how you make a phony phone call.",4
17013,Amy,8," I‰Ûªm not sure I grasp the full entertainment value, but all right. Next on Wikipedia‰Ûªs list of slumber party activities, Truth or Dare.",4
17014,Penny,8," Okay, it‰Ûªs your game. You go first.",4
17015,Amy,8," Hang on. I‰Ûªm familiarizing myself with the rules. Seems fairly straightforward. Bernadette, truth or dare?",4
17016,Bernadette,8, Truth.,4
17017,Amy,8, All right. To what temperature must you heat beef in order to kill the prion that causes bovine spongiform encephalopathy?,4
17018,Bernadette,8, Um.,4
17019,Amy,8," Remember, you have to answer honestly.",4
17020,Penny,8," Wait. No, Amy, you‰Ûªre supposed to ask her something personal or embarrassing.",4
17021,Amy,8, Oh. All right. What is the circumference of your areolas?,4
17022,Scene,8, The movie line. ,4
17023,Sheldon,8," Munching on complimentary popcorn. Woot, woot. Oh, the gall. I hope his next tweet is popcorn lodged in trachea, choking to death, woot, woot.",4
17024,Theatre staff,8," Guys, I am sorry. We are full up.",4
17025,Sheldon,8, No!,4
17026,Theatre staff,8, We‰Ûªre full up.,4
17027,Leonard,8, We really want to see this. Is there anything you can do?,4
17028,Theatre staff,8, Sorry. Fire regulations. Should‰Ûªve gotten here earlier.,4
17029,Sheldon,8, This is nothing but a blatant abuse of power by a petty functionary. Explain to me why Wil Wheaton and his lackeys get in and we don‰Ûªt.,4
17030,Theatre staff,8," ‰Û÷Cause I‰Ûªm the petty functionary with the clipboard, bitch.",4
17031,Howard,8, I guess that‰Ûªs that. Let‰Ûªs go home.,4
17032,Sheldon,8, You know what? I‰Ûªm going back to I told you so. I told you so.,4
17033,Raj,8," We can still see something. Uh, the new Sandra Bullock movie is playing two blocks away. You know Sandy B always brings it.",4
17034,Sheldon,8," Look, a side door. Come on, Short Round.",4
17035,Howard,8, I guess we‰Ûªd better go after him.,4
17036,Leonard,8, Short Round?,4
17037,Raj,8, Indy‰Ûªs young sidekick from Temple of Doom.,4
17038,Leonard,8," Yeah, I know who it is, but why is it me?",4
17039,Raj,8, You‰Ûªre right. It should be a cuddly Asian boy. Like me.,4
17040,Scene,8, Penny‰Ûªs apartment. ,4
17041,Amy,8," And Absolon hath kist hir nether yea, and Nicholas is scalded in the towte. This tale is doon, and God save al the rowte.‰Û",4
17042,Penny,8, What the hell was that?,4
17043,Amy,8, Bernadette dared me to tell a dirty story. The Miller‰Ûªs Tale by Chaucer is the dirtiest story I know. It would have been hidden in sock drawers if people in the 14th century had worn socks.,4
17044,Bernadette,8, I thought it was pretty spicy. Especially the part where he kisses her nether yea.,4
17045,Amy,8," You might not like it as much if you knew what nether yea meant. Hint, if one cares about hygiene, one ought not be kissing it.",4
17046,Bernadette,8," Okay, my turn. Penny, truth or dare?",4
17047,Penny,8, Truth.,4
17048,Bernadette,8, Why are you still hanging out with Leonard so much even though you broke up with him?,4
17049,Amy,8," Oh, that‰Ûªs an excellent question. For two people who claim to be no longer pair-bonded, you spend an inordinate amount of time in each other‰Ûªs company.",4
17050,Bernadette,8, Yeah.,4
17051,Penny,8, Dare.,4
17052,Amy,8, I don‰Ûªt believe the rules allow for an ex post facto option change.,4
17053,Bernadette,8, Yeah.,4
17054,Penny,8," Okay, look, just because we‰Ûªre not seeing each other anymore doesn‰Ûªt mean we can‰Ûªt be friends. I mean, Leonard‰Ûªs a great guy.",4
17055,Amy,8," Then, why did you terminate your relationship with him?",4
17056,Penny,8," I don‰Ûªt know. He got really serious, and I wasn‰Ûªt ready for it.",4
17057,Amy,8," Interesting. How will you react if, in the future, you become ready for it, and Leonard is unavailable, because another woman has realized that he is, to use your words, a great guy?",4
17058,Penny,8, You can only ask one question.,4
17059,Amy and Bernadette together,8, That one.,4
17060,Penny,8," You know what, I don‰Ûªt want to play anymore.",4
17061,Amy,8," Well, I‰Ûªm not sure how this is scored, but I believe we may have won.",4
17062,Scene,8, The movie theatre.,4
17063,Leonard,8, Sheldon? Sheldon?,4
17064,Howard,8," Where did he go? (Raj whistles) We‰Ûªre looking for Sheldon, not Marmaduke.",4
17065,Sheldon,8, You whistled?,4
17066,Leonard,8, What is that?,4
17067,Sheldon,8," Raiders of the Lost Ark, with 21 additional seconds. If I can‰Ûªt see it, no one else can see it.",4
17068,Leonard,8," Sheldon, this is crazy.",4
17069,Sheldon,8, No. Crazy was leaving the projection booth unattended.,4
17070,Leonard,8, Listen to me. You are over-tired. You‰Ûªre not thinking right. Put the movie back before we get into trouble.,4
17071,Sheldon,8," Trouble is my middle name, Leonard. Actually, it‰Ûªs Lee, but I prefer Trouble.",4
17072,Wil Wheaton,8," Oh, look who they let in.",4
17073,Sheldon,8," Don‰Ûªt worry, Wil Wheaton. I was just leaving. åÊDa-da-da-da, da-da-da!",4
17074,Howard,8," Come on, Short Round.",4
17075,Leonard,8, Yeah.,4
17076,Scene,8, Outside the movie theatre.,4
17077,Sheldon,8," Da-da-da-da, da-da-da!",4
17078,Raj,8," Come on, guys! Hurry up! Hurry up!",4
17079,Howard,8, Let‰Ûªs see you run with a bag of urine strapped to your leg.,4
17080,Wil,8, He‰Ûªs got the movie! Get him!,4
17081,Sheldon,8, Why is there never a pontoon plane when you need one?,4
17082,Scene,8, Penny‰Ûªs apartment. ,4
17083,Bernadette,8, She‰Ûªs been in there a long time.,4
17084,Amy,8," Clearly, losing Truth or Dare upset her. Perhaps we should try to take her mind off it with another popular slumber party activity.",4
17085,Bernadette,8," Ooh, like what?",4
17086,Amy,8," Well, the Internet suggests that slumber party guests often engage in harmless experimentation with lesbianism.",4
17087,Bernadette,8, Where exactly on the Internet have you been looking?,4
17088,Amy,8, Penny?,4
17089,Penny,8," Oh, hey, Amy. Look, I‰Ûªm sorry I got so upset. I just,whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,whoa! What are you doing?",4
17090,Amy,8, Don‰Ûªt worry. I‰Ûªll avoid the nether yea.,4
17091,Bernadette,8, I might have gone with eating raw cookie dough.,4
17092,Scene,9, The apartment. ,4
17093,Raj,9, You know who‰Ûªs got to be the bravest person in the Marvel Universe? Whoever has to give She-Hulk a bikini wax.,4
17094,Howard,9," You want to talk brave, how about Captain America‰Ûªs undocumented Mexican gardener?",4
17095,Leonard,9, He‰Ûªs not braver than whoever uses the bathroom after The Thing?,4
17096,Sheldon,9," As usual, you‰Ûªre all wrong. The bravest person in the Marvel Universe is the doctor who gives Wolverine his prostate exam.",4
17097,Howard,9, How about the guy who gets a prostate exam from Wolverine?,4
17098,Sheldon,9," Now you just being silly. Wolverine‰Ûªs never displayed the slightest interest in helping others prevent prostate cancer. (Answering phone) Hello. Yes, the elevator‰Ûªs out of order you‰Ûªll have to use the stairs. Of course you can. Pizza dates back to the 16th century, while the first elevator was not installed until 1852. That means that for over 300 years, people carried pizzas up stairs. Be part of that proud tradition.",4
17099,Leonard,9, I‰Ûªll go get Penny while that guy spits on our food.,4
17100,Raj,9, Do you think they gave Wolverine an Adamantium prostate?,4
17101,Howard,9, That‰Ûªs a stupid question.,4
17102,Raj,9, We‰Ûªre having a conversation about probing the heinies of superheroes. There are no stupid questions.,4
17103,Scene,9, Penny‰Ûªs door. ,4
17104,Man,9, Yes?,4
17105,Leonard,9," Oh, um, is Penny here?",4
17106,Man,9," You‰Ûªre Leonard, right?",4
17107,Leonard,9, Yeah.,4
17108,Man,9," Damn, it‰Ûªs good to finally meet you, son.",4
17109,Leonard,9," Okay, I think a bit of context here might help.",4
17110,Penny,9," Oh, hey, Leonard. I see you met my dad.",4
17111,Leonard,9," Oh, good. Context.",4
17112,Penny‰Ûªs Dad,9," Come on in, buddy. Take a load off.",4
17113,Penny,9," Oh, gee, dad, Leonard can‰Ûªt stay. He just dropped by to say hello. Thanks for stopping by, sweetie. I‰Ûªll see you later. (Kisses him passionately) Bye.",4
17114,Leonard,9, That was odd.,4
17115,Scene,9, The apartment. ,4
17116,Sheldon,9," Are you sure you have enough comics? You‰Ûªre going to be monitoring the telescope for 12 hours, and by my estimate, you‰Ûªve only selected seven hours of reading material. That‰Ûªs even factoring in your difficulty in parsing American comic book idioms like Bamf and Snikt.",4
17117,Raj,9, Is that racist? It feels racist.,4
17118,Howard,9," Don‰Ûªt be oversensitive. He‰Ûªs calling you illiterate, not your race.",4
17119,Raj,9," Oh, okay. Good. I don‰Ûªt need more comics. Howard‰Ûªs gonna stop by, we‰Ûªre gonna play intergalactic battleship and Indian Monopoly.",4
17120,Sheldon,9," I don‰Ûªt care for novelty editions of Monopoly. I prefer the classics, regular and Klingon.",4
17121,Howard,9," Actually, Indian Monopoly‰Ûªs just like regular, except the money‰Ûªs in Rupees, instead of hotels you build call centers, and when you pick a chance card, you might die of dysentery. Just FYI, that was racist.",4
17122,Leonard,9, You‰Ûªll never guess what just happened.,4
17123,Sheldon,9," You went out in the hallway, stumbled into an interdimensional portal which brought you 5,000 years into the future, where you took advantage of the advanced technology to build a time machine, and now you‰Ûªre back to bring us all with you to the year 7010 where we are transported to work at the thinkatorium by telepathically controlled flying dolphins?",4
17124,Leonard,9, No.,4
17125,Sheldon,9, Aw.,4
17126,Leonard,9, Penny kissed me.,4
17127,Sheldon,9," Well, who would ever guess that?",4
17128,Raj,9, What‰Û_ what kind of a kiss?,4
17129,Leonard,9, A big kiss. On the mouth.,4
17130,Howard,9, Is it possible that she was going for your cheek and you moved and she accidentally got lip? That happens with me and my mom all the time.,4
17131,Leonard,9," She introduced me to her father, kissed me and then shut the door in my face.",4
17132,Howard,9,Maybe she was trying to send you a message.,4
17133,Leonard,9, You think?,4
17134,Howard,9, Yeah. This man is not my father. I‰Ûªm being held hostage. So I‰Ûªm going to do something insane in the hopes that you‰Ûªll call 911.,4
17135,Leonard,9, Penny kissing me is not insane. She used to kiss me all the time.,4
17136,Sheldon,9," Einstein defined insanity as doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results. By that standard, Penny is cuckoo for cocoa puffs.",4
17137,Leonard,9," I‰Ûªm just saying, it felt like it may have meant something.",4
17138,Howard,9," Ah, this takes me back. Leonard obsessing about Penny. I mean, don‰Ûªt get me wrong, I love your new stuff, but once in a while it‰Ûªs nice to hear the hits.",4
17139,Raj,9," Ooh, ooh! Do our babies will be smart and beautiful. That one always makes me laugh.",4
17140,Leonard,9, Why do I bother talking to you people?,4
17141,Sheldon,9," If it‰Ûªll make you feel better, we rarely listen.",4
17142,Penny (at door),9," Hey, can I talk to you out here for a sec?",4
17143,Leonard,9," Yeah, sure.",4
17144,Sheldon,9, I‰Ûªm starting to think we‰Ûªre never going to see that pizza.,4
17145,Penny,9, So you‰Ûªre probably wondering what that was all about.,4
17146,Leonard,9," What, uh, the kissing and everything? Nah, women do that to me all the time.",4
17147,Penny,9," Yeah, okay. The thing is, I kind of told my father we got back together again.",4
17148,Leonard,9, What? Why?,4
17149,Penny,9," Well, you‰Ûªre the first guy he‰Ûªs ever really approved of, you know? You‰Ûªre a scientist who went to college and you don‰Ûªt have a neck tattoo or outstanding warrants or, or a baby.",4
17150,Leonard,9, What kind of guys did you used to go out with?,4
17151,Penny,9," Just guys. Anyway, when I told him we split up, he was heartbroken, and he kept bugging me, how‰Ûªs Leonard? why can‰Ûªt you get back together with Leonard? I bet Leonard never tipped a cow over on himself. So to get him off my back, I told him we worked things out.",4
17152,Leonard,9," Really? How, how‰Ûªd we manage that?",4
17153,Penny,9, What?,4
17154,Leonard,9," Well, did you apologize? Did you have to woo me?",4
17155,Penny,9," Get over yourself. I whistled, you came running.",4
17156,Leonard,9," Yeah, no, I don‰Ûªt think so.",4
17157,Penny,9," Okay, why are you arguing about this?",4
17158,Leonard,9," I‰Ûªm just saying, if we fake got back together, that‰Ûªs totally not how it fake happened.",4
17159,Penny,9," Oh, okay, whatever. Will you please just play along until my dad leaves?",4
17160,Leonard,9," Hold on, you actually want me to deceive your father with some sort of sham play acting and kissing? Cause I‰Ûªm good with that.",4
17161,Penny‰Ûªs Dad,9," Penny, you out here?",4
17162,Penny,9," Come on, honey, not in front of my dad.",4
17163,Penny‰Ûªs Dad,9," Relax, I‰Ûªve seen you do a lot worse with a lot stupider.",4
17164,Leonard,9, See? He doesn‰Ûªt mind.,4
17165,Penny‰Ûªs Dad,9," So, Leonard, I‰Ûªm taking your gal out for a steak dinner, you want to join us?",4
17166,Penny,9," Oh, dad, that‰Ûªs nice, but Leonard has to work. Right, Leonard?",4
17167,Leonard,9," Uh, I do, I have to work. But I‰Ûªm gonna blow that off to spend the evening with my sweetie and her father, ‰Ûªcause, you know, just the kind of boyfriend I am.",4
17168,Penny,9, Oh.,4
17169,Leonard,9," Come here, you.",4
17170,Scene,9, Raj‰Ûªs Lab.,4
17171,Howard,9, C-7.,4
17172,Raj,9, Miss.,4
17173,Howard,9," How could that be a miss? C-6 was a hit, C-8 was a hit. Part of your starship has to be on C-7.",4
17174,Raj,9, Not if it has a hole in the middle.,4
17175,Howard,9, What kind of spaceship has a hole in the middle?,4
17176,Raj,9, A Romulan battle bagel?,4
17177,Bernadette,9, Knock-knock.,4
17178,Howard,9," Oh, great, you made it. Come on in. I invited her.",4
17179,Bernadette,9, So where‰Ûªs the telescope?,4
17180,Howard,9," It‰Ûªs in Hawaii, but Raj controls it from here. He‰Ûªs hoping to see Epsilon Eridani dim, which would be evidence of a planet orbiting it.",4
17181,Bernadette,9," So we just sit and stare at the screen, waiting for something to happen?",4
17182,Howard,9," I did it with you when we rented The Notebook. (Raj whispers) Yes, Gena Rowlands is a treasure. You‰Ûªd better open up that bottle of wine or I‰Ûªm gonna end up with swimmer‰Ûªs ear.",4
17183,Raj,9," Excuse me. I can‰Ûªt be drinking, I‰Ûªm about to make an important scientific discovery here.",4
17184,Howard,9, What? Galileo did his best work while drinking wine.,4
17185,Raj,9, How do you know that?,4
17186,Howard,9," Well, he was Italian. It‰Ûªs a reasonable assumption.",4
17187,Raj,9," Dude, can you even open your mouth without spewing a cultural stereotype?",4
17188,Howard,9," Oh, I, I‰Ûªm sorry, Galileo drank diet sprite. Look, you‰Ûªre my best friend, she‰Ûªs my girlfriend, you should bond. You know, like you and my mom did.",4
17189,Raj,9, Your mom creeps the hell out of me.,4
17190,Howard,9," Yes, but she‰Ûªs stopped calling you slumdog millionaire.",4
17191,Raj,9, I do appreciate that.,4
17192,Bernadette,9, Here we go.,4
17193,Howard,9, Well I‰Ûªd like to propose a toast. To science and friendship.,4
17194,Bernadette,9," Hold on. Wait. No, it‰Ûªs okay, go ahead.",4
17195,Howard,9, What?,4
17196,Bernadette,9," Oh, I was working with Penicillin-resistant gonorrhoea in the lab today and I was just trying to remember if I washed my hands.",4
17197,Scene,9, Penny‰Ûªs dad‰Ûªs car. ,4
17198,Leonard,9," Thanks for the steak, Wyatt.",4
17199,Penny‰Ûªs dad (Wyatt),9, My pleasure. It‰Ûªs nice to have dinner with a boyfriend of Penny‰Ûªs that knows how to use a napkin.,4
17200,Penny,9," So not funny, dad.",4
17201,Wyatt,9," Let me tell you about this one genius she was going out with, this, this fella Donnie.",4
17202,Penny,9," Oh, will you please let it go?",4
17203,Wyatt,9, Donnie was gonna make millions turning farm waste into biofuel and selling it to the government.,4
17204,Leonard,9, A lot of people are doing that.,4
17205,Penny,9," Oh, see?",4
17206,Wyatt,9," Yeah, but all Donnie did was mix pig poop with a little water and pump it into his mom‰Ûªs Camry.",4
17207,Penny,9," Yeah, that‰Ûªs great. It‰Ûªs a funny story. Moving on.",4
17208,Wyatt,9," And Donnie was a rocket scientist compared to that boy who wanted to get beer pong into the Olympics. What was his name, sweetheart?",4
17209,Penny,9," Curtis, and I‰Ûªm pretty sure he was joking.",4
17210,Wyatt,9, I don‰Ûªt know. That petition looked real to me.,4
17211,Penny,9," Yeah, okay, I think this ends the ex-boyfriend portion of our evening.",4
17212,Wyatt,9," Well, I‰Ûªm just glad you finally found yourself a keeper.",4
17213,Leonard,9," Thanks, Wyatt. I‰Ûªm a keeper.",4
17214,Scene,9, Outside Penny‰Ûªs door.,4
17215,Wyatt,9," Leonard, you want to come in for a nightcap?",4
17216,Penny,9," Oh, gee, dad, he‰Ûªd love to, but Leonard has to work in the morning.",4
17217,Leonard,9, Maybe I could go in a little late.,4
17218,Penny,9," No, no, no, you can‰Ûªt. Your career is far too important.",4
17219,Wyatt,9," Behind every great man is a nagging woman who won‰Ûªt let him have any fun, am I right, Leonard?",4
17220,Leonard,9, Don‰Ûªt I know it.,4
17221,Wyatt,9," Well, good night, son.",4
17222,Leonard,9," Good night, Wyatt. Oh, good night, honey.",4
17223,Penny,9, Good night.,4
17224,Leonard,9, I love you.,4
17225,Penny,9," Love you, too.",4
17226,Sheldon,9," Oh, friggety-frak. Not this again.",4
17227,Scene,9, The lab. ,4
17228,Howard,9," Three, four, five, pass go, get 2,000 Rupees, Six, seven, whoops. Can‰Ûªt go any further. There‰Ûªs a sacred cow in my way.",4
17229,Raj,9," Bernadette, please tell your boyfriend to cool it with the cow jokes.",4
17230,Bernadette,9," It won‰Ûªt help. Once he finds a joke he likes, he sticks with it.",4
17231,Raj,9, Yeah. Like his haircut material.,4
17232,Bernadette,9," Oh, right. Did you get your hair cut?",4
17233,Raj,9, No. I got them all cut.,4
17234,Bernadette,9, Which is still so funny.,4
17235,Raj,9," And when you go to a Chinese restaurant, he always gets the same fortune in his fortune cookie.",4
17236,Bernadette,9," Right. Help, I‰Ûªm a prisoner in a Chinese fortune cookie factory.",4
17237,Howard,9," Okay, I think that‰Ûªs enough about me.",4
17238,Raj,9," He‰Ûªs right. Let‰Ûªs make fun of his mother. Howard, come rub my feet! My corns are killing me!",4
17239,Bernadette,9," Howard, help me out of the tub! I‰Ûªm stuck again!",4
17240,Scene,9, The apartment. ,4
17241,Leonard,9," Coming. Hey, lovebug.",4
17242,Penny,9, Shut up. You know what I‰Ûªve been doing for the last hour?,4
17243,Leonard,9," Mm, dreamily doodling Mrs. Leonard Hofstadter in a notebook?",4
17244,Penny,9, Listening to my father go on and on about what a great guy you are.,4
17245,Leonard,9," You got to admit, I am, I‰Ûªm delightful.",4
17246,Penny,9, Why are you making this so difficult?,4
17247,Leonard,9, It‰Ûªs not difficult for me. I‰Ûªm having fun.,4
17248,Penny,9, Leonard.,4
17249,Leonard,9, What do you want me to do? You started this. Do you want to go over and tell him we‰Ûªre broken up?,4
17250,Penny,9, No.,4
17251,Leonard,9," Well, then, what do you want?",4
17252,Penny,9, I don‰Ûªt know.,4
17253,Leonard,9, Don‰Ûªt you think that‰Ûªs something you should have figured out before you stomped over here?,4
17254,Penny,9, Maybe.,4
17255,Sheldon,9," Leonard, Penny, excellent. I‰Ûªd like to say I‰Ûªm very happy that you‰Ûªre back together, and if I can figure out a way to do so and sound sincere, I will. In the meantime, I‰Ûªd like to go over some proposed changes to the roommate agreement specifically to address Penny‰Ûªs annoying personal habits.",4
17256,Penny,9," Oh, my God. What personal habits?",4
17257,Leonard,9," I have a list. FYI, overuse of the phrase, oh, my god, is number 12.",4
17258,Penny,9," Okay, Sheldon, you don‰Ûªt have to do this because Leonard and I are not‰Û_",4
17259,Leonard,9, Ba-ba-ba-ba. Are you sure you want to include him in this?,4
17260,Sheldon,9, Include me in what? Is there a plot afoot? I‰Ûªll have no truck with plots.,4
17261,Penny,9," No, you‰Ûªre right. No, there‰Ûªs, there‰Ûªs no plots, no trucks, no feet. So what other annoying habits shall we discuss?",4
17262,Sheldon,9," Uh, we don‰Ûªt discuss anything. Leonard is the signatory to the Roommate Agreement. As such, he bears responsibility for all your infractions and must pay all fines.",4
17263,Leonard,9, Fines?,4
17264,Sheldon,9," Yes. If Penny‰Ûªs going to be spending nights here again, you‰Ûªll need to set up an escrow account. Sign here.",4
17265,Scene,9, The lab.,4
17266,Raj,9," Hello, Hawaii. This is Dr. Koothrappali in Pasadena. I‰Ûªd like you to reposition the telescope, please. Scarlett Johansson‰Ûªs house! I‰Ûªm kidding, Hawaii. Mahalo. Whoo!",4
17267,Howard,9, It might have been a mistake to open that second bottle of wine.,4
17268,Bernadette,9," Well, live and learn. So, Raj, do you think this planet you‰Ûªre looking for could have an atmosphere that supports life?",4
17269,Raj,9," Maybe. If it did, I‰Ûªd be famous. I‰Ûªd be on the cover of magazines. And then, instead of living alone in my tiny apartment, I‰Ûªd have a big mansion.",4
17270,Bernadette,9, That sounds great.,4
17271,Raj,9," It is. If you like wandering around a big, empty house with no one to love you.",4
17272,Howard,9, We‰Ûªd come visit you.,4
17273,Raj,9," No, you wouldn‰Ûªt. You‰Ûªd be intimidated by my wealth and fame. My only friends would be my genetically engineered monkey butler, and the little people I hired to be my living chess set.",4
17274,Bernadette,9," He‰Ûªs taking a turn to the dark side, isn‰Ûªt he?",4
17275,Howard,9, Hold on. He could come back.,4
17276,Raj,9," Oh, what‰Ûªs the point of everything?",4
17277,Howard,9, Nope. He‰Ûªs gone.,4
17278,Raj,9, You know it‰Ûªs been more than a year since I‰Ûªve even kissed a girl?,4
17279,Howard,9, What about that hook-up at Comic-Con you told me about?,4
17280,Raj,9," Oh, grow up. I was lying. I lie all the time. Nobody wants to kiss me.",4
17281,Bernadette,9," Oh, you poor, poor thing. Raj, you have to know you‰Ûªre a wonderful man. There are a lot of girls out there who‰Ûªll want to kiss you.",4
17282,Raj,9, Where?,4
17283,Bernadette,9, You just have to look.,4
17284,Howard,9, No!,4
17285,Bernadette,9," Well, this was fun.",4
17286,Scene,9, The apartment. Wyatt and Leonard are playing Wii fishing.,4
17287,Wyatt,9, Oh! I think I got a nibble.,4
17288,Leonard,9," Oh, b-be careful. Give him some line. Okay, now reel him in.",4
17289,Wyatt,9," Oh, look at that baby. They‰Ûªre really biting, huh?",4
17290,Leonard,9, Yeah. They do that when you set it on easy.,4
17291,Wyatt (phone rings),9," Oh, that‰Ûªs me. Hello. Oh, hi, sweetie. Yeah, I got up early and didn‰Ûªt want to wake you, so I went out for coffee and ran into Leonard on the way back. Guess what, we‰Ûªre fishing. Yeah. Right here on his couch.",4
17292,Leonard,9," Hey, baby. I love you! Mwuh, mwuh, mwuh, mwuh, mwuh.",4
17293,Wyatt,9," That‰Ûªs Leonard says he loves you. What? I see. The whole thing‰Ûªs bull squirt, huh? Well, that‰Ûªs very disappointing. Bye.",4
17294,Leonard,9," Oh, hey. There‰Ûªs been something I‰Ûªve been meaning to tell you.",4
17295,Scene,9, Penny‰Ûªs apartment. ,4
17296,Wyatt,9, I can‰Ûªt believe you would lie to me like that.,4
17297,Leonard,9," Just for the record, I did not want to be a part of this.",4
17298,Wyatt,9, I‰Ûªll get to you in a minute.,4
17299,Leonard,9, No hurry.,4
17300,Wyatt,9," That my own daughter thinks I don‰Ûªt love her enough to support her no matter what choices she makes, well, that hurts me deeply.",4
17301,Penny,9," I‰Ûªm sorry, daddy‰Û_",4
17302,Wyatt,9, Let me finish.,4
17303,Penny,9, Oh.,4
17304,Wyatt,9, I thought we were past the days when you would try to pull the wool over my eyes. Telling me the baggie in your underwear drawer is potpourri? And the pee stick in your bathroom is to check for diabetes?,4
17305,Penny,9," You know, I‰Ûªm sorry.",4
17306,Wyatt,9," You‰Ûªre a grown woman, and I respect your right to make your own decisions, but all I ask is you respect me enough to be honest about them.",4
17307,Penny,9," You‰Ûªre right. Look, from now on, I will tell you the truth.",4
17308,Wyatt,9," Thank you. Now, why don‰Ûªt you go and put some clothes on and we‰Ûªll grab a bite to eat before I head for the airport. Now you.",4
17309,Penny,9," Daddy, he had nothing to do‰Û_",4
17310,Wyatt,9, Keep walking.,4
17311,Penny,9, Okay.,4
17312,Wyatt,9," Please, please, please don‰Ûªt give up on her.",4
17313,Leonard,9, What?,4
17314,Wyatt,9," I can‰Ûªt go back to the skateboard idiots, the white rappers and all those sweaty dumb-asses with their backwards hats.",4
17315,Leonard,9," Gee, I don‰Ûªt know if it‰Ûªs in the cards, sir.",4
17316,Wyatt,9," Then, stack the deck. Cheat. Lie. I don‰Ûªt care. I want grandkids before I die, and I want them to grow up in a house without wheels.",4
17317,Leonard,9, I‰Ûªll give it a shot.,4
17318,Wyatt,9, Thank you. Now I‰Ûªm going to do something here to help you along.,4
17319,Leonard,9, Excuse me?,4
17320,Wyatt,9," Just don‰Ûªt panic. Now, get your sorry, lying ass out of my face and make sure I never see it again!",4
17321,Leonard,9," Oh, the reverse psychology thing. I see. That‰Ûªs very clever.",4
17322,Wyatt,9, Don‰Ûªt yap. Just get out.,4
17323,Leonard,9, I‰Ûªll friend you on Facebook.,4
17324,Scene,9, The apartment. ,4
17325,Sheldon,9," Oh, there you are. Just so you know, I was up all night, but I have finally completed the Penny-specific section of the new roommate agreement.",4
17326,Leonard,9," Yeah, well, not necessary. We broke up again.",4
17327,Sheldon,9," Do you even think about other people, Leonard? Do you?",4
17328,Scene,9, The cafeteria.,4
17329,Raj,9, Hey.,4
17330,Leonard,9," Oh, how‰Ûªd it go last night?",4
17331,Raj,9," Oh, you know. Same old, same old. Looked through a telescope, saw some stars. Big whoop.",4
17332,Leonard,9, Really? You waited months for time with that telescope. What happened?,4
17333,Raj,9, Why? You writing a book?,4
17334,Sheldon,9," I‰Ûªm going to propose a hypothesis. Last night, Raj accidentally made contact with an alien civilization and has been ordered by the United States government to keep it a secret.",4
17335,Raj,9, Nothing happened. Can we please just change the subject?,4
17336,Sheldon,9, That sounds rehearsed. We are not alone.,4
17337,Howard,9, Hey.,4
17338,Leonard,9, Hey.,4
17339,Sheldon,9, Hello.,4
17340,Howard,9, Hey.,4
17341,Raj,9, Hey.,4
17342,Leonard,9, You get to play with Raj‰Ûªs big telescope last night?,4
17343,Howard,9, Whoa. Where did that come from?,4
17344,Raj,9, He never touched my telescope.,4
17345,Howard,9, Way to go shutting up.,4
17346,Raj,9, I did shut up. Now you shut up.,4
17347,Howard,9, Fine.,4
17348,Raj,9, Thank you. How come you didn‰Ûªt call me this morning?,4
17349,Scene,10, The apartment. ,4
17350,Sheldon,10, Clarify something for me. Isn‰Ûªt the point of a communal meal the exchange of ideas and opinions? An opportunity to consider important issues of the day?,4
17351,Leonard,10," It is. You just kind of put a damper on things when you said, the next person I see talking with food in their mouth will be put to death.",4
17352,Sheldon,10," Well, we could argue about who said what all night long, but to set things back on course, I will propose a new topic of conversation.",4
17353,Leonard,10, Great.,4
17354,Sheldon,10," What is the best number? By the way, there‰Ûªs only one correct answer.",4
17355,Raj,10," Five million, three hundred eighteen thousand and eight?",4
17356,Sheldon,10, Wrong. The best number is 73. You‰Ûªre probably wondering why.,4
17357,Leonard,10, No.,4
17358,Howard,10, Uh-uh.,4
17359,Raj,10, We‰Ûªre good.,4
17360,Sheldon,10," 73 is the 21st prime number. Its mirror, 37, is the 12th, and its mirror, 21, is the product of multiplying, hang on to your hats, seven and three. Eh? Eh? Did I lie?",4
17361,Leonard,10, We get it. 73 is the Chuck Norris of numbers.,4
17362,Sheldon,10," Chuck Norris wishes. In binary, 73 is a palindrome, one-zero-zero-one-zero-zero-one which backwards is one-zero-zero-one-zero-zero-one, exactly the same. All Chuck Norris backwards gets you is Sirron Kcuhc.",4
17363,Raj,10," Just for the record, when you enter five million three hundred eighteen thousand and eight in a calculator, upside-down it spells boobies.",4
17364,Leonard,10, Remember when you were wondering why the girls didn‰Ûªt want to eat with us tonight?,4
17365,Howard,10," Yeah, I get it now.",4
17366,Scene,10, A bar.,4
17367,Penny,10," I love your little heart locket, Bernadette.",4
17368,Bernadette,10," Oh, thanks. Howard gave it to me. It‰Ûªs the cutest thing. Every time I have dinner with his mom, the next day I get jewellery.",4
17369,Amy,10," Did you know that the iconic Valentine‰Ûªs heart shape is not actually based on the shape of a human heart, but rather on the shape of the buttocks of a female bending over?",4
17370,Penny,10," Oh, so I spent seventh grade dotting my I‰Ûªs with little asses? Cool.",4
17371,Zack,10," Hey, Penny, how‰Ûªs it going?",4
17372,Penny,10," Hey, Zack, what are you doing here?",4
17373,Zack,10, My dad‰Ûªs company prints the menus for this place. I‰Ûªm just dropping off some new ones laminated. Makes ‰Ûªem easier to clean if people throw up on ‰Ûªem. Guess how I got the idea?,4
17374,Penny,10," Yeah, I got it, I got it. Uh, Zack, these are my friends Bernadette and Amy.",4
17375,Bernadette,10, Hi.,4
17376,Zack,10, Hey.,4
17377,Amy,10, Hoo.,4
17378,Zack,10," Okay, well, it was good to see you.",4
17379,Penny,10," Yeah, you, too.",4
17380,Bernadette,10, He‰Ûªs really cute. How do you know him?,4
17381,Penny,10," Oh, we went out a couple of times.",4
17382,Amy,10, I‰Ûªm often flummoxed by current slang. Does went out mean had intercourse?,4
17383,Bernadette,10, Yes.,4
17384,Penny,10," No, no. But in this case, yes.",4
17385,Amy,10, Interesting. And was it not satisfactory?,4
17386,Penny,10," No, it was great. He just didn‰Ûªt really challenge me on an intellectual level.",4
17387,Bernadette,10, Couldn‰Ûªt you just fool around with him and then listen to NPR?,4
17388,Penny,10, Wouldn‰Ûªt help. Zack can‰Ûªt even spell NPR.,4
17389,Bernadette,10, It‰Ûªs what I do with Howard. I‰Ûªm much smarter than he is. But it‰Ûªs important to protect his manhood.,4
17390,Amy,10, Hoo.,4
17391,Bernadette,10, What‰Ûªs the matter?,4
17392,Amy,10," I‰Ûªm suddenly feeling flushed. My heart rate is elevated, my palms are clammy, my mouth is dry. In addition, I keep involuntarily saying hoo.",4
17393,Penny,10," Oh, we know what‰Ûªs causing that, don‰Ûªt we?",4
17394,Amy,10, It‰Ûªs no mystery. I obviously have the flu coupled with sudden-onset Tourette‰Ûªs syndrome.,4
17395,Scene,10, The university cafeteria.,4
17396,Howard,10, Did you hear about the accident at the bio lab?,4
17397,Leonard,10, No. What happened?,4
17398,Howard,10, They were injecting rats with radioactive isotopes and one of the techs got bit.,4
17399,Raj,10, Did he get superpowers?,4
17400,Howard,10," No, he got five stitches and a tetanus shot.",4
17401,Raj,10," Oh. Well, that‰Ûªs disappointing.",4
17402,Howard,10, Why?,4
17403,Raj,10," Well, you get bit by a radioactive animal in a lab, you kind of want to turn into a superhero.",4
17404,Howard,10," Yeah, but who‰Ûªd want to become Rat-Man?",4
17405,Raj,10," Who wouldn‰Ûªt? You could zip through a maze in nothing flat, squeeze through really small holes, and shut down restaurants in a single bound. And the best part is, if I were Rat-Man, you could be my sidekick, Mouse Boy.",4
17406,Howard,10, Mouse Boy?,4
17407,Raj,10," You don‰Ûªt like Mouse Boy? How about, uh, uh, Kid Vermin?",4
17408,Howard,10," First of all, if we had superpowers, I wouldn‰Ûªt be the sidekick. You‰Ûªd be the sidekick.",4
17409,Raj,10, Rat-Man is nobody‰Ûªs sidekick.,4
17410,Howard,10," Leonard, settle this. Of the two of us, who‰Ûªs the obvious sidekick?",4
17411,Raj,10," Yeah, Leonard, who?",4
17412,Leonard,10," 12 years after high school, and I‰Ûªm still at the nerd table.",4
17413,Scene,10, Amy‰Ûªs lab. ,4
17414,Sheldon,10, Aren‰Ûªt you slicing that man‰Ûªs brain a little too thin?,4
17415,Amy,10," It‰Ûªs too thin if I were making a foot-long brain sandwich at Quiznos. For examination under a two-photon microscope, it‰Ûªs fine.",4
17416,Sheldon,10," Well, you‰Ûªre the expert. If the correct way to do it is the wrong way, then I yield.",4
17417,Amy,10," Very well. If you die and donate your body to science, I promise to slice your brain like Canadian bacon.",4
17418,Sheldon,10, Thank you.,4
17419,Amy,10," Now, if you‰Ûªll excuse me, I have to take my temperature.",4
17420,Sheldon,10," Are you monitoring your circadian rhythms in order to identify your periods of maximum mental acuity? I did that one summer. Ah, youth.",4
17421,Amy,10," No, I experienced some distressing symptoms last night, so I‰Ûªm checking my vital signs every hour.",4
17422,Sheldon,10, I‰Ûªd be happy to create a chart and participate in a differential diagnosis.,4
17423,Amy,10," Oh, that sounds like fun.",4
17424,Sheldon,10, All right. What were the symptoms?,4
17425,Amy,10," Elevated heart rate, moist palms, dry mouth and localized vascular throbbing.",4
17426,Sheldon,10, Localized to what region?,4
17427,Amy,10, Ears and genitalia.,4
17428,Sheldon,10, Interesting. Not body parts that usually team up. What about environmental factors? Describe the scene for me.,4
17429,Amy,10," I was sitting in a restaurant with Penny and Bernadette, drinking water, carbonated as it was a special occasion. Penny‰Ûªs friend Zack stopped by and said hello and I said hoo.",4
17430,Sheldon,10, Who?,4
17431,Amy,10, Zack.,4
17432,Sheldon,10, Then why did you ask?,4
17433,Amy,10, Ask what?,4
17434,Sheldon,10, Who.,4
17435,Amy,10, Zack.,4
17436,Sheldon,10," All right, let‰Ûªs start over. What did you say when Zack walked in?",4
17437,Amy,10, Hoo.,4
17438,Sheldon,10, Zack.,4
17439,Amy,10, Why do you keep saying Zack?,4
17440,Sheldon,10, Because you keep saying who.,4
17441,Amy,10, I‰Ûªm not saying hoo now. I said hoo last night.,4
17442,Sheldon,10," And the answer was Zack, correct?",4
17443,Amy,10, There was no question. I simply said hoo.,4
17444,Sheldon,10," All right, I think I have enough to go on. Possible explanations for your symptoms are, in descending order of likelihood, hyperthyroidism, premature menopause, hosting an alien parasite or, and I only include it for the sake of covering absolutely all bases, sexual arousal.",4
17445,Amy,10, Where would I have picked up an alien parasite?,4
17446,Scene,10, The cafeteria. ,4
17447,Howard,10, There you are.,4
17448,Raj,10," Oh, hey.",4
17449,Howard,10, Let me ask you a question. What are you most afraid of?,4
17450,Raj,10," I don‰Ûªt know. Um, nuclear war. Accidentally being buried alive. Any of those movies where you get that phone call that says you‰Ûªre going to die, and then you do.",4
17451,Howard,10," No. Something very specific that we both know you, Rajesh Koothrappali, are terrified of.",4
17452,Raj,10," Well, type two diabetes runs in my family. The thought of losing a toe‰Û_",4
17453,Howard,10, Spiders! You‰Ûªre afraid of spiders!,4
17454,Raj,10, What the heck is this?,4
17455,Howard,10," A jar with a big spider in it, of course. Bravery test. First one to take his hand out is the sidekick.",4
17456,Raj,10, Are you crazy?,4
17457,Howard,10, Perhaps. Are you scared?,4
17458,Raj,10, No. But it‰Ûªs a stupid test.,4
17459,Howard,10," Oh, really? What if the earth was in danger and the only way to save it was to stick your hand in a jar with a spider?",4
17460,Raj,10," Oh, yeah? What if the earth was in danger and the only way to save it was to take a shower in the locker room and let other guys see you naked?",4
17461,Howard,10," Oh, come on. That‰Ûªs never gonna happen. Now put your hand in the jar or forever be revealed as my sidekick.",4
17462,Raj,10," All right, I will.",4
17463,Howard,10, How did you get so brave all of a sudden?,4
17464,Raj,10, It‰Ûªs easy. The spider‰Ûªs crawling up your arm.,4
17465,Howard,10," Get it off! Get it off! Please, Raj! Ah! Ah! Ah! Please. Oh!",4
17466,Scene,10, Amy‰Ûªs lab. ,4
17467,Amy,10, My blood work shows thyroid function normal. Cortisol levels normal.,4
17468,Sheldon,10, How about your follicle-stimulating hormone levels?,4
17469,Amy,10," Sheldon, I am not going through menopause.",4
17470,Sheldon,10, Are you sure? You said that with the testy bark of an old biddy.,4
17471,Amy,10," I think we need to face the cold, hard truth, I was sexually aroused by Penny‰Ûªs friend Zack.",4
17472,Sheldon,10, Hang on. I don‰Ûªt know that we‰Ûªve given the alien parasite hypothesis a fair shake.,4
17473,Amy,10," Let‰Ûªs look at this logically. I have a stomach, I get hungry. I have genitals, I have the potential for sexual arousal.",4
17474,Sheldon,10," A cross we all must bear. You know, in difficult moments like this, I often turn to a force greater than myself.",4
17475,Amy,10, Religion?,4
17476,Amy,10, No.,4
17477,Sheldon,10," Don‰Ûªt. It‰Ûªs terrible. However, in it, we learn that when Spock finds himself drawn off the path of logic by feelings bubbling up from his human half, he suppresses them using the Vulcan mental discipline of Kolinar.",4
17478,Amy,10, Are you suggesting we live our lives guided by the philosophies found in cheap science fiction?,4
17479,Sheldon,10, Cheap science fiction?,4
17480,Amy,10, What are you doing?,4
17481,Sheldon,10, Using Kolinar to suppress my anger at that last comment.,4
17482,Amy,10, Is it possible that your concern for me at this moment is motivated by nothing more than simple jealousy?,4
17483,Sheldon,10," I hadn‰Ûªt considered that. Give me a moment. All right, I‰Ûªve considered it.",4
17484,Amy,10, And?,4
17485,Sheldon,10, I reject it.,4
17486,Amy,10," You reject it because you don‰Ûªt feel jealousy, or because you are suppressing jealousy?",4
17487,Sheldon,10, I think I‰Ûªll eat my lunch at home.,4
17488,Amy,10," That‰Ûªs not your lunch, Sheldon, those are the cadaver brain specimens.",4
17489,Sheldon,10," Oh. As they were incorrectly sliced, you can see how I could mistake them for my sashimi.",4
17490,Scene,10, The laundry room.,4
17491,Sheldon,10, Hello.,4
17492,Penny,10, Hey. Isn‰Ûªt tomorrow your usual laundry night?,4
17493,Sheldon,10," The supermarket was out of my regular fabric softener. If this one under or over-softens, I‰Ûªll need time to make things right.",4
17494,Penny,10, That‰Ûªs thinking ahead.,4
17495,Sheldon,10, The alternative would be to think backwards. And that‰Ûªs just remembering.,4
17496,Penny,10, So how‰Ûªs Amy?,4
17497,Sheldon,10, Amy‰Ûªs changed. I might have to let her go.,4
17498,Penny,10," Oh, no. Why?",4
17499,Sheldon,10," I thought she was a highly evolved creature of pure intellect, like me. But recent events indicate that she may be a slave to her baser urges. Like you.",4
17500,Penny,10, Just going to skip over that insult.,4
17501,Sheldon,10, What insult?,4
17502,Penny,10," Yeah. That‰Ûªs why I‰Ûªm going to skip over it. Are you saying that Amy is, oh, what‰Ûªs the",4
17503,Sheldon,10, Forget science. She‰Ûªs horny.,4
17504,Penny,10, Oh! Okay. Wow.,4
17505,Sheldon,10, It‰Ûªs simple biology. There‰Ûªs nothing I can do about it.,4
17506,Penny,10, Are you sure?,4
17507,Sheldon,10, What are you suggesting?,4
17508,Penny,10, I‰Ûªm suggesting there might be something you could do about Amy‰Ûªs urges?,4
17509,Sheldon,10, It‰Ûªs illegal to spay a human being.,4
17510,Penny,10, Yeah. That‰Ûªs not what I had in mind.,4
17511,Sheldon,10, Oh. Oh! You mean something I could do.,4
17512,Penny,10, Exactly.,4
17513,Sheldon,10," Well, I was hoping to avoid this. But I might as well get it over with. Thank you, Penny. I‰Ûªll let you know what happens.",4
17514,Penny,10," Oh, Amy, you lucky girl.",4
17515,Scene,10, The apartment. Sheldon is on the phone.,4
17516,Sheldon,10," Yes. This is Dr. Sheldon Cooper. Is this the Zack Johnson who used to have coitus with my neighbour Penny? Sorry to bother you. Hello. I‰Ûªm looking for a Zack Johnson who used to have coitus with my neighbour Penny. Coitus. It means intercourse. And I have a feeling I‰Ûªm speaking to the right Zack. This is Sheldon Cooper. Fine. Shelly. Yes, that does sound like a girl‰Ûªs name. No, it doesn‰Ûªt bother me. Yes, Smelly Shelly does bother me. Let me tell you why I‰Ûªm calling. I‰Ûªd like to know if you‰Ûªd be interested in having sex with Amy Farrah Fowler. Amy Farrah Fowler. Yes, that is a girl‰Ûªs name. Good grief. It‰Ûªs like trying to talk to a dolphin.",4
17517,Scene,10, A gymnasium. ,4
17518,Leonard,10, Really? This is going to decide who‰Ûªs the hero and who‰Ûªs the sidekick?,4
17519,Howard,10, You got a better idea?,4
17520,Leonard,10, Every idea is better than this idea.,4
17521,Howard,10, Ding!,4
17522,Raj,10, Wait. What the hell is ding?,4
17523,Howard,10, It‰Ûªs a bell.,4
17524,Raj,10, I don‰Ûªt think this kind of wrestling has a bell.,4
17525,Howard,10, Fine. How do you want to start?,4
17526,Raj,10," I say, uh, how about one, two, three, go?",4
17527,Howard,10, One-two-three-go? That‰Ûªs for babies.,4
17528,Raj,10," Okay, how about, uh, on your mark, get set, go?",4
17529,Howard,10," That‰Ûªs for a footrace. If you want to race, we have to go outside.",4
17530,Raj,10," No, it‰Ûªs chilly outside. Didn‰Ûªt bring my jacket.",4
17531,Howard,10," Oh, for crying out loud. What kind of superhero needs a jacket?",4
17532,Raj,10," What kind of superhero says dibs on the red tights, dibs on the red tights.",4
17533,Howard,10," All right, how about this? Ready, wrestle.",4
17534,Raj,10," Wait. Are we starting now? Or is that what you‰Ûªre going to say when we do start, or‰Û_",4
17535,Howard,10, We‰Ûªre starting now!,4
17536,Raj,10, Don‰Ûªt yell at me!,4
17537,Leonard,10, Suppose there are worse ways to spend a Friday night. None come to mind.,4
17538,Scene,10, A bar.,4
17539,Sheldon,10, Look at this stamp. On what authority are they permitted to mutilate patrons as they enter?,4
17540,Amy,10, I‰Ûªm sure it‰Ûªll wash off.,4
17541,Sheldon,10, Little comfort tonight. I look like a Hell‰Ûªs Angel.,4
17542,Amy,10, There‰Ûªs Zack.,4
17543,Sheldon,10, Are you sure this is what you want to do?,4
17544,Amy,10," It‰Ûªs not what I want to do, it‰Ûªs what I have to do.",4
17545,Sheldon,10," Go, Amy Farrah Fowler. Follow your endocrine system.",4
17546,Amy,10," Thank you, Sheldon. You‰Ûªre a good friend.",4
17547,Sheldon,10, Please don‰Ûªt drag this out. This is never going to come off.,4
17548,Amy,10," Excuse me? Zack? I am Amy Farrah Fowler. We met the other night. I have spent my life in pursuit of pure knowledge. Until I met you, my decisions were founded in logic and reason. And yet here I stand before you, 130 pounds of raging estrogen, longing to grab hold of your gluteus maximus and make Shakespeare‰Ûªs metaphorical beast with two backs.",4
17549,Zack,10, My gluteus what?,4
17550,Amy,10," On the other hand, as I look at the blank, ape-like expression on your face, I have decided to adopt the Vulcan practice of Kolinar. Good-bye, Zack.",4
17551,Zack,10, Bye. Hoo. That should hold me for a while.,4
17552,Scene,10, The gymnasium.,4
17553,Howard,10, I‰Ûªm legally obligated to inform you that I took a karate lesson when I was 11. I‰Ûªd be a regular ninja by now if my mom could‰Ûªve arranged a carpool.,4
17554,Raj,10," Oh, yeah? Well, I‰Ûªve been taking Pilates class at the rec center, and my abs look like sections of a Hershey bar.",4
17555,Howard,10," Oh, yeah? Won‰Ûªt matter, you‰Ûªre going down!",4
17556,Raj,10," No, uh-uh, you‰Ûªre going down!",4
17557,Howard,10," If anybody‰Ûªs going to go down, it‰Ûªs going to be you.",4
17558,Leonard,10, Fellas. It‰Ûªs been 30 minutes. Nobody‰Ûªs touched each other.,4
17559,Scene,10, A street. ,4
17560,Sheldon,10, I‰Ûªm glad you decided to reject your animal hindbrain and return to the realm of pure intellect.,4
17561,Amy,10, As am I. (Holds Sheldon‰Ûªs hand),4
17562,Sheldon,10, What are you doing?,4
17563,Amy,10, An experiment. Nope. Nothing. Never mind.,4
17564,Scene,10, The gymnasium. ,4
17565,Raj,10, You realize you can‰Ûªt win.,4
17566,Howard,10, I prefer to think that I can‰Ûªt lose.,4
17567,Raj,10, You‰Ûªre wrong. It‰Ûªs only a matter of time before you fall into Rat-Man‰Ûªs rat trap.,4
17568,Howard,10," You pathetic fool! If there were a rat-catcher, wouldn‰Ûªt it catch Rat-Man?",4
17569,Raj,10, Just because I didn‰Ûªt express myself well doesn‰Ûªt mean my underlying point was invalid! You bloviating buffoon!,4
17570,Howard,10, You narcissistic nincompoop!,4
17571,Raj,10," You crimson coward! Oh, Leonard, wake up, you‰Ûªre missing some very excellent superhero quips.",4

17576,Sheldon,11, Not so fast. Infinite Sheldon.,4
17577,Leonard,11, Infinite Sheldon?,4
17578,Sheldon,11," Yes, Infinite Sheldon defeats all other cards and does not violate the rule against homemade cards because I made it at work.",4
17579,Leonard,11, Do you understand why people don‰Ûªt want to play with you?,4
17580,Sheldon,11," No, although it‰Ûªs a question I‰Ûªve been pondering since preschool.",4
17581,Leonard,11, Hey.,4
17582,Zack,11, Hey.,4
17583,Leonard,11, Hey.,4
17584,Penny,11," Hey, your copy of Science magazine was in my mailbox.",4
17585,Leonard,11," Oh, thanks.",4
17586,Penny,11, Mm-hmm.,4
17587,Zack,11," Check it out, all about planets this month.",4
17588,Leonard,11, That‰Ûªs an atom.,4
17589,Zack,11," Agree to disagree. That‰Ûªs what I love about science, there‰Ûªs no one right answer.",4
17590,Leonard,11," So, you and Zack again, huh?",4
17591,Penny,11," Yeah, yeah, me and Zack again.",4
17592,Zack,11, Were we here earlier?,4
17593,Penny,11," Okay, we should, we should go.",4
17594,Zack,11," Ah, not yet. I want to talk science with the science dudes.",4
17595,Howard,11," Oh, and the science dudes want to talk science with you. What do you want to talk about, rocks, dinosaurs, our friend the beaver?",4
17596,Zack,11," You know, I saw this great thing on the Discovery Channel. Turns out that if you kill a starfish, it‰Ûªll just come back to life.",4
17597,Sheldon,11, Was the starfish wearing boxer shorts? Because you might have been watching Nickelodeon.,4
17598,Zack,11," No, I‰Ûªm almost sure that it was the Discovery Channel. It was a great show. They also said dolphins might be smarter than people.",4
17599,Leonard,11, They might be smarter than some people.,4
17600,Zack,11," Well, maybe we can do an experiment to find out.",4
17601,Sheldon,11," Oh, that‰Ûªs easy enough. We‰Ûªd need a large tank of water, a hoop to jump through, and a bucket of whatever bite-sized treats you find tasty.",4
17602,Zack,11, I don‰Ûªt get it.,4
17603,Leonard,11, A dolphin might.,4
17604,Zack,11," Oh, I see. You guys are inferring that I‰Ûªm stupid.",4
17605,Sheldon,11, That‰Ûªs not correct. We were implying it. You then inferred it.,4
17606,Zack,11, Let‰Ûªs go.,4
17607,Penny,11," You know, for a group of guys who claim they spent most of their lives being bullied, you can be real jerks. Shame on all of you. (Closes door)",4
17608,Raj,11, What the hell did I do?,4
17609,Penny (Opens door again),11, You laughed.,4
17610,Scene,11, The same.,4
17611,Leonard,11, You think Penny‰Ûªs right? Were we bullying Zack?,4
17612,Howard,11," No, I know bullying. He left here unswirlied and his ass crack was underpants-free.",4
17613,Raj,11, And nobody drew a penis on his forehead.,4
17614,Leonard,11, That happened to you?,4
17615,Raj,11, First day of cricket camp. They drew it so the testicles were my eyes.,4
17616,Leonard,11," I don‰Ûªt know, I think we might owe the guy an apology.",4
17617,Howard,11, So go apologize.,4
17618,Leonard,11, Why me?,4
17619,Howard,11," You started it, we just piled on.",4
17620,Leonard,11, What would I even say?,4
17621,Sheldon,11," Zack, I‰Ûªm sorry you‰Ûªre stupid. Have a Milk Dud.",4
17622,Raj,11, A Milk Dud?,4
17623,Sheldon,11," Yeah, Milk Duds, with their self-deprecating name and remarkably mild flavour, are the most apologetic of the boxed candies.",4
17624,Leonard,11," I got a better idea. We‰Ûªre all responsible. I say we all go. Come on, who‰Ûªs with me? Free comic books to anyone who comes with me. I might get punched. You really want to miss that?",4
17625,Raj,11, Junior Mints are pretty apologetic.,4
17626,Sheldon,11, You‰Ûªre embarrassing yourself.,4
17627,Scene,11, At Penny‰Ûªs door. Leonard knocks three times. ,4
17628,Sheldon,11, Penny.,4
17629,Penny,11, What?,4
17630,Leonard,11," Yeah, we came to talk to Zack. Hey, Zack.",4
17631,Zack,11, What do you want?,4
17632,Leonard,11," Listen, uh, the stuff we were saying before, we were just kidding around.",4
17633,Zack,11," No, you weren‰Ûªt. You were making fun of me.",4
17634,Leonard,11," Come on, that‰Ûªs what we do. We give each other a hard time. Hey, Sheldon, you look like a praying mantis.",4
17635,Sheldon,11, That‰Ûªs very hurtful.,4
17636,Leonard,11, See?,4
17637,Zack,11," I don‰Ûªt know, it still wasn‰Ûªt very nice.",4
17638,Sheldon,11, Milk Dud?,4
17639,Zack,11," Oh, I love Milk Duds. Okay, we‰Ûªre cool.",4
17640,Sheldon (to Raj),11, Junior Mints.,4
17641,Zack,11, You guys want to come in and have a beer?,4
17642,Leonard,11," Uh, we‰Ûªre on our way to the comic book store.",4
17643,Howard,11, Leonard‰Ûªs buying.,4
17644,Zack,11, Really? I haven‰Ûªt been to a comic book store in literally a million years.,4
17645,Sheldon,11, Literally? Literally a million years?,4
17646,Leonard,11, Don‰Ûªt.,4
17647,Zack,11, You want to go with ‰Ûªem?,4
17648,Penny,11, No.,4
17649,Zack,11," Okay, see you later.",4
17650,Penny,11," Wait, w-w-wait-wait-wait, you‰Ûªre ditching me to go look at comic books?",4
17651,Zack,11, Are you mad at me?,4
17652,Penny,11, I‰Ûªm not happy.,4
17653,Zack,11, Milk Dud?,4
17654,Scene,11, The comic book store.,4
17655,Zack,11," Wow, this place is awesome. Where do they keep the Archies?",4
17656,Sheldon,11," In the bedrooms of ten-year-old girls, where they belong.",4
17657,Zack,11," Oh, no, you‰Ûªre thinking old-school Archie. It‰Ûªs much more sophisticated now. Like, there‰Ûªs two universes, and Archie‰Ûªs married to Betty in one and Veronica in the other. Midge is even breaking up with Moose.",4
17658,Raj,11, No.,4
17659,Zack,11," About time, right?",4
17660,Stuart,11, Hey.,4
17661,Zack,11, Hey.,4
17662,Stuart,11, You guys finally chip in for a bodyguard?,4
17663,Leonard,11," Uh, no. Oh, this is Zack. He‰Ûªs a friend of ours. Zack, this is Stuart. He owns the store.",4
17664,Zack,11," Wow, lucky you.",4
17665,Stuart,11," Yeah, I work 70 hours a week and average a dollar sixty five an hour.",4
17666,Zack,11, Sweet.,4
17667,Stuart,11, Is that sarcasm?,4
17668,Howard,11," Uh, no, it‰Ûªs an indictment of the American education system.",4
17669,Raj,11, The Archies are over here.,4
17670,Zack,11, Yippee.,4
17671,Stuart,11, So are you guys coming to my New Year‰Ûªs Eve costume party?,4
17672,Sheldon,11, Of course. We‰Ûªre coming as the Justice League of America.,4
17673,Howard,11, Switching it up from last year when we came as the Justice League of America.,4
17674,Sheldon,11," To that point, it occurs to me that we might have an opportunity to finally snare Best Group Costume if we shore up our weak link, which is clearly Leonard as Superman.",4
17675,Leonard,11," Hey, I got new boots this year. Guaranteed to add three inches.",4
17676,Sheldon,11," That‰Ûªs sad. Let‰Ûªs ask ourselves, is there anyone we know who would make a more manly and convincing son of Krypton?",4
17677,Stuart,11, Than than Leonard in high-heeled boots? Howard‰Ûªs mother in high-heeled boots?,4
17678,Sheldon,11, I was thinking specifically of the gentleman over there moving his lips as he enjoys the latest exploits of Betty and Veronica.,4
17679,Leonard,11, Zack?,4
17680,Howard,11, He is the only person we know with actual muscles.,4
17681,Leonard,11, You can‰Ûªt replace me with Zack.,4
17682,Sheldon,11, Why not? Penny did it.,4
17683,Howard,11," Yeah, she seems happier. Why wouldn‰Ûªt we be?",4
17684,Zack,11," Score. I got an Archie, Betty and Veronica, and a Jughead. All set for my weekend number twos.",4
17685,Sheldon,11," Congratulations. Zack, how would you like to be Superman?",4
17686,Zack,11," I don‰Ûªt know, sounds like a lot of responsibility.",4
17687,Scene,11, The stairwell. ,4
17688,Leonard,11," Fine, if Zack‰Ûªs going to be Superman, I want to be Green Lantern.",4
17689,Raj,11, But I‰Ûªm Green Lantern.,4
17690,Leonard,11, You can be Aquaman.,4
17691,Raj,11, I don‰Ûªt want to be Aquaman. He sucks. He sucks underwater. He sucks fish pee.,4
17692,Sheldon,11," Excuse me, I believe Aquaman uses his telepathic powers to request the fish do their business elsewhere.",4
17693,Zack,11," Hey, babe.",4
17694,Penny,11, I‰Ûªm still mad at you.,4
17695,Zack,11," Well, you won‰Ûªt be when you hear the great news.",4
17696,Penny,11, What great news?,4
17697,Zack,11," We‰Ûªre going to a costume party at the comic book store on New Year‰Ûªs Eve, and you get to be Wonder Woman.",4
17698,Sheldon,11, Complete with bulletproof bracelets and lasso of truth. Invisible plane sold separately.,4
17699,Penny,11," Wait, why me? Wh-Why can‰Ûªt your girlfriend be Wonder Woman?",4
17700,Howard,11, She and her lab team are under quarantine. Seems at the Christmas party they were doing Jell-O shots out of petri dishes that used to contain yellow fever.,4
17701,Penny,11," Okay, what about your friend Amy?",4
17702,Sheldon,11, Amy Farrah Fowler doesn‰Ûªt believe in wearing costumes. She isn‰Ûªt the free spirit I am.,4
17703,Penny,11," Okay, well, forget it. I‰Ûªm not spending my New Year‰Ûªs Eve at a comic book store wearing a Wonder Woman costume.",4
17704,Howard (after Raj whispers to him),11, He says he‰Ûªll wear it if you‰Ûªll be Aquaman.,4
17705,Scene,11," The apartment. Leonard is dressed as Green Lantern, Sheldon as The Flash. ",4
17706,Leonard,11, What are you doing?,4
17707,Sheldon,11, We‰Ûªre going to be late. I‰Ûªm pacing nervously.,4
17708,Leonard,11, You‰Ûªre jogging.,4
17709,Sheldon,11, This is how the Flash paces.,4
17710,Sheldon,11, I‰Ûªm not Sheldon. I‰Ûªm the Flash. And now I‰Ûªm going to the Grand Canyon to scream in frustration. I‰Ûªm back.,4
17711,Howard,11, I‰Ûªm Batman.,4
17712,Sheldon,11," Oh, I hardly think so. The real caped crusader calls his crime-fighting cohorts when he‰Ûªs running late.",4
17713,Howard,11, I had to walk. I couldn‰Ûªt get Raj on the back of my scooter.,4
17714,Raj,11," I‰Ûªve said this before, and I‰Ûªll say it again. Aquaman sucks.",4
17715,Zack,11, Look up in the sky. It‰Ûªs a bird. It‰Ûªs a plane. I forget the rest.,4
17716,Penny,11, All right. Let‰Ûªs get this thing over with.,4
17717,Sheldon,11, I‰Ûªm sorry. But in what universe is Wonder Woman blonde?,4
17718,Howard,11," Relax. No one‰Ûªs going to be looking at her hair. Ow! I mean, ow.",4
17719,Zack,11," Hold on. The costume came with a black wig. Where is it, babe?",4
17720,Penny,11, No. I‰Ûªm not wearing it. It looks stupid.,4
17721,Zack,11, Come on. We‰Ûªre trying to win a contest here.,4
17722,Penny,11, Forget it. I‰Ûªm not wearing the wig.,4
17723,Zack,11," Penny, there‰Ûªs no I in Justice League.",4
17724,Howard,11," Well, actually.",4
17725,Sheldon,11, Don‰Ûªt. He‰Ûªs making our case.,4
17726,Zack,11," Okay, babe. Uh, kind of embarrassing me in front of my friends.",4
17727,Penny,11, Okay. You know what? I changed my mind. I‰Ûªm not going.,4
17728,Raj,11, Looks like someone else is going to have to be Wonder Woman.,4
17729,Scene,11, Penny‰Ûªs door. ,4
17730,Zack,11," Babe, open up.",4
17731,Penny,11, I‰Ûªm not talking to you.,4
17732,Zack,11, Then who are you talking to? Babe?,4
17733,Sheldon,11,"åÊ (Knock) Penny, (Knock) Penny, (Knock) Penny, (Knock) Penny, (Knock) Penny, (Knock) Penny, (Knock) Penny, (Knock) Penny, (Knock) Penny, (Knock) Penny, (Knock) Penny, (Knock) Penny, (Knock) Penny, (Knock) Penny, (Knock) Penny, (Knock) Penny, (Knock) Penny, (Knock) Penny, (Knock) Penny, (Knock) Penny.",4
17734,Penny,11, What the hell is wrong with you?,4
17735,Sheldon,11," I‰Ûªm the Flash. I just knocked 30,000 times.",4
17736,Penny,11," Okay. What do you want, Sheldon?",4
17737,Sheldon,11, I understand why you‰Ûªre upset.,4
17738,Penny,11, Really?,4
17739,Sheldon,11, Yes. You‰Ûªre afraid that costume makes you look fat.,4
17740,Penny,11," No. Wait, wait, does it?",4
17741,Sheldon,11, Don‰Ûªt worry. Wonder Woman was an Amazon. And Amazons tend to be very beefy gals.,4
17742,Penny,11," Good-bye, Sheldon.",4
17743,Sheldon,11," But they‰Ûªre not blonde, so put on your wig. Hello?",4
17744,Scene,11, The apartment. ,4
17745,Raj,11, Stupid Aquaman.,4
17746,Leonard,11," If it makes you feel any better, when I was dating Penny, she used to flip out on me all the time.",4
17747,Zack,11, Whoa. You dated Penny?,4
17748,Leonard,11, She didn‰Ûªt tell you?,4
17749,Zack,11, She told me she dated a guy named Leonard. Who would have thought it was you?,4
17750,Leonard,11, Who else would it be?,4
17751,Zack,11," I don‰Ûªt know. Somebody bigger and, yeah, sure. Why not you?",4
17752,Sheldon,11, I may have failed.,4
17753,Howard,11," Okay, I guess we just go without a Wonder Woman.",4
17754,Zack,11, I don‰Ûªt want to go without Penny.,4
17755,Raj,11," Oh, great. No Superman, no Wonder Woman? All we‰Ûªve got is a skinny Flash, an Indian Aquaman, a nearsighted Green Lantern, and a teeny, tiny Dark Knight.",4
17756,Sheldon,11," Obviously, we‰Ûªre no longer a Justice League. We have no choice but to switch to our Muppet Baby costumes.",4
17757,Raj,11," Ooh, I call Kermit.",4
17758,Sheldon,11, I‰Ûªm Kermit. You‰Ûªre Scooter.,4
17759,Raj,11," Oh, man. Scooter sucks. He‰Ûªs the Aquaman of the Muppet Babies.",4
17760,Howard,11," No, we can still make this work. Leonard, you talk to Penny.",4
17761,Leonard,11, What makes you think I can convince her?,4
17762,Howard,11," You got her to have sex with you. Obviously, your superpower is brainwashing.",4
17763,Leonard,11," Okay, let me see if I understand this. You want me to convince my ex-girlfriend to go to a costume party with her new boyfriend just so we can win a stupid prize?",4
17764,Sheldon,11, Yes. And make her wear the black wig. Good luck.,4
17765,Scene,11, Penny‰Ûªs apartment. Knocking.,4
17766,Penny,11," Go away, Sheldon.",4
17767,Leonard,11, It‰Ûªs Leonard.,4
17768,Penny,11," Oh. Go away, Leonard.",4
17769,Penny,11, It‰Ûªs open.,4
17770,Leonard,11, Hey.,4
17771,Penny,11," I‰Ûªm not going to that party, Leonard.",4
17772,Leonard,11," Okay, listen. You don‰Ûªt have to wear the wig. At this party, we‰Ûªre gonna win first prize just by showing up with a girl.",4
17773,Penny,11, It‰Ûªs not the wig.,4
17774,Leonard,11," Did I do something? I mean, I tried to be friends with Zack, like you said, which believe me, was difficult, given how you and me used to be, you know, you and me, and now you and him are you and him.",4
17775,Penny,11," Okay, look. We‰Ûªre not really me and him.",4
17776,Leonard,11, Then what are you?,4
17777,Penny,11, I don‰Ûªt know. I only started seeing Zack again so I wouldn‰Ûªt be alone on New Year‰Ûªs Eve. How pathetic is that?,4
17778,Leonard,11, Not as pathetic as dressing up like this and going to a comic book store on New Year‰Ûªs Eve.,4
17779,Penny,11, You make a cute Green Arrow.,4
17780,Leonard,11, Green Lantern.,4
17781,Penny,11, Like there‰Ûªs a difference.,4
17782,Leonard,11, There‰Ûªs a big difference. Arrow. Lantern.,4
17783,Penny,11," Whatever. Look, if Zack and I had just gone to a regular club or a party, it would have been fine, but this, with the costumes, and you.",4
17784,Leonard,11, What about me?,4
17785,Penny,11, Nothing. Let‰Ûªs go to the party. (Puts on wig) How do I look?,4
17786,Leonard,11," Um, I guarantee you‰Ûªll be the prettiest girl there.",4
17787,Howard (outside the door),11," Okay, the good news is, we have a Wonder Woman.",4
17788,Sheldon,11, Oh.,4
17789,Zack,11, Yes.,4
17790,Sheldon,11, What‰Ûªs the bad news?,4
17791,Howard,11, Superman probably isn‰Ûªt getting laid tonight.,4
17792,Zack,11," Aw, damn.",4
17793,Scene,11, The party. ,4
17794,Stuart,11, And the award for best group costume goes to Justice League of America number three!,4
17795,Sheldon,11, Thank you! Thank you so much!,4
17796,Stuart,11," Okay. Okay, ten seconds to midnight.",4
17797,All,11," Ten, nine, eight‰Û_",4
17798,Sheldon,11," No, wait! I have a speech.",4
17799,All,11," Seven, six‰Û_",4
17800,Sheldon,11, Stop counting!,4
17801,All,11," Five, four, three‰Û_",4
17802,Sheldon,11," This is my moment, dag nab it!",4
17803,All,11," Two, one! Happy New Year!",4
17804,Sheldon,11, I‰Ûªm not going to say another word until you people settle down. I‰Ûªm waiting.,4
17805,Scene,11, The street. ,4
17806,Zack,11, That was a great party. We should dress like this all the time.,4
17807,Penny,11, Are you high?,4
17808,Leonard,11, You‰Ûªre being a bully.,4
17809,Howard,11, Check it out. Those guys are breaking into that car.,4
17810,Leonard,11, What should we do?,4
17811,Sheldon,11, We‰Ûªre the Justice League of America. There‰Ûªs only one thing we can do. Turn around and slowly walk away.,4
17812,Zack (after a moment‰Ûªs thought),11, Nah. Hold up.,4
17813,Scene,11, The apartment. ,4
17814,Leonard,11," Look, I know our winter thermostat setting is 72 degrees, but I‰Ûªm a little warm, so I‰Ûªm going to turn it down.",4
17815,"Sheldon (as The Flash, runs to the Grand Canyon)",11," Good Lord, how you frustrate me, Leonard Hofstadter! (Runs back) Fine.",4
17816,Scene,12, The university cafeteria. Howard is on the phone.,4
17817,Howard,12," Ma, Ma, calm down. Listen to me. I know it says click with the mouse, but on a laptop, the trackpad is the mouse. Now, put your finger on it. Doesn‰Ûªt matter which finger. Good choice. Now move it down to your e-mail icon. Yeah, the little envelope. What do you mean, what does it look like? It looks like an envelope! Fine, you don‰Ûªt like the computer, don‰Ûªt use it! Sure, we can exchange it for a salad spinner. Good-bye!",4
17818,Raj,12," That‰Ûªs a Hanukkah present you‰Ûªre regretting, huh?",4
17819,Sheldon,12," I won‰Ûªt say that all senior citizens who can‰Ûªt master technology should be publicly flogged, but if we made an example of one or two, it might give the others incentive to try harder.",4
17820,Leonard,12," I had a great idea. You know how we‰Ûªre always having to stop and solve differential equations, like when you‰Ûªre doing Fourier analysis, or using the Schrodinger equation?",4
17821,Sheldon,12, Howard doesn‰Ûªt. He‰Ûªs only an engineer.,4
17822,Leonard,12," I was thinking, we could write a little app that would use handwriting recognition, and then run it through a symbolic evaluation engine. You just use your smartphone, take a picture of the equation and bam!",4
17823,Raj,12, You know what‰Ûªs a great app? The one that makes fart noises.,4
17824,Sheldon,12," You know, Leonard, that‰Ûªs actually a valid idea. Very good.",4
17825,Leonard,12, Can you say that and not make it sound like I‰Ûªm a cat who learned how to use the toilet?,4
17826,Sheldon,12," No. The two achievements are equally surprising and equally admirable, though if pressed, I‰Ûªd have to give a slight edge to the cat. I‰Ûªll save you the pain and nervousness of waiting for the answer. I agree to be part of your project. Congratulations.",4
17827,Leonard,12," Oh, yay for me. What about you guys? I can‰Ûªt promise anything, but people do make money off stuff like this.",4
17828,Howard,12, A few extra bucks would be nice. I could finally move out of my mother‰Ûªs house.,4
17829,Raj,12, Where would you go?,4
17830,Howard,12, I always dreamed about building a little place of my own over the garage.,4
17831,Raj,12," You know, if I made more money, I could take time off from work and give pretty girls submarine rides.",4
17832,Howard,12, What‰Ûªs that? Some weird sex thing?,4
17833,Raj,12," No. You take pretty girls underwater in your private submarine, and you show them fish. Why does everything have to be dirty with you?",4
17834,Leonard,12," I was thinking we could work on this at night, and then maybe in a couple of weeks, we‰Ûªll have ourselves an app to sell.",4
17835,Howard,12, Sounds like we‰Ûªre in business.,4
17836,Raj,12, I think we should take a picture to capture this moment.,4
17837,Leonard,12, Yeah.,4
17838,Sheldon,12, Oh!,4
17839,Raj (pressing button on camera phone. Camera makes a fart noise),12," Was that the best 99 cents I ever spent, or what?",4
17840,Scene,12, The apartment. ,4
17841,Leonard,12, I checked the App Store. No one is doing handwriting-recognition differential equation solving.,4
17842,Sheldon,12," Oh, dear Lord, shush.",4
17843,Leonard,12, What?,4
17844,Sheldon,12," You have so few good ideas, Leonard. And you‰Ûªre just going to spill the beans in front of an outsider?",4
17845,Penny,12," Who, me?",4
17846,Howard,12," Sheldon, I don‰Ûªt think Penny cares about handwriting-recognition based differential‰Û_",4
17847,Sheldon (singing),12," The stars at night are big and bright, deep in the heart of Texas.",4
17848,Leonard,12, She‰Ûªs not going to steal our idea.,4
17849,Penny,12, What idea?,4
17850,Leonard,12, We‰Ûªre gonna write an application‰Û_,4
17851,Sheldon (singing),12," The prairie sky is wide and high, deep in the heart‰Û_",4
17852,Penny,12," Okay, stop, stop!",4
17853,Sheldon,12, Of Texas.,4
17854,Penny,12," Whatever your secret is, I‰Ûªm sure it‰Ûªs boring, so I‰Ûªm not interested.",4
17855,Leonard,12," It‰Ûªs not boring at all. You see, in higher order mathematics, there are certain sets of equations that‰Û_",4
17856,Penny,12, Bored.,4
17857,Leonard,12, Satisfied?,4
17858,Sheldon,12, Hardly. Consider this unlikely but very plausible scenario. A young woman alone in the big city. Her ridiculous dream of becoming an actress lies shattered about her.,4
17859,Penny,12," Hey, wait a minute.",4
17860,Howard,12," Well, hang on. Let‰Ûªs see where he‰Ûªs going.",4
17861,Sheldon,12," Then it hits her. How is she going to survive? I mean, she has no prospects, no marketable skills. And then one day, she meets a group of geniuses and their friend Howard.",4
17862,Howard,12," Hey, I‰Û_",4
17863,Penny,12, Hang on. Let‰Ûªs see where he‰Ûªs going.,4
17864,Sheldon,12," She befriends them, and then lies in wait until they reveal a marketable idea, which she steals and sells to the highest bidder.",4
17865,Leonard,12, That is ridiculous.,4
17866,Sheldon,12," Oh, is it? Well let‰Ûªs see you come up with an explanation as to why this woman hangs out with us all the time.",4
17867,Penny,12," Oh, great. You know what? I‰Ûªve already mooched dinner off you guys. I don‰Ûªt need to listen to this.",4
17868,Howard,12," There‰Ûªs your answer, free food.",4
17869,Sheldon,12," All right, I‰Ûªve taken the liberty of drafting these workflow charts which outline our various duties and the path we will follow as we develop our ground-breaking new app.",4
17870,Raj,12," Hey, why am I in charge of phone support? Seems a bit racist.",4
17871,Sheldon,12, A customer service representative with an Indian accent will create the impression we‰Ûªre a vast enterprise that uses overseas call centres.,4
17872,Raj,12, Oh. Very clever. But still racist.,4
17873,Sheldon,12," Duly noted, Steve from Wichita.",4
17874,Howard,12, Why am I listed as your executive assistant?,4
17875,Sheldon,12," Because the word secretary has fallen into disrepute. FYI, my mother‰Ûªs birthday is coming up. I‰Ûªm going to need you to pick up a present.",4
17876,Leonard,12," Okay, we need to stop for a minute.",4
17877,Sheldon,12," Leonard, please, we can talk during our break. We have one coming up at midnight. We‰Ûªll need snacks.",4
17878,Leonard,12," Sheldon, you‰Ûªre not in charge. It‰Ûªs my idea. I‰Ûªm in charge.",4
17879,Sheldon,12," Oh, of course you are. Look at the organizational chart. You‰Ûªre clearly listed as founder.",4
17880,Leonard,12," Well, yes, and you‰Ûªre listed as Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer and Chief Operating Officer.",4
17881,Sheldon,12," You missed Chief Science Officer, Chairman of the Board, and Head of the Secret Santa Committee.",4
17882,Leonard,12, Okay. You need to get clear on this right now. I am in charge of this project.,4
17883,Raj,12, Ooh. Leonard‰Ûªs going all alpha nerd on Sheldon‰Ûªs ass.,4
17884,Sheldon,12," All right. All right, I‰Ûªm not going to argue with you. Sheldon Cooper is nothing if not a team player. Dr. Hofstadter, you have the conn.",4
17885,Leonard,12, Thank you. I thought we might start by talking about the user interface.,4
17886,Sheldon,12," Oh, dear Lord, we‰Ûªre doomed.",4
17887,Scene,12, Later. ,4
17888,Leonard,12," So this button here will allow you to scan a new equation, but over here, you can press this, and just substitute new values for the coefficients.",4
17889,Sheldon,12," Good one, boss.",4
17890,Leonard,12, What?,4
17891,Sheldon,12, This diagram. I assume you were opening with a joke. It certainly buoyed up this employee‰Ûªs esprit de corps.,4
17892,Leonard,12, It‰Ûªs not a joke. It‰Ûªs the real design.,4
17893,Sheldon,12," In that case, may I offer 27 little tweaks to make it slightly less embarrassing?",4
17894,Leonard,12," Sheldon, I think this will work. Let‰Ûªs just try it my way.",4
17895,Sheldon,12," Oh, I‰Ûªm, I‰Ûªm sorry. I assumed that you wanted candid truth-telling from your employees, but I realize now, you want the mindless nattering of complacent yes-men.",4
17896,Leonard,12, Are you done?,4
17897,Sheldon,12," If you say so, boss.",4
17898,Scene,12, Later still.,4
17899,Howard,12," So right now, this button-press event is just triggering a dummy procedure call‰Û_",4
17900,Sheldon,12, How about this for the app name? The Surprisingly Helpful Equation-Linked Differential Optimized Numerator.,4
17901,Raj,12, So it spells Sheldon?,4
17902,Sheldon,12, Does it? A happy accident.,4
17903,Leonard,12, We‰Ûªre not doing names now. Howard?,4
17904,Howard,12," Like I was saying, right now it‰Ûªs just a dummy procedure, but eventually, it will drop us into‰Û_",4
17905,Sheldon,12," All right, fine. If we‰Ûªre not going to give it a name, can we at least give it a secret code designation?",4
17906,Leonard,12, No.,4
17907,Sheldon,12," Well, but hear me out. The atomic bomb was The Manhattan Project. Windows 95 was originally Project Chicago. For our app, I would humbly suggest Project Nodlehs.",4
17908,Leonard,12, That‰Ûªs just Sheldon backwards.,4
17909,Sheldon,12, Another happy accident.,4
17910,Leonard,12, We‰Ûªre not wasting time with names right now.,4
17911,Sheldon,12, I see. Is that decision open for discussion?,4
17912,Leonard,12, No.,4
17913,Sheldon,12, Is the decision to not discuss it open for discussion?,4
17914,Leonard,12, No.,4
17915,Howard,12," Again, right now it‰Ûªs just a dummy procedure, but eventually, it will drop us into‰Û_",4
17916,Sheldon,12, I call for a vote of no confidence and an immediate change in leadership.,4
17917,Leonard,12," Oh Sheldon, stop it.",4
17918,Sheldon,12," When in the course of human events, it becomes necessary to dissolve the bonds that tie three competent scientists together‰Û_",4
17919,Leonard,12," That‰Ûªs enough, Sheldon.",4
17920,Sheldon,12," All right, let‰Ûªs get right to the vote. Show of hands all those opposed to Leonard and his reign of tyranny.",4
17921,Leonard,12," Okay, that‰Ûªs it, you‰Ûªre fired.",4
17922,Sheldon,12, Really? Why?,4
17923,Leonard,12, Because you‰Ûªre impossible to work with.,4
17924,Sheldon,12, I see. And is that open for discussion?,4
17925,Scene,12, The following morning.,4
17926,Leonard,12, What are you doing?,4
17927,Sheldon,12," Oh. Good morning, shoemaker. I think you‰Ûªll be pleased with what the elves were up to last night.",4
17928,Leonard,12, But I fired you.,4
17929,Sheldon,12," Oh, I know. I‰Ûªm now an independent contractor.",4
17930,Leonard,12," No, you are now nothing. You have no connection to this project whatsoever.",4
17931,Sheldon,12, But I made it better.,4
17932,Leonard,12, I don‰Ûªt want it better. I want it my way.,4
17933,Sheldon,12," Well, that speaks volumes, doesn‰Ûªt it? All right, I suppose I‰Ûªll go put on my bus pants.",4
17934,Leonard,12, What the hell are bus pants?,4
17935,Sheldon,12," They are pants one wears over one‰Ûªs regular pants when one sits on bus seats that other people have previously sat on. But perhaps from your lofty heights atop the corporate ladder, you‰Ûªve lost touch with the struggles of the common man.",4
17936,Leonard,12," Look, I‰Ûªm still happy to drive you to work. Nothing‰Ûªs changed in that regard. We‰Ûªre still roommates, we‰Ûªre still friends.",4
17937,Sheldon,12," Except you identified me, your best friend, as a gangrenous limb that needed to be severed from the organism and tossed away. The desperate act of a little man with a big Napoleon complex.",4
17938,Leonard,12, You know what? Go put on your bus pants.,4
17939,Scene,12, The cafeteria.,4
17940,Raj,12," Mm. Last night, I had a dream we got so rich from the app, you and I bought matching side-by-side mansions. But there was a secret tunnel connecting your front yard to my back yard. What do you think that means?",4
17941,Howard,12," It means after we play handball, I‰Ûªm showering at home.",4
17942,Sheldon,12," Good morning, Friend Howard. Friend Raj. I see you gentlemen are enjoying beverages. Perhaps they would taste better out of these.",4
17943,Raj,12, World‰Ûªs Greatest Astrophysicist?,4
17944,Sheldon,12, Don‰Ûªt thank me. You earned it.,4
17945,Howard,12, Howard Wolowitz. Why not World‰Ûªs Greatest Engineer?,4
17946,Sheldon,12," I‰Ûªm sorry. I typed that into the label maker, but I just couldn‰Ûªt press enter. Now down to business. What would it take for you to abandon Leonard and join me in a rival company? Unless, of course, the mugs are sufficient, in which case, welcome aboard.",4
17947,Howard,12, We‰Ûªre not quitting on Leonard.,4
17948,Sheldon,12, I understand. And your loyalty is admirable. But what if I were to up the ante?,4
17949,Raj,12, What are you talking about?,4
17950,Sheldon,12," Monogrammed key chains with a built-in laser pointer. No? How about can cosies emblazoned with our university mascot? Go, Beavers. I‰Ûªll be back.",4
17951,Scene,12, The apartment. ,4
17952,Howard,12," Okay, let‰Ûªs try this one. Spherical Hankel function.",4
17953,Leonard,12, Hold on. That‰Ûªs it!,4
17954,Howard,12, Eureka!,4
17955,Raj,12," Hey, we agreed when it was Eureka time, we were all gonna say it together.",4
17956,Howard,12, Fine. Let‰Ûªs say it together.,4
17957,Raj,12, No. The moment has passed.,4
17958,Sheldon,12," Greetings, gentlemen. How goes your little project?",4
17959,Raj,12," You mean, Project Lenwoloppali?",4
17960,Sheldon,12," Ah, a combination of all your names. Very clever. I assume Koothranardowitz was taken?",4
17961,Leonard,12, We‰Ûªre actually scanning equations and getting good results.,4
17962,Sheldon,12," Oh, well then, by all means, carry on. I wouldn‰Ûªt want to impede your progress.",4
17963,Leonard,12," Howard, did you solve the install time problem yet?",4
17964,Howard,12, No. It‰Ûªs a little tricky. I‰Ûªm gonna try having it pick up the libraries dynam‰Û_,4
17965,Leonard,12, What are you doing?!,4
17966,Sheldon,12, Playing the theremin.,4
17967,Leonard,12," No. I mean, what are you doing with a theremin?",4
17968,Sheldon,12," Playing it. I‰Ûªve loved the theremin from the first moment I heard the original Star Trek theme. And it‰Ûªs been killing me that it just sits in my closet, gathering dust.",4
17969,Leonard,12, Sheldon! We‰Ûªre working here!,4
17970,Sheldon,12," That‰Ûªs all right. I can barely hear you over my theremin. (Leonard pulls out plug) Well, that was a little uncalled for.",4
17971,Leonard,12," No, that was completely called for. We need quiet.",4
17972,Sheldon,12," So, your project is more important than mine?",4
17973,Leonard,12," Well, seeing as your project is to sabotage my project, yes.",4
17974,Sheldon,12," Don‰Ûªt beat around the bush, Leonard. If you don‰Ûªt want me here, just say the word, and I‰Ûªll leave.",4
17975,Scene,12, The hallway.,4
17976,Sheldon,12, Could have beaten around the bush a little.,4
17977,Scene,12, The lobby. Sheldon is playing his theramin.,4
17978,Sheldon (singing),12," Nobody knows the trouble I‰Ûªve seen, nobody knows my sorrow-ow-ow-ow.",4
17979,Penny,12, What you doing? Trying to contact your home planet?,4
17980,Sheldon,12, I‰Ûªm practicing my theremin.,4
17981,Penny,12, Oh.,4
17982,Sheldon (singing),12," Nobody knows the trouble I‰Ûªve seen. Glory, hallelujah.",4
17983,Penny,12," Something got you down, there, Sheldon?",4
17984,Sheldon,12, Leonard kicked me out of my own apartment. And his app team.,4
17985,Penny,12," Oh, honey, I‰Ûªm sorry.",4
17986,Sheldon,12, He wouldn‰Ûªt drive me to work today. I had to wear my bus pants.,4
17987,Penny,12, Is that so?,4
17988,Sheldon,12, Yes. And they‰Ûªre still sticky.,4
17989,Penny,12, Aw.,4
17990,Sheldon,12, Probably going to have to throw them away.,4
17991,Penny,12," Hey, you don‰Ûªt need Leonard and his app. You can make one with me.",4
17992,Sheldon,12, With you?,4
17993,Penny,12," Seriously, I have a great idea for one.",4
17994,Sheldon,12, Is it better than your idea to move to Los Angeles and become a famous actress?,4
17995,Penny,12," Okay, look, when you see someone wearing shoes you like, you just snap a picture of them, and the app goes on the Internet to find out where you can buy them.",4
17996,Sheldon,12, That‰Ûªs your app idea?,4
17997,Penny,12," Well, you don‰Ûªt like it?",4
17998,Sheldon,12," I didn‰Ûªt say that. But no, I don‰Ûªt.",4
17999,Penny,12, Why not?,4
18000,Sheldon,12," Oh, Penny, where do I begin? The simple-mindedness of your idea is exceeded only by its crass consumerism and banality.",4
18001,Penny,12, And Leonard didn‰Ûªt want to work with you? Imagine that.,4
18002,Sheldon,12," I know, it‰Ûªs baffling. (Singing) Nobody knows the trouble I‰Ûªve seen.",4
18003,Penny,12," Sheldon, I‰Ûªm gonna make some cocoa. Do you want some?",4
18004,Sheldon,12, Do you make it with milk or water?,4
18005,Penny,12, Milk.,4
18006,Sheldon,12, Real cocoa?,4
18007,Penny,12, That‰Ûªs what it says on the packet.,4
18008,Sheldon,12, Do you have those little marshmallows?,4
18009,Penny,12," No, sorry.",4
18010,Sheldon,12," Well, I suppose it‰Ûªs appropriate.",4
18011,Penny,12, What does that mean?,4
18012,Sheldon,12, A disappointing drink for a disappointing day.,4
18013,Scene,12, The apartment. ,4
18014,Raj,12," Hey, look at this. 20 people from the university have already signed up for our private beta.",4
18015,Leonard,12," I‰Ûªm telling you, the Lenwoloppali Differential Equation Scanner meets a real need. We‰Ûªve got a hit.",4
18016,Raj,12, What do you think we should sell it for?,4
18017,Howard,12," Well, based on the fact that our potential market is about 70 or 80 guys, and you want a submarine, I‰Ûªd say about a million dollars a pop.",4
18018,Raj,12," Well, what if we put out a lite version for half a million? You know, get the word of mouth going.",4
18019,Penny,12," Hi. I‰Ûªm sorry to bother you guys, but you‰Ûªve got to come take your Sheldon back.",4
18020,Leonard,12, What‰Ûªs he doing in your apartment?,4
18021,Penny,12," Well, he was moping down in the lobby, so I invited him over, and now I regret it.",4
18022,Leonard,12," Why do you regret, uh, never mind, stupid question.",4
18023,Penny,12," Look, can‰Ûªt you just let him play with you until bedtime?",4
18024,Leonard,12, We‰Ûªre not playing. This is real work.,4
18025,Howard,12, We‰Ûªre going to be hundred-aires.,4
18026,Penny,12, Okay. What if I got him to apologize and promise to behave?,4
18027,Leonard,12," Then I guess we would let him back on the app team, and while we‰Ûªre doing that, you could take an aerial tour of L.A. on your flying pig.",4
18028,Penny,12, Okay. Wait right here.,4
18029,Raj,12," I‰Ûªll tell you one thing. If I get rich enough, that‰Ûªs the kind of girl I want to take on a submarine ride. And yes, that time, I meant it to be dirty.",4
18030,Scene,12, Penny‰Ûªs apartment.,4
18031,Sheldon,12, Really? Leonard wants me back?,4
18032,Penny,12," Oh, yes. He says they are lost without you.",4
18033,Sheldon,12," Well, we sure saw that coming.",4
18034,Penny,12, That‰Ûªs right.,4
18035,Sheldon,12, You know what I‰Ûªm going to do? I am going to sit here and just let them stew.,4
18036,Penny,12," No, no, no. You know, they have suffered enough. Everybody‰Ûªs suffered enough. The thing is, you‰Ûªre going to have to offer him a face-saving way out of this.",4
18037,Sheldon,12, How?,4
18038,Penny,12, Say you‰Ûªre sorry.,4
18039,Sheldon,12," Oh, no. Mrs. Mary Cooper didn‰Ûªt raise her no liars.",4
18040,Penny,12," Okay. Um, how about this? You know how you‰Ûªre always trying to learn about sarcasm?",4
18041,Sheldon,12, No.,4
18042,Penny,12, No?,4
18043,Sheldon,12, I was being sarcastic.,4
18044,Penny,12," Oh. Good for you. So all you have to do here is say you‰Ûªre sorry to Leonard, but say it sarcastically.",4
18045,Sheldon,12," Of course. He will hear it as an attempt to mend fences, as opposed to the withering condemnation you and I will know it to be.",4
18046,Penny,12," Yeah. Yeah, that was my plan. All right. Come on. Let‰Ûªs go.",4
18047,Sheldon,12," Oh, by the way, thank you for the delicious cocoa.",4
18048,Penny,12," Oh, you‰Ûªre welcome.",4
18049,Sheldon,12," Boy, I‰Ûªm getting good at this.",4
18050,Scene,12, The apartment. ,4
18051,Leonard,12," Okay, now that you‰Ûªre back on the team, let‰Ûªs get you caught up.",4
18052,Sheldon,12," Before you begin, let me say again how deeply sorry I am for my earlier behaviour and how much I respect and admire your leadership.",4
18053,Leonard,12," Thank you. So as you can see, not only can you store your favourite equations, but you can forward them to your friends or post them on Facebook right from the app.",4
18054,Sheldon,12," Well, I must say, I am impressed.",4
18055,Leonard,12, Thanks.,4
18056,Sheldon,12, You all have clearly put in a lot of hard work.,4
18057,Howard,12, We have.,4
18058,Sheldon,12," As a result, you have taken the most important step on the road to success, learning what not to do. Now, let‰Ûªs start fresh. Howard, we‰Ûªre going to need some tea.",4
18059,Scene,12, Penny‰Ûªs apartment. ,4
18060,Penny,12," Okay, these are Uggs. These are Crocs. These are knockoff Manolo Blahniks.",4
18061,Sheldon,12, Bored.,4
18062,Penny,12," Look, you said it yourself, we have to create a database before you can write an alga-thingy.",4
18063,Sheldon,12," Algorithm. You see, Penny, Alan Turing defined an algorithm‰Û_",4
18064,Penny,12," Bored. Okay. These are Steve Maddens. These are Nine West. These are Target. Oh, but don‰Ûªt they look like Chanel? These are Michael Kors. These are Roxy. These are Sachel‰Ûªs. Oh, these are Betsy Johnson, they‰Ûªre so cute‰Û_",4
18065,Sheldon (singing at the same time),12," Nobody knows the trouble I‰Ûªve seen, nobody knows my sorrow‰Û_",4
18066,Scene,13, The Cheesecake Factory,4
18067,Penny,13, Hey. So you guys ready to order?,4
18068,Sheldon,13," Since we come in every Tuesday night at six o‰Ûªclock and order the same exact thing, and it‰Ûªs now six oh eight, I believe your question not only answers itself but also stands alongside such other nonsensical queries as who let the dogs out? and, uh, How are they hanging?",4
18069,Penny,13," Okay. So, the usual, with extra spit on Sheldon‰Ûªs hamburger.",4
18070,Amy,13," Penny, a moment? Do you have plans this weekend?",4
18071,Penny,13," Oh, gee, Amy, I‰Ûªm sorry, I‰Ûªm actually pretty busy this weekend.",4
18072,Sheldon,13, Probably serving food that was ordered today.,4
18073,Amy,13, That‰Ûªs too bad. I was hoping you could be my plus-one at the Institute of Interdisciplinary Studies‰Ûª symposium on the impact of current scientific research on societal interactions.,4
18074,Penny,13, The what?,4
18075,Leonard,13, It‰Ûªs an annual science conference. We‰Ûªve all been invited to speak.,4
18076,Penny,13," Oh. Oh, okay, well, you know, like I said, I have plans, so.",4
18077,Amy,13," Shame. Since you‰Ûªre my best friend, I thought it would be a good bonding opportunity.",4
18078,Penny,13, I‰Ûªm your best friend?,4
18079,Amy,13, Don‰Ûªt you read my blog?,4
18080,Penny,13," Oh, don‰Ûªt feel bad. I never read Leonard‰Ûªs, and I used to sleep with him.",4
18081,Amy,13, Do you know anybody else who would appreciate an all-expense-paid spa weekend at a four-star resort in Big Sur?,4
18082,Penny,13," No, I really, I‰Ûªm sorry, free what? Sorry, what, what?",4
18083,Leonard,13, I think her weekend just opened up.,4
18084,Penny,13," Wait, wait, just to be clear, when you guys say spa, does that mean the same thing as when regular people say it?",4
18085,Leonard,13, Pretty much. Except we keep our shirts on in the sauna.,4
18086,Penny,13," You know, it is going to be difficult, but I‰Ûªm going to cancel my plans so I can do this for my bestie.",4
18087,Amy,13, Please don‰Ûªt touch my breasts.,4
18088,Penny,13," I, I wasn‰Ûªt going to.",4
18089,Amy,13, All right. I just want to establish boundaries.,4
18090,Penny,13," Boy, this is great. I haven‰Ûªt had a vacation in ages.",4
18091,Sheldon,13," In order to take a vacation, one first has to work.",4
18092,Penny,13," You know, for a smart guy, you really seem to have a hard time grasping the concept, don‰Ûªt piss off the people who handle the things you eat.",4
18093,Amy,13, That does seem to be a valid principle.,4
18094,Sheldon,13, I trust Penny will adhere to the Official California Restaurant Workers‰Ûª Solemn Oath of Ethics and Cleanliness.‰Û,4
18095,Amy,13, I don‰Ûªt believe there‰Ûªs any such thing.,4
18096,Sheldon,13, You lied to me?,4
18097,Scene,13, The apartment.,4
18098,Sheldon,13," Good morning. If I could have everyone‰Ûªs attention, please? I know we‰Ûªre all eager to get on the road to Big Sur, so if we focus, I‰Ûªm sure we can get through this orientation in under a half an hour. Then it‰Ûªs just Q&A, quiz, safety drills, pose for commemorative group photo and we‰Ûªre off.",4
18099,Leonard,13," Don‰Ûªt worry. Just sit next to me during the quiz, and you can copy my answers.",4
18100,Sheldon,13," Raj? What are you doing? I don‰Ûªt think so. You‰Ûªve had your allotted six ounces. The first bathroom break isn‰Ûªt until the Denny‰Ûªs located near Bakersfield, which is approximately two and half hours away. Remember, people, we‰Ûªre only as strong as our weakest bladder.",4
18101,Howard (after Raj whispers to him),13, Nobody cares about your Kegel exercises.,4
18102,Sheldon,13," All right. We have seven people, and two cars. In the lead car, driven by Leonard, will be myself, Amy Farrah Fowler and Penny.",4
18103,Amy,13," Yes! He had you in the other car, but I got you upgraded.",4
18104,Penny,13, Yay!,4
18105,Sheldon,13," She made the case that if we break down in the middle of nowhere, your Nebraska backwoods skills and brawny hands will give us the best chance to survive in the wild.",4
18106,Penny,13, Brawny?,4
18107,Leonard,13, They‰Ûªre bigger than mine.,4
18108,Scene,13, Leonard‰Ûªs car. ,4
18109,Sheldon,13," Red Leader to Red Five, come in. Red Leader to Red Five, come in. Howard, you promised.",4
18110,Howard (voice),13, Fine. åÊRed Five to Red Leader. What do you want now?,4
18111,Sheldon,13, It‰Ûªs eleven fifteen. I‰Ûªm requesting your quarter-hourly location update.,4
18112,Howard,13, Still right behind you.,4
18113,Sheldon,13," Copy that, Red Five. Radio contact is sufficient. No need to extend your middle finger.",4
18114,Penny,13," So, Amy, I‰Ûªve been wondering, are you and Sheldon going to be sharing a room?",4
18115,Amy,13," No, we discussed it. We decided we didn‰Ûªt want to jeopardize our relationship by getting to know each other too well.",4
18116,Sheldon,13, Indeed. Nothing sours a friendship more than over-familiarity with someone‰Ûªs toilet routine.,4
18117,Leonard,13, I can vouch for that.,4
18118,Penny,13, Hey.,4
18119,Leonard,13," Not you, him.",4
18120,Penny,13, Oh. Thanks.,4
18121,Leonard,13, Although yours was an eye-opener.,4
18122,Amy,13," Don‰Ûªt worry, Penny. You‰Ûªre my plus-one. You‰Ûªll bunk with me. And FYI, travel makes me constipated, so I‰Ûªm the ideal hotel roommate.",4
18123,Penny,13, Terrific. Are we there yet?,4
18124,Scene,13, Bernadette‰Ûªs car. ,4
18125,Bernadette,13, I hope we get there in time to see the keynote address.,4
18126,Howard,13, Really? You want to see the keynote?,4
18127,Howard,13," Actually, I was thinking we could go straight to the room and take a nap.",4
18128,Bernadette,13, Really? And miss the keynote?,4
18129,Howard,13," We can watch it later on C-SPAN. Besides, I was really looking forward to you and me napping together in the hotel.",4
18130,Bernadette,13," Well honey, if you‰Ûªre that tired, why don‰Ûªt you just take a nap here in the car?",4
18131,Howard,13," No, see, it‰Ûªs not‰Û_",4
18132,Bernadette,13," Hang on. It‰Ûªs Leonard. Hi, Leonard.",4
18133,Leonard (voice),13," Yeah, hi. Listen, I just got a text from Raj. He wanted me to tell you that when Howard says nap, he means sex.",4
18134,Bernadette,13," Oh. Thank you, Raj.",4
18135,Scene,13, Leonard‰Ûªs car. ,4
18136,Leonard,13, Are you an element in the actinoid series?,4
18137,Sheldon,13, No. Amy?,4
18138,Amy,13, Are you usually radioactive when found in nature?,4
18139,Sheldon,13, No.,4
18140,Amy,13, Are you in the lanthanoid series?,4
18141,Sheldon,13," Amy, it‰Ûªs Penny‰Ûªs turn. Penny?",4
18142,Penny,13," Uh, I don‰Ûªt know. Are you food?",4
18143,Sheldon,13, That‰Ûªs not apropos. We‰Ûªve already established I‰Ûªm found in the periodic table.,4
18144,Penny,13," Well, it‰Ûªs a table, right? I mean, why can‰Ûªt there be food on it?",4
18145,Sheldon,13, I knew she wasn‰Ûªt lead car material.,4
18146,Penny,13, Who elected you Road Trip God?,4
18147,Sheldon,13, Leonard.,4
18148,Leonard,13," It was a late-night vote. We were all exhausted, and he was threatening to filibuster. It‰Ûªs not technically Road Trip God, it‰Ûªs Travel Supervisor.",4
18149,Sheldon,13, Although Road Trip God does have a certain ring to it.,4
18150,Penny,13, I don‰Ûªt understand why you people just let him bully you like this. Someone should stand up to him. What‰Ûªs he going to do?,4
18151,Scene,13, Bernadette‰Ûªs car. ,4
18152,Penny,13, I can‰Ûªt believe you let him kick me out of the car.,4
18153,Howard,13, What could we do? He‰Ûªs the Travel Supervisor.,4
18154,Bernadette,13," Don‰Ûªt worry, Penny. This is a better car anyway.",4
18155,Howard,13, Yeah. It‰Ûªs the Love Car.,4
18156,Penny,13, Should I ask?,4
18157,Bernadette (singing),13," They say we‰Ûªre young and we don‰Ûªt know, we won‰Ûªt find out until we grow.",4
18158,Howard (singing),13," Well, I don‰Ûªt know if all that‰Ûªs true, ‰Ûªcause you got me, and, baby, I got you.",4
18159,Together (singing),13," Babe, mm da-da, da-da, da-da, I got you, babe, da-da, da-da, da-da, I got you, babe‰Û_",4
18160,Penny,13," Red Leader, I‰Ûªm really sorry.",4
18161,Scene,13, The hotel. ,4
18162,Howard and Bernadette (singing),13," I got you, babe.",4
18163,Amy,13, I missed you.,4
18164,Penny,13," You know what? I missed you, too.",4
18165,Very tall and powerfully built man,13, Bernadette?,4
18166,Bernadette,13," Oh, my God, Glenn!",4
18167,Glenn,13, Great to see you!,4
18168,Bernadette,13, Are you here for the conference?,4
18169,Glenn,13," Yeah, I‰Ûªm doing a global warming panel.",4
18170,Bernadette,13," Oh, good for you. Uh, Glenn, this is my boyfriend Howard.",4
18171,Glenn,13, Oh. Nice to meet you.,4
18172,Howard,13, Hi. Ow. Hi.,4
18173,Glenn,13, You‰Ûªre a lucky man. Bernie‰Ûªs a great gal.,4
18174,Howard,13, Yes. Bernie sure is.,4
18175,Bernadette,13, I‰Ûªll try to catch it.,4
18176,Glenn,13," Oh, great. Bye.",4
18177,Bernadette,13, Bye.,4
18178,Howard,13," Hey, Bernie?",4
18179,Bernadette,13, Yeah?,4
18180,Howard,13, Please tell me he‰Ûªs your gay cousin.,4
18181,Bernadette,13, No. He was one of my professors in college.,4
18182,Howard,13, Oh! That‰Ûªs a relief.,4
18183,Bernadette,13," Then we went out for a year. Come on, let‰Ûªs check in, so we can take that nap.",4
18184,Howard (after Raj whispers to him),13," No, it‰Ûªs not necessarily proportional. Shut up!",4
18185,Scene,13, Howard‰Ûªs hotel room.,4
18186,Howard,13," That green bag is Dr. Cooper‰Ûªs. Here‰Ûªs an extra five. Make him wait. Oh. Right to the nap, huh? Okay? Uh, so, this Glenn guy. You say you went out with him for, like, a year.",4
18187,Bernadette,13, Do we really need to talk about my old boyfriend now?,4
18188,Howard,13," No. I guess not. What is he, like, six-four, six-five?",4
18189,Bernadette,13, Six-seven.,4
18190,Howard,13, Probably has a hard time finding a suit that fits.,4
18191,Bernadette,13, Is something bothering you?,4
18192,Howard,13, No. It‰Ûªs just‰Û_,4
18193,Bernadette,13, What?,4
18194,Howard,13," I‰Ûªm just thinking. If you had sex with that guy, I mean, there‰Ûªs nothing I can do here that will make any kind of impact.",4
18195,Bernadette,13," Howard, it‰Ûªs not a contest. I love you. I want to be with you.",4
18196,Howard,13," Yeah, great, love you, too, but, if it were a contest, I wouldn‰Ûªt have a chance, right?",4
18197,Bernadette,13, You can‰Ûªt think that way.,4
18198,Howard,13, Yep. Loser.,4
18199,Bernadette,13," Howard, stop it.",4
18200,Howard,13, Sorry. I just never figured that a guy like me going out with a girl like you would ever have to compete with a guy like that.,4
18201,Bernadette,13," Wait a minute, a girl like me? What‰Ûªs that mean?",4
18202,Howard,13, I‰Ûªm‰Û_ I‰Û_,4
18203,Bernadette,13, Are you saying you don‰Ûªt think I‰Ûªm hot enough to go out with a guy like Glenn?,4
18204,Howard,13," No! No, I‰Ûªm saying exactly the opposite.",4
18205,Bernadette,13, I‰Ûªm too hot to go out with a guy like Glenn?,4
18206,Howard,13," Yeah, let‰Ûªs go with that.",4
18207,Scene,13, Amy‰Ûªs hotel room.,4
18208,Amy (exiting bathroom),13, Still nothing. Remind me to try again in an hour.,4
18209,Penny,13, Will do.,4
18210,Amy,13," So, girl talk?",4
18211,Penny,13," Um, sure. What do you, what do you got in mind?",4
18212,Amy,13, Do you subscribe to the Freudian theory of penis envy?,4
18213,Penny,13," Um, I never really thought about it. Why?",4
18214,Amy,13, Sometimes I think it might be nice to have one.,4
18215,Penny,13, Really?,4
18216,Amy,13," Not for sex, for convenience. You can‰Ûªt deny that, by comparison, our internal plumbing is extremely high maintenance.",4
18217,Penny,13," Again, I‰Ûªve never given it much thought.",4
18218,Amy,13, We have time now. Think about it.,4
18219,Penny (knock on door),13," Oh, good. Hey.",4
18220,Bernadette,13, Can I stay here tonight?,4
18221,Penny,13," Yeah. Why, what happened?",4
18222,Bernadette,13, Howard‰Ûªs a complete and total ass.,4
18223,Penny,13," Oh, yeah, that. Come on in.",4
18224,Bernadette,13, Thanks. I‰Ûªll sleep on the floor.,4
18225,Amy,13, Not necessary. Penny and I are perfectly comfortable sharing a bed.,4
18226,Penny,13, We are?,4
18227,Amy,13," Of course, we‰Ûªre best friends.",4
18228,Penny,13," Oh, right, right, the blog.",4
18229,Amy,13," Word of warning, though. I‰Ûªm prone to night terrors, so if I wake up kicking and screaming, don‰Ûªt panic. Just pin me down and stroke my hair, and I‰Ûªll be fine.",4
18230,Scene,13, Leonard‰Ûªs room. ,4
18231,Penny,13," Hey, can I stay here tonight?",4
18232,Leonard,13, Shh-shh-shh-shh. Sheldon‰Ûªs asleep. What‰Ûªs going on?,4
18233,Penny,13," Well, Howard‰Ûªs a complete and total ass, Bernadette‰Ûªs in my bed, and no matter how much you stroke Amy‰Ûªs hair, she bites.",4
18234,Leonard,13, What?,4
18235,Penny,13, Never mind. Can I stay here or not?,4
18236,Leonard,13," Uh, sure.",4
18237,Penny,13, All right.,4
18238,Leonard,13," So, how do you wanna do this?",4
18239,Penny,13," Well, I‰Ûªm not getting in bed with him.",4
18240,Leonard,13," Yeah, it is a little like getting into Dracula‰Ûªs coffin.",4
18241,Penny,13, We‰Ûªre just gonna have to make the best of this.,4
18242,Leonard,13," Okay, when you say make the best of it.",4
18243,Penny,13, Sleep.,4
18244,Leonard,13, Right. So we‰Ûªll just call the middle here the Neutral Zone.,4
18245,Penny,13, The what?,4
18246,Leonard,13," Star Trek. You know, the Neutral Zone between the Federation and the Romulan Empire.",4
18247,Penny,13," Oh, okay. Just like old times.",4
18248,Leonard,13," Of course, sometimes the Federation and the Romulans would enter the Neutral Zone to negotiate a temporary truce.",4
18249,Penny,13," Sweetie, let me put this in a way you‰Ûªll understand. From the waist down, my shields are up.",4
18250,Leonard,13," Got it, got it. We can do all kinds of stuff from the waist up, you know?",4
18251,Penny,13, Go to sleep.,4
18252,Leonard,13, Good night.,4
18253,Sheldon,13, Please tell me you‰Ûªre not having coitus.,4
18254,Penny,13, We are not having coitus.,4
18255,Sheldon,13, Can you guarantee that it won‰Ûªt happen at any time during the night?,4
18256,Penny,13, Yes.,4
18257,Leonard,13, No.,4

18262,Raj,13, Why?,4
18263,Sheldon,13," Howard is a complete and total ass, Bernadette is in Penny‰Ûªs bed, Amy bites, and Penny may or may not have coitus with Leonard.",4
18264,Raj,13, Okay. Come on in.,4
18265,Scene,13, Leonard‰Ûªs room. ,4
18266,Penny,13," Leonard, are you asleep?",4
18267,Leonard,13, No.,4
18268,Penny,13, I really appreciate you letting me stay here tonight.,4
18269,Leonard,13," Sure, no problem.",4
18270,Penny,13, I know it‰Ûªs kinda weird.,4
18271,Leonard,13, True dat.,4
18272,Penny,13, True dat?,4
18273,Leonard,13, I‰Ûªve gotten a lot more street since we broke up.,4
18274,Penny,13, Right. Still mad at me about that?,4
18275,Leonard,13," No. No, I understand. I got too intense, you had to back off.",4
18276,Penny,13, Thank you.,4
18277,Leonard,13," I‰Ûªve gotten a lot better at that, you know. I‰Ûªve dated four different women since we broke up and I didn‰Ûªt tell any of them that I loved them and wanted to have their babies.",4
18278,Penny,13, Good for you.,4
18279,Leonard,13," Okay, good night.",4
18280,Penny,13," Good night. You know, maybe it wouldn‰Ûªt be the worst idea in the world to violate the Neutral Zone for just one night. Oh!",4
18281,Raj,13," Hey, Leonard, Sheldon kicked me out of the room, gave me your key.",4
18282,Leonard,13," Penny‰Ûªs here. (Raj whispers to him) No, we don‰Ûªt want to watch Bridget Jones‰Ûªs Diary!",4
18283,Scene,13, A conference room.,4
18284,Sheldon,13," Good morning and welcome to Science and Society. I‰Ûªm Dr. Sheldon Cooper, BS, MS, MA, PhD, and ScD. OMG, right? Perhaps that joke was a little too hippie-dippy for this crowd. All right then, we‰Ûªll begin with opening remarks. Miss Rostenkowski, would you like to start us off by discussing your assessment of science‰Ûªs responsibility to society?",4
18285,Bernadette,13," Sure. I think all branches of science have to move cautiously these days. It‰Ûªs not just giant nuclear weapons that can destroy the world. As a microbiologist, I can tell you even the tiniest organisms can still tear you a new one.",4
18286,Howard,13," Interesting. I think what you might need to know about my colleague is that though she claims her field of intereståÊ is tiny organisms, she certainly has spent her fair share of time around what we can assume was pretty massive weaponry.",4
18287,Bernadette,13, I think Mr. Wolowitz needs to keep in mind that the past is the past. But he should know that I am the kind of girl who could get all the giant missiles she wants.,4
18288,Amy,13, Are we talking about women wanting penises? Because I‰Ûªd like to weigh in.,4
18289,Sheldon,13," Dr. Koothrappali, would you care to join the conversation?",4
18290,Raj,13," Certainly. I‰Ûªd like to raise two points. Number one, I think they are talking about penises. And number two, these mimosas are kicking my little brown ass.",4
18291,Leonard,13, I‰Ûªd like to kick your little brown ass.,4
18292,Raj,13, What did I do?,4
18293,Leonard,13," Oh, I don‰Ûªt know. Maybe when you walk into a hotel room and you see a guy getting back together with his girlfriend, you should consider doing something other than crawling into the adjoining bed.",4
18294,Raj,13, I did. You said no Bridget Jones.,4
18295,Penny (voice),13, We weren‰Ûªt getting back together! It was a one-time thing!,4
18296,Sheldon,13, Excuse me. We‰Ûªre not taking comments or questions from the audience just yet.,4
18297,Penny(voice),13," Oh, shut up, Sheldon!",4
18298,Amy,13," Hi, bestie.",4
18299,Penny(voice),13," Yeah, hi.",4
18300,Sheldon,13," All right, why don‰Ûªt we see if we can bring this back to topic.",4
18301,Howard,13," Let me ask you something, Bernie.",4
18302,Sheldon,13, I guess not.,4
18303,Howard,13, How would you feel if you met my ex-girlfriend and she was like Angelina Jolie?,4
18304,Bernadette,13," Oh, come on, Howard, be realistic.",4
18305,Howard,13," What, I‰Ûªm not hot enough for Angelina Jolie?",4
18306,Raj,13, I‰Ûªd like to weigh in here. No.,4
18307,Sheldon,13," All right, why don‰Ûªt we open it up to Q&A from the audience?",4
18308,Penny (voice),13," Yeah, I have a question. Is there anybody who can get me the hell out of here and back to Los Angeles tonight?",4
18309,Glenn (voice),13, I‰Ûªm driving back to L.A. tonight.,4
18310,Bernadette,13," Um, Penny, that‰Ûªs Glenn. Glenn, that‰Ûªs Penny.",4
18311,Leonard,13, No!,4

18315,Sheldon,13, Must be out of range.,4
18316,Amy,13," Leonard, can I ask you a question?",4
18317,Leonard,13, Sure.,4
18318,Amy,13, Are you bothered by the fact that your former girlfriend left the symposium with what is probably the most beautiful man I‰Ûªve ever seen in my life?,4
18319,Leonard,13, No. Why do you ask?,4
18320,Amy,13, Because we‰Ûªre going 120 miles per hour.,4
18321,Sheldon,13," All right, if no one‰Ûªs going to guess, I was spying the aluminium rims on the police car we passed a few miles back.",4
18322,Scene,14, A lecture hall.,4
18323,Sheldon,14," Good evening. I‰Ûªm your guest lecturer, Dr. Sheldon Cooper. I was expecting applause, but I suppose stunned silence is equally appropriate. I agreed to speak to you this evening, because I was told that you‰Ûªre the best and the brightest of this university‰Ûªs doctoral candidates. Hmm. Of course, that‰Ûªs like saying you are the most important electron in a hydrogen atom. ‰Û÷Cause, you see, there‰Ûªs only one electron in a hydrogen atom. Best and brightest, my sweet patootie. All right, let‰Ûªs begin. Show of hands, who here is familiar with the concept of topological insulators? Don‰Ûªt kid yourselves.",4
18324,Scene,14, The apartment.,4
18325,Leonard,14," I found another tweet from a student at Sheldon‰Ûªs lecture. Dr. Cooper has taken a relatively boring subject and managed to make it completely insufferable. Plus, he looks like a giant insect.",4
18326,Howard,14," Look. Listen to this one. Does Einstein‰Ûªs theory explain why time flies when you‰Ûªre having fun, but when you‰Ûªre listening to Dr. Cooper, it falls out of the sky, dead?",4
18327,Raj,14," Ooh, somebody took pictures and uploaded them to their Flickr account.",4
18328,Leonard,14, Wow. How do you get an entire lecture hall to flip you off at the same time?,4
18329,Howard,14," Apparently, if you‰Ûªre Sheldon, all you need to do is turn your back.",4
18330,Penny,14," Hey, Leonard, is your wi-fi down? I can‰Ûªt get on.",4
18331,Leonard,14," Oh, Sheldon changed the password. It‰Ûªs now Penny is a freeloader. No spaces.",4
18332,Penny,14, Thanks. What are you guys doing?,4
18333,Leonard,14, Sheldon gave a lecture at the university tonight. We‰Ûªre reading the reviews.,4
18334,Penny,14, Oh. How‰Ûªd he do?,4
18335,Howard,14," Well, picture the Hindenburg meets Chernobyl meets Three Mile Island meets Tron 2.",4
18336,Penny,14," That bad, huh?",4
18337,Leonard,14, Read this woman‰Ûªs tweet.,4
18338,Penny,14, Listening to Dr. Cooper has made me want to start cutting myself again,4
18339,Leonard,14, Yeah.,4
18340,Sheldon,14," Good evening, Leonard, Howard, Raj, freeloader.",4
18341,Howard,14," So, how‰Ûªd the lecture go?",4
18342,Leonard,14," In a word, triumphant.",4
18343,Leonard,14, Really? Triumphant?,4
18344,Sheldon,14," Oh, yes, you should have seen those young people. Thirsty for knowledge, drinking in my wisdom. I may have changed a few lives today.",4
18345,Penny,14," Oh, please let me tell him.",4
18346,Leonard,14," I don‰Ûªt know, I kind of promised Howard.",4
18347,Sheldon,14, Tell me what?,4
18348,Howard,14," Actually, we should all share the moment. Raj, if you would.",4
18349,Sheldon,14," Oh, tweets about my lecture. Hmm. That‰Ûªs rather unfair. That‰Ûªs downright cruel. Plus, insects have six legs. Yeah, I‰Ûªm not familiar with the acronym KMN.",4
18350,Leonard,14," Oh, uh, from the context, we think it means kill me now.",4
18351,Sheldon,14," Well, I suppose everyone‰Ûªs entitled to their own opinion. I think I‰Ûªll turn in. I didn‰Ûªt want to teach those poopy heads, anyway.",4
18352,Howard,14," FYI, I think that‰Ûªs what Darth Vader said just before he started building the Death Star.",4
18353,Scene,14, The Cheesecake Factory,4
18354,Howard,14, Sheldon still moping?,4
18355,Leonard,14," Yeah, it‰Ûªs weird. Even though he didn‰Ûªt want to give the lecture in the first place, being rejected by those students really hit him hard.",4
18356,Raj,14," Mmm, I know the feeling. It‰Ûªs like accidentally walking into a gay bar and then having no one hit on you. It-It happened to a friend of mine.",4
18357,Bernadette,14, Are you guys doing okay?,4
18358,Howard,14," Yeah, Leonard and I are fine, but I think Raj needs to meet a girl really soon.",4
18359,Bernadette,14," Well, that shouldn‰Ûªt be too hard. He‰Ûªs such a cutie.",4
18360,Raj,14," Thank you, but cute is for bunnies. I want to be something with sex appeal, like, like a labradoodle.",4
18361,Howard,14, Labradoodle?,4
18362,Leonard,14, We might be starting to zero in on your problem.,4
18363,Bernadette,14, Don‰Ûªt you listen to them. You‰Ûªve got plenty of sex appeal.,4
18364,Raj,14, You really think so?,4
18365,Bernadette,14, Yeah. You‰Ûªre a hottie.,4
18366,Raj,14," Well, thanks, Bernadette. And just for the record, labradoodles are hypo-allergenic, which is a very sexy quality to those troubled by animal dander.",4
18367,Scene,14, The apartment.,4
18368,"Amy (on webcam, with an undersea background)",14," So, what do you think?",4
18369,Sheldon,14," It‰Ûªs a charming illusion, but it does not cheer me up.",4
18370,Amy,14, Not even when I do this? (Pretends to be a fish),4
18371,Sheldon,14, No.,4
18372,Amy,14," Well, that was the last arrow in my quiver of whimsy.",4
18373,Sheldon,14, Do you realize that teaching is the first thing I‰Ûªve failed at since my ill-fated attempt to complete a chin-up in March of 1989?,4
18374,Amy,14," If this humiliating experience is really troubling you, there are things we could do about it.",4
18375,Sheldon,14, For instance?,4
18376,Amy,14," Well, the first thing that comes to mind is isolating the part of your brain where the memory is stored and destroying it with a laser.",4
18377,Sheldon,14," Hmm, no. One slip of the hand, and suddenly I‰Ûªm sitting in the Engineering Department, building doodads with Wolowitz.",4
18378,Amy,14," All right. Have you considered improving your socialization skills, thus allowing you to communicate more effectively with other people?",4
18379,Sheldon,14, Isn‰Ûªt that their burden? I‰Ûªm the one with something interesting to say.,4
18380,Amy,14," Fair enough, but in its essence, teaching is a performance art. In the classroom paradigm, the teacher has the responsibility to communicate, as well as entertain and engage.",4
18381,Sheldon,14, I sense that you‰Ûªre trying to slow-walk me to an epiphany. Would you mind very much jumping to it?,4
18382,Amy,14, Perhaps you should consider taking acting lessons.,4
18383,Sheldon,14, Acting lessons. Interesting. It might help if I could act as though I care about my students and whether or not they learn.,4
18384,Scene,14, Penny‰Ûªs apartment door.,4
18385,Sheldon,14," (Knock, knock, knock) Penny. (Knock, knock, knock) Penny. (Knock, knock, knock) Penny.",4
18386,Penny,14, What?,4
18387,Sheldon,14," You‰Ûªre an (finger quotes) actress, correct?",4
18388,Penny,14, I‰Ûªm not an (finger quotes)actress. I‰Ûªm an actress.,4
18389,Sheldon,14, All right. You‰Ûªre an actress. I need you to teach me.,4
18390,Penny,14, You want an acting lesson?,4
18391,Sheldon,14, Perhaps two. I‰Ûªd like to master the craft.,4
18392,Penny,14," Okay, where is this coming from?",4
18393,Sheldon,14," It has been suggested to me that acting techniques could improve my lecturing, at which, if certain tweets and blogs are to be believed, I suck the big one.",4
18394,Penny,14," Yeah, I saw those. They were funny. I printed a few out and put ‰Ûªem on my fridge.",4
18395,Sheldon,14," So, when could we start?",4
18396,Penny,14," Okay, just to be clear. You are asking me for help because I know something that the brilliant Dr. Sheldon Cooper doesn‰Ûªt.",4
18397,Sheldon,14, I suppose that‰Ûªs one way to look at it.,4
18398,Penny,14, I think it‰Ûªs the only way to look at it.,4
18399,Sheldon,14, Are you going to help me or not?,4
18400,Penny,14, Probably. I‰Ûªm just enjoying the foreplay. Does this mean you are done mocking my acting career?,4
18401,Sheldon,14," Oh, I‰Ûªm sorry, I thought making the transition from actor to acting teacher was the signal that one‰Ûªs career had reached the end of the road.",4
18402,Penny,14, Forget it.,4
18403,Sheldon,14, I‰Ûªll pay you 40 dollars.,4
18404,Penny,14," Saturday, nine a.m. Bring cash.",4
18405,Scene,14, The university cafeteria,4
18406,Howard,14," Raj, I have amazing news!",4
18407,Raj,14, What?,4
18408,Howard,14, I just got offered a fellowship at the Weitzmann Institute in Israel.,4
18409,Raj,14," Dude, that‰Ûªs incredible!",4
18410,Howard,14," I know. The only thing is, I‰Ûªm gonna be gone for two years.",4
18411,Raj,14," Aw, I‰Ûªm gonna miss you. Are you going with him?",4
18412,Bernadette,14, I have to stay here for school.,4
18413,Howard,14," That‰Ûªs what we‰Ûªre here to talk to you about. You see, Bernadette has needs.",4
18414,Raj,14, What kind of needs?,4
18415,Howard,14, Sexual needs.,4
18416,Bernadette,14," Most of them regular, some of them kind of messed up.",4
18417,Howard,14," So, while I‰Ûªm gone, you‰Ûªre going to have to satisfy her.",4
18418,Bernadette,14, What do you say?,4
18419,Raj,14, I say okey-dokey.,4
18420,Howard (to the real Raj who is daydreaming),14, What ya thinking so hard about?,4
18421,Raj,14, Just that I‰Ûªm definitely not gay.,4
18422,Scene,14, Penny‰Ûªs apartment. ,4
18423,Sheldon,14," (Knock, knock, knock) Penny. (Knock, knock, knock) Penny. (Knock, knock, knock) Penny.",4
18424,Penny,14, What‰Ûªs wrong?,4
18425,Sheldon,14, Nothing. I was acting.,4
18426,Penny,14, You were acting?,4
18427,Sheldon,14," Yes. In preparation for today‰Ûªs studies, I read Stanislavski‰Ûªs An Actor Prepares, Stella Adler‰Ûªs",4
18428,Penny,14," Well, good for you. Come on in.",4
18429,Sheldon,14, How shall we begin?,4
18430,Penny,14," Well, I thought we‰Ûªd start with some basic movement exercises. You know, get our bodies warmed up a little.",4
18431,Sheldon,14, All right.,4
18432,Penny,14," So I just want you to relax and kind of move around in the space. You know, just do whatever feels natural. Sheldon?",4
18433,Sheldon (doing nothing),14, You said to do whatever feels natural. This feels natural. Certainly more natural than what you‰Ûªre doing.,4
18434,Penny,14," Come on, you got to work with me. We need to get connected with our bodies.",4
18435,Sheldon,14," Penny, my body and I have a relationship that works best when we maintain a cool, wary distance from each other.",4
18436,Penny,14," All right, let‰Ûªs just say we‰Ûªve warmed up.",4
18437,Sheldon,14, You‰Ûªre the teacher.,4
18438,Penny,14, Okay. One of the things that might help you in connecting with your students is being a little more spontaneous. So why don‰Ûªt we try some improvisation?,4
18439,Sheldon,14, Why not? It seems like you‰Ûªre improvising your entire curriculum.,4
18440,Penny,14, This is all about listening and responding.,4
18441,Sheldon,14, Gotcha.,4
18442,Penny,14," I‰Ûªm going to create a character and a situation, and you just jump in when you feel it.",4
18443,Sheldon,14, All right.,4
18444,Penny,14, All right.,4
18445,Sheldon,14, Action.,4
18446,Penny,14," Okay, it‰Ûªs not a movie. It‰Ûªs improv. So no one calls action.",4
18447,Sheldon,14," Hey, you taught me something. Who would have thought it?",4
18448,Penny,14," Okay. Uh, no, the shipment has not arrived, and I really need those shoes. They are my biggest seller. Yes, ladies sizes six through ten. Thank you. Oh, sorry, I have to go, I have a customer. Bye-bye. Hi. Can I help you?",4
18449,Sheldon,14," I‰Ûªd like a frozen yogurt, please.",4
18450,Penny,14, Yogurt?,4
18451,Sheldon,14, Yeah.,4
18452,Penny,14," Um, okay, sure. Luckily, we sell both shoes and yogurt here.",4
18453,Sheldon,14, You do?,4
18454,Penny,14," Yes. Look up at the sign, and remember, improv is always about saying yes.",4
18455,Sheldon,14, All right. Yes. I see a sign. It says Camarillo State Mental Hospital.,4
18456,Penny,14, What?,4
18457,Sheldon,14, It‰Ûªs the only explanation I can come up with for why you think you sell shoes and yogurt.,4
18458,Penny,14," Okay, you know what? Let‰Ûªs just try a different improv. Uh, oh, this time we will be two winos living under a freeway overpass.",4
18459,Sheldon,14," Oh, and we‰Ûªre going to use props?",4
18460,Penny,14," You bet. I had dreams, you know. I was gonna be famous. Show everybody back home I could be someone. Now look at me. Want some?",4
18461,Sheldon,14, You have any frozen yogurt?,4
18462,Scene,14, The apartment.,4
18463,Leonard,14, I‰Ûªm still not adjusted to how the SyFy channel spells their name now. S-Y-F-Y. That‰Ûªs siffy.,4
18464,Raj,14, Uh-huh.,4
18465,Leonard (phone rings),14," Hello? Oh, my God! Is he okay?",4
18466,Raj,14, What happened?,4
18467,Leonard,14," Hang on. Hang on. Uh-huh. Okay, thank you. Howard was on his scooter, and got hit by a truck. He‰Ûªs in critical condition.",4
18468,Raj,14," Oh, no!",4
18469,Bernadette,14, Did you hear? Isn‰Ûªt it terrible?,4
18470,Leonard,14, Have you seen him?,4
18471,Bernadette,14, They wouldn‰Ûªt let me in. Oh my Howie.,4
18472,Leonard,14, It‰Ûªll be okay. It‰Ûªll be okay.,4
18473,Raj,14," It‰Ûªll be okay. It‰Ûªll be okay. (Phone rings) It‰Ûªs Howard. Howard, hello.",4
18474,Howard,14," Raj, is that you?",4
18475,Raj,14," Yeah, I‰Ûªm right here, buddy. How are you?",4
18476,Howard,14," Shh, shh. Listen to me. I‰Ûªm not gonna make it.",4
18477,Raj,14," No, no, no, don‰Ûªt say that. You‰Ûªre going to be all right.",4
18478,Howard,14," Raj, I don‰Ûªt have time. Now, pay attention. My last wish is that you look after Bernadette.",4
18479,Raj,14," Of course, of course. Now when you say look after, you mean‰Û_",4
18480,Bernadette,14, Sexually.,4
18481,Raj,14," Excuse me, Bernadette. I have to hear it from him.",4
18482,Howard,14, Sexually.,4
18483,Raj,14," Got it. Take care. I guess I have no choice but to make sweet, guilt-free love to you over and over again for the rest of my life.",4
18484,Bernadette,14, That‰Ûªs how I heard it.,4
18485,Leonard (out of Raj‰Ûªs daydream),14, Or it could be sy-fee.,4
18486,Raj,14, What?,4
18487,Leonard,14, S-Y-F-Y. Sy-fee.,4
18488,Raj,14," Oh, right. Good one.",4
18489,Scene,14, Penny‰Ûªs apartment. ,4
18490,Penny,14," So, did you get a chance to go over the scene I gave you?",4
18491,Sheldon,14, Yes. I didn‰Ûªt care for it.,4
18492,Penny,14," Okay, Cat on a Hot Tin Roof is an American classic.",4
18493,Sheldon,14," So is the McRib sandwich. I don‰Ûªt care for that, either.",4
18494,Penny,14, Fine. What would you rather do as a scene study?,4
18495,Sheldon,14, I‰Ûªm glad you asked. I took the liberty of adapting a Star Trek fan fiction novella I wrote when I was ten into a one-act play.,4
18496,Penny,14, And you think it‰Ûªs better than Tennessee Williams?,4
18497,Sheldon,14, Why don‰Ûªt we leave that for future generations to decide?,4
18498,Penny,14, Where No Sheldon Has Gone Before.,4
18499,Sheldon,14," It‰Ûªs the story of a young boy who is transported from the ignorant backwoods of East Texas to the 23rd Century, where his genius is not only appreciated, but celebrated.",4
18500,Penny,14, KMN.,4
18501,Sheldon,14," Now, in this pivotal scene, Sheldon‰Ûªs mother, played by you, argues with an emissary of the United Federation of Planets, Mr. Spock, the role I will bring to life.",4
18502,Penny,14," Okay, that‰Ûªs fine, but let‰Ûªs try and get you out of your comfort zone.",4
18503,Sheldon,14, Why would we want to do that? It‰Ûªs called the comfort zone for a reason.,4
18504,Penny,14," Okay, the whole point of this is to loosen you up a little, so I‰Ûªm thinking you‰Ûªll play the role of your mother, and I will bring life to Mr. Spock.",4
18505,Sheldon,14, I‰Ûªm sorry. You‰Ûªll be Spock?,4
18506,Penny,14, It‰Ûªs only logical.,4
18507,Sheldon,14, Very well. I‰Ûªll set the scene.,4
18508,Penny,14, All right.,4
18509,Sheldon,14," East Texas. A warm summer night. A woman, Mary, stands on a porch. In the distance, we hear a lonesome train whistle. Woo-woo. The droning buzz of cicadas. Zzzzzzzzz. A coyote howls at the moon, frightening sensitive young boys everywhere. Aw-aw-aw! Out in the woods, an owl screeches.",4
18510,Penny,14," Okay, okay. We get it. You set the scene.",4
18511,Sheldon,14, Hoo!,4
18512,Penny,14, Now just read your mother‰Ûªs line.,4
18513,Sheldon,14," Shelly! Shelly, how many times have I told you not to leave your sciencey stuff out on the porch? Goodness, I‰Ûªll never understand that boy. But then again, I‰Ûªm a religious nut, and my mind is closed to so many things.",4
18514,Penny,14, Woo-woo-woo-woo-woo-woo. Spock to Enterprise. Transport successful.,4
18515,Sheldon,14," Glory be to Heaven, some sort of creature just manifested out of thin air. George, put down that Pepsi can full of bourbon that ain‰Ûªt foolin‰Ûª no one, and get your shotgun!",4
18516,Penny,14," Greetings, Mary Cooper. I am Spock.",4
18517,Sheldon,14, I‰Ûªm sorry. I just don‰Ûªt buy it.,4
18518,Penny,14, Just keep going!,4
18519,Sheldon,14," Oh, my, your sudden appearance startles me.",4
18520,Penny,14," We have been monitoring your son Sheldon from the 23rd Century, and we have determined that he is now ready to join us. His unique genius is our best hope for bringing peace to a vast and troubled galaxy.",4
18521,Sheldon,14," I understand. Oh, Shelly? A man‰Ûªs here to take you away to the future! Be sure to pack clean underwear.‰Û",4
18522,Penny,14," Okay, okay, let‰Ûªs try that last line again, and this time, maybe try choking up a little.",4
18523,Sheldon,14, Why?,4
18524,Penny,14," Well, you‰Ûªre losing your son.",4
18525,Sheldon,14," Yes, but he‰Ûªs going to a better place where he won‰Ûªt get beat up. So much.",4
18526,Penny,14," All right, come on, just try it my way. Pretend you‰Ûªre sad to see him go. I‰Ûªm gonna lead you in. His unique genius is our best hope for bringing peace to a vast and troubled galaxy. That‰Ûªs your cue.",4
18527,Sheldon,14, I‰Ûªm sorry. I just love that line. Even the way you do it.,4
18528,Penny,14," All right, come on, come on. Put some real emotion into it. Blah-blah, blah, blah, vast and troubled galaxy. Go.",4
18529,Sheldon,14," Oh, Shelly? A man‰Ûªs here to take you away to the future. Be sure to pack clean underwear.",4
18530,Penny,14, That‰Ûªs good. That‰Ûªs good. That‰Ûªs good.,4
18531,Sheldon,14," Mommy, why are you crying? ‰Û÷Cause I‰Ûªm gonna miss you, Shelly-bean, even though you creep the bejeezus out of me.",4
18532,Penny,14," Okay, I guess we‰Ûªre improvising now.",4
18533,Sheldon,14," Well I‰Ûªm sorry. It‰Ûªs not my fault. I‰Ûªm just incredibly smart, and everyone around here is dumber than a bag of rocks. Oh, now, don‰Ûªt you start crying. You get in that spaceship. Mommy‰Ûªs late for Indian bingo.",4
18534,Penny (on phone),14," Mrs. Cooper, hey, it‰Ûªs Penny. Yeah, I think I broke your son. Hey, hold on. Talk to your mother.",4
18535,Sheldon,14," Mommy, I love you. Don‰Ûªt let Spock take me to the future!",4
18536,Scene,14, The cafeteria. ,4
18537,Bernadette,14," Okay, Raj, I know you‰Ûªve been avoiding me and Howard, and I‰Ûªm not leaving until you tell me what‰Ûªs going on inside that little head of yours.",4
18538,Raj (singing),14, Like the wild elephant I am trumpeting my love for you!,4
18539,Bernadette (singing),14, Like a hidden flower my sweet fragrance comes into view!,4
18540,Raj (singing),14, My heart burns for you like the sun at noon!,4
18541,Bernadette (singing),14, My desert welcomes you like the rainy monsoon!,4
18542,Raj (singing),14, You are my heart!,4
18543,Bernadette (singing),14, My universe!,4
18544,Raj (singing),14, You are my heart!,4
18545,Bernadette (singing),14, My universe!,4
18546,Both together (singing),14, My universe!,4
18547,Chorus of everyone in cafeteria (singing),14,  Hey! You are my heart! My universe! You are my heart! My universe! You are my heart! My universe! My universe!,4
18548,Raj (out of daydream),14," Dance number aside, I‰Ûªm so not gay.",4
18549,Scene,15, The University cafeteria,4
18550,Raj,15," Here‰Ûªs what I wonder about zombies. (Others all groan) What happens if they can‰Ûªt get any human flesh to eat? They can‰Ûªt starve to death, they‰Ûªre already dead.",4
18551,Howard,15, You take this one. I spent an hour last night on how do vampires shave when they can‰Ûªt see themselves in the mirror?,4
18552,Sheldon,15, Well-groomed vampires meet in pairs and shave each other. Case closed.,4
18553,Raj,15," Yeah, okay, so, zombies.",4
18554,Leonard,15," I guess it depends on the zombies, Raj. Are we talking slow zombies, fast zombies? Like, in 28 Days, if those zombies didn‰Ûªt eat, they starved.",4
18555,Howard,15, You‰Ûªre thinking of 28 Days Later. 28 Days is where Sandra Bullock goes to rehab and puts the audience into an undead state,4
18556,Raj,15," Hey, don‰Ûªt bag on Sandra Bullock! You think it makes you look cultured, but you just come off as bitter.",4
18557,Leonard,15," Oh, Dr. Siebert, twelve o‰Ûªclock.",4
18558,Howard,15, Why‰Ûªs the president of the university slumming in the cafeteria?,4
18559,Sheldon,15," Perhaps he‰Ûªs emulating Shakespeare‰Ûªs Henry V, who dressed as a commoner and mingled among them, to find out how he was being perceived by his subjects. Course, if he‰Ûªd have read any of the thirteen hundred e-mails I‰Ûªve sent him on the subject of his administration, he could have saved himself the trouble.",4
18560,Raj,15, Or maybe he heard it‰Ûªs Tator Tot Tuesday. That‰Ûªs why I‰Ûªm here.,4
18561,Dr. Seibert,15," Hey, there‰Ûªs my favorite geniuses! How are we doing today?",4
18562,Sheldon,15," That depends, how much longer do you plan on fondling my shoulder?",4
18563,Seibert,15," Sorry, Dr. Cooper, I forgot you have a touch phobia.",4
18564,Sheldon,15," It‰Ûªs not a touch phobia, it‰Ûªs a germ phobia. If you‰Ûªd like to go put on a pair of latex gloves,",4
18565,Seibert,15," Yeah. So, listen, fellas, who‰Ûªs up for a little party this Saturday night? Open bar, good eats, might even be a few pretty girls.",4
18566,Raj,15, Sounds great!,4
18567,Howard,15, I‰Ûªm in!,4
18568,Sheldon,15," Hold on. Just because the nice man is offering you candy, doesn‰Ûªt mean you should jump into his windowless van. What‰Ûªs the occasion?",4
18569,Seibert,15, Just a little fund-raiser for the university.,4
18570,Sheldon,15, Aha! The tear-stained air mattress in the back of the van.,4
18571,Seibert,15," I understand your reticence, Dr. Cooper, and I sympathize, but the hard facts are, occasionally, we have to shake a few hands and kiss a few butts to raise money for our research.",4
18572,Sheldon,15," I don‰Ûªt care, it‰Ûªs demeaning. And I refuse to be trotted out and shown off like a prize hog at the Texas State Fair. Which, by the way, is something you don‰Ûªt want to attend wearing a Star Trek ensign‰Ûªs uniform.",4
18573,Seibert,15," All right, let me put it this way. You‰Ûªre gonna put on a suit, you‰Ûªre gonna come to this party, and you‰Ûªre gonna explain your research to a bunch of old people, or I swear to God, I‰Ûªll blind you with a hot spoon, like they did to that little boy in Slumdog Millionaire.",4
18574,Raj,15," Oh, you don‰Ûªt want that.",4
18575,Seibert,15," So, Saturday night! It‰Ûªs gonna be off the hook.",4
18576,Sheldon,15, Ugh!,4
18577,Seibert,15, Get over it.,4
18578,Raj,15," Oh, boy! Tator tots and a party invitation? What a great day!",4
18579,Scene,15, The apartment.,4
18580,Penny,15, There you go.,4
18581,Leonard,15, Are you sure this is right?,4
18582,Penny,15," Yeah, just tuck that part in your pants;åÊ you‰Ûªll be fine.",4
18583,Howard,15," Okay, let‰Ûªs go smooch some rich, wrinkled tuckus.",4
18584,Penny,15," Oh, Howard, I can‰Ûªt believe Bernadette let you go to a fancy party wearing a dickey.",4
18585,Howard,15," Excuse me, my girlfriend doesn‰Ûªt pick out my clothes. My mother does.",4
18586,Leonard,15, Oh. We should get going.,4
18587,Howard,15, What about Sheldon?,4
18588,Sheldon,15, Sheldon is not going.,4
18589,Leonard,15, Really? What do we tell Siebert?,4
18590,Sheldon,15, Tell him Dr. Cooper feels that the best use of his time is to employ his rare and precious mental faculties to tear the mask off nature and stare at the face of God.,4
18591,Penny,15," Sheldon, it‰Ûªs Saturday night, you‰Ûªll be doing laundry.",4
18592,Sheldon,15," Don‰Ûªt tell him that, tell him the mask thing.",4
18593,Scene,15, The party.,4
18594,Howard,15," Hey, put your tie back in your pants.",4
18595,Leonard,15, Thanks.,4
18596,Raj,15, Nice place. Reminds me of my parents‰Ûª house back in New Delhi.,4
18597,Howard,15, You‰Ûªre kidding.,4
18598,Raj,15," No. We are very wealthy. But the only difference is, we have more servants.",4
18599,Leonard,15, More than this?,4
18600,Raj,15," More than we can use. You see, in India, we don‰Ûªt make the mistake of letting our poor people have dreams.",4
18601,Seibert,15, Ah. There‰Ûªs my band of brainiacs. Where‰Ûªs Dr. Cooper?,4
18602,Leonard,15, He‰Ûªs tearing the mask off nature to look at the face of God.,4
18603,Seibert,15," The board of directors insists he has a beautiful mind. I think he‰Ûªs just bananas. Come on, let me introduce you to one of the university‰Ûªs leading donors.",4
18604,Raj,15, I think we were misled about the cute girls.,4
18605,Seibert,15," Mrs. Latham, I‰Ûªd like you to meet three of our outstanding young researchers. This is Dr. Leonard Hofstadter, Dr. Rajesh Koothrappali and Howard Wolowitz.",4
18606,Mrs Latham,15," Well, what happened to you, Wolowitz, couldn‰Ûªt stick with it long enough to get your PhD?",4
18607,Howard,15, I‰Ûªm an engineer. Most engineers don‰Ûªt bother with a PhD. But you may be interested to know I designed the zero-gravity waste-disposal system for NASA.,4
18608,Mrs Latham,15," Got it, you‰Ûªre a space plumber.",4
18609,Howard,15, I‰Ûªm gonna go hit the bar.,4
18610,Mrs Latham,15, Tell me about these two.,4
18611,Raj,15, Do him first.,4
18612,Seibert,15, Dr. Hofstadter is representing our experimental physics program tonight. I think you‰Ûªll really enjoy hearing about his fascinating work.,4
18613,Mrs Latham,15, Right. Fascinate me.,4
18614,Leonard,15, Uh.. b.. d.. uh.. uh..,4
18615,Mrs Latham,15," They‰Ûªre cute when they‰Ûªre about to wet themselves, aren‰Ûªt they? I‰Ûªll make it easy for you. When you arrive at the lab in the morning, what sort of machine do you turn on?",4
18616,Leonard,15, Coffee maker?,4
18617,Mrs Latham,15," All right, Dr. Kooth‰Û_ uh, whatever it is, you‰Ûªre up.",4
18618,Raj,15, It‰Ûªs Koothrappali. I have to tinkle.,4
18619,Scene,15, The apartment.,4
18620,Sheldon,15," And so, instead of bowing to pressure, and going to that pointless soiree, I stayed right here and did a load of whites.",4
18621,Amy (on webcam),15," Well, normally I respect your macho rebellious attitude toward The Man, but, in this case, I think you‰Ûªve made a foolish mistake.",4
18622,Sheldon,15," Unlikely. But make your case. Keeping in mind that your critical attitude is ruining our Saturday night together, and I‰Ûªm not above minimizing your window.",4
18623,Amy,15," Sheldon, like it or not, until you manage to upload your intelligence into a self-sustaining orbiting satellite, equipped with high-speed Internet and a cloaking device, you will be dependent on other members of the human race.",4
18624,Sheldon,15, That‰Ûªs it. Prepare to be minimized.,4
18625,Amy,15," I‰Ûªm not finished. All scientists have to fund-raise, Sheldon. How do you think I paid for my lab?",4
18626,Sheldon,15, Your lab is funded by some Middle-Eastern dilettante?,4
18627,Amy,15," Technically, Faisal is my fiance. But I do have a state-of-the-art two-photon microscope and a place to stay in Riyadh for the winter.",4
18628,Sheldon,15," Well, that explains those puzzling camel race photos on your Facebook page.",4
18629,Amy,15," And consider this, without you to make the case for the physics department, the task will fall to people like Leonard and Rajesh.",4
18630,Sheldon,15, Are you trying to scare me? ‰Û÷Cause you‰Ûªre succeeding.,4
18631,Amy,15," Well, then prepare to be terrified. If your friends are unconvincing, this year‰Ûªs donations might go to, say, the geology department.",4
18632,Sheldon,15," Oh, dear,not, not the dirt people!",4
18633,Amy,15," Or worse, it could go to the liberal arts.",4
18634,Sheldon,15, No!,4
18635,Amy,15," Millions of dollars being showered on poets, literary theorists and students of gender studies.",4
18636,Sheldon,15," Oh, the humanities!",4
18637,Scene,15, The party.,4
18638,Leonard,15," On the bright side, I don‰Ûªt think President Siebert will be making us go to any more fund-raisers.",4
18639,Howard,15," It was so much easier at my bar mitzvah. The old people just came up to you, pinched your cheek and handed you a savings bond.",4
18640,Raj,15," Oh, don‰Ûªt be such gloomy Gusses. Look at the size of these shrimp! At what point do we start calling them lobsters?",4
18641,Leonard,15," Face it, Raj, we crashed and burned tonight.",4
18642,Mrs Latham,15," Oh, you didn‰Ûªt do that badly.",4
18643,Leonard,15," Mrs. Latham, the first machine I turn on in the morning is the helium-neon laser, ‰Ûªcause it needs to warm up.",4
18644,Mrs Latham,15," I no longer care, dear. But don‰Ûªt worry, I really enjoyed meeting you this evening.",4
18645,Leonard,15, You‰Ûªre kidding. That was good for you? ‰Û÷Cause I was sweating through my T-shirt.,4
18646,Mrs Latham,15, Excellent! There‰Ûªs nothing I like better than making smart people feel ill at ease.,4
18647,Leonard,15, Why?,4
18648,Mrs Latham,15," Oh, I don‰Ûªt know, it‰Ûªs one of the fun things you get to do when you have lots of money. Watch. Hey! Who said you could eat that shrimp? See? Fun.",4
18649,Sheldon (behind them),15," No, no, no, I‰Ûªm just here for your money. I don‰Ûªt want to shake anyone‰Ûªs germy hands. Explain it to them, Siebert.",4
18650,Scene,15, The apartment. ,4
18651,Sheldon (on phone),15," I must confess I don‰Ûªt understand you, President Siebert. First you say you want me to appear at your fund-raisers, but now you say you never want me to go anywhere near your fund-raisers. Forgive me, but that sounds like a mixed message. Here we go again. If there‰Ûªs simply no talking to me, why did you call? I‰Ûªm sorry, someone‰Ûªs on the other line. Why don‰Ûªt you see if you can organize your thoughts, and we‰Ûªll try again later. Cooper-Hofstadter residence. Go for Cooper.",4
18652,Leonard,15," Hello, Mrs. Latham. Yes, I live with him. I don‰Ûªt, I, I really don‰Ûªt know why. Tonight? Sure, that‰Ûªd be great. Okay, I‰Ûªll, I‰Ûªll see you then. Bye. She wants to have dinner and talk about my research.",4
18653,Sheldon,15," An entire dinner to talk about your research? Where you going, the drive-thru at Jack in the Box?",4
18654,Leonard,15," Well, wherever we‰Ûªre going, she‰Ûªs sending a car to pick me up.",4
18655,Sheldon,15," Okay, I see what‰Ûªs happening.",4
18656,Leonard,15, What?,4
18657,Sheldon,15," My stature intimidates her, so she‰Ûªs using you to get to me. Crafty old gal.",4
18658,Leonard,15," Excuse me, but you are not the only distinguished scientist in this apartment. I‰Ûªve been published in peer-reviewed journals, I received a Dissertation of the Year award for experimental particle physics.",4
18659,Sheldon,15," No, that can‰Ûªt be it. And since you seem to have forgotten, the reason we live together is we‰Ûªre best friends. And I got your back, Jack.",4
18660,Secne,15, Mrs Latham‰Ûªs car.,4
18661,Leonard,15, That was a great meal.,4
18662,Mrs Latham,15, I‰Ûªm glad you enjoyed it.,4
18663,Leonard,15, The only time I eat this well is when my mom‰Ûªs in town and she takes me out to dinner.,4
18664,Mrs Latham,15, Is that so?,4
18665,Leonard,15," You kind of remind me of her. She enjoys making people uncomfortable, too.",4
18666,Mrs Latham,15," Well, you remind me of a boy I dated in college.",4
18667,Leonard,15, No kidding.,4
18668,Mrs Latham,15, Sweet boy. Very smart. If only he‰Ûªd had money.,4
18669,Leonard,15," Yeah, um, so, hey, speaking of money, how are you feeling about helping the physics department get a cryogenic centrifugal pump and molecular sieve?",4
18670,Mrs Latham,15," Well, I must say, you make a very persuasive case for it.",4
18671,Leonard,15," Oh, good, good.",4
18672,Mrs Latham,15, And I‰Ûªm seriously considering taking it to the next level.,4
18673,Leonard,15," Terrific. Great. What level is that? (She grabs him and kisses him) Okay, now you don‰Ûªt remind me of my mom.",4
18674,Scene,15, The apartment.,4
18675,Sheldon,15," I‰Ûªm sorry, so, eventually, zombies are going to attack the rehab facility where Sandra Bullock is?",4
18676,Penny,15," Yes, Sheldon. Keep watching.",4
18677,Sheldon,15," You know, it‰Ûªs a shame, all that work she‰Ûªs doing to get sober, only to be torn apart and eaten alive.",4
18678,Howard,15, Hey. How was dinner?,4
18679,Leonard,15, Swell. I need a drink. Do we have any alcohol?,4
18680,Sheldon,15," No. But we have potatoes, I could make you vodka. It‰Ûªll take two weeks.",4
18681,Penny,15," Leonard, are you okay?",4
18682,Leonard,15," Um, I‰Ûªm not sure.",4
18683,Howard,15, What‰Ûªs going on?,4
18684,Leonard,15," Well, Mrs. Latham said she was seriously considering donating money so we could get a cryogenic centrifugal pump.",4
18685,Sheldon,15," Oh, wow!",4
18686,Howard,15, Yes!,4
18687,Leonard,15, Then she stuck her tongue down my throat.,4
18688,Sheldon,15, Why?,4
18689,Penny,15," Okay, we can‰Ûªt keep explaining everything. Read that book we got you.",4
18690,Leonard,15, She hit on me.,4
18691,Howard,15, Wait-wait-wait. Are you telling us that old lady wanted to have sex with you in exchange for giving your department millions of dollars?,4
18692,Leonard,15, I think so.,4
18693,Howard,15, You lucky duck.,4
18694,Penny,15," You‰Ûªre really a broken toy, aren‰Ûªt you?",4
18695,Leonard,15," I was able to get out of there before anything else happened, but she wants to see me again tomorrow night.",4
18696,Sheldon,15, Excellent! What are you planning to wear?,4
18697,Leonard,15, What?,4
18698,Sheldon,15," Penny, you‰Ûªre an expert on trading sexual favours for material gain, walk him through this.",4
18699,Leonard,15," Well, n-no, hold on a second, I‰Ûªm not going to sleep with her.",4
18700,Sheldon,15, But we need a cryogenic centrifugal pump.,4
18701,Leonard,15," Well, forget it! It‰Ûªs not gonna happen.",4
18702,Sheldon,15," Well, come now, Leonard, this may be your only chance to make a real contribution to science!",4
18703,Leonard,15," I repeat, not gonna happen.",4
18704,Penny,15, What was all that about me trading sexual favours for material gain?,4
18705,Sheldon,15, It was a compliment. I believe in giving credit where credit is due.,4
18706,Scene,15," The apartment, the following night.",4
18707,Sheldon (on phone),15," Okay, fine. I‰Ûªll tell him. Leonard, Mrs. Latham‰Ûªs car is here for you.",4
18708,Leonard,15, I won‰Ûªt be too late. I‰Ûªm just gonna make a final pitch for the funding and then say good night.,4
18709,Sheldon,15," Hold on, I have something for you.",4
18710,Leonard,15, What‰Ûªs this?,4
18711,Sheldon,15," Just a few things you may need tonight. There‰Ûªs, uh, baby oil, condoms and, uh, a little something I procured from the school of pharmacology. They say it is to Viagra as Viagra is to a green M&M.",4
18712,Leonard,15, I am not going to have sex with her.,4
18713,Sheldon,15, Maybe this will overcome your reluctance. I went on the Internet and found a photograph of a 25-year-old Mrs. Latham to get your libido humming. Check out those saddle shoes. Rar!,4
18714,Leonard,15, Are you insane? I‰Ûªm not going to prostitute myself just so we can get some new equipment.,4
18715,Sheldon,15," Oh, come on! Why not?",4
18716,Leonard,15," Good night, Sheldon.",4
18717,Sheldon,15," Given how much time you spend engaging in pointless self-abuse, you might consider, just this once, using your genitalia to actually accomplish something!",4
18718,Penny,15," He still won‰Ûªt shag the old lady, huh?",4
18719,Sheldon,15, No. But thank you for asking.,4
18720,Scene,15, Mrs Latham‰Ûªs car.,4
18721,Leonard,15, Hey. Hi.,4
18722,Mrs Latham,15," Hello, Leonard. I hope you‰Ûªre hungry.",4
18723,Leonard,15," I‰Ûªm very hungry. For food, right?",4
18724,Mrs Latham,15," Oh, I made you uncomfortable last night. I‰Ûªm so sorry.",4
18725,Leonard,15," No, that‰Ûªs okay.",4
18726,Mrs Latham,15," No, it most certainly is not. Leonard, I‰Ûªm making the donation to your department regardless of what happens between us.",4
18727,Leonard,15, Really?,4
18728,Mrs Latham,15," Well, of course. There‰Ûªs no quid pro quo here. You and your colleagues are doing remarkable research, and you deserve the money.",4
18729,Leonard,15, Oh. Then what was last night about?,4
18730,Mrs Latham,15," I took a shot, sue me.",4
18731,Leonard,15, Oh.,4
18732,Mrs Latham,15," You‰Ûªre a very handsome man, Leonard.",4
18733,Leonard,15, Thank you.,4
18734,Mrs Latham,15, It was foolish of me to think someone your age might ever be interested in someone like me.,4
18735,Leonard,15," Oh, don‰Ûªt say that. You‰Ûªre a very attractive woman.",4
18736,Mrs Latham,15," Oh, please.",4
18737,Leonard,15," No, it‰Ûªs true.",4
18738,Mrs Latham,15," Well, aren‰Ûªt you sweet. Just for the record, you‰Ûªd remember a night with me for the rest of your life.",4
18739,Leonard,15," I‰Ûªm sure I would. But why, why, exactly?",4
18740,Mrs Latham,15, You‰Ûªre a very smart man. How do you think I landed such a rich husband?,4
18741,Leonard,15, I hadn‰Ûªt really given it much thought.,4
18742,Mrs Latham,15," Well, think about it.",4
18743,Leonard,15, Do you mean?,4
18744,Mrs Latham,15, Yep. I‰Ûªm that good.,4
18745,Leonard,15," Oh, what the hell.",4
18746,Scene,15, The stairwell. Leonard is returning home looking dishevelled.,4
18747,Penny,15," Good morning, slut.",4
18748,Leonard,15, What?,4
18749,Penny,15," Oh, please, I recognize the walk of shame when I see it. All you‰Ûªre missing is a little smeared mascara and a purse with panties wadded up in it.",4
18750,Sheldon,15, What‰Ûªs going on?,4
18751,Leonard,15," Oh, nothing‰Ûªs going on. Excuse me.",4
18752,Sheldon,15, Are you just getting home?,4
18753,Leonard,15, Yeah.,4
18754,Sheldon,15," That‰Ûªs a good sign, right?",4
18755,Penny,15," Oh, yeah.",4
18756,Sheldon,15, I‰Ûªm so proud of you! You sold yourself out like a common streetwalker!,4
18757,Leonard,15," No, I didn‰Ûªt do it for the money.",4
18758,Sheldon,15, She stiffed you?,4
18759,Penny,15, I believe that‰Ûªs what your roommate did to her.,4
18760,Sheldon,15, What?,4
18761,Penny,15," Again, read the book we gave you.",4
18762,Leonard,15," No, I mean, I, I, I got the money first.",4
18763,Sheldon,15," Smart. Get paid up front. Yeah, I think you have a real knack for gigolo work, Leonard.",4
18764,Leonard,15," Uh, I‰Ûªm gonna go lie down.",4
18765,Sheldon,15," That‰Ûªs a good idea, get your rest. There are a lot more rich old ladies out there, and Daddy needs a new linear accelerator. And I thought he didn‰Ûªt learn anything from his relationship with you.",4
18766,Penny,15, Hey!,4
18767,Sheldon,15, Another compliment! Learn to recognize them.,4
18768,Scene,15, The cafeteria.,4
18769,Seibert,15," Ah, there he is! The man of the hour! He took one for the team!",4
18770,Leonard,15, I didn‰Ûªt do it for the money!,4
18771,Seibert,15," Keep telling yourself that, it makes it easier. Trust me, I know.",4
18772,Raj,15," Cool, buddy! That‰Ûªs awesome!",4
18773,Howard,15, How was she?,4
18774,Scene,16, Bernadette‰Ûªs bedroom.,4
18775,Howard,16, What‰Ûªs so funny?,4
18776,Bernadette,16, Nothing. Just thinking about the noises people make during sex.,4
18777,Howard,16," I do sometimes get a bit carried away, don‰Ûªt I?",4
18778,Bernadette,16, It‰Ûªs cute. You sound a little like a drunken monkey. Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh!,4
18779,Howard,16, You know it‰Ûªs meant as a compliment.,4
18780,Bernadette,16, That‰Ûªs how I take it.,4
18781,Howard,16, This is perfect. I hope this moment never ends.,4
18782,Bernadette,16, Me too.,4
18783,Howard,16," Well, gotta go.",4
18784,Bernadette,16, Oh! Already? Why don‰Ûªt you stay over?,4
18785,Howard,16," Well, I‰Ûªd love to, but you know my mother needs me in the morning.",4
18786,Bernadette,16," Please, I think the woman can manage to put a wig on by herself.",4
18787,Howard,16," It‰Ûªs not just the wig. It‰Ûªs pinning her hair up, drawing on her eyebrows. It‰Ûªs a two-person job.",4
18788,Bernadette,16," It‰Ûªs just, when you leave right after we make love, it makes me feel cheap.",4
18789,Howard,16," Oh, honey, I‰Ûªm sorry. What can I do?",4
18790,Bernadette,16, Stay.,4
18791,Howard,16," Okay. Like, what, another five, ten minutes?",4
18792,Bernadette,16, Go home.,4
18793,Howard,16, Your call.,4
18794,Bernadette,16," Howard, have you ever considered us living together?",4
18795,Howard,16," Boy, I don‰Ûªt know. You, me, Ma living under the same roof?",4
18796,Bernadette,16," No, I mean just you and me. You can move in here, or we can find a place.",4
18797,Howard,16, I‰Ûªve got a better solution.,4
18798,Bernadette,16, What?,4
18799,Howard,16," We wait for my mom‰Ûªs heart to explode from all the salt she eats. Then we just stick her in the ground, flip her mattress and move into the big bedroom.",4
18800,Bernadette,16, Great.,4
18801,Howard,16, Look at us planning a future together.,4
18802,Scene,16, Outside Howard‰Ûªs house.,4
18803,Mrs Wolowitz (voice),16, Who‰Ûªs there? Are you a sex criminal?,4
18804,Howard,16," Sex criminals don‰Ûªt have keys, Ma.",4
18805,Mrs Wolowitz,16, Where were you so late?,4
18806,Howard,16, I was out with Bernadette.,4
18807,Mrs Wolowitz,16," I know what that means, I watch Dr. Phil. I hope to God you used a condom!",4
18808,Howard,16," I‰Ûªm not having this conversation with you, Ma!",4
18809,Mrs Wolowitz,16, God forbid you get one of those new fancy sex diseases!,4
18810,Howard,16, Nobody has a disease!,4
18811,Mrs Wolowitz,16, I hope not. I share a toilet with you. Is that what you want? To give your mother herpes?,4
18812,Howard,16, That‰Ûªs it. I don‰Ûªt have to take this. Good luck with your eyebrows in the morning!,4
18813,Mrs Wolowitz,16, Who‰Ûªs there? Are you a sex criminal?,4
18814,Howard,16, I‰Ûªm still leaving! I just forgot my Claritin.,4
18815,Scene,16, The apartment.,4
18816,Leonard,16," Hey, what‰Ûªs up?",4
18817,Howard,16, I need a place to crash.,4
18818,Leonard,16," Uh, sure. Why?",4
18819,Howard,16, Big fight with my mother.,4
18820,Leonard,16, Still arguing over which CSI is the best?,4
18821,Howard,16," No, we agreed they all have their merits. This was about Bernadette.",4
18822,Sheldon,16, What‰Ûªs going on?,4
18823,Leonard,16, Howard‰Ûªs gonna sleep here tonight. He had a fight with his mother.,4
18824,Sheldon,16, Did you offer him a hot beverage?,4
18825,Leonard,16, No.,4
18826,Sheldon,16," Leonard, social protocol states when a friend is upset, you offer them a hot beverage, such as tea.",4
18827,Howard,16, Tea does sound nice.,4
18828,Sheldon,16," You heard the man, Leonard. And while you‰Ûªre at it, I‰Ûªm upset that we have an unannounced houseguest, so make me cocoa. Point of inquiry, given that Leonard is your secondary friend and Koothrappali is your primary friend, why didn‰Ûªt you seek refuge under his roof?",4
18829,Howard,16, There‰Ûªs no room. His sister is staying with him.,4
18830,Leonard,16," Wait, wait. What?",4
18831,Sheldon,16," Cocoa, Leonard. Focus. I‰Ûªm down in the dumps here.",4
18832,Leonard,16, Priya‰Ûªs in town?,4
18833,Howard,16," Yeah, some work thing. Anyway, my mother seems to think that Bernadette‰Û_",4
18834,Leonard,16, Hold on. When did Priya get here?,4
18835,Howard,16," I don‰Ûªt know. A couple of days ago. The thing is, Bernadette doesn‰Ûªt like that I have to take care of my mother, and my mother doesn‰Ûªt trust Bernadette.",4
18836,Leonard,16," Yeah, that‰Ûªs a real pickle. Bye.",4
18837,Sheldon,16," Don‰Ûªt worry. As your tertiary friend, I am prepared to step in and comfort you.",4
18838,Howard,16, That‰Ûªs not really necessary.,4
18839,Sheldon,16," No, no. I‰Ûªll finish making the tea, while you narcissistically ramble on about whatever‰Ûªs troubling you.",4
18840,Howard,16, Thanks.,4
18841,Sheldon,16, That‰Ûªs what tertiary friends are for.,4
18842,Scene,16, Raj‰Ûªs Apartment. Leonard knocks on the door. ,4
18843,Raj (inside),16, Who is it?,4
18844,Leonard,16, It‰Ûªs Leonard.,4
18845,Raj,16, You can‰Ûªt come in.,4
18846,Leonard,16, I just want to talk to her.,4
18847,Raj,16, I forbid it.,4
18848,Priya,16," Open the door, Rajesh.",4
18849,Raj,16, You heard me. I forbidded it.,4
18850,Priya,16, Forbidded it?,4
18851,Raj,16, Forbaded it?,4
18852,Priya,16, Get out of the way. What are you doing here?,4
18853,Leonard,16, What are you doing here?,4
18854,Priya,16, I have business in Los Angeles.,4
18855,Leonard,16, Why didn‰Ûªt you call?,4
18856,Raj,16," Clearly, she was sending you a message to take a hike, Mike.",4
18857,Priya,16," I‰Ûªm sorry. I thought about calling, but I just wasn‰Ûªt sure if seeing you was such a good idea.",4
18858,Leonard,16, I know. Last time I came on too strong. Can we talk in private?,4
18859,Raj,16, No!,4
18860,Priya,16, Sure.,4
18861,Raj,16," It‰Ûªs completely inappropriate for a single woman to entertain a man in private. If you insist on talking, you must do it on the couch! All right, you may talk in the bedroom, but I want this door to remain open! All right, just this once you may close the door. But keep in mind I‰Ûªll be right out here monitoring the situation! (Dials phone) Oh, damn it. Leonard, when you get this message, call me. (Dials again) Priya, this is your brother. When you get this, tell Leonard to check his voicemail.",4
18862,Scene,16, The Cheesecake Factory.,4
18863,Sheldon,16, Would you be sleeping over again this evening? Because you‰Ûªre welcome to.,4
18864,Howard,16," That‰Ûªs very nice of you, but I made other plans.",4
18865,Sheldon,16," Well, just keep in mind that should you ever need a slightly apathetic tertiary friend, I stand at the ready.",4
18866,Priya,16," Hi, Howard. Hi, Sheldon.",4
18867,Howard,16, Hey.,4
18868,Sheldon,16, Hello.,4
18869,Raj,16, Why are you holding hands? I forbid you to hold hands.,4
18870,Priya,16," Rajesh, you know Leonard and I spent the night together.",4
18871,Raj,16," Yeah, but you were just sleeping, because I forboded you to have sex.",4
18872,Leonard,16, The word is forbade.,4
18873,Raj,16, Are you sure? That doesn‰Ûªt sound right.,4
18874,Priya,16," Listen, Rajesh, Leonard and I have decided to see each other again, and you don‰Ûªt get to tell me who I can and can‰Ûªt have a relationship with.",4
18875,Sheldon,16," Actually, he can. The Hindu Code of Manu is very clear in these matters. If a woman‰Ûªs father is not around, the duty of controlling her base desires falls to the closest male member of her family, in this case, Raj. The code also states that if she disobeys, she will be reborn in the womb of a jackal and tormented by diseases. If true, that seems like an awfully large gamble given that the prize is Leonard.",4
18876,Raj,16," There it is, Priya. We‰Ûªre Indian. We believe this stuff.",4
18877,Priya,16," I think it also says that if you eat beef, you need to live with cows for three months and drink their urine.",4
18878,Raj,16," Some of it makes sense, some of it‰Ûªs crazy. My point is, you can‰Ûªt go out with Leonard.",4
18879,Penny (arriving),16, Who can‰Ûªt go out with Leonard?,4
18880,Raj,16, My sister.,4
18881,Leonard,16," Penny, this is Raj‰Ûªs sister, Priya.",4
18882,Priya,16, It‰Ûªs very nice to meet you.,4
18883,Penny,16," Oh, yeah, you, too.",4
18884,Sheldon,16," Priya, if you‰Ûªre experiencing any tension or awkwardness, it may stem from the fact that Leonard and Penny used to, if I may quote Howard, do the dance with no pants.",4
18885,Penny,16, Sheldon!,4
18886,Leonard,16, Really?,4
18887,Howard,16," Hey, Bernadette, can I talk to you for a second?",4
18888,Bernadette,16, Sure.,4
18889,Raj,16," Penny, you became disenchanted with Leonard as a lover. Would you please tell my sister why?",4
18890,Howard,16," Listen, my mom‰Ûªs going to Palm Springs to visit her sister. That‰Ûªs two whole nights in a row I can sleep over with you all the way to morning. Unless the desert air dries out her sinuses, in which case I‰Ûªll have to schlep out there with the big humidifier.",4
18891,Bernadette,16," That‰Ûªs it? That‰Ûªs your big solution to all of our problems? If your mom‰Ûªs nose holds up, we get two nights together?",4
18892,Howard,16, Isn‰Ûªt that great?,4
18893,Bernadette,16," No, it‰Ûªs not great. You need to make a choice. Me or your mother.",4
18894,Howard,16," Oh, uh‰Û_",4
18895,Bernadette,16, Wrong answer.,4
18896,Howard,16," No, wait. You didn‰Ûªt let me finish.",4
18897,Bernadette,16, I‰Ûªm listening.,4
18898,Howard,16, Uh‰Û_,4
18899,Bernadette,16, Agh!,4
18900,Scene,16, Penny‰Ûªs apartment. (groans),4
18901,Amy,16, I came as quickly as I could.,4
18902,Penny,16, Okay. Why?,4
18903,Amy,16," To comfort you, of course. Sheldon told me about Leonard dating Rajesh‰Ûªs sister. So I high-tailed it over here to pick up the pieces of your broken heart.",4
18904,Penny,16," Amy, I‰Ûªm fine.",4
18905,Amy,16," You don‰Ûªt have to be strong for me. Now let‰Ûªs talk about Priya, that man-stealing bitch.",4
18906,Penny,16, What?,4
18907,Amy,16," In situations like this, best girlfriends are often catty about the other woman. Rawr.",4
18908,Penny,16," Really, I am not upset about Leonard and Priya.",4
18909,Amy,16, Oh. Then perhaps you don‰Ûªt understand what‰Ûªs going on. Your former boyfriend has replaced you with what appears to be a very suitable mate. Arguably much more suitable than you.,4
18910,Penny,16," Oh. Well, good for him. Hey, what do you mean, more suitable?",4
18911,Amy,16," Well, granted, Penny, your secondary sexual characteristics are reasonably bodacious. But Priya is highly educated, she‰Ûªs an accomplished professional, and she comes from the culture that literally wrote the book on neat ways to have sex. Whereas you, on the other hand, are a community college dropout who comes from the culture that wrote the book on tipping cows.",4
18912,Penny,16," Yeah. Okay, I got it. I got it. So, what is all that stuff?",4
18913,Amy,16," This is a portable electroencephalogram. I‰Ûªm doing research on emotions and brain activity. So when you start crying, I can see which region of the brain is activated. Then I‰Ûªm going to stimulate the analogous area in the brain of a rhesus monkey and see if he cries. Cool, huh?",4
18914,Scene,16, Bernadette‰Ûªs apartment. Howard knocks on door.,4
18915,Howard,16, I choose you.,4
18916,Bernadette,16, Really?,4
18917,Howard,16, Yep. I moved out of my mother‰Ûªs house. Cord is cut. I‰Ûªm all yours.,4
18918,Bernadette,16, What did she say when you told her?,4
18919,Howard,16, I don‰Ûªt know. She hasn‰Ûªt responded to my email yet.,4
18920,Bernadette,16," This is so great. I love you, Howard.",4
18921,Howard,16," I love you, too. So what‰Ûªs for dinner?",4
18922,Bernadette,16," Well, I don‰Ûªt really have much of anything in the house.",4
18923,Howard,16, That‰Ûªs fine. Why don‰Ûªt we go fool around in our bedroom? And then you can go shopping.,4
18924,Scene,16, The apartment. ,4
18925,Leonard,16," I thought maybe after we eat, we could see an early movie.",4
18926,Priya,16, I‰Ûªd love that.,4
18927,Leonard,16," I love the way you say, I‰Ûªd love that.",4
18928,Raj,16, She says it the same way I do. I‰Ûªd love that. Everybody in India says it that way. It‰Ûªs not a big deal.,4
18929,Priya,16," Rajesh, don‰Ûªt be a child.",4
18930,Raj,16," I‰Ûªm not being a child. Leonard, I swear to God, if your sister ever comes to town, I shall have my way with her.",4
18931,Leonard,16, My sister‰Ûªs 38 and married.,4
18932,Raj,16, All the more shame that will fall upon the house of Hofstadter.,4
18933,Penny,16," Ooh, I thought I smelled pizza.",4
18934,Sheldon,16," That‰Ûªs remarkable. If pepperoni were an explosive substance, you could replace German shepherds at our nation‰Ûªs airports.",4
18935,Priya,16," Hi. Penny, right?",4
18936,Penny,16," Oh, yes. Hi, hi. I‰Ûªm sorry. I didn‰Ûªt know you had company. I don‰Ûªt want to impose.",4
18937,Sheldon,16," No, no. It‰Ûªs not an imposition. At this point, in our ecosystem, you are akin to the plover, a small scavenging bird that eats extra food from between the teeth of crocodiles. Please, fly into our open maw, and have at it.",4
18938,Penny,16," If I had more than a box of baking soda in my refrigerator, I wouldn‰Ûªt have to take that.",4
18939,Amy,16," Hi, bestie.",4
18940,Penny,16," Hi. So, um, Priya, you‰Ûªre a lawyer, right?",4
18941,Priya,16," I know. Pretty boring, huh?",4
18942,Leonard,16," Oh, come on. It‰Ûªs not boring at all. She‰Ûªs currently helping set up a secondary derivative market which would allow overseas car firms to hedge their investments against potential advancements in battery technology. Hmm?",4
18943,Priya,16," Thank you, Leonard. That doesn‰Ûªt make it sound boring at all.",4
18944,Amy,16," So, how you holding up?",4
18945,Penny,16, I‰Ûªm fine.,4
18946,Amy,16," Oh, who are you kidding? She‰Ûªs breathtaking.",4
18947,Priya,16," So, Penny, Leonard tells me you‰Ûªre an actress. That must be pretty exciting.",4
18948,Penny,16," Oh, yeah, yeah. It‰Ûªs real great. Today I drove to Van Nuys for an audition I thought was going to be for a cat food commercial. Turned out to be porn.",4
18949,Sheldon,16, Did you get the part?,4
18950,Penny,16, I didn‰Ûªt do the audition.,4
18951,Sheldon,16," Given the state of your career, can you really afford to be picky?",4
18952,Priya,16, I took acting classes when I was at Cambridge. I loved it. We did Taming of the Shrew.,4
18953,Leonard,16," Oh, wow. I love Taming of the Shrew. I did a paper on it in high school. Who knows not where a wasp does wear his sting? In his tail.",4
18954,Priya,16, In his tongue.,4
18955,Leonard,16, Whose tongue?,4
18956,Priya,16," Yours, if you talk of tails, and so farewell.",4
18957,Leonard,16," What, with my tongue in your tail?",4
18958,Amy,16, I‰Ûªm regretting my earlier cattiness. She is an absolute delight.,4
18959,Scene,16, Bernadette‰Ûªs bedroom. ,4
18960,Bernadette,16, Wow.,4
18961,Howard,16," Wow, indeed.",4
18962,Bernadette,16, I can‰Ûªt believe we‰Ûªre finally living together.,4
18963,Howard,16, Yeah. You know what would make this moment perfect?,4
18964,Bernadette,16, What?,4
18965,Howard,16, A little snack. You got any string cheese?,4
18966,Bernadette,16," No. I, I might have some cheddar.",4
18967,Howard,16, Not as good. You can‰Ûªt make strings with it. Remind me to put it on your shopping list.,4
18968,Bernadette,16, Okay.,4
18969,Howard,16, You have hypo-allergenic detergent?,4
18970,Bernadette,16, No.,4
18971,Howard,16," Better put it on the list. If you wash my underwear with regular soap, I get little red bumps on my tuchus.",4
18972,Bernadette,16, Wait a second. I‰Ûªm doing your laundry?,4
18973,Howard,16," Well, honey, it‰Ûªs not gonna do itself. Oh, before I forget, tomorrow morning, you‰Ûªre driving me to the dentist.",4
18974,Bernadette,16, I have to take you?,4
18975,Howard,16, You don‰Ûªt have to take me. You get to take me.,4
18976,Bernadette,16, Wait a minute. Are you telling me your mother usually takes you to the dentist?,4
18977,Howard,16, It‰Ûªs not weird. There‰Ûªs lots of kids there with their moms.,4
18978,Bernadette,16, I can‰Ûªt believe this.,4
18979,Howard,16," What? It‰Ûªs fun. If I have no cavities, afterwards, we go out for a treat.",4
18980,Bernadette,16," All right, Howard, let‰Ûªs get something straight right now. I‰Ûªm not going to be your mother.",4
18981,Howard,16," Whoa, whoa, whoa! Where did that come from?",4
18982,Scene,16, Howard‰Ûªs house. ,4
18983,Mrs Wolowitz (off),16, Who‰Ûªs that? Is it a sex criminal?,4
18984,Howard,16," Nobody wants to do that to you, Ma.",4
18985,Mrs Wolowitz,16, Where were you?,4
18986,Howard,16, Didn‰Ûªt you read my email?,4
18987,Mrs Wolowitz,16, You know I can‰Ûªt turn on that ferkakta computer. I left you some brisket on the kitchen counter.,4
18988,Howard,16, Thank you.,4
18989,Mrs Wolowitz,16, Remember to floss after. We have the dentist in the morning!,4
18990,Scene,16, Penny‰Ûªs apartment. ,4
18991,Penny,16," Oh, hey. What‰Ûªs up?",4
18992,Amy,16, I just wanted to check in on you.,4
18993,Penny,16, Why?,4
18994,Amy,16," It seems like the appropriate thing to do when one‰Ûªs best friend finds herself replaced by a smart, beautiful woman with the smouldering sexuality of a crouched Bengal tiger.",4
18995,Penny,16," I already told you, I‰Ûªm okay with it. I mean, if anything, I‰Ûªm quite pleased (starting to blub) that Leonard has found someone (starting to blub) that makes him so happy.",4
18996,Amy,16," It‰Ûªs okay, it‰Ûªs okay.",4
18997,Penny,16, Thank you.,4
18998,Amy,16," Now, let‰Ûªs get these electrodes attached and see what‰Ûªs going on in that pretty little noggin of yours.",4
18999,Penny,16, Okay.,4
19000,Scene,16, The apartment. ,4
19001,Penny,16, I smell Chinese food.,4
19002,Sheldon,16, It‰Ûªs actually Thai. You‰Ûªre slipping.,4
19003,Penny,16, Are Leonard and Priya here?,4
19004,Sheldon,16, They went to Catalina for the weekend.,4
19005,Penny,16, Oh. Where‰Ûªs Raj?,4
19006,Sheldon,16," At home, forbidding it.",4
19007,Penny,16, How about Howard?,4
19008,Sheldon,16, I‰Ûªm given to understand his mother grounded him for running away.,4
19009,Penny,16," Oh, okay. Well, I guess it‰Ûªs just the two of us, huh?",4
19010,Sheldon,16," Actually, it‰Ûªs the three of us.",4
19011,Amy (on webcam),16," What up, bestie? Good news. Thanks to you, I was able to make a rhesus monkey cry like a disgraced televangelist.",4
19012,Penny,16, Great.,4
19013,Amy,16," So, you feeling better?",4
19014,Penny,16, Not really.,4
19015,Amy,16," Sheldon, you have a guest who‰Ûªs upset.",4
19016,Sheldon,16, Right. I‰Ûªll make tea.,4
19017,Penny,16," Oh, sweetie, it‰Ûªs okay. I don‰Ûªt want tea.",4
19018,Sheldon,16, I‰Ûªm sorry. It‰Ûªs not optional.,4
19019,Scene,17, The apartment. Sheldon is on the phone.,4
19020,Sheldon,17," Buona sera, Luigi‰Ûªs Pizza. Buona sera. It means good evening in Italian. May I say, having to explain that to you calls into question the authenticity of your ristorante?",4
19021,Leonard,17," Okay, I‰Ûªm out of here.",4
19022,Sheldon,17," Un momento. Oh, for heaven‰Ûªs sake, now you‰Ûªre being deliberately stupid. (to Leonard) Where are you going?",4
19023,Leonard,17, I‰Ûªm having dinner with Priya at Raj‰Ûªs. I think Howard‰Ûªs going to be there. You want to join us?,4
19024,Sheldon,17," But tonight‰Ûªs Thursday. On Thursdays, everybody comes over here and has pizza. Or a reasonable facsimile prepared by someone claiming to be Luigi, but who sounds suspiciously like Jackie Chan.",4
19025,Leonard,17, Can‰Ûªt we make a one-time exception for tonight?,4
19026,Sheldon,17," We could. We could also stop using the letter M, but I think that idea is isguided and oronic.",4
19027,Leonard,17, Just come with me to Raj‰Ûªs.,4
19028,Sheldon,17," Well, I don‰Ûªt want to go to a party.",4
19029,Leonard,17," It‰Ûªs not a party. It‰Ûªs the same group of people who hang out here, hanging out over there.",4
19030,Sheldon,17," I‰Ûªm sorry, but five people eating and chatting is a party.",4
19031,Leonard,17, How come it‰Ûªs not a party when we do it here?,4
19032,Sheldon,17, Because we don‰Ûªt throw parties.,4
19033,Leonard,17," I don‰Ûªt know what to tell you, Sheldon. I‰Ûªm going to see Priya. Everyone‰Ûªs over there. You coming or not?",4
19034,Sheldon,17," Well, no, sir, and do you know why? In a word, tradition. Every Thursday night for the last eight years, you and I and our friends have gathered here in this very spot to break bread covered with cheese and sauce, discuss the issues of the day, and yes, share a laugh or two. But I guess our rich heritage means nothing to you.",4
19035,Leonard,17, I guess you‰Ûªre right. See you later.,4
19036,Sheldon,17, Wait! Leonard! Wait! What am I going to do for dinner?,4
19037,Leonard,17, Come with me to Raj‰Ûªs and eat there.,4
19038,Sheldon,17, I can‰Ûªt do that. What if he serves haggis and blood pudding?,4
19039,Leonard,17, I really doubt that‰Ûªs what he‰Ûªll serve.,4
19040,Sheldon,17," But what if he does? I‰Ûªll be obliged to dine on liver and lungs stuffed in a sheep‰Ûªs stomach. And frankly, blood pudding is essentially the same thing. I don‰Ûªt know why he‰Ûªs serving both.",4
19041,Leonard,17," What do you want to do? You want to come with me, or do you want to sit here alone?",4
19042,Sheldon,17," No, I‰Ûªll go to your haggis party. But I‰Ûªm telling you, this is adness. This is utter and coplete adness.",4
19043,Sheldon,17," Oh, dear!",4
19044,Leonard,17, What?,4
19045,Sheldon,17, Raj‰Ûªs television. I just realized we‰Ûªre about to spend an evening watching a plasma screen with a cluster of dead pixels in the upper left-hand corner.,4
19046,Leonard,17, So don‰Ûªt watch TV. Read a book.,4
19047,Sheldon,17," And be a social pariah? Oh, you know that‰Ûªs not my style.",4
19048,Leonard,17, Ugh!,4
19049,Sheldon,17," The audible sigh is a show of exasperation, right?",4
19050,Leonard,17, Right.,4
19051,Sheldon,17, Is it about me or the dead pixels?,4
19052,Raj,17," Hey, you‰Ûªre just in time. We made Tex-Mex.",4
19053,Leonard,17," Oh, sounds great.",4
19054,Sheldon,17," Oh, Indians making Tex-Mex. Might as well have had the Chinese pizza.",4
19055,Priya,17," Hey, you.",4
19056,Leonard,17, Hi.,4
19057,Howard,17," That‰Ûªs got to be fun for you, huh? Watching Hofstadter suck the saliva out of your sister‰Ûªs mouth?",4
19058,Sheldon,17," Excuse me. Before this evening goes any further, we need to decide where everyone is going to sit.",4
19059,Priya,17," There is no assigned seats, Sheldon. Just sit anywhere. Make yourself comfortable.",4
19060,Sheldon,17," Oh, what fun. We‰Ûªre like hippies at a love-in.",4
19061,Leonard,17, Just sit here.,4
19062,Sheldon,17," Yeah, right on, man. Right on. Oh, look, it‰Ûªs Harry Potter and 98% of The Sorcerer‰Ûªs Stone.",4
19063,Raj,17," Okay, we‰Ûªve got fajitas with all the fixins, so you make your own.",4
19064,Sheldon,17," Wonderful. Dinner, some assembly required.",4
19065,Priya,17," Do you want a margarita, Sheldon?",4
19066,Sheldon,17, A margarita? Where are we? What is happening?,4
19067,Scene,17, The bar of the Cheesecake Factory,4
19068,Penny,17," Oh. Hey, Sheldon. What can I get ya?",4
19069,Sheldon,17, Water. Neat. With a little umbrella.,4
19070,Penny,17, Where are all your friends?,4
19071,Sheldon,17," Sadly, Penny, this evening, I am the Dark Knight, roaming these mean streets alone. A windbreaker for my cape, and a stern expression for my cowl.",4
19072,Penny,17, Okay.,4
19073,Sheldon,17, Excuse me? Isn‰Ûªt this the point where the world-weary barkeep absentmindedly wipes down the bar and coaxes the woes out of the troubled patron?,4
19074,Penny,17," Well, I was getting your stupid umbrella, but all right. What‰Ûªs troubling you, buddy?",4
19075,Sheldon,17," I don‰Ûªt think your heart‰Ûªs in it, but since you asked. Apparently, because Leonard is dating Raj‰Ûªs sister, we‰Ûªre all forced to hang out at his apartment.",4
19076,Penny,17," Oh, the horror.",4
19077,Sheldon,17," Indeed. Yeah, at one point, Raj put on reggae music, and his sister took off her shoes. It was like the last days of Caligula. (Phone rings) Oh, I have to get this. Umbrella?",4
19078,Penny,17, Ugh!,4
19079,Sheldon,17, Wonder what she‰Ûªs exasperated about. Hello?,4
19080,Amy (on phone),17," Sheldon, are you all right? When last we spoke, you were going to take a taxi home from Raj‰Ûªs, but according to Facebook, you just checked in at the Cheesecake Factory.",4
19081,Sheldon,17," Yes, I was in a taxi, but the driver didn‰Ûªt look at all like the photograph on his license, so I leapt out and ran for it.",4
19082,Amy,17, Wise.,4
19083,Penny,17, There you go. Just like recovering alcoholics drink in the Caribbean.,4
19084,Amy,17," Hi, bestie.",4
19085,Penny,17," Oh. Hi, Amy. How you been?",4
19086,Amy,17," Fine. From this angle, I can see up your nose.",4
19087,Penny,17," Yeah, it‰Ûªs a great time to be alive, isn‰Ûªt it?",4
19088,Sheldon,17, Don‰Ûªt worry. My problems can wait while you two hens finish your clucking.,4
19089,Penny,17," Look, Sheldon, Leonard is dating Priya. She is staying with Raj. That means you‰Ûªre all probably gonna be hanging out there more.",4
19090,Amy,17," Penny, I‰Ûªm sorry you got dragged into this. I know you‰Ûªre devastated that your ex-boyfriend has found an exciting new lover with flawless, caramel-coloured skin.",4
19091,Penny,17," Okay, I‰Ûªm not upset about Leonard and Priya.",4
19092,Amy,17, Your flaring nostrils indicate otherwise.,4
19093,Sheldon,17, Cluck-cluck-cluck.,4
19094,Amy,17," Sheldon, look at me. I think it‰Ûªs time to face the fact that Leonard is the nucleus of your social group. Where he goes, the group goes.",4
19095,Sheldon,17, Leonard the nucleus? That makes no sense. I‰Ûªm the whimsical elf that everyone looks to for a good time.,4
19096,Amy,17, I‰Ûªm not saying that you‰Ûªre not fun. You‰Ûªre the most fun person I know.,4
19097,Penny,17, A lot of people think I‰Ûªm fun to be around.,4
19098,Amy,17," Don‰Ûªt be needy, bestie. That‰Ûªs probably part of what chased Leonard away. What I am saying, Sheldon, is that your group is Leonard-centric. If it were a town, it would be Leonardville. If it were an Islamic nation, Leonardstan. If it were the birthplace of motion pictures, we‰Ûªd all be singing Hooray for Leonardwood.",4
19099,Penny,17," Ooh, I got one. If you guys were a band, you‰Ûªd be called Leonard and the Leonards.",4
19100,Amy,17, So needy.,4
19101,Scene,17, The apartment. ,4
19102,Leonard,17, What you doing?,4
19103,Sheldon,17, I‰Ûªm setting out snacks.,4
19104,Leonard,17, You do realize everyone‰Ûªs eating at Raj‰Ûªs again tonight?,4
19105,Sheldon,17," I didn‰Ûªt say the snacks were for you now, did I, Nosy Rosie?",4
19106,Leonard,17, You‰Ûªre having people over?,4
19107,Sheldon,17," Yes. Must be killing you wondering who. Fine, I‰Ûªll tell you. Stuart from the comic bookstore, Barry Kripke from the university, Penny‰Ûªs ex-boyfriend Zack and TV‰Ûªs LeVar Burton.",4
19108,Leonard,17, Really? LeVar Burton‰Ûªs coming here?,4
19109,Sheldon,17, Possibly. I Tweeted him.,4
19110,Leonard,17," Okay, well, tell him I loved him on Star Trek.",4
19111,Sheldon,17," Please, Leonard, stop trying to horn in on my new friends.",4
19112,Leonard,17, Of course. Good night.,4
19113,Sheldon,17, Leonard.,4
19114,Leonard,17, Yeah?,4
19115,Sheldon,17," We had a good run, you and I.",4
19116,Leonard,17, Okay.,4
19117,Sheldon,17, But change is a part of life.,4
19118,Leonard,17, It certainly is.,4
19119,Sheldon,17, Okay. I have guests coming. I‰Ûªm afraid I‰Ûªm going to have to ask you to leave now.,4
19120,Leonard,17, I am leaving.,4
19121,Sheldon,17," Don‰Ûªt make this harder than it is, Leonard.",4
19122,Leonard,17," Good-bye, Sheldon.",4
19123,Sheldon,17," And good-bye to you, sir. He‰Ûªll be back.",4
19124,Leonard,17, Of course I‰Ûªll be back. I live here!,4
19125,Scene,17," The apartment, later. ",4
19126,Sheldon,17," Well, it would appear LeVar Burton won‰Ûªt be joining us so let‰Ûªs get started. Um, I thought we‰Ûªd begin by going around the room, introducing ourselves and saying a little bit about why we‰Ûªre here. Okay. I‰Ûªm Sheldon. Uh, for regular readers of The New England Journal of High Energy Physics, I need no introduction. If you‰Ûªre not familiar with that publication, there‰Ûªs a free copy in your goody bag. Stuart?",4
19127,Stuart,17," Um. Hi. I‰Ûªm Stuart. I run a comic bookstore, which for financial reasons, I‰Ûªm currently living in. And I guess what I‰Ûªm hoping for most out of tonight is a hot shower.",4
19128,Sheldon,17," That‰Ûªs very nice, Stuart. Zack?",4
19129,Zack,17," I‰Ûªm Zack, and I‰Ûªm, uh‰Û_ uh‰Û_ could you come back to me?",4
19130,Sheldon,17, Of course. Barry?,4
19131,Barry,17," I‰Ûªm Barry Kwipke, and I‰Ûªm here because you told me there was going to be a whaffle. When is the whaffle?",4
19132,Sheldon,17," Patience, patience, Barry. The whaffle‰Û_ the raffle is the grand finale to an evening-long festival of fun and folly.",4
19133,Barry,17, One more question‰Û_,4
19134,Sheldon,17," Yes, you must be present to win.",4
19135,Zack,17," Okay, I‰Ûªm ready. I‰Ûªm Zack, and I‰Ûªm, uh‰Û_ oh, crap, why is this so hard?",4
19136,Scene,17, Penny‰Ûªs apartment.,4
19137,Penny,17," Oh, hey.",4
19138,Bernadette,17, Hi.,4
19139,Amy,17," Yo, P-dog.",4
19140,Penny,17, What‰Ûªs up?,4
19141,Bernadette,17, We‰Ûªre here to kidnap you for a girls‰Ûª night out.,4
19142,Amy,17," Parenthetical, the term kidnap is being used playfully.",4
19143,Penny,17, I kind of figured that.,4
19144,Amy,17, Good. Now put this pillowcase over your head.,4
19145,Penny,17, No.,4
19146,Amy,17," She used to be much more fun, until Leonard punched her in the heart.",4
19147,Bernadette,17," We just thought you might want to go out and have a good time, maybe go dancing.",4
19148,Penny,17," Oh. Gee, thanks, but I‰Ûªm not really in the mood.",4
19149,Amy,17, You do understand that it will distract you from obsessing over the rich variety of sweet loving that your ex-boyfriend is currently receiving from the fiery jewel of Mumbai.,4
19150,Penny,17," Okay, look, if I agree to go out with you guys, will you promise to stop pestering me about Leonard and Priya?",4
19151,Amy,17, Yes.,4
19152,Bernadette,17, Sure.,4
19153,Penny,17, All right. I‰Ûªll go change. Come on in.,4
19154,Amy,17," If you‰Ûªd have let me bring the chloroform, we wouldn‰Ûªt have had to put up with all this jibber-jabber.",4
19155,Scene,17, The apartment. ,4
19156,Zack,17," Anyway, after we get done snowboarding, I go back to the lodge and get in the Jacuzzi. There‰Ûªs no one around, so naturally, I‰Ûªm free-balling it. Next thing I know, this beautiful chick shows up, drunk out of her skull, wants to get in with me.",4
19157,Sheldon,17, Question. Was it a Jacuzzi or a hot tub?,4
19158,Barry,17, Weally? That‰Ûªs your question?,4
19159,Zack,17, What‰Ûªs the difference?,4
19160,Sheldon,17," Jacuzzi is a commercial brand. Hot tub is the generic term, i.e., all Jacuzzis are hot tubs, but not all hot tubs are Jacuzzis.",4
19161,Zack,17," Is that like all thumbs are fingers, but not all fingers are thumbs?",4
19162,Sheldon,17," Surprisingly, yes.",4
19163,Zack,17," Nice. Now, what exactly are toes?",4
19164,Stuart,17, Can you please get back to the drunk girl? I‰Ûªd like something to think about in the shower.,4
19165,Zack,17," Oh, yeah. Right. Anyway, she takes off all of her clothes, climbs into the hot tub, and the first thing I notice‰Û_",4
19166,Sheldon,17, The water level rose.,4
19167,Zack,17, No.,4
19168,Sheldon,17," Of course it did. It‰Ûªs said that Archimedes, the ancient Greek mathematician, discovered the principle of displacement while taking a bath.",4
19169,Barry,17," Tewwific. Go ahead, Zack. Naked dwunk girl, fwee-balling, continue.",4
19170,Sheldon,17," Forgive me, but I think you‰Ûªll find my story is more interesting.",4
19171,Barry,17, Does yours have wet bweasts in it?,4
19172,Sheldon,17," Better. It has a gold crown. You see, the king wondered how much gold was in it and charged Archimedes with coming up with the solution. Because the crown was irregularly shaped, there was no way to mathematically determine its volume. But, while bathing, Archimedes realized he could immerse the crown and measure the amount the water rose.",4
19173,Zack,17," So, long story short, I nailed her.",4
19174,Sheldon,17," When he finished, he shouted Eureka!",4
19175,Zack,17," No, I always shout, Holy Moly! Don‰Ûªt know why. Just do.",4
19176,Sheldon,17," All right, that concludes the getting to know you portion of the evening. Who‰Ûªs ready to play some vintage video games? And tonight‰Ûªs selections include ColecoVision‰Ûªs Smurf Rescue in Gargamel‰Ûªs Castle, Atari‰Ûªs Cookie Monster Munch, and for you text adventure aficionados, Zork. Pick me, pick me. I‰Ûªm fun.",4
19177,Barry,17," That all sucks the big haiwy meatball. How about I go get the kawaoke machine out of my car, get plastered and blow the woof off this place?",4
19178,Zack,17," Great, I‰Ûªll make a beer run.",4
19179,Stuart,17, And I‰Ûªll take a shower. We‰Ûªll meet back here in fifteen.,4
19180,Barry,17, Check.,4
19181,Sheldon,17, I‰Ûªm unhappy.,4
19182,Scene,17, Raj‰Ûªs apartment. ,4
19183,Leonard,17, This is delicious. Where‰Ûªd you learn to make chili?,4
19184,Priya,17," When I was at university in England, my flatmate was from Texas.",4
19185,Leonard,17, I hope she wasn‰Ûªt anything like my flatmate from Texas.,4
19186,Priya,17," Sheldon is a bit quirky, isn‰Ûªt he?",4
19187,Howard,17," Oh, please. That crazy bastard‰Ûªs looking at quirky in the rearview mirror.",4
19188,Leonard,17," Did you know that, per our roommate agreement, I have to wash my feet before I get in the shower? And not in the sink. We each have special buckets.",4
19189,Howard,17," Raj, did you ever tell your sister about the time Sheldon got punched by Bill Gates?",4
19190,Priya,17," Oh, God, you‰Ûªre kidding.",4
19191,Raj,17," Nope. Gates gave a speech at the university. Sheldon went up to him afterwards and said, maybe if you weren‰Ûªt so distracted by sick children in Africa, you could have put a little more thought into Windows Vista.‰Û",4
19192,Leonard,17, Bam. Right in the nose. Made me proud to own a PC.,4
19193,Raj,17, I‰Ûªd like to propose a toast to a rare and wonderful Sheldon-free evening.,4
19194,Leonard,17," Hear, hear.",4
19195,Howard,17, Cheers. You realize that‰Ûªs the first time we‰Ûªve ever done that without having to listen to Sheldon tell us why it‰Ûªs called a toast?,4
19196,Priya,17, Why is it called a toast?,4
19197,Leonard,17," Oh, the ancient Romans put spiced toast in their punch bowls.",4
19198,Raj,17, Sheldon tells it better.,4
19199,Leonard,17, He kind of does.,4
19200,Howard,17, Yeah.,4
19201,Leonard,17," Aw, hell, I miss him.",4
19202,Scene,17, Penny‰Ûªs apartment. ,4
19203,Penny,17," So, where do you guys want to go dancing?",4
19204,Bernadette,17, We were hoping you‰Ûªd know a place.,4
19205,Amy,17," Yes, perhaps somewhere packed tightly with young, beautiful bodies sweating and writhing against each other in a glorious orgy of the flesh.",4
19206,Penny,17," Oh, yeah, I know that place. What do you think?",4
19207,Amy,17," That should display enough of your bosom to attract a new mate, or a hungry infant.",4
19208,Penny,17," Okay, let‰Ûªs go through this one more time. Just because Leonard has a new girlfriend does not mean I need to go out and hook up with some guy.",4
19209,Bernadette,17," But you could if you wanted to, right?",4
19210,Penny,17," Well, yeah, I guess.",4
19211,Bernadette,17," Pick out the hottest guy in the room, take him home, do unspeakable things to him, then kick him to the curb with a smile on his face and teeth marks on his heinie?",4
19212,Penny,17, More or less.,4
19213,Amy,17, What‰Ûªs that like?,4
19214,Penny,17," I don‰Ûªt know. It‰Ûªs fun while you‰Ûªre doing it. And then after, it‰Ûªs mostly embarrassment, self-loathing and regret.",4
19215,Bernadette,17, I would take that deal all day long.,4
19216,Penny,17," Yeah, well, it‰Ûªs not gonna happen tonight. You know, for the first time in my life, I am not in a relationship, and I‰Ûªm totally okay with it.",4
19217,Amy,17," You know, if being on your own is new to you, I‰Ûªd be happy to share some tension-relieving techniques for ladies I‰Ûªve perfected over the years. For example, do you have an electric toothbrush?",4
19218,Penny,17," Um, no.",4
19219,Amy,17, You should get one.,4
19220,Bernadette,17, What‰Ûªs that?,4
19221,Amy,17, It appears to be something preserved between two pieces of acrylic.,4
19222,Penny,17," Oh, it‰Ûªs a snowflake from the North Pole. Leonard gave it to me last year.",4
19223,Bernadette,17," Oh, God, that is so romantic.",4
19224,Penny,17," Yeah, it was.",4
19225,Bernadette,17, Leonard‰Ûªs really one of a kind.,4
19226,Amy,17," Saying that while holding a snowflake is a little bit heavy-handed, don‰Ûªt you think?",4
19227,Penny,17," Let me see that. Oh, screw it. I can deal with a little self-loathing. Let‰Ûªs go find me a heinie to bite.",4
19228,Amy,17," Outstanding. And if we fail, we can always stop at CVS and pick you out a nice toothbrush. I call mine Gerard.",4
19229,Bernadette,17, That‰Ûªs kind of creepy.,4
19230,Scene,17, The apartment. Barry and Zack are singing ‰ÛÏDon‰Ûªt Go Breaking My Heart‰Û,4
19231,Stuart,17, Anybody do Walking on Sunshine yet?,4
19232,Sheldon,17, No.,4
19233,Stuart,17, Dibs.,4
19234,Scene,17, Raj‰Ûªs apartment. ,4
19235,Priya,17," I‰Ûªm sorry, Sheldon bought a loom and learned how to weave?",4
19236,Leonard,17, He actually got pretty good. He made us all matching serapes.,4
19237,Raj,17, I still wear mine when there‰Ûªs a nip in the air.,4
19238,Priya,17," Now, was this before or after he adopted the 25 cats?",4
19239,Leonard,17, Long before the cats. I think it was around the time he tried to declare our apartment a sovereign nation. I still have some of the currency.,4
19240,Sheldon (outside),17," (Knock, knock, knock) All my friends. (Knock, knock, knock) All my friends. (Knock, knock, knock) All my friends.",4
19241,Howard,17, I think it‰Ûªs like Beetlejuice. We said his name too many times.,4
19242,Raj,17, Come on in.,4
19243,Sheldon,17, Thank you.,4
19244,Leonard,17, Hey. I thought you were with your new buddies.,4
19245,Sheldon,17, I had to leave. They were having fun wrong.,4
19246,Priya,17," Come here, Sheldon. Sit here with me.",4
19247,Sheldon,17, Thank you.,4
19248,Priya,17, Would you like some homemade chili?,4
19249,Sheldon,17, Are there beans in it?,4
19250,Priya,17, Yes.,4
19251,Sheldon,17," Then it‰Ûªs not chili. Real chili has no beans in it, but you‰Ûªre from a foreign land, so your ignorance is forgiven.",4
19252,Priya,17," Sheldon, do you want some or not?",4
19253,Sheldon,17," Yes, please. Your girlfriend‰Ûªs a little short-tempered.",4
19254,Raj,17," I‰Ûªd like to propose a toast to friends, no matter how quirky.",4
19255,All,17, Cheers.,4
19256,Sheldon,17," Priya, do you know why this is called a toast?",4
19257,Priya,17," Actually, I do. I believe the Romans used to put spiced toast in their punch bowls.",4
19258,Sheldon,17, She‰Ûªs also a bit of a know-it-all. Mmm. This is good. Whatever it is.,4
19259,Scene,17, The apartment. Stuart is singing ‰ÛÏWalking on Sunshine‰Û. Barry and Zack are doing backing vocals. ,4
19260,LeVar Burton,17," Hello? I‰Û_ Oh, I don‰Ûªt think so. I am so done with Twitter.",4
19261,Scene,18, Leonard‰Ûªs bedroom,4
19262,Priya,18, Morning.,4
19263,Leonard,18, Morning.,4
19264,Priya,18, Sleep okay?,4
19265,Leonard,18," Mm-hmm. Great. Hey, can I ask you something?",4
19266,Priya,18, Sure.,4
19267,Leonard,18," Last night, me wanting to try that stuff out of the Kama Sutra, was that fun for you or kinda racially insensitive?",4
19268,Priya,18," Yeah, just because you‰Ûªre in bed with an Indian woman, you think that gives you permission to use crazy positions from an ancient Indian love manual?",4
19269,Leonard,18," Hey, if you can find a book called weird sex with white boys, I‰Ûªd be okay with that.",4
19270,Priya,18," No, you have such beautiful eyes. Have you ever thought about getting contacts?",4
19271,Leonard,18, I tried in the seventh grade. I could never get used to them.,4
19272,Priya,18," Oh, that‰Ûªs too bad.",4
19273,Leonard,18," Yeah, if I had contacts I would have been the coolest debate club president ever to be stuffed into his own cello case.",4
19274,Priya,18," If you had them on now, you could see what we‰Ûªre going to do next.",4
19275,Leonard,18, Th-th-th-that‰Ûªs okay. I can infer from context.,4
19276,Scene,18, The cafeteria.,4
19277,Howard,18," Hey, Raj, wanna see a new magic trick I‰Ûªve been working on?",4
19278,Sheldon,18," Howard, if I may interject here with a piece of friendly advice. Is working on magic tricks really how you want to spend your time? Granted, you‰Ûªre just an engineer, but that doesn‰Ûªt mean you might not someday build a geegaw or a thingamabob that may get you a thank you in someone else‰Ûªs Nobel prize acceptance speech.",4
19279,Raj,18," Is the trick making him disappear? Sure, let‰Ûªs see it.",4
19280,Howard,18," Here, shuffle these.",4
19281,Raj,18, Okay.,4
19282,Howard,18," Now spread them out on the table face down. Pick one, look at it.",4
19283,Raj,18, Okay.,4
19284,Howard,18," Now remember your card, put it back in the deck.",4
19285,Sheldon,18, Is it any wonder he doesn‰Ûªt have a doctorate?,4
19286,Howard,18," Remind me, what‰Ûªs your birthday?",4
19287,Raj,18, October sixth.,4
19288,Howard,18," Okay, October is the tenth month. So ten, one plus zero is one, plus six is seven. Turn over the seventh card.",4
19289,Raj,18, How about that!,4
19290,Howard,18, Is that your card?,4
19291,Raj,18," Yes, it is. Very cool!",4
19292,Sheldon,18, It‰Ûªs not cool. It‰Ûªs a childish trick designed to confuse and intrigue simpletons. How‰Ûªd you do it?,4
19293,Howard,18, A magician never reveals his secrets. But surely a future Nobel prize winner can figure it out.,4
19294,Sheldon,18, Fine. Give me a second.,4
19295,Howard,18," You ever notice when he thinks real hard, it smells like bacon?",4
19296,Random man,18," Oh, hey!",4
19297,Leonard,18, Sorry! Oop!,4
19298,Leonard,18," Sorry! Pardon me! Oh, I‰Ûªm so sorry! My fault! Check it out. I just got contacts.",4
19299,Scene,18, The apartment.,4
19300,Penny,18," One, two, three, four, five. No way.",4
19301,Howard,18," That‰Ûªs your card, right?",4
19302,Penny,18, Seven of clubs! That is amazing!,4
19303,Sheldon,18, It‰Ûªs not amazing. All magic tricks are merely a combination of manipulation and misdirection with the occasional dwarf in a box wiggling his feet.,4
19304,Howard,18," Oh, really? So how did I do it?",4
19305,Sheldon,18," Well, I don‰Ûªt care how you did it. I have more important things to think about. Clearly, the cards are marked.",4
19306,Howard,18, I thought you had more important things to think about.,4
19307,Sheldon,18," I do. You just happen to have caught me on a break. Oh, let me see those cards.",4
19308,Penny,18," Oh, big deal. Not knowing is part of the fun.",4
19309,Sheldon,18, Not knowing is part of the fun. Was that the motto of your community college?,4
19310,Leonard,18," Hey, guys, what do you think? Priya took me clothes shopping.",4
19311,Penny,18," Hey, you look great. Good for you, Priya. I could never get that stupid hoodie off him when we were‰Û_ well, you look great.",4
19312,Leonard,18, Thank you.,4
19313,Priya,18, Lets go hang everything up.,4
19314,Leonard,18," Yeah, good. New contacts. I should have done this years ago.",4
19315,Howard,18, So you finally getting used to them doing it on a daily basis?,4
19316,Penny,18, I‰Ûªm not going out with him. He can sleep with whoever he wants.,4
19317,Howard,18," Yeah, I was talking to Raj.",4
19318,Penny,18, Oopsy.,4
19319,Sheldon,18, This deck is rigged in some fashion.,4
19320,Howard,18, Fine. Get another deck and I‰Ûªll do the trick with that.,4
19321,Sheldon,18, So you‰Ûªre saying this is a regulation deck?,4
19322,Howard,18," I‰Ûªm saying believe in magic, you muggle.",4
19323,Penny,18," You know, well, I‰Ûªm happy Leonard‰Ûªs found someone. Not that anybody asked.",4

19325,Priya,18, How many Star Trek uniforms do you have?,4
19326,Leonard,18, Just two. Everyday and dress.,4
19327,Priya,18," Uh-huh. Listen, we need to talk about something.",4
19328,Leonard,18," Oh, my god, you‰Ûªre breaking up with me! Why would you take me out shopping and then break up with me? That is so cruel.",4
19329,Priya,18," Leonard, I‰Ûªm not breaking up with you.",4
19330,Leonard,18," Oh, okay. So, what‰Ûªs up?",4
19331,Priya,18," It‰Ûªs a little weird, your ex-girlfriend hanging out here all the time.",4
19332,Leonard,18," I know. I usually never see my ex-girlfriends, unless their hard drives crash.",4
19333,Priya,18," I‰Ûªm just saying, how would you feel if I was hanging out with my ex-boyfriend?",4
19334,Leonard,18," Um, not great, I guess. But Penny and I are just friends.",4
19335,Priya,18," I don‰Ûªt care. This is a woman you have slept with. If you want her around, then I have to wonder if maybe you‰Ûªre not ready to move on.",4
19336,Leonard,18," No, no-no-no, I‰Ûªm ready! I gave up the gift of sight for you. If that‰Ûªs not moving on, what is?",4
19337,Priya,18, You need to cut the cord with Penny.,4
19338,Leonard,18, Oh. Okay.,4
19339,Priya,18, You don‰Ûªt sound very confident.,4
19340,Leonard,18," No, no, I‰Ûªm confident. It‰Ûªs not like I‰Ûªm unfamiliar with the get lost conversation. Although, this will be the first time I‰Ûªll be the one saying it.",4
19341,Priya,18, Thank you. I appreciate it.,4
19342,Leonard,18," Sure. Oh, god, you smell so good. Of course, that could just be my other senses getting stronger. Hypothetically, if I had access To a Lieutenant Uhura uniform, would you wear it?",4
19343,Priya,18," Leonard, it is a source of great pain to me and my family that my brother has that outfit in his wardrobe. Can we not discuss it?",4
19344,Leonard,18," I‰Ûªm sorry. I‰Ûªm, never mind.",4
19345,Scene,18, The apartment,4
19346,Howard,18, And was your card the jack of diamonds?,4
19347,Penny,18," Oh, unbelievable! Know how he did it yet?",4
19348,Sheldon,18, Um‰Û_,4
19349,Penny,18," Aw, he has the same look my little nephew gets when he can‰Ûªt figure out how I got his nose.",4
19350,Howard,18," You know, I have some remedial magic tricks that might be more your speed. Like, ooh, look! The pencil‰Ûªs rubber!",4
19351,Penny,18," Hey, I think I know how you did the card trick.",4
19352,Sheldon,18," Oh, oh, please, if I don‰Ûªt know, you don‰Ûªt know. That‰Ûªs axiomatic.",4
19353,Penny,18, Come here. (Whispers to Howard),4
19354,Howard,18, You‰Ûªre right.,4
19355,Penny,18, Not too bad for someone who doesn‰Ûªt know what axiomatic means.,4
19356,Scene,18, The laundry room.,4
19357,Leonard,18," Oh, hi.",4
19358,Penny,18," Hey, you. What happened with the contacts?",4
19359,Leonard,18, One of them‰Ûªs upstairs. The other one sort of slipped back into my skull.,4
19360,Penny,18," Hey, is that one of the new shirts Priya got you?",4
19361,Leonard,18, Yeah.,4
19362,Penny,18, You don‰Ûªt wanna wash that.,4
19363,Leonard,18, No?,4
19364,Penny,18," No, that‰Ûªs silk. Seriously, what would you do without me?",4
19365,Leonard,18, Yeah.,4
19366,Penny,18," You know, I gotta tell you, I think you got a real winner with Priya.",4
19367,Leonard,18," Yeah, me, too.",4
19368,Penny,18," She seems really sweet. Believe me, you do not want to take that for granted. There are a lot of bitches out there.",4
19369,Leonard,18," Yeah, bitches are the worst.",4
19370,Penny,18," All right, well I‰Ûªll see you later.",4
19371,Leonard,18," Uh, Penny, there‰Ûªs something I have to tell you.",4
19372,Penny,18, What?,4
19373,Leonard,18," Okay, uh, how do I put this? Um, are you familiar with Darwin‰Ûªs observation of the finches in the Galapagos Islands?",4
19374,Penny,18, Did they make a movie about it?,4
19375,Leonard,18, No.,4
19376,Penny,18, Then no.,4
19377,Leonard,18," All right, well, anyway, Darwin observed that when two groups of finches competed over the same food source, eventually one of them would evolve a different beak shape so they could feed on something else.",4
19378,Penny,18, Okay.,4
19379,Leonard,18, So what do you think we can learn from that behaviour that we can apply to our own lives?,4
19380,Penny,18," Uh, a bird in the hand is worth two in the bush?",4
19381,Leonard,18," Sure, that has birds in it.",4
19382,Penny,18," It‰Ûªs fun talking to you, Leonard, I always learn stuff.",4
19383,Leonard,18," I‰Ûªm sorry, but I‰Ûªm gonna count that.",4
19384,Scene,18, Leonard‰Ûªs bedroom,4
19385,Priya,18, Do you really have to wear that in bed?,4
19386,Leonard,18, Yeah. The doctor didn‰Ûªt want me to rub my eye during the night. It was either this or one of those giant neck cones.,4
19387,Priya,18, So did you get to talk to Penny?,4
19388,Leonard,18," Oh, yes. Indeed, I did.",4
19389,Priya,18, And?,4
19390,Leonard,18, She completely understood everything I said. Case closed.,4
19391,Priya,18, Was she upset?,4
19392,Leonard,18," Maybe, but that‰Ûªs not my problem. She‰Ûªs not my girlfriend, you are.",4
19393,Priya,18, I hope you weren‰Ûªt cruel to her.,4
19394,Leonard,18," Is the autumn cruel for letting the flowers die, or is that just nature‰Ûªs way?",4
19395,Sheldon,18," (Knock, knock, knock) Leonard? (Knock, knock, knock) Leonard? (Knock, knock, knock) Leonard?",4
19396,Leonard,18, What?,4
19397,Sheldon,18," I think I figured out Wolowitz‰Ûªs magic trick, and I need you to pick a card.",4
19398,Leonard,18," I am not opening that door, Sheldon.",4
19399,Sheldon,18," As you wish. (Cards slide under door) Pick a card, put it back, and prepare to be amazed. (Leonard does not) Did you pick one?",4
19400,Leonard,18, Yep.,4
19401,Sheldon,18, (Sliding card under door) Is this your card?,4
19402,Leonard,18, (Not looking) Nope.,4
19403,Sheldon,18, Drat. Is this your card?,4
19404,Leonard,18, No.,4
19405,Sheldon,18, I‰Ûªll be right back.,4
19406,Scene,18, The apartment. Sheldon is alone.,4
19407,Sheldon,18," Pick a card, Sheldon. Now look at it, and put it back in the deck. Now do you remember your card? Of course I do, I have an eidetic memory. My apologies. Now shuffle the cards. Shuffling. Wait here. Processing image, cross-referencing.",4
19408,Leonard,18, Whatcha doin‰Ûª?,4
19409,Sheldon,18, I‰Ûªm reverse engineering Wolowitz‰Ûªs magic trick.,4
19410,Leonard,18, What‰Ûªs up with the infrared cameras?,4
19411,Sheldon,18," I‰Ûªm measuring residual heat levels on the playing cards to determine which one‰Ûªs been touched. By the way, if you hope to have children, I suggest you switch from briefs to boxers. Your testicles look a tad warm.",4
19412,Leonard,18," Holy crap, are you connected to the Oak Ridge National Laboratory?",4
19413,Sheldon,18, Yes. I‰Ûªm using their Cray Supercomputer to analyze shuffling patterns.,4
19414,Leonard,18," Sheldon, that computer is used for National defence. Hacking into it is a Federal crime.",4
19415,Sheldon,18," Relax, we‰Ûªre not under attack right now.",4
19416,Leonard,18," Okay, I‰Ûªm leaving before the black helicopters get here.",4
19417,Sheldon,18," And is this my card? Rats! I wonder if Howard used a radioactive tracer. Where am I going to find Uranium-235 this time of night? Come on, Craigslist.",4
19418,Scene,18, A restaurant,4
19419,Leonard,18, Is it racist that I took you to an Indian restaurant?,4
19420,Priya,18," It‰Ûªs okay, I like Indian food.",4
19421,Leonard,18," Or as you probably call it back home, food.",4
19422,Priya,18, Why didn‰Ûªt you wear your contacts? Don‰Ûªt you like them?,4
19423,Leonard,18," No, no, I do. It‰Ûªs just I knew I was having curry tonight and I only want one part of my body to burn at a time.",4
19424,Priya,18," You know, my company offered me a position here in Los Angeles.",4
19425,Leonard,18, Does that mean you‰Ûªd relocate here permanently?,4
19426,Priya,18, Maybe. What do you think?,4
19427,Leonard,18,"Oh, åÊI love it. Oh, that‰Ûªs great!",4
19428,Penny (knocking on window),18, Hi! Hi! Just hang on.,4
19429,Leonard,18, Small world.,4
19430,Priya,18," You did talk to her, didn‰Ûªt you?",4
19431,Leonard,18," Of course, I did. I talked and talked and talked.",4
19432,Penny,18," Hey! Look at Leonard in his fancy-ass grownup clothes. Way to go, Priya. For once, he doesn‰Ûªt look like a mannequin in the boys‰Ûª department. Hey, did he tell you I saved the silk shirt?",4
19433,Priya,18," No, he did not.",4
19434,Penny,18," He was gonna throw it in the washing machine with his Spiderman underwear. That‰Ûªs our Lenny, huh?",4
19435,Priya,18," Yes, that‰Ûªs our Lenny.",4
19436,Penny,18," So, how‰Ûªs the food here? Oh, wow, that is really, really good. Oh, I‰Ûªm sorry. You guys are on a date. We can hang out anytime. Have fun.",4
19437,Leonard,18, Bye.,4
19438,Priya,18, Good night.,4
19439,Penny,18," Oh, that‰Ûªs, hot, hot, hot, hot! Whoo! It really sneaks up on ya, huh? All right, I gotta go.",4
19440,Leonard,18, It is pretty spicy.,4
19441,Scene,18, The cafeteria.,4
19442,Sheldon,18," Oh, I‰Ûªve been meaning to tell you, I figured out your magic trick.",4
19443,Howard,18, Really?,4
19444,Sheldon,18," Oh, yes. In fact, I improved upon it.",4
19445,Howard,18," I‰Ûªd love to see that. How about you, Raj?",4
19446,Raj,18, Beefaroni and a show? How do you turn that down?,4
19447,Sheldon,18, All right. Pick a card.,4
19448,Howard,18, Okay.,4
19449,Sheldon,18, Bippity-boppity-boo.,4
19450,Howard,18, What‰Ûªs with the wand and the beep?,4
19451,Sheldon,18," The wand is called showmanship, and the beep is none of your business. Oh! Excuse me, I‰Ûªm getting a text message completely unrelated to this magic trick. Oh, look, my dry cleaning‰Ûªs ready. And your card was the five of spades. Ta-da.",4
19452,Raj,18, These cards have barcodes on them. The wand is a reader. It‰Ûªs transmitting to your phone.,4
19453,Sheldon,18," I said, ta-da. Show‰Ûªs over.",4
19454,Howard,18," That‰Ûªs pathetic. Let me show you how a real magician does it. Raj, take a card. Don‰Ûªt let me see it.",4
19455,Raj,18, Okay.,4
19456,Howard,18, Three of clubs. (It isn‰Ûªt),4
19457,Raj,18," Son of a gun, you‰Ûªre blowing my mind!",4
19458,Howard,18, Bippity-boppity-boo-yah!,4
19459,Sheldon,18, That does it. I‰Ûªm getting uranium.,4
19460,Raj,18, You ever gonna tell him?,4
19461,Howard,18, Maybe. When it stops being fun.,4
19462,Raj,18, So never.,4
19463,Scene,18, Penny‰Ûªs door.,4
19464,Penny,18," Oh, hey, I was just on my way to work.",4
19465,Leonard,18," Oh, okay, it‰Ûªs not important. It can wait.",4
19466,Penny,18," No, it‰Ûªs all right. Walk me down. So, what‰Ûªs up?",4
19467,Leonard,18," Uh, I kind of have a problem I was hoping you could help me with.",4
19468,Penny,18," Sure, anything.",4
19469,Leonard,18, Move out.,4
19470,Penny,18, What?,4
19471,Leonard,18," Well, uh, not far. Hey, if you ever wanna start a family, La CaÌ±ada has some great schools.",4
19472,Penny,18," Okay, I‰Ûªm not moving anywhere. What the hell is this all about?",4
19473,Leonard,18," Why does it have to be about anything? Can‰Ûªt a fella ask his buddy to relocate, no questions asked?",4
19474,Penny,18," Oh, for god‰Ûªs sake, Leonard, this is about Priya, isn‰Ûªt it? She doesn‰Ûªt want me hanging out with you.",4
19475,Leonard,18," Yes. There, I said it.",4
19476,Penny,18," Okay, look, I happen to like your girlfriend.",4
19477,Leonard,18, And she likes you.,4
19478,Penny,18," No, she doesn‰Ûªt.",4
19479,Leonard,18," Not really, no.",4
19480,Penny,18," It doesn‰Ûªt matter. Look, I promise from now on I will keep my distance from you.",4
19481,Leonard,18," Well, now, hold on. What kind of distance are we talking about? Because we are neighbours. I mean, I can hear the toilet flush in your apartment.",4
19482,Penny,18, You can hear my toilet flush?,4
19483,Leonard,18," I don‰Ûªt listen for it, but it‰Ûªs nice to know everything‰Ûªs okay with your plumbing. The building‰Ûªs plumbing.",4
19484,Penny,18," Leonard, I get it. You‰Ûªre in a new relationship now. And I‰Ûªm happy for you. So why don‰Ûªt we just shake hands and part friends?",4
19485,Leonard,18," Well, now hold on, how about this? How about we still hang out, but on the down-low?",4
19486,Penny,18, Are you really that kind of guy?,4
19487,Leonard,18, No. I actually felt kinda silly just saying on the down-low.,4
19488,Penny,18," Good-bye, Leonard.",4
19489,Leonard,18," Penny, wait. (Bumps into door) Damned contacts.",4
19490,Scene,18, The cafeteria.,4
19491,Howard,18, Incoming.,4
19492,Raj,18, Hi!,4
19493,Howard,18, Hey!,4
19494,Sheldon,18, Hello.,4
19495,Raj,18," Why so glum, chum?",4
19496,Sheldon,18," Apparently, you can‰Ûªt hack into a government supercomputer and then try to buy uranium without the Department of Homeland Security tattling to your mother.",4
19497,Howard,18," Oh, that‰Ûªs too bad. Figure out the magic trick yet?",4
19498,Sheldon,18, Figure out the magic trick yet?,4
19499,Howard,18, Want me to tell you how to do it?,4
19500,Sheldon,18, No.,4
19501,Howard,18, I‰Ûªll show you one more time. Raj?,4
19502,Sheldon,18," Hang on. This time do it with me, so I can make sure there‰Ûªs no monkey business.",4
19503,Howard,18, All right. (Raj looks over Sheldon‰Ûªs shoulder. Holds two fingers over his heart). Two of hearts.,4
19504,Sheldon,18, I hate you.,4
19505,Howard,18," Yeah, he‰Ûªs gonna win the Nobel prize.",4
19506,Scene,19, The apartment,4
19507,Sheldon,19," Why hast thou forsaken me, O deity whose existence I doubt?",4
19508,Policeman,19, Here. Breathe into this bag.,4
19509,Leonard,19, What‰Ûªs going on?,4
19510,Sheldon,19," They stole everything, Leonard, everything.",4
19511,Policeman,19, Are you the roommate?,4
19512,Leonard,19," Yeah, Leonard Hofstadter. What happened?",4
19513,Policeman,19, Your friend here called 911 to report a robbery.,4
19514,Leonard,19," Oh, my God, what did they get?",4
19515,Sheldon,19," What didn‰Ûªt they get? They got my enchanted weapons, my vicious gladiator armour, my wand of untainted power, and all my gold.",4
19516,Leonard,19, You called the police because someone hacked your World of Warcraft account?,4
19517,Sheldon,19," What choice did I have? The mighty Sheldor, level 85 blood elf, hero of the Eastern kingdoms, has been picked clean, like a carcass in the desert sun. Plus, the FBI hung up on me.",4
19518,Policeman,19, Into the bag.,4
19519,Sheldon,19, They took my battle ostrich.,4
19520,Leonard,19," Oh, no, not Glenn?",4
19521,Sheldon,19," Yes, Glenn! The only bird I ever loved.",4
19522,Policeman,19," Good luck, fellas.",4
19523,Leonard,19," Thank you, officer.",4
19524,Sheldon,19, Wait a minute! You‰Ûªre not going to do anything?,4
19525,Policeman,19," Mr. Cooper, there‰Ûªs nothing‰Û_",4
19526,Sheldon,19, Doctor Cooper.,4
19527,Policeman,19, Seriously?,4
19528,Leonard,19, Not the kind with access to drugs.,4
19529,Policeman,19," Fine. Dr. Cooper. I‰Ûªm sorry for your loss, but the Pasadena Police Department doesn‰Ûªt have jurisdiction in Pandora.",4
19530,Sheldon,19," That‰Ûªs from Avatar, World of Warcraft takes place in Azeroth. Goodness gracious, how are you allowed to carry a gun? Can you at least refer me to a rogue ex-cop?",4
19531,Policeman,19, What?,4
19532,Sheldon,19," You know, one who was drummed off the force because he refused to play by the rules, and now he hires himself out to impose his own brand of rough justice?",4
19533,Policeman,19, No.,4
19534,Leonard,19," Thank you, officer.",4
19535,Sheldon,19, It‰Ûªs all gone. All gone.,4
19536,Leonard,19," I‰Ûªm really sorry, Sheldon.",4
19537,Sheldon,19," What kind of world do we live in, where a man would take another man‰Ûªs battle ostrich?",4
19538,Leonard,19, I don‰Ûªt know.,4
19539,Sheldon,19," This act of aggression must be met with swift and cruel ferocity. It is time to cry havoc, and let slip the dogs of war.",4
19540,Leonard,19," I‰Ûªm on it. (On phone) Hi, Mrs. Wolowitz. Is, is Howard there? Okay, thanks. That particular dog of war will have to call you back after his bath.",4
19541,Sheldon,19, See if Raj is done with Pilates.,4
19542,Scene,19, The apartment.,4
19543,Sheldon,19," Three thousand hours. Three thousand hours clicking on that mouse, collecting weapons and gold. It‰Ûªs almost as if it was a huge waste of time.",4
19544,Howard,19," Whoever did this knew what they were doing. He got in and out of your account in under 15 minutes, transferred all your stuff, and didn‰Ûªt leave a digital fingerprint.",4
19545,Sheldon,19, Oh! There isn‰Ûªt enough camomile tea in the world to quell the rage in my heart.,4
19546,Raj,19," Hold on. I‰Ûªm talking to an orc under the bridge in Thunder Bluff who says if we pay him, he‰Ûªll help us track down your things.",4
19547,Sheldon,19, Can we trust him?,4
19548,Raj,19," I should say so, he appears to be a member of the Nigerian royal family.",4
19549,Howard,19, Whoa! Somebody‰Ûªs auctioning off a jewelled ostrich bridle!,4
19550,Sheldon,19," No. Glenn‰Ûªs was leather. He was a simple ostrich. Is! Is, I haven‰Ûªt given up hope.",4
19551,Penny,19, Hey.,4
19552,Leonard,19," Hey, Penny. We‰Ûªre kind of in the middle of a crisis, here.",4
19553,Penny,19," Oh, I know. Bernadette told me. Sorry, Sheldon. I know that game meant a lot to you.",4
19554,Sheldon,19," That game? Excuse me, Penny, but Doodle Jump is a game. Angry Birds is a game. World of Warcraft is a massively multi-player online role-playing‰Û_ all right, technically it‰Ûªs a game.",4
19555,Raj,19," Bad news, the Nigerian prince may be a fraud.",4
19556,Penny,19," Okay, well, anyways, I brought you a day-old cheesecake to cheer you up!",4
19557,Sheldon,19, Stale pastry is hollow succour to a man who is bereft of ostrich.,4
19558,Penny,19, Just say thank you.,4
19559,Sheldon,19, I thought I just did.,4
19560,Penny,19, All right. See you later.,4
19561,Priya,19, Oh! Hello.,4
19562,Penny,19," Oh, hi! I was just dropping off a cheesecake to Sheldon. He was robbed of a bunch of imaginary crap that‰Ûªs useful in a make-believe place.",4
19563,Priya,19, I don‰Ûªt know what that means.,4
19564,Penny,19," Yeah, well, sadly, I do.",4
19565,Scene,19, Penny‰Ûªs apartment. ,4
19566,Penny,19, Did you know last weekend Priya took Leonard rollerblading at the beach? Can you believe that?,4
19567,Bernadette,19," I feel like I‰Ûªm supposed to say that bitch, but I don‰Ûªt have enough information.",4
19568,Penny,19," I am the one who spent two years trying to get him to even go to the beach in the first place. And he was so phobic about stepping on medical waste, I had to carry him to the water.",4
19569,Bernadette,19, I took Howard to the beach once. He almost burst into flames like a vampire.,4
19570,Penny,19, So what‰Ûªs the thanks I get for turning Leonard into quality boyfriend material? I have to tiptoe around his new girlfriend.,4
19571,Amy,19, I think you‰Ûªre on.,4
19572,Bernadette,19, Oh. That bitch!,4
19573,Penny,19, Want some coffee liqueur on your ice cream?,4
19574,Amy,19," Ah, here‰Ûªs the alcohol and drug peer pressure Mother warned me about. I was starting to think it was never going to happen. Yes, please.",4
19575,Penny,19," You guys should‰Ûªve seen Leonard when I first met him. There was no eye contact. He was either looking up at the ceiling, or down at his shoes.",4
19576,Amy,19, I‰Ûªm drunk.,4
19577,Penny,19," You know, for the first couple of months, whenever I would take off my bra, he would giggle and say, oh boy, my breast friends.",4
19578,Bernadette,19," Well, if it makes you feel any better, I‰Ûªm never speaking to Priya again.",4
19579,Penny,19," No, don‰Ûªt do that. No reason to be mean to her.",4
19580,Amy,19," This may be the alcohol talking, but I believe there is. Are you familiar with the recent study of Tanzanian chimpanzees by Nishida and Hosaka out of Kyoto University?",4
19581,Penny,19," No, but I can name all the Kardashians.",4
19582,Amy,19," Primates, such as ourselves, have a natural instinct to ostracize ill-mannered members of the troop. Bernadette‰Ûªs urge to shun, scowl or fling her waste at Priya is hard-wired into her DNA.",4
19583,Bernadette,19, I don‰Ûªt have an urge to fling my waste.,4
19584,Amy,19," Believe me, it‰Ûªs there, we all have it. Hit me with some more booze, and I‰Ûªll show you.",4
19585,Scene,19, The apartment,4
19586,Howard,19," All right, here we are, this is the tavern where all the black-market weapon trades go down.",4
19587,Raj,19, I don‰Ûªt think my character should be in a place like this. Everyone‰Ûªs undressing her with their eyes.,4
19588,Howard,19, Maybe if you stop dropping your sword and bending over to pick it up.,4
19589,Leonard,19," Okay, what exactly are we looking for?",4
19590,Howard,19," Redheaded troll, goes by the name of Glumly. According to the message boards, if you want to move stolen goods and it‰Ûªs after school hours, he‰Ûªs your guy.",4
19591,Priya,19," Leonard, is this going to take much longer? I thought we were going to spend some time together.",4
19592,Leonard,19," Uh, we are. In the meantime, you‰Ûªre welcome to whip up a quick character and join us.",4
19593,Priya,19, Seriously?,4
19594,Leonard,19," Well, you have to put in a credit card number, but it‰Ûªs fun.",4
19595,Priya,19, Maybe I should just go home.,4
19596,Howard,19, Our troll just walked in! I got him!,4
19597,Leonard,19, We got him. We‰Ûªre almost done.,4
19598,Howard,19," So, how do you guys want to play this?",4
19599,Sheldon,19," Be ruthless. You tell him if he doesn‰Ûªt start talking, we‰Ûªll register a complaint with his Internet service provider.",4
19600,Raj,19," Sheldon, what if he gets his Internet from his cable company? He could lose his HBO and all their delightful original programming.",4
19601,Sheldon,19," I don‰Ûªt care! I‰Ûªm losin‰Ûª it, man!",4
19602,Leonard,19," Why don‰Ûªt we play this smart? Try a little good goblin, bad goblin.",4
19603,Priya,19," Oh, dear Lord.",4
19604,Howard,19," Nah, I think we have to be more subtle.",4
19605,Raj,19," Okay, I see where this is going. Fine, I‰Ûªll have sex with him.",4
19606,Leonard,19, That‰Ûªs not where it was going.,4
19607,Raj,19," Good, because I would hate that.",4
19608,Priya,19," Leonard, you‰Ûªre busy, let‰Ûªs talk tomorrow.",4
19609,Leonard,19," Oh, wait. Hang on. Are you upset?",4
19610,Priya,19," No, no, I think it‰Ûªs sexy to date a boy trapped in a man‰Ûªs body.",4
19611,Leonard,19," Good, good. I‰Ûªll tell you what happens.",4
19612,Sheldon,19, And people think I don‰Ûªt get sarcasm.,4
19613,Scene,19, The hallway. ,4
19614,Amy,19," Well, well, well. Look who it is.",4
19615,Penny,19," Okay, be nice.",4
19616,Priya,19, Hello.,4
19617,Penny,19, Hi. We‰Ûªre just heading out for a drink.,4
19618,Amy,19, Because I do that now.,4
19619,Bernadette,19, Count your blessings you‰Ûªre not a Tanzanian chimp.,4
19620,Priya,19, What?,4
19621,Penny,19," Don‰Ûªt listen to her, she‰Ûªs had a lot of ice cream. Do you want to join us?",4
19622,Priya,19," Oh, thank you, but I have work to do.",4
19623,Amy,19," Four women walk down the stairs, how many reach the lobby?",4
19624,Scene,19, The cafeteria.,4
19625,Leonard,19, Did your sister say anything when you got home last night?,4
19626,Raj,19," Oh, no, don‰Ûªt put me in the middle of this. I‰Ûªm not going to be your go-between.",4
19627,Leonard,19," Come on, help me out. Am I in trouble?",4
19628,Raj,19, There‰Ûªs no reason to worry.,4
19629,Leonard,19, That‰Ûªs a relief.,4
19630,Raj,19, I‰Ûªm sure many women in happy relationships spend their nights skyping with their ex-boyfriend Sanjay.,4
19631,Howard,19," Good news, gentlemen, I found our hacker.",4
19632,Sheldon,19, What?,4
19633,Leonard,19, Really?,4
19634,Howard,19," Yeah. No one can hide from me, not Waldo, not Carmen San Diego, not even topless Natalie Portman.",4
19635,Sheldon,19," I‰Ûªve never said these words before, but good job, Howard!",4
19636,Howard,19," Thanks. Our culprit is one Mr. Todd Zarnecki, 2711 Ocean View Road, Carlsbad, California.",4
19637,Sheldon,19, The name and the address drip with evil.,4
19638,Raj,19, What else do we know about him?,4
19639,Howard,19," Well, quite a bit, actually.",4
19640,Leonard,19, I‰Ûªll bet he‰Ûªs some loser who lives with his parents.,4
19641,Howard,19," Yes, he does live with his parents. Here‰Ûªs a Google Earth shot of their house.",4
19642,Sheldon,19, Excellent! It‰Ûªs in a cul-de-sac. We can box him in.,4
19643,Leonard,19," Hold on, you‰Ûªre thinking of going there?",4
19644,Sheldon,19, Carlsbad is only a couple of hours away.,4
19645,Leonard,19," Fine. You walk up to the house, knock on the door and demand your stuff back. What if he says no?",4
19646,Sheldon,19," I don‰Ûªt know if you‰Ûªve been following the news, Leonard, but there have been some terrific advancements in the field of torture.",4
19647,Leonard,19, No one‰Ûªs getting tortured.,4
19648,Sheldon,19," Fine, we‰Ûªll abide by the Geneva Convention. But ask yourself this, in the course of our lives, how much lunch money has been taken from us? How many kites? How many Scooby-Doo Trapper Keepers?",4
19649,Raj,19, I totally had one of those.,4
19650,Sheldon,19," Of course you did. It was a fun and practical way of organizing your school work. But the bullies took it from us. Well, no more. Tonight, we take back our dignity, our birthright and our pride. What do you say? Who‰Ûªs with me?",4
19651,Raj,19," I have a hip-hop aerobics class at five, could we go after?",4
19652,Sheldon,19, Sure.,4
19653,Howard,19," Also, tonight‰Ûªs the Sabbath and my mother and I have a tradition of lighting the candles and",4
19654,Sheldon,19, Fine. Leonard?,4
19655,Leonard,19," Oh, geez, I don‰Ûªt know if I can ditch Priya two nights in a row.",4
19656,Raj,19," Oh, come on, man. Bros before‰Û_ my sister.",4
19657,Leonard,19," Aw, screw it. I‰Ûªm in.",4
19658,Raj,19," Me, too.",4
19659,Howard,19, And me.,4
19660,Sheldon,19," One moment. (Places a tissue on their hands before adding his own) I‰Ûªm hell-bent on catching a cyber criminal, not the common cold.",4
19661,Scene,19, Howard‰Ûªs house,4
19662,Sheldon,19," I‰Ûªm sorry, I thought this delay was so you could watch Wheel of Fortune with your mother.",4
19663,Howard,19," I am. She‰Ûªs just bleaching her moustache. Check it out. Hey, Ma! Before and After! Four words, 17 letters, two N‰Ûªs, one V.",4
19664,Howard‰Ûªs Mother (off),19, Fanny pack of wolves.,4
19665,Leonard,19, That‰Ûªs incredible.,4
19666,Howard,19," Yeah, she‰Ûªs kind of a Wheel savant.",4
19667,Leonard (phone rings),19," Uh-oh, that‰Ûªs Priya.",4
19668,Raj,19," Sitar music for her ringtone is not cool, dude.",4
19669,Leonard,19," Hit the‰Û_ Hey, sweetie. Yeah, I‰Ûªm sorry. I‰Ûªm gonna be working late. I, I, I miss you, too. Okay, sure, I‰Ûªll call you when I get home. Okay, bye-bye.",4
19670,Raj,19, Very nice. You lie to my sister.,4
19671,Howard,19, That‰Ûªs the nicest thing he does to your sister.,4
19672,Raj (phone rings),19," Oh, guess who.",4
19673,Leonard,19, Cover for me.,4
19674,Raj,19," Hello, Priya. What‰Ûªs up? How would I know if Leonard‰Ûªs at work or not? Don‰Ûªt be suspicious. Look, if you want your relationship with Leonard to continue, you‰Ûªre going to have to believe whatever wild-eyed, cockamamie excuse the white devil has the nerve to offer you. Okay? Yeah, bye-bye. You owe me.",4
19675,Howard,19," New puzzle, Ma. Same name. One N, two D‰Ûªs, three O‰Ûªs.",4
19676,Howard‰Ûªs Mother (off),19, Whoopi and Rube Goldberg!,4
19677,Sheldon,19, That‰Ûªs uncanny.,4
19678,Howard,19," I know. It‰Ûªs her superpower. Well, that and jiggling her arm fat.",4
19679,Scene,19, Leonard‰Ûªs car. ,4
19680,Leonard,19, I can‰Ûªt believe we‰Ûªre going all the way to San Diego to confront this guy.,4
19681,Howard,19," Yeah, we‰Ûªre kind of bad-asses, aren‰Ûªt we?",4
19682,Leonard,19, Totally.,4
19683,Raj,19," Hey, how about we stay the night and hit Legoland in the morning?",4
19684,Sheldon,19," Sea World is better. It has Shamu, who is literally tons of fun. But for the moment, let‰Ûªs stay focused on Todd Zarnecki.",4
19685,Raj,19," Yeah, we‰Ûªre coming for you, Todd Zarnecki. And for the record, Legoland is more interactive.",4
19686,Sheldon,19," I almost feel sorry for the poor fool, sitting in his split-level suburban ranch, unaware that a vengeful horde is barrelling down the San Diego Freeway at 71 miles an hour. Ease up there, lead foot. You trying to get us killed?",4
19687,Raj,19, I took the liberty of burning us a mix of heroic questing music.,4
19688,Sheldon,19, This says Beyonce Bootylicious Dance Mix.,4
19689,Raj,19, It‰Ûªs a re-writable CD. Just put it in.,4
19690,Howard,19, Beyonce? Really?,4
19691,Raj,19, She‰Ûªs curvy and she owns it. I like that.,4
19692,Leonard (as Ride of the Valkyries begins),19," Oh, yeah, I‰Ûªm feeling it.",4
19693,Sheldon,19, We are winged fury! Which is still no excuse for going over the posted speed limit.,4
19694,Scene,19, Stuck in a traffic tailback.,4
19695,Howard,19," Next time we go to kick someone‰Ûªs ass, we take the train.",4
19696,Sheldon,19, I always prefer the train.,4
19697,Scene,19, Outside Todd Zarnecki‰Ûªs house.,4
19698,Leonard,19," Sheldon, let‰Ûªs go.",4
19699,Sheldon,19, Coming.,4
19700,Howard,19, Why did you bring that?,4
19701,Sheldon,19, No weapon strikes more fear into a man‰Ûªs heart than a Klingon bat‰Ûªleth.,4
19702,Leonard,19," Okay, let‰Ûªs get clear on something. We‰Ûªre just going to tell this guy to transfer all of your stuff back into your account and then be on our way. No one‰Ûªs bat‰Ûªlething anybody.",4
19703,Sheldon,19, So my blade shall not taste blood tonight?,4
19704,Leonard,19, No.,4
19705,Sheldon,19," Well, now I just feel silly holding it.",4
19706,Leonard,19, Come on.,4
19707,Sheldon,19, Can I at least kick down the door?,4
19708,Leonard,19," You‰Ûªre welcome to try, but the other day, it took you 15 minutes to get into a FedEx box. (Rings bell)",4
19709,Voice Inside,19, Who is it?,4
19710,Sheldon,19, Your doom!,4
19711,Raj,19, Don‰Ûªt say your doom. Who opens the door for their doom?,4
19712,Sheldon,19, Good point. Basket of puppies.,4
19713,Huge man (opening door),19, What?,4
19714,Leonard,19," Uh, Sheldon?",4
19715,Sheldon,19, Are you Todd Zarnecki?,4
19716,Todd,19, Yeah. Who are you?,4
19717,Sheldon,19, I am Sheldor of Azeroth. I want my things back.,4
19718,Todd,19, I don‰Ûªt think so. Let me see that.,4
19719,Sheldon,19, Careful. That‰Ûªs a collectible.,4
19720,Todd,19, I know. I‰Ûªve always wanted one. (Closes door),4
19721,Sheldon,19," Well, he‰Ûªs even more cunning than we thought.",4
19722,Scene,19, Leonard‰Ûªs car.,4
19723,Sheldon,19," You know, the joke‰Ûªs on him. Without the certificate of authenticity, that bat‰Ûªleth is worthless.",4
19724,Howard,19," Yeah, he walked right into our trap.",4
19725,Raj,19, Legoland seems like a hollow dream now.,4
19726,Leonard,19, Oh-oh.,4
19727,Raj,19, What‰Ûªs the matter?,4
19728,Leonard,19," Something‰Ûªs wrong, I‰Ûªm not getting any gas. Anybody know anything about internal combustion engines?",4
19729,Sheldon,19, Of course.,4
19730,Raj,19, Very basic.,4
19731,Howard,19, 19th-century technology.,4
19732,Leonard,19, Does anybody know how to fix an internal combustion engine?,4
19733,Sheldon,19, No.,4
19734,Howard,19," No, not a clue.",4
19735,Leonard,19," Well, we‰Ûªd better call somebody to come pick us up.",4
19736,Sheldon,19, It‰Ûªd be swell if they had a train.,4
19737,Scene,19, Penny‰Ûªs car.,4
19738,Sheldon,19," Thank you, Penny.",4
19739,Penny,19," No problem. So, Leonard, I think it‰Ûªs interesting you didn‰Ûªt call your girlfriend to come get you.",4
19740,Leonard,19," Uh, I kind of told her I was working.",4
19741,Penny,19, So you lied to her. Also interesting.,4
19742,Leonard,19," Yeah, she doesn‰Ûªt really understand the whole Warcraft adventure-role-playing thing.",4
19743,Penny,19," Well, doesn‰Ûªt matter if she gets it, as long as she‰Ûªs pretty.",4
19744,Howard,19," This one‰Ûªs funny, Leonard. How come you couldn‰Ûªt make it work with her?",4
19745,Penny,19, So did you at least get Sheldon‰Ûªs fake stuff back?,4
19746,Sheldon,19, No. We failed in our noble quest.,4
19747,Penny,19, How come?,4
19748,Sheldon,19, Todd Zarnecki was mean.,4
19749,Penny,19, All right. Hang on.,4
19750,Leonard,19, What are you doing?,4
19751,Penny,19, I‰Ûªm gonna show you how we finish a quest in Nebraska. Oh. Beyonce. (Ride of the Valkyries) This ain‰Ûªt no Beyonce.,4
19752,Scene,19, Todd Zarnecki‰Ûªs house. Todd answers the door. ,4
19753,Todd,19, Now what?,4
19754,Penny,19, Give my friend his stuff back.,4
19755,Todd,19, I don‰Ûªt know what you‰Ûªre talking about.,4
19756,Penny,19," Well, then, good news. Today‰Ûªs the day a girl‰Ûªs finally going to touch you in your little special place. (Kicks him in the groin) Now give him his stuff back.",4
19757,Todd,19, Okay.,4
19758,Sheldon,19," We did it! I said, we.",4
19759,Scene,19, The lobby. ,4
19760,Priya,19," Oh, hold the door.",4
19761,Penny,19," Oh, hi.",4
19762,Priya,19, Hi.,4
19763,Penny,19, Going to see Leonard?,4
19764,Priya,19, Yes. How have you been?,4
19765,Penny,19, Fine. You?,4
19766,Priya,19," Very well, thank you.",4
19767,Penny,19," Alright, well great seeing you.",4
19768,Priya,19," Yeah, you too.",4
19769,Penny,19, Amy‰Ûªs right. I do want to fling my poop at her.,4
19770,Scene,20, A bookstore.,4
19771,Dr. Brian Greene,20," My new book, The Hidden Reality, takes on a grand question. Is our universe the only universe? You see, there‰Ûªs a growing belief among scientists like me that ours may only be one among many universes populating a gigantic cosmos. In The Hidden Reality, I explore this possibility without presuming any knowledge of mathematics or physics on the part of the reader.",4
19772,Sheldon,20, Hysterical.,4
19773,Amy,20," I‰Ûªm glad you talked me into this. We work so hard, sometimes, it‰Ûªs nice to goof off and do something silly.",4
19774,Sheldon,20, Agreed. Wait till you hear how he dumbs down Werner Heisenberg for the crowd. You may actually believe you‰Ûªre in a comedy club.,4
19775,Greene,20," You can think about Heisenberg‰Ûªs Uncertainty Principle much like the special order menu that you find in certain Chinese restaurants, where you have dishes in column A and other dishes in column B, and if you order the first dish in column A, you can‰Ûªt order the corresponding dish in column B. That‰Ûªs sort of like the Uncertainly Principle.",4
19776,Sheldon,20, Ba-dum-bump.,4
19777,Amy,20," Say, I heard an interesting tidbit about Howard and Bernadette.",4
19778,Sheldon,20," Really, Amy? Gossip? I‰Ûªm disappointed in you.",4
19779,Amy,20," Now, now. Evolutionary biologist Robin Dunbar has identified gossip as an aid to social bonding in large groups.",4
19780,Sheldon,20," Forgive my language, but poppycock.",4
19781,Amy,20," What if he‰Ûªs right? And by not participating in gossip, society breaks down into small feral bands of tattooed motorcycle riders fighting to the death over the last few cans of tuna fish?",4
19782,Sheldon,20," Fine. In the parlance of the urban music scene, what‰Ûªs the 4-1-1?",4
19783,Amy,20, Bernadette is thinking about breaking up with Howard.,4
19784,Sheldon,20," I believe our nation‰Ûªs tuna cans are safe. Excuse me. Dr. Greene, question?",4
19785,Greene,20, Yes?,4
19786,Sheldon,20, You‰Ûªve dedicated your life‰Ûªs work to educating the general populace about complex scientific ideas.,4
19787,Greene,20," Yes, in part.",4
19788,Sheldon,20," Have you ever considered trying to do something useful? Perhaps, reading to the elderly?",4
19789,Greene,20, Excuse me?,4
19790,Sheldon,20," Yeah, but not your books. Something they might enjoy. I kid, of course. Big fan.",4
19791,Scene,20, The apartment. The guys are playing on a Nintendo Wii.,4
19792,Leonard,20, Nice shot.,4
19793,Sheldon,20, Thank you. My father taught me archery as a child. It‰Ûªs odd how the activity brings back the smell of Kmart bourbon.,4
19794,Leonard,20, Perfect.,4
19795,Sheldon,20," I know. What an elf I would have made. Whoo, what do you think you‰Ûªre doing?",4
19796,Leonard,20, Shooting at a target?,4
19797,Sheldon,20, With what?,4
19798,Leonard,20, An arrow.,4
19799,Sheldon,20, Really? I didn‰Ûªt see you draw one from your quiver.,4
19800,Leonard,20," I‰Ûªm not going to do that, Sheldon.",4
19801,Sheldon,20," Leonard, the people at Nintendo can only go so far in helping us recreate an actual athletic experience. We have to do our part, too. (Leonard mimes drawing an arrow and stabbing Sheldon with it.) That was uncalled for, but I‰Ûªll play along. Ow! I had an unusual experience with Amy last night.",4
19802,Leonard,20, Really? How could you tell?,4
19803,Sheldon,20, She was attempting to engage me in gossip.,4
19804,Leonard,20, You don‰Ûªt say?,4
19805,Sheldon,20, Yes. I think prolonged exposure to Penny has turned her into a bit of a Gabby Gertie.,4
19806,Leonard,20," So, what‰Ûªs the gossip?",4
19807,Sheldon,20," Oh, please, I was just pointing it out. I have no desire to engage in the activity.",4
19808,Leonard,20," Fine, don‰Ûªt tell me.",4
19809,Sheldon,20," All right, get this. Bernadette is thinking about breaking up with Howard.",4
19810,Leonard,20, Oh. That‰Ûªs too bad. I wonder what happened.,4
19811,Sheldon,20," Mm, it‰Ûªs hard to say. I can only speculate based on the data I collected watching my parents‰Ûª marriage implode. In that case, the woman dives into religion, while the man dives into a bottle-blonde bartender who tries to buy my love with action figures. Oop! Out of arrows.",4
19812,Leonard,20," Boy, you sure get your money‰Ûªs worth out of these games.",4
19813,Scene,20, The bathroom.,4
19814,Leonard,20," ‰ÛÒ Priya, can I come in?",4
19815,Priya,20, Sure.,4
19816,Leonard,20," Oh, God.",4
19817,Priya,20, What?,4
19818,Leonard,20, It‰Ûªs okay. You didn‰Ûªt know. I‰Ûªll take care of it.,4
19819,Priya,20," What, what did I do?",4
19820,Leonard,20, Sheldon doesn‰Ûªt allow flossing that close to the mirror.,4
19821,Priya,20, You‰Ûªre kidding.,4
19822,Leonard,20, It‰Ûªs a splatter thing. There‰Ûªs a little piece of tape on the floor you‰Ûªre supposed to stand behind.,4
19823,Priya,20, That‰Ûªs madness.,4
19824,Leonard,20," I know. Just do it. There‰Ûªs a big inspection coming up, and I don‰Ûªt want to lose my TV privileges.",4
19825,Priya,20, You really need to let me take a look at that roommate agreement one of these days.,4
19826,Leonard,20," Mm, I don‰Ûªt know. I get a lawyer, he gets a lawyer, it‰Ûªs just easier to stand behind the tape.",4
19827,Priya,20," Oh, by the way, a fellow at work said I could use his Dodger tickets this weekend. Does that sound like fun?",4
19828,Leonard,20," Yeah! Dodgers are baseball, right?",4
19829,Priya,20, You‰Ûªll need to explain the game to me.,4
19830,Leonard,20," Mm, it‰Ûªs complicated, but as I remember it, the essentials are, get chosen last, get hit by the ball, cry, go home.",4
19831,Priya,20," Well, regardless, I‰Ûªve got four tickets, and I was thinking we can bring Bernadette and Howard. She‰Ûªs really interesting, and I bet I can get used to him.",4
19832,Leonard,20," Well, it might not be a great idea to invite those two.",4
19833,Priya,20, Why not?,4
19834,Leonard,20," Don‰Ûªt tell anybody I told you, but I heard she might be breaking up with him.",4
19835,Priya,20," Oh, too bad. Although I do know one person for whom that‰Ûªs good news.",4
19836,Leonard,20, Really? Who?,4
19837,Priya,20, My brother. He‰Ûªs got a big crush on Bernadette.,4
19838,Leonard,20, What? You‰Ûªre kidding!,4
19839,Priya,20," Mmm. I found poems he wrote about her. Very disturbing. Oh, Bernadette, please play my clarinet.",4
19840,Leonard,20," Wow, that‰Ûªs hard to believe.",4
19841,Priya,20," Yes. And for years, everyone in my family was convinced that he was the clarinet enthusiast. Hmm. What‰Ûªs that piece of tape?",4
19842,Leonard,20," Oh, that one doesn‰Ûªt apply to you. You sit.",4
19843,Scene,20, The lobby. ,4
19844,Leonard,20, Hey!,4
19845,Penny,20, Hey! How‰Ûªs it going?,4
19846,Leonard,20, Not too bad. Did you hear about Howard and Bernadette?,4
19847,Penny,20, ‰Û÷Course I heard about it. How did you hear about it?,4
19848,Leonard,20, I heard about it from Sheldon. He got it from Amy.,4
19849,Penny,20," Oh, damn it. I told Amy that in the strictest confidence. Boy, some people are such blabbermouths. Well, whatever, I‰Ûªm sure Bernadette can do better.",4
19850,Leonard,20, Do you think a sexually ambivalent Indian astrophysicist with selective mutism and alcohol issues is better than a hundred-pound Jewish guy who lives with his mom?,4
19851,Penny,20, You are kidding. Raj likes Bernadette?,4
19852,Leonard,20, I didn‰Ûªt say Raj. Who said Raj?,4
19853,Penny,20," Okay, give. How do you know? Did he tell you?",4
19854,Leonard,20, No.,4
19855,Penny,20," Well, then who?",4
19856,Leonard,20, I can‰Ûªt say.,4
19857,Penny,20," Priya told you. What a little gossip. You know, not an attractive quality in a woman, Leonard. Not judging, just my opinion.",4
19858,Leonard,20," Well, The point is, if this got out, it would destroy Howard and Raj‰Ûªs friendship.",4
19859,Penny,20," You don‰Ûªt have to worry. Unlike Amy and Priya, I know how to keep a secret.",4
19860,Leonard,20, You‰Ûªre the one who told Amy in the first place.,4
19861,Penny,20, In confidence!,4
19862,Scene,20, Raj‰Ûªs apartment.,4
19863,Raj,20," Hello, Mummy. Hello, Daddy. How are you?",4
19864,Mrs Koothrappali (on webcam),20," We‰Ûªre very rich in a very poor country. So, all in all, can‰Ûªt complain.",4
19865,Dr Koothrappali,20," So, Priya, how are enjoying staying with your brother?",4
19866,Priya,20," It‰Ûªs fine. But if I‰Ûªm going to stay in Los Angeles much longer, I think I should get my own place.",4
19867,Mrs Koothrappali,20," Why? Is Rajesh not making you feel comfortable? Rajesh, why aren‰Ûªt you making your sister comfortable?",4
19868,Raj,20," I am making her comfortable. Besides, she‰Ûªs not sleeping here half the time anyway.",4
19869,Dr Koothrappali,20," What? Where are you sleeping, Priya?",4
19870,Priya,20," It‰Ûªs a figure of speech, Daddy. It means I-I work late.",4
19871,Mrs Koothrappali,20," Please tell me you‰Ûªre not dating an American. I knew this would happen. Rajesh, are you letting your sister date that little Howard boy?",4
19872,Dr Koothrappali,20," Now, hold on. If she is dating an American, that‰Ûªs not a bad way to go. He‰Ûªs Jewish. Those chaps are very successful, and they don‰Ûªt drink a lot.",4
19873,Raj,20," It, it doesn‰Ûªt matter. Howard has a girlfriend.",4
19874,Priya,20, For now.,4
19875,Raj,20, What does that mean?,4
19876,Priya,20, I‰Ûªll tell you later.,4
19877,Raj,20, Is something going on with him and Bernadette?,4
19878,Mrs Koothrappali,20, Who‰Ûªs Bernadette?,4
19879,Dr Koothrappali,20, Doesn‰Ûªt sound Jewish.,4
19880,Mrs Koothrappali,20, You can‰Ûªt tell by that. Winona Ryder is Jewish.,4
19881,Dr Koothrappali,20," Okay, we‰Ûªre getting off the subject. Rajesh, I want you to try harder to make your sister feel welcome.",4
19882,Priya,20," Thank you, Daddy.",4
19883,Raj,20," Don‰Ûªt worry. Everything I have, I share with her. Including my friend Leon‰Û_",4
19884,Priya,20," Good night, Mummy. Good night, Daddy.",4
19885,Raj,20," Oh, my God, I think you broke my toe!",4
19886,Priya,20, Well you should have kept your mouth shut.,4
19887,Raj,20," Fair enough. Now, what‰Ûªs up with Clarinet? Bernadette!",4
19888,Scene,20, The cafeteria.,4
19889,Sheldon,20, I‰Ûªve been thinking about Dr. Greene‰Ûªs efforts to make science palatable for the masses.,4
19890,Leonard,20," Oh, yeah? What about it?",4
19891,Sheldon,20," That‰Ûªs all. I‰Ûªve just been thinking about it. Now, I‰Ûªm thinking about fractal equations. Now I‰Ûªm thinking about the origin of the phrase train of thought. Now I‰Ûªm thinking about trains.",4
19892,Raj,20, Are you listening to this guy?,4
19893,Howard,20," Hmm? Oh, I‰Ûªm sorry. I was somewhere else.",4
19894,Leonard,20, Lucky bastard.,4
19895,Sheldon,20, Now I‰Ûªm thinking about Jell-O.,4
19896,Raj,20, So what‰Ûªs up?,4
19897,Howard,20, It‰Ûªs a Bernadette thing.,4
19898,Raj,20," Oh, no. I hope everything‰Ûªs okay.",4
19899,Leonard,20," Whatever it is, we‰Ûªre here for you. You can tell us anything.",4
19900,Raj,20, Yeah. Good or devastating.,4
19901,Howard,20, I‰Ûªm gonna ask her to marry me.,4
19902,Leonard,20, Marry you?,4
19903,Raj,20, What?,4
19904,Howard,20, Yeah. I just need to figure out the right time to pop the question.,4
19905,Leonard,20," Oh, I‰Ûªd wait.",4
19906,Raj,20," No rush, no rush.",4
19907,Howard (phone rings),20," Oh, great. It‰Ûªs my cousin David about the ring. Hey, David, what‰Ûªd you find? Oh, sure, a half a carat‰Ûªs fine. Her freakishly small hands make anything look big. It‰Ûªs one of the reasons I love her.",4
19908,Leonard,20," Man, he‰Ûªs going to be blindsided.",4
19909,Raj,20, I know. It‰Ûªll be awful.,4
19910,Sheldon,20, Why are you smiling?,4
19911,Leonard,20," Yeah, Raj, why?",4
19912,Raj,20," Uh, a smile means something different in my country. You know, tears of joy, smile of sadness. India‰Ûªs a goofy place.",4
19913,Sheldon,20," Oh, I‰Ûªm back to trains. Woo-woo.",4
19914,Scene,20, The apartment.,4
19915,Amy,20, Did I tell you our lab got a grant to study addiction?,4
19916,Sheldon,20, No.,4
19917,Amy,20, Fascinating work. I recently trained a capuchin monkey to smoke cigarettes.,4
19918,Sheldon,20, Have you learned anything?,4
19919,Amy,20, Yes. He looks much cooler than the non-smoking monkeys. Although it‰Ûªs not much of a contest. The other monkeys just sit around and masturbate.,4
19920,Sheldon,20," If you don‰Ûªt mind, I‰Ûªd like to stop listening to you and start talking.",4
19921,Amy,20, By all means.,4
19922,Sheldon,20, Howard has announced his intention to propose marriage to Bernadette.,4
19923,Amy,20, I don‰Ûªt understand. The original piece of gossip indicated an impending breakup.,4
19924,Sheldon,20," I know. The group consensus is that his proposal will be met with an humiliating, soul-crushing rejection. Everyone was set a-twitter. Although oddly, no one tweeted.",4
19925,Amy,20, It‰Ûªs not surprising that the story has captured the attention of our little circle of friends. Are you familiar with meme theory?,4
19926,Sheldon,20," I‰Ûªm familiar with everything, but go on.",4
19927,Amy,20, Meme theory suggests that items of gossip are like living things that seek to reproduce using humans as their host.,4
19928,Sheldon,20," I‰Ûªm no stranger to memetic epidemiology. At Johnson Elementary School, the phrase Shelly Cooper‰Ûªs a smelly pooper spread like wildfire.",4
19929,Amy,20, I should think so. That‰Ûªs gold.,4
19930,Sheldon,20, Your meme hypothesis does intrigue me. How might we examine this more closely?,4
19931,Amy,20, Do you have any ethical qualms regarding human experimentation?,4
19932,Sheldon,20, It‰Ûªs one of the few forms of interaction with people that I don‰Ûªt find repellent.,4
19933,Amy,20, We need to fabricate a tantalizing piece of gossip.,4
19934,Sheldon,20, And a second non-tantalizing piece to use as a control.,4
19935,Amy,20," Then we‰Ûªll track its progress through our social group and interpret the results through the competing academic prisms of memetic theory, algebraic gossip and epidemiology.",4
19936,Sheldon,20," Look at you, getting me to engage in the social sciences. You‰Ûªre a vixen, Amy Farrah Fowler.",4
19937,Scene,20, Penny‰Ûªs door.,4
19938,Penny,20," Oh, hey, Amy. What‰Ûªs up?",4
19939,Amy,20," Sheldon and I engaged in sexual intercourse. In other news, I‰Ûªm thinking of starting an herb garden. Mum‰Ûªs the word. Gotta go.",4
19940,Scene,20, The Cheesecake Factory,4
19941,Bernadette,20," Oh, hey, Raj, what are you doing here?",4
19942,Raj,20," I just felt like drinking alone, because I‰Ûªm deep and dark.",4
19943,Bernadette,20," Uh-huh. So, uh, Howard‰Ûªs not here?",4
19944,Raj,20, No. It‰Ûªs just one of those times when it‰Ûªs just you and me. Like when the three of us went to the movies and you and I waited outside the bathroom while Howard threw up Red Vines and Cherry Coke. Do you remember that?,4
19945,Bernadette,20, Yeah.,4
19946,Raj,20," Me, too. Good times.",4
19947,Penny,20," Hey, 16 wants to order appetizers.",4
19948,Bernadette,20," Oh, thanks.",4
19949,Raj,20, This was nice.,4
19950,Penny,20," What the hell are you doing? Howard is your best friend, and that is his girlfriend. You should be ashamed of yourself.",4
19951,Raj,20," I was when I came in, but it‰Ûªs amazing what liquor does to guilt. Besides what you might not know is, Bernadette is planning on breaking up with Howard.",4
19952,Penny,20," Well, I know that. How do you know that?",4
19953,Raj,20, My sister told me.,4
19954,Penny,20," Oh, that gossipy bitch! No offense.",4
19955,Raj,20, None taken. You should hear how she talks about you.,4
19956,Penny,20," Okay, listen, just because Howard and Bernadette are having problems, does not mean you should be here sniffing around.",4
19957,Raj,20, What can I do? I can‰Ûªt stop thinking about her.,4
19958,Penny,20," All right, try thinking about this. Sheldon and Amy had sex.",4
19959,Raj,20, Shut your ass!,4
19960,Penny,20," Yeah, it‰Ûªs true. Amy told me.",4
19961,Raj,20, How did that even happen? Did they know that‰Ûªs what they were doing when they were doing it?,4
19962,Penny,20, I-I guess they just figured it out at some point.,4
19963,Raj,20, Wow. I can‰Ûªt believe old Smelly Pooper finally got laid.,4
19964,Scene,20, The apartment. ,4
19965,Leonard,20, Hey.,4
19966,Sheldon,20, Hey.,4
19967,Leonard,20, Hope you‰Ûªre hungry.,4
19968,Sheldon,20," Interesting. A friendly sentiment in this country, cruel taunt in the Sudan. It‰Ûªs a lesson in context.",4
19969,Leonard,20, Will Amy be joining us for dinner?,4
19970,Sheldon,20," Yes, I believe so.",4
19971,Leonard,20," Good, good. Everything okay between you two?",4
19972,Sheldon,20, Yes. Why do you ask?,4
19973,Leonard,20," No reason. I was just talking to Raj, and he mentioned what a lovely glow she has these days.",4
19974,Sheldon,20," Did he mean as if she‰Ûªd been out in the sun, tending an herb garden without wearing a hat or sunblock?",4
19975,Leonard,20, No. That‰Ûªs not what he meant.,4
19976,Sheldon,20," Well, we may never know. As my mother would say, the Asians are an inscrutable folk. Now, if you‰Ûªll excuse me, I have work to do.",4
19977,Leonard,20," Yeah, you do. You dog, you.",4
19978,Sheldon,20, Did you get that?,4
19979,Amy (on webcam),20, Every word. Our false gossip meme appears to have reached node lambda.,4
19980,Sheldon,20, This is moving faster than we thought.,4
19981,Amy,20, Agreed. It appears the rate of gossip transmission is proportional to the number of nodes squared.,4
19982,Sheldon,20," I must say, Amy, pretending to have intercourse with you is giving me a great deal of satisfaction.",4
19983,Amy,20," Slow down, Sheldon. I‰Ûªm not quite there yet.",4
19984,Scene,20," The apartment, later.",4
19985,Leonard,20, Pass the soy sauce.,4
19986,Howard,20, Sure.,4
19987,Amy,20, Bernadette just asked about my sexual encounter with you. The meme has reached full penetration.,4
19988,Sheldon,20, Pun intended?,4
19989,Amy,20, No. Happy accident.,4
19990,Sheldon,20, This is remarkable. Took less than 24 hours.,4
19991,Amy,20, I should let you know that she asked for details about our dalliance.,4
19992,Sheldon,20," Interesting. So it went beyond the mere fact of coitus to a blow by blow, as it were.",4
19993,Amy,20, Pun intended?,4
19994,Sheldon,20, I‰Ûªm sorry. What pun?,4
19995,Amy,20," Not important. I described your lovemaking as aloof, but effective.",4
19996,Sheldon,20," I wish you hadn‰Ûªt done that. That‰Ûªs going to make me a chick magnet, and I‰Ûªm so busy as it is.",4
19997,Howard,20," Hey, everybody, I got something I want to ask Bernadette, and I can‰Ûªt think of a better time than when I‰Ûªm with all my friends.",4
19998,Leonard,20," Oh, hold on, Howard. There‰Ûªs lots of better times.",4
19999,Raj,20," Leonard, please. The man is talking. Let him get it out, and let the chips fall where they may.",4
20000,Howard,20, Thank you. Bernadette Maryann Rostenkowski‰Û_,4
20001,Bernadette,20," Oh, God. What‰Ûªs happening?",4
20002,Howard,20," I know things haven‰Ûªt been perfect with us, and we‰Ûªve had our problems, but I just have to tell you, from the moment I‰Û_",4
20003,Bernadette,20," Howard, let me just stop you right here.",4
20004,Raj,20, This is it.,4
20005,Bernadette,20, Yes.,4
20006,Howard,20," Yes, what?",4
20007,Bernadette,20," Yes, I will marry you.",4
20008,Howard,20, You will?,4
20009,Raj,20, You will?,4
20010,Bernadette,20, I will. I will!,4
20011,Howard,20," Oh, I love you so much.",4
20012,Bernadette,20," Oh, I love you, too.",4
20013,Leonard,20, Congratulations!,4
20014,Priya,20," Oh, it‰Ûªs so exciting.",4
20015,Amy,20, I wonder what changed her mind.,4
20016,Sheldon,20, Perhaps your talk of my sexual prowess renewed her faith in love.,4
20017,Amy,20, As good an explanation as any.,4
20018,Leonard,20, That‰Ûªs great.,4
20019,Scene,20, Penny‰Ûªs door. ,4
20020,Penny,20," Oh, hey, Amy. Bernadette just texted me. Howard proposed?",4
20021,Amy,20," Yes, not important. Just stopped by to let you know I‰Ûªm getting orthotics. Also, I‰Ûªm carrying Sheldon‰Ûªs baby. Mum‰Ûªs the word.",4
20022,Scene,20," The stairwell, moments later. Leonard is reading a text message. ",4
20023,Leonard,20, You‰Ûªre pregnant?,4
20024,Amy,20, Wow. Is there anything on there about orthotics?,4
20025,Scene,21, The bathroom,4
20026,Sheldon,21," Leonard, are you in the shower?",4
20027,Leonard,21," I can‰Ûªt hear you, I‰Ûªm in the shower.",4
20028,Sheldon,21," I asked if you were in the shower, but that‰Ûªs moot now.",4
20029,Leonard,21, What?,4
20030,Sheldon,21, Moot. Rendered unimportant by recent events.,4
20031,Leonard,21," I can‰Ûªt hear you, I‰Ûªm in the shower.",4
20032,Sheldon,21, I have to skip the chitchat. Emergency.,4
20033,Leonard,21, What kind of emergency?,4
20034,Sheldon,21," Mathematical. 32-ounce banana smoothie, 16-ounce bladder.",4
20035,Leonard,21, You might not want to do that.,4
20036,Sheldon,21, I assure you I do.,4
20037,Leonard,21," Sheldon, I‰Ûªm not alone in here.",4
20038,Sheldon,21, What?,4
20039,Priya,21," Hello, Sheldon.",4
20040,Sheldon,21, What are you doing in there? She can‰Ûªt be in here.,4
20041,Leonard,21," We were in here first, you can‰Ûªt be in here.",4
20042,Sheldon,21," According to the roommate agreement, paragraph nine, subsection B, the right to bathroom privacy is suspended in the event of force majeure. And believe me, I am experiencing a very majeure force.",4
20043,Sheldon,21," Come on, you can‰Ûªt wait two minutes?",4
20044,Priya,21," Oh, Leonard, let the man pee.",4
20045,Scene,21, Penny‰Ûªs door. ,4
20046,Sheldon,21," (Knock, knock, knock) Penny? (Knock, knock, knock) Penny? (Knock, knock, knock) Penny?",4
20047,Penny,21, What?,4
20048,Sheldon,21, Move. Move. Move!,4
20049,Scene,21, The apartment.,4
20050,Sheldon,21," Dr. Leonard Hofstadter, you are officially charged with two violations of the roommate agreement. Do you waive reading of the charges?",4
20051,Leonard,21," Yeah, fine.",4
20052,Priya,21," Hang on. No, my client does not waive reading of the charges.",4
20053,Leonard,21, Oh. Cool. I‰Ûªve got a lawyer. And I‰Ûªve seen her naked.,4
20054,Priya,21, Proceed.,4
20055,Sheldon,21," Very well. Count the first, on or about the 28th day of April, the accused did knowingly and with malice aforethought deny access to the shared bathroom in a time of emergency, to wit, my back teeth were floating. Count the second, the accused exceeded the agreed upon occupancy of the shower, to wit, one, unless we are under attack by water-soluble aliens.",4
20056,Priya,21, Can I see the roommate agreement?,4
20057,Sheldon,21," Um, it‰Ûªs fairly technical.",4
20058,Priya,21, I think I can handle it.,4
20059,Leonard,21," Top of her class, Cambridge University. Licensed to practice law in three countries. And your face.",4
20060,Priya,21," All right, based on a cursory reading, it doesn‰Ûªt look like you have much of a case, Sheldon.",4
20061,Sheldon,21," Do so, do so.",4
20062,Priya,21," Oh, I‰Ûªm afraid not. Section seven here, on the right to enter the bathroom in emergency situations, is not specific as to what constitutes an emergency.",4
20063,Sheldon,21," Oh, that‰Ûªs ridiculous. A bathroom emergency is self-explanatory.",4
20064,Priya,21," Is it? If Leonard forgot to trim his nose hair, could he barge in while you were showering?",4
20065,Sheldon,21, Irrelevant. Leonard doesn‰Ûªt trim his nose hair. He thinks because he‰Ûªs short nobody can see up there.,4
20066,Priya,21," My point is, Sheldon, the legal principle is ambiguity in a contract benefits the party that did not draft it, in this case, Leonard. So much for count one.",4
20067,Sheldon,21, But‰Û_,4
20068,Priya,21," There‰Ûªs no buts, Sheldon, that‰Ûªs how the law works.",4
20069,Leonard,21, Schooled!,4
20070,Priya,21," As for the shower capacity issue, I cite addendum J. When Sheldon showers second, any and all measures shall be taken to ensure an adequate supply of hot water. I believe this supercedes the occupancy issue.",4
20071,Leonard,21, Superceded!,4
20072,Sheldon,21, This isn‰Ûªt over.,4
20073,Leonard,21," No offence, but shower sex with you is now the second best thing that‰Ûªs happened today.",4
20074,Scene,21, The apartment. ,4
20075,Raj,21," Mmm, Greek food on pizza night? This is the most delightfully cruel thing we‰Ûªve done to Sheldon since we left that fake message from Stephen Hawking on his voice mail.",4
20076,Priya,21, Seriously?,4
20077,Sheldon,21, What is that you‰Ûªre eating? Tonight is pizza night.,4
20078,Leonard,21, I‰Ûªd like to refer that to my attorney.,4
20079,Priya,21," According to what I see here, Thursday nights are Franconi‰Ûªs pizza night.",4
20080,Sheldon,21," Yes, and when Franconi‰Ûªs went out of business, we switched to Graziano‰Ûªs.",4
20081,Howard,21," That‰Ûªs interesting. Can you just switch restaurants like that, Priya?",4
20082,Priya,21," A good question, Howard. Turns out you can‰Ûªt. According to the document you drew up, Sheldon, the selection of a new takeout restaurant requires public hearings and a 60-day comment period. Were those criteria met?",4
20083,Sheldon,21, No.,4
20084,All,21, Opa!,4
20085,Sheldon,21," This is Greek food? Leonard, you hate Greek food.",4
20086,Leonard,21, Not as much as you.,4
20087,Sheldon,21, Fine. I‰Ûªm nothing if not adaptable.,4
20088,Leonard,21, I got you the lamb kabob.,4
20089,Sheldon,21," Thank you. If you think about it, Greek food isn‰Ûªt that far from italian food. They share a spice palette. And what a civilization is the Greeks. They gave us science, democracy, and little cubes of charred meat that taste like sweat.",4
20090,Scene,21, Penny‰Ûªs door. ,4
20091,Sheldon,21," (Knock, knock, knock) Penny? (Knock, knock, knock) Penny? (Knock, knock, knock) Penny?",4
20092,Penny,21, Hey. What‰Ûªs up?,4
20093,Sheldon,21, The mean Indian lady tried to make me eat lamb. Congratulations. Pizza night will now be at your apartment. Order one.,4
20094,Penny,21," Oh, I‰Ûªm sorry, honey, I‰Ûªm meeting Amy and Bernadette for dinner. But you‰Ûªre welcome to tag along.",4
20095,Sheldon,21," A girls night? Oh, I don‰Ûªt know if I‰Ûªm up for an evening talking about rainbows, unicorns and menstrual cramps.",4
20096,Penny,21," Okay, suit yourself. We‰Ûªll probably be trashing Priya a little.",4
20097,Sheldon,21, Shotgun.,4
20098,Scene,21, A bar.,4
20099,Penny,21," Okay, I‰Ûªd like to propose a toast to a wonderful girls night out.",4
20100,Amy,21," Fair warning, we can get ker-razy.",4
20101,Bernadette,21, Yeah. Last week we smoked cigars and pretended to be dragons.,4
20102,Sheldon,21," Really, Amy? Tobacco and alcohol? Need I remind you not a lot of scientific discoveries were made by people having a good time?",4
20103,Amy,21, Why did you bring him? He‰Ûªs harshing my buzz.,4
20104,Penny,21, I felt sorry for him. Priya‰Ûªs giving him a hard time.,4
20105,Bernadette,21," Ooh, the Priya bashing‰Ûªs starting early. Yay! Okay, what‰Ûªs up with those pantsuits?",4
20106,Amy,21, I need some context.,4
20107,Penny,21, Pantsuits suck.,4
20108,Amy,21," And that opens her up To justifiable ridicule for wearing them. Good one, Bernadette. See? Ker-razy.",4
20109,Scene,21," The same, later.",4
20110,Bernadette,21, Whee-ee-ee!,4
20111,Amy,21, You smell like baby powder.,4
20112,Sheldon,21," It‰Ûªs talc. But as that‰Ûªs a primary ingredient of baby powder, I understand your confusion.",4
20113,Amy,21," Oh, I‰Ûªm not confused at all. You‰Ûªre like a sexy toddler.",4
20114,Sheldon,21, I don‰Ûªt know how to process that.,4
20115,Bernadette,21, I do. Amy and Sheldon sitting in a tree. K-I-S-S-S-S-I-N-G.,4
20116,Penny,21, That‰Ûªs too many S‰Ûªs for kissing.,4
20117,Bernadette,21, Not if they‰Ûªre doing it for a long time.,4
20118,Penny,21," Sheldon, have you ever kissed a girl?",4
20119,Sheldon,21," Other than my mother, my sister and my mee-maw, no. But in the interest of full disclosure, I was once on a bus and had to give mouth-to-mouth resuscitation to an elderly nun who passed out from heat exhaustion. Every year I get a Christmas card from her, signed with far too many X‰Ûªs and O‰Ûªs.",4
20120,Bernadette,21, That doesn‰Ûªt count. Aren‰Ûªt you even a little curious?,4
20121,Penny,21," Yeah, you‰Ûªre a scientist, where is the curiosity?",4
20122,Amy,21, I‰Ûªm available for experimentation.,4
20123,Sheldon,21, Thank you. Not necessary. We know everything there is to know about kissing. It requires 34 facial muscles and 112 postural muscles.,4
20124,Amy,21," Oh, blah, blah, blah. Give me some sugar, bestie (kisses Penny).",4
20125,Sheldon,21, I‰Ûªm certainly glad no one said they were curious about Aztec human sacrifice.,4
20126,Penny,21," Hey, I know, let‰Ûªs take Sheldon dancing.",4
20127,Bernadette,21," Oh, I totally want to see Sheldon dance. I bet he looks like a spider on a hot plate.",4
20128,Sheldon,21," No, thank you, but for the record, I‰Ûªm an excellent dancer. Proficient in the rumba, waltz and cha-cha.",4
20129,Amy,21, Really?,4
20130,Sheldon,21, I don‰Ûªt see why that‰Ûªs surprising. I excel at so many things. You‰Ûªve had my sourdough bread.,4
20131,Penny,21, Did you take dance lessons?,4
20132,Sheldon,21," Against my will. In the South, pre-adolescent children are forced through a process called cotillion, which indoctrinates them with all the social graces and dance skills needed to function in 18th century Vienna.",4
20133,Penny,21," Oh, we are so taking you dancing.",4
20134,Sheldon,21," No, you most certainly are not.",4
20135,Bernadette,21," Well, what does your cotillion training say is expected of a gentleman when three ladies ask him to escort them to a dance soiree?",4
20136,Sheldon,21, I saved a nun‰Ûªs life. Why am I being punished?,4
20137,Scene,21, A taxi.,4
20138,Penny,21, Take us to a place we can waltz.,4
20139,Taxi driver,21, Where you can what?,4
20140,Sheldon,21," Waltz. It‰Ûªs a social dance from Austria, choreographed to a three-four time signature. (Sings Blue Danube. The taxi driver says something into radio in Korean. The word ‰ÛÏwaltz‰Û is included. Dispatcher replies also in Korean. Taxi driver sings Blue Danube. Dispatcher says ‰ÛÏoh, waltz!‰Û They speak Korean some more. )",4
20141,Taxi Driver,21, Here we go.,4
20142,Amy (singing),21," I kissed a girl and I liked it, I hope my boyfriend don‰Ûªt mind it.",4
20143,Sheldon,21, What happened to you?,4
20144,Scene,21, A Korean ballroom dancing club. Sheldon and Amy are dancing. ,4
20145,Penny,21," Shake it baby, shake it!",4
20146,Bernadette,21," Muy caliente, Sheldon!",4
20147,Elderly Korean Gentleman,21, Care to dance?,4
20148,Bernadette,21," Oh, I‰Ûªm sorry, I‰Ûªm engaged.",4
20149,Korean,21, How about you?,4
20150,Penny,21," Oh, what the hell. Ooh!",4
20151,Scene,21, Outside Amy‰Ûªs apartment. ,4
20152,Amy,21," How come if we‰Ûªre the smart people, we don‰Ûªt do this every night?",4
20153,Sheldon,21, What‰Ûªs 16 times 14?,4
20154,Amy,21, My burps taste like cranberry juice.,4
20155,Sheldon,21, And there‰Ûªs your answer.,4
20156,Amy,21, Would you like to come in for a nightcap?,4
20157,Sheldon,21," If you‰Ûªre referring to the beverage, you know I don‰Ûªt drink. If you‰Ûªre referring to the hat you don while wearing a nightshirt and holding a candle, I have one.",4
20158,Amy,21, I have yoo-hoo.,4
20159,Sheldon,21, It‰Ûªs hard to say no to yoo-hoo. The name literally beckons.,4
20160,Amy,21, Make yourself comfortable.,4
20161,Sheldon,21, Thank you. Is someone smoking?,4
20162,Amy,21," Oh, that‰Ûªs just Ricky.",4
20163,Sheldon,21, You own a smoking monkey?,4
20164,Amy,21, Don‰Ûªt be silly. He‰Ûªs one of the animals in my department‰Ûªs nicotine addiction study.,4
20165,Sheldon,21, What‰Ûªs he doing here?,4
20166,Amy,21, I‰Ûªm giving him emphysema. The least I can do is let him hang out and watch cable.,4
20167,Sheldon,21, Remarkable. Aren‰Ûªt you worried about secondhand smoke?,4
20168,Amy,21, A little. The real danger is him biting my face off while I‰Ûªm sleeping.,4
20169,Sheldon,21, is he deliberately blowing smoke at me?,4
20170,Amy,21, Yeah. He‰Ûªs kind of an ass.,4
20171,Sheldon,21, Thank you. May I share something with you that‰Ûªs troubling me?,4
20172,Amy,21, Of course. What‰Ûªs rattling around that big bulbous brain of yours?,4
20173,Sheldon,21," Priya has essentially nullified my roommate agreement with Leonard, making life in the apartment very uncomfortable for me.",4
20174,Amy,21, And you want me to kill her? Done.,4
20175,Sheldon,21," No, of course not.",4
20176,Amy,21, I trained Ricky how to smoke. I can train him to shoot a poison dart. No jury would convict us ‰Ûªcause people love monkeys.,4
20177,Sheldon,21," I understand the alcohol has stirred up whatever it is that makes girls go wild, but I really need to talk to smart Amy now.",4
20178,Amy,21, Excuse me. Have you considered that your intelligence might be the very thing causing your dilemma?,4
20179,Sheldon,21, No.,4
20180,Amy,21, What do you think Ricky over here would do if an interloper encroached on his territory?,4
20181,Sheldon,21," Well, when challenged, monkeys generally assert their dominance through chasing, assault and a stylized penile display. That‰Ûªs a little outside my comfort zone.",4
20182,Amy,21," You‰Ûªre being too literal. My point is, he would not meekly surrender to the rules, and neither should you.",4
20183,Sheldon,21, Are you suggesting I play dirty?,4
20184,Amy,21," Yes, dirty. Dirty, dirty, dirty. Which brings me to our next order of business. (Kisses him)",4
20185,Sheldon,21, Fascinating.,4
20186,Amy,21, I hope you don‰Ûªt take what I‰Ûªm about to do as a comment on what we just did. (Runs to bathroom and vomits),4
20187,Sheldon (to Ricky),21, Who‰Ûªs to say you shouldn‰Ûªt be dissecting our brains? You really are an ass.,4
20188,Scene,21, The apartment. ,4
20189,Leonard,21," Morning, Sheldon.",4
20190,Sheldon,21," Oh, good, you‰Ûªre up. I‰Ûªve written a new and improved roommate agreement that benefits me greatly. I‰Ûªd like you to sign it.",4
20191,Leonard,21, Why would I want to do that?,4
20192,Sheldon,21," Excellent question. Do you remember what happened to the alien, played by talented character actor Frank Gorshin, in the Star Trek episode Let That Be Your Last Battlefield?",4
20193,Leonard,21," Uh, Captain Kirk activated the self-destruct sequence and threatened to blow up the Enterpriseand kill them both unless he gave in?",4
20194,Sheldon,21," Affirmative. Computer, this is Dr. Sheldon Cooper. Activate self-destruct sequence. Code 1-1-A-2-B.",4
20195,Female Voice,21, Self-destruct sequence activated.,4
20196,Leonard,21," What are you gonna do, Sheldon, blow up the apartment?",4
20197,Sheldon,21," That was my first thought, but all my cool stuff is here.",4
20198,Priya,21, So what happens when it counts down?,4
20199,Sheldon,21," Unless Leonard signs the new agreement in the next 41 seconds, this computer will send an e-mail to your parents in India saying that you‰Ûªre in a secret relationship with the whiter-than-marshmallow-fluff Leonard Hofstadter.",4
20200,Priya,21," Oh, my God.",4
20201,Leonard,21, What‰Ûªs the big deal?,4
20202,Priya,21," Trust me, it‰Ûªs a big deal.",4
20203,Leonard,21," They‰Ûªre gonna find out about me eventually, right?",4
20204,Priya,21," Yeah, of course, just not today.",4
20205,Sheldon,21, 20 seconds.,4
20206,Leonard,21, Are you ashamed of me?,4
20207,Priya,21, Of course not.,4
20208,Leonard,21, Then why can‰Ûªt we tell your parents?,4
20209,Priya,21," Please, don‰Ûªt push this.",4
20210,Sheldon,21," He does that all the time, doesn‰Ûªt he? 15.",4
20211,Priya,21," Okay, fine, Sheldon, you win. Turn it off.",4
20212,Leonard,21," No, he‰Ûªs bluffing.",4
20213,Sheldon,21, I never bluff. Ten.,4
20214,Leonard,21, It‰Ûªs blackmail!,4
20215,Sheldon,21, Nine.,4
20216,Priya,21, We give up.,4
20217,Sheldon,21, Eight.,4
20218,Leonard,21, This is ridiculous. (Pulls out plug),4
20219,Sheldon,21," It‰Ûªs a laptop with a full charge. Honestly, what do you see in him?",4
20220,Priya,21, Give him what he wants or we‰Ûªre done.,4
20221,Sheldon,21, Three.,4
20222,Leonard,21, Really?,4
20223,Sheldon,21, Two.,4
20224,Leonard,21," Okay, I‰Ûªll sign it!",4
20225,Female Voice,21, Self-destruct sequence aborted.,4
20226,Sheldon,21," You may have gone to Cambridge, but I‰Ûªm an honorary graduate of Starfleet academy.",4
20227,Scene,21, The apartment. Sheldon is at his laptop. ,4
20228,Sheldon,21," Good morning, Amy.",4
20229,Amy,21, It most assuredly is not.,4
20230,Sheldon,21," Are you experiencing dehydration, headache, nausea and shame?",4
20231,Amy,21, Yes. I also found a Korean man‰Ûªs business card tucked into my cleavage. What happened last night?,4
20232,Sheldon,21," Ah, memory impairment, the free prize at the bottom of every vodka bottle.",4
20233,Amy,21, Sheldon?,4
20234,Sheldon,21," All right. Last night you gave me some excellent advice regarding my problem here at home, you kissed me and then vomited on and off for 40 minutes, following which you passed out on your bathroom floor. I then folded a towel under your head as a pillow, set your oven clock to the correct time because it was driving me crazy, and I left.",4
20235,Amy,21, Okay. Don‰Ûªt really know where we go from here.,4
20236,Sheldon,21, I suggest we treat our relationship as if it were a crashed computer and restore it to the last point we both agree it worked.,4
20237,Amy,21, Terrific. Thank you. (Noise of Ricky in background) They were out of menthols! Get off my back! Not easy living with a temperamental little primate.,4
20238,Leonard (off),21," Come on, Priya, just admit I embarrass you!",4
20239,Sheldon,21," You‰Ûªre preaching to the choir, sister.",4
20240,Scene,22," A public washroom. Amy and Penny are in cubicles, Bernadette is washing her hands.",4
20241,Amy,22," I must say, Penny, this is great fun.",4
20242,Penny,22, Glad you‰Ûªre enjoying yourself.,4
20243,Amy,22," Until I met you and Bernadette, my trips to the bathroom had been entirely focused on elimination. Now they have a delightful social aspect.",4
20244,Bernadette,22," Amy, you must‰Ûªve been in the bathroom with other women before.",4
20245,Amy,22, Of course I have. But they were strangers and seemed off-put when I engaged in friendly stall-to-stall chit-chat.,4
20246,Bernadette,22, Some women don‰Ûªt like to get chummy when their panties are down.,4
20247,Amy,22," You okay in there, bestie?",4
20248,Penny,22, I‰Ûªm fine.,4
20249,Amy,22," The reason I ask is that many people experience bladder shyness, the inability to pass urine",4
20250,Penny,22," Yeah, I said I‰Ûªm fine. Stop talking to me.",4
20251,Amy,22, She always this crabby when she urinates?,4
20252,Bernadette,22, We‰Ûªre really not that close.,4
20253,Penny,22, Screw it. I‰Ûªll go later.,4
20254,Amy,22, And I‰Ûªll be right by your side.,4
20255,Scene,22, A shoe shop. ,4
20256,Bernadette,22, Did I tell you Priya invited me and Howard to have dinner with her and Leonard?,4
20257,Penny,22," Oh, that‰Ûªs nice.",4
20258,Amy,22," No, it‰Ûªs not. It‰Ûªs a strategic manoeuvre. Leonard‰Ûªs new girlfriend is testing Bernadette‰Ûªs loyalty to you and the group. That bitch is crafty.",4
20259,Bernadette,22, You think?,4
20260,Amy,22, Of course. How does the cheetah attack a herd of wildebeests? By going after its weakest member.,4
20261,Bernadette,22," Well, what makes me the weakest member?",4
20262,Amy,22, Your trusting nature coupled with your teeny-tiny body. You wouldn‰Ûªt last a minute on the Serengeti.,4
20263,Penny,22," Okay, Amy, you‰Ûªre being silly. I am not concerned about who hangs out with who. And I certainly don‰Ûªt have a problem with Leonard‰Ûªs new girlfriend who wears way too much makeup. Ooh, these are cute. Of course if I buy them, I‰Ûªll have to rent my womb out to a gay couple.",4
20264,Bernadette,22, It doesn‰Ûªt matter. I‰Ûªm going to tell her we can‰Ûªt make it.,4
20265,Amy,22," Oh, no. You have to go.",4
20266,Bernadette,22, I don‰Ûªt understand. I thought I was a teeny-tiny wildebeest.,4
20267,Amy,22," You are, with hair that smells like strawberries. And we‰Ûªre going to use that to our advantage.",4
20268,Penny,22, Wait. What are you talking about?,4
20269,Amy,22," By accepting the invitation, Bernadette becomes a double agent inside the enemy camp. She could ferret out Priya‰Ûªs tactics, identify her weaknesses and feed her false information, such as, Leonard‰Ûªs no stranger to back-alley cockfights.",4
20270,Bernadette,22, I don‰Ûªt know. I‰Ûªm not a very good liar. They kind of whup that out of you in Catholic school.,4
20271,Amy,22, Don‰Ûªt worry. I‰Ûªll teach you. I did two years of Cub Scouts before they found out I was a girl.,4
20272,Penny,22," Okay, I don‰Ûªt know you people. I‰Ûªm just an innocent woman wondering if this shoe store will take my Texaco card.",4
20273,Amy,22, How do you feel about concealing a recording device in the cleavage of your ample bosom?,4
20274,Bernadette,22, I don‰Ûªt want anything in my ample bosom.,4
20275,Amy,22," Come on, Strawberries. Take one for the team.",4
20276,Leonard,22," Okay, see you later.",4
20277,Sheldon,22, Good news. I finally have a handle on my idea for three-person chess.,4
20278,Leonard,22, That is good news. Bye.,4
20279,Sheldon,22," Uh, do you know how I solved the balanced centre combat-area problem? Five words, transitional quadrilateral to triangular tessellation.",4
20280,Leonard,22," That, that‰Ûªs brilliant.",4
20281,Sheldon,22," It‰Ûªs what I do. But wait, there‰Ûªs more. I also invented two new chess pieces. The serpent, and the old woman.",4
20282,Leonard,22," Okay, now I have to ask. What do they do?",4
20283,Sheldon,22," When the serpent slithers to an opposing player‰Ûªs piece, that piece is considered poisoned and will die after two more moves. Ugh.",4
20284,Leonard,22, All right.,4
20285,Sheldon,22," Unless, it gets to the old woman in time, in which case she sucks out the poison, turning her into the Grand Empress, a piece combining the power of the knight, queen and serpent.",4
20286,Leonard,22, Elegant.,4
20287,Sheldon,22, That‰Ûªs because it‰Ûªs simple.,4
20288,Leonard,22," Okay, well, I look forward to playing with you.",4
20289,Sheldon,22, And‰Û_,4
20290,Leonard,22, And what?,4
20291,Sheldon,22," And a third person. It‰Ûªs three-person chess. I must say, ever since you started having regular intercourse, your mind has lost its keen edge. You should reflect on that.",4
20292,Leonard,22," Excuse me, but Einstein had a pretty busy sex life.",4
20293,Sheldon,22," Yes, and he never unified gravity with the other forces. If he hadn‰Ûªt been such a hound dog, we‰Ûªd all have time machines.",4
20294,Leonard,22, Got it. Bye.,4
20295,Sheldon,22, You know I‰Ûªm right.,4
20296,Leonard (outside apartment),22, I think he‰Ûªs getting worse.,4
20297,Amy,22," Oh, my metatarsal are barking.",4
20298,Leonard,22, You okay?,4
20299,Amy,22," Yeah, yeah. I‰Ûªm just breaking in some new shoes.",4
20300,Leonard,22, Very pretty.,4
20301,Amy,22, Thank you. Did you know that women wear high heels to make the buttocks and breasts more prominent?,4
20302,Leonard,22, Hadn‰Ûªt really thought about it.,4
20303,Amy,22, Look.,4
20304,Leonard,22," Uh, sure. Very‰Û_ prominent.",4
20305,Amy,22," Please, Leonard, don‰Ûªt leer, you have a girlfriend.",4
20306,Leonard,22, Sorry.,4
20307,Amy,22," So, are you off to dinner with Priya, Howard and Bernadette?",4
20308,Leonard,22, Yeah. How did you know?,4
20309,Amy,22," I heard it at the mall, when I was shopping with my girlfriends, ‰Ûªcause, you know, that‰Ûªs kind of my life now. Have a good night. Try not to ogle my caboose as I walk away.",4
20310,Scene,22, Raj‰Ûªs apartment.,4
20311,Priya,22," Hey, you.",4
20312,Leonard,22," Hi. Hey, Raj, will you be joining us for dinner?",4
20313,Raj,22, The lonely guy and the two happy couples? I‰Ûªd rather get a prostate exam from a leper who walks away with nine fingers.,4
20314,Priya,22," Oh, would you please stop feeling sorry for yourself?",4
20315,Raj,22, I have to feel sorry for myself. I‰Ûªm the only one who cares. Just like I‰Ûªm the only one who‰Ûªll have sex with me.,4
20316,Leonard,22, Really? In front of your sister?,4
20317,Priya,22, We shared a room growing up. This is not news to me.,4
20318,Raj,22," Excuse me. I‰Ûªm going to go wander the streets alone. Invisible, unwanted and unloved, a pathetic shadow in a city with no heart. (Leaves, then returns a moment later) I forgot my windbreaker. It‰Ûªs chilly.",4
20319,Scene,22, Penny‰Ûªs apartment. ,4
20320,Amy,22, I don‰Ûªt understand. Is this a way to break in new shoes?,4
20321,Penny,22," No. Once these puppies touch the ground they‰Ûªre mine, and I‰Ûªll have to wear them walking up and down Hollywood Boulevard in order to pay them off. Pretty, pretty, pretty.",4
20322,Penny,22, The what?,4
20323,Amy,22, Bernadette is with Priya and Leonard. Message received. Commence operation ‰ÛÏPriya Wouldn‰Ûªt Wanna Be-ya.‰Û,4
20324,Penny,22, Hey. Seriously? Didn‰Ûªt you get enough of this cliquey crap in high school?,4
20325,Amy,22, I wish. A clique requires friends. I didn‰Ûªt have any.,4
20326,Penny,22, None?,4
20327,Amy,22, I used to take my lunch down to the maintenance room and eat with the janitor. It was nice until his wife called me a puta and made me stop. Hang on. It‰Ûªs the wildebeest. Priya just made a snide comment about your acting career.,4
20328,Penny,22, Wh‰Û_ What the hell did she say?,4
20329,Amy,22," She thinks it‰Ûªs cool you‰Ûªre following your dream, no matter what.",4
20330,Penny,22, That bitch!,4
20331,Amy,22, How do you want to handle it?,4
20332,Penny,22," Um, okay. Tell Bernadette to tell Priya that I‰Ûªm on my way to Prague to shoot a movie with Angelina Jolie.",4
20333,Amy,22, Got it. Is it going to be in 3-D?,4
20334,Penny,22, What? I don‰Ûªt know. It doesn‰Ûªt matter.,4
20335,Amy,22, I‰Ûªm gonna say 3-D. That‰Ûªll let her know the studio has faith in it.,4
20336,Scene,22, Raj‰Ûªs apartment.,4
20337,Leonard,22, You‰Ûªre kidding. 3-D?,4
20338,Bernadette,22, That‰Ûªs what I hear.,4
20339,Howard,22, Then the studio must have real faith in it.,4
20340,Leonard,22, Wonder why she didn‰Ûªt tell me.,4
20341,Priya,22, Have you been spending time with your ex-girlfriend?,4
20342,Leonard,22, No.,4
20343,Priya,22, Then why are you surprised she didn‰Ûªt tell you?,4
20344,Leonard,22," Well, it‰Ûªs not as much surprised as, uh, uh, you know, uh. th-th-th-the other thing.",4
20345,Priya,22, What other thing?,4
20346,Leonard,22," Well, you know, if you, if, if, if you, uh, I don‰Ûªt, oh, what‰Ûªs the word I‰Ûªm looking for?",4
20347,Howard,22, I‰Ûªm not going to help you. This is hilarious.,4
20348,Bernadette,22, She‰Ûªs also dating an astronaut.,4
20349,Priya,22, Wow. That‰Ûªs very impressive.,4
20350,Bernadette,22," Yeah. But Leonard‰Ûªs impressive, too.",4
20351,Leonard,22, Thank you. Befuddled. The word I was looking for was befuddled.,4
20352,Scene,22, The apartment. Sheldon is playing three person chess by himself. ,4
20353,Sheldon,22, Knight to old woman six-and-a-third. Brilliant move. Thank you. (Knock on door) Will the two of you excuse me?,4
20354,Raj,22, I need a hug.,4
20355,Sheldon,22," Sorry, I have company.",4
20356,Raj,22," Come on, Sheldon, open the door.",4
20357,Sheldon,22, I don‰Ûªt want to hug you.,4
20358,Raj,22," I don‰Ûªt want to hug you, either. I was just feeling blue.",4
20359,Sheldon,22," Blue, as in depressed.",4
20360,Raj,22," Well, not so much depressed as lonely.",4
20361,Sheldon,22, I don‰Ûªt know what colour lonely is.,4
20362,Raj,22, What?,4
20363,Sheldon,22," Red is angry, yellow is frightened, green is jealous and blue is depressed. Perhaps we can assign a colour to lonely.",4
20364,Raj,22, Nothing rhymes with orange. It‰Ûªs probably lonely.,4
20365,Sheldon,22," All right. Come in. You look positively orange with loneliness. No, I don‰Ûªt see that catching on at all.",4
20366,Raj,22, What are you doing?,4
20367,Sheldon,22, I‰Ûªm working on my three-person chess game.,4
20368,Raj,22," Oh, cool. Can I play?",4
20369,Sheldon,22, It‰Ûªs three-person chess. Did you bring a friend?,4
20370,Raj,22, No.,4
20371,Sheldon,22," Then as a mental exercise I invite you to figure out why the two of us can‰Ûªt play three-person chess. Can you believe this guy? Social protocol does, however, require me to bring you a hot beverage in your time of need.",4
20372,Raj,22," No, thank you. I‰Ûªm fine.",4
20373,Sheldon,22, It‰Ûªs not optional. We‰Ûªre out of tea. I hope you like bouillon.,4
20374,Raj,22," I, uh, I guess you‰Ûªre probably wondering what‰Ûªs got me down.",4
20375,Sheldon,22," Actually, I was wondering if I could add a third new chess piece. How do you think people would feel about Prince Joey, the king‰Ûªs feeble-minded but well-meaning cousin?",4
20376,Raj,22," I‰Ûªm going to be 30 years old, and I have no one in my life to love me. I‰Ûªm such a basket case, I can‰Ûªt even talk to a woman without having alcohol in my body.",4
20377,Sheldon,22," The fun thing about Prince Joey is every time he moves, there‰Ûªs a one-in-five chance he‰Ûªll kill himself.",4
20378,Raj,22," Sheldon, listen to me. I have a big decision to make, and I‰Ûªm scared.",4
20379,Sheldon,22, Yellow. Go ahead.,4
20380,Raj,22, A friend at the School of Pharmacology gave me these new pills they‰Ûªre testing. He says it‰Ûªs the next big thing for social anxiety disorder.,4
20381,Sheldon,22, Fascinating. What‰Ûªs in it?,4
20382,Raj,22, I‰Ûªm not sure. Some sort of beta-blocker attached to a molecule extracted from the urine of cows.,4
20383,Sheldon,22, I like cows.,4
20384,Raj,22, That‰Ûªs not the point.,4
20385,Sheldon,22, It was its own point. Go on.,4
20386,Raj,22," I‰Ûªm a scientist. My ability to think is my bread and butter. I‰Ûªm afraid if I take this, I might lose that special, unique something that makes me so successful in my field.",4
20387,Sheldon,22," Rajesh, I‰Ûªve had the privilege of working alongside you for many years. My recommendation is that you gobble these up like Tic Tacs.",4
20388,Scene,22, Raj‰Ûªs apartment. ,4
20389,Howard,22," Okay, I‰Ûªm still trying to work this out. How did Penny meet an astronaut?",4
20390,Bernadette,22, I don‰Ûªt know. The regular way people meet astronauts.,4
20391,Howard,22, Most of those guys live in Texas.,4
20392,Bernadette,22," Obviously, this one doesn‰Ûªt.",4
20393,Howard,22, Okay.,4
20394,Bernadette,22," Leonard lives here. Priya‰Ûªs from India. People meet, Howard. God!",4
20395,Howard,22, Fine.,4
20396,Bernadette,22," You‰Ûªve met lots of astronauts, and I‰Ûªve never grilled you about that. I‰Ûªd thank you to extend me the same courtesy.",4
20397,Howard,22," I‰Ûªm not grilling you, I was just curious.",4
20398,Leonard,22," I still can‰Ûªt get over the fact that she got a big movie part. Not that I care what my ex-girlfriend‰Ûªs up to, ‰Ûªcause I don‰Ûªt.",4
20399,Bernadette,22," Maybe that‰Ûªs where she met the astronaut, all right?",4
20400,Priya,22, I‰Ûªm sorry. What would an astronaut be doing working on a movie?,4
20401,Bernadette,22, He‰Ûªs a consultant.,4
20402,Leonard,22, I thought the movie was about 18th-century Vienna?,4
20403,Bernadette,22," He can‰Ûªt have a hobby? Excuse me, I have to pee. Or is that implausible, as well?",4
20404,Howard,22," It‰Ûªs nice to have another couple to hang with, isn‰Ûªt it?",4
20405,Scene,22, Penny‰Ûªs apartment. ,4
20406,Penny (to the shoes),22," All right, guys, you have to go back. I can‰Ûªt afford you. ‰ÛÏNo, don‰Ûªt send",4
20407,Amy,22," Good golly, Penny, your whimsy is boundless. (Phone rings) What do you got for me, wildebeest?",4
20408,Bernadette (in Raj‰Ûªs bathroom),22, I think they‰Ûªre on to me. The story‰Ûªs starting to fall apart.,4
20409,Amy,22," Calm down. Everything‰Ûªs going to be okay. (To Penny) We may have to kill her. Bernadette, I‰Ûªm putting you on speakerphone. Where are you now?",4
20410,Bernadette,22, In the bathroom.,4
20411,Amy,22," Oh, look at this, another one of our classic bathroom gabfests. What‰Ûªs the problem?",4
20412,Bernadette,22, They‰Ûªre just asking me all sorts of questions I can‰Ûªt answer.,4
20413,Amy,22, Just change the subject.,4
20414,Bernadette,22, I suppose I could get them back to talking about Leonard going to India to meet Priya‰Ûªs parents.,4
20415,Penny,22, What?,4
20416,Bernadette,22, They said something about going there this summer.,4
20417,Penny,22," What, are they getting engaged?",4
20418,Bernadette,22, I don‰Ûªt know. I was too busy covering my heinie on Amy‰Ûªs stupid astronaut story!,4
20419,Amy,22, What astronaut story?,4
20420,Bernadette,22, You texted me Penny‰Ûªs dating an astronaut.,4
20421,Amy,22, I texted architect. That‰Ûªs amusing. Auto-correct must‰Ûªve changed it.,4
20422,Bernadette,22," Yeah, it‰Ûªs hysterical.",4
20423,Penny,22," All right, look, just forget about the astronaut.",4
20424,Amy,22, Architect. Where would you have met an astronaut?,4
20425,Penny,22," Look, just find out what‰Ûªs up with this trip to India.",4
20426,Bernadette,22, I don‰Ûªt want to do this anymore!,4
20427,Penny,22, Don‰Ûªt you quit on us!,4
20428,Howard (knocking on bathroom door),22," Bernie, you okay?",4
20429,Bernadette (screaming),22, It was an architect!,4
20430,Scene,22, A coffee shop.,4
20431,Raj,22," Thank you for coming with me, Sheldon. You‰Ûªre a good friend.",4
20432,Sheldon,22, I‰Ûªm glad you think so. That‰Ûªs what I strive to emulate.,4
20433,Raj,22," Okay, let‰Ûªs see if this drug works.",4
20434,Woman at table,22, Can I help you?,4
20435,Raj,22," Forgive me for staring, but you‰Ûªre very beautiful.",4
20436,Woman,22, Thank you. That‰Ûªs a great accent. Where are you from?,4
20437,Raj,22, India.,4
20438,Woman,22," Oh, cool. I‰Ûªve always wanted to go there.",4
20439,Raj,22, It‰Ûªs a beautiful country. You‰Ûªd love it. May I join you?,4
20440,Woman,22," Uh, okay, sure. Why not?",4
20441,Raj,22," My name is Dr. Rajesh Koothrappali, and this is my friend Dr. Sheldon Cooper.",4
20442,Woman,22, Hi.,4
20443,Sheldon,22," Oh, there‰Ûªs no need to interact with me. I‰Ûªm just here to observe.",4
20444,Woman,22, What‰Ûªs he observing?,4
20445,Raj,22," We‰Ûªre scientists. We observe everything. Here, go buy yourself a scone.",4
20446,Sheldon,22, All right.,4
20447,Raj,22, And what is your name?,4
20448,Woman,22, Angela.,4
20449,Raj,22," Oh, derived from the word angel. Appropriate.",4
20450,Angela,22, You‰Ûªre cute.,4
20451,Sheldon,22, I‰Ûªd like to buy a scone.,4
20452,Server,22," Oh, I‰Ûªm sorry, we‰Ûªre out. We have muffins.",4
20453,Sheldon,22," They sound delicious, but this money is earmarked for scones.",4
20454,Angela,22, What are you doing?,4
20455,Raj (taking his shirt off),22," Oh, just getting comfortable. So how long have you lived in Los Angeles?",4
20456,Angela,22, I‰Û_,4
20457,Sheldon,22, They were out of scones.,4
20458,Raj (removing his trousers),22," Sheldon, I‰Ûªm talking to someone. You‰Ûªre being rude. I‰Ûªll bet you‰Ûªre an actress. If not, you should be. You have a very expressive face.",4
20459,Angela,22," Oh, my God.",4
20460,Raj,22," Wait, where are you going? We were doing so well. She never even got to see my penis. Ta-da!",4
20461,Scene,22," Raj‰Ûªs apartment. They are playing Jenga, ",4
20462,Priya,22, Who wants some more coffee?,4
20463,Leonard,22," Thanks, yeah.",4
20464,Howard,22, Sure.,4
20465,Bernadette,22, Let me help you.,4
20466,Howard,22, Nice to see that the gals are getting along.,4
20467,Leonard,22," Gals? Who are you, Fred Flintstone?",4
20468,Bernadette,22, This trip to India sounds fun.,4
20469,Priya,22," Yeah, I think it will be.",4
20470,Bernadette,22, Are you concerned your parents might not approve of Leonard?,4
20471,Priya,22, A little. They‰Ûªre very old-fashioned.,4
20472,Bernadette,22," Well, I wouldn‰Ûªt worry about it. It‰Ûªs not like you guys are getting engaged, right?",4
20473,Priya,22," Oh, God, no. We‰Ûªre not there yet.",4
20474,Bernadette,22, Not engaged. Very interesting. I have to tinkle.,4
20475,Priya,22, You‰Ûªve been in there a lot tonight. Are you okay?,4
20476,Bernadette,22, Yes. Are you writing a book?,4
20477,Priya,22, Why are you getting upset?,4
20478,Bernadette,22, I‰Ûªm not upset. Maybe you‰Ûªre upset.,4
20479,Priya,22, What‰Ûªs up with you? Bernadette?,4
20480,Bernadette,22," I can‰Ûªt do this anymore! I‰Ûªm a good girl! I went to Catholic school! (Storms out,)",4
20481,Howard,22," Okay, well, it‰Ûªs getting late. This was terrific. You win. Bernie?",4
20482,Leonard,22, I think the word you‰Ûªre looking for is befuddled.,4
20483,Scene,22," The apartment. Sheldon, Leonard and Howard are playing three person chess. ",4
20484,Sheldon,22, My catapult flings my bishop to Howard‰Ûªs Queen‰Ûªs Gorilla two.,4
20485,Howard,22," Nice. Okay, rook to transporter pad. And he comes out at Leonard‰Ûªs Queen‰Ûªs Bishop",4
20486,Leonard,22, Hang on. When is my pawn allowed to use the golf cart?,4
20487,Sheldon,22, When it‰Ûªs done charging. Or you land on the time machine. Obviously.,4
20488,Leonard,22," Oh, oh, Beekeeper to King 12. I capture your Pope and release the swarm. Checkmate on Sheldon.",4
20489,Sheldon,22, I knew I should have given my Pope the jet pack.,4
20490,Raj (still naked),22," Hey, I‰Ûªve got winners.",4
20491,Scene,23, The Cheesecake Factory,4
20492,Penny,23," Hey, do me a favour and take table seven.",4
20493,Bernadette,23, You mean the one with my one hundred and eighteen-pound rock-hard stud of a fiancÌ© who‰Ûªs prone to canker sores and pinkeye?,4
20494,Penny,23," Nah, I prefer to look at it as the one with my ex-boyfriend and his gorgeous, successful and sophisticated girlfriend, who makes me feel like a toothless Okie.",4
20495,Bernadette,23, Do you want me to spill hot soup on her?,4
20496,Penny,23," Oh, please, you‰Ûªre not that kind of person.",4
20497,Bernadette,23, I know. But if she orders something low-fat I‰Ûªll totally give her the full-fat version.,4
20498,Leonard,23," Uh, that‰Ûªs my water.",4
20499,Sheldon,23, What?,4
20500,Leonard,23, My water. You‰Ûªre drinking it.,4
20501,Sheldon,23, Dear Lord! Have you been drinking it?,4
20502,Leonard,23, Yes. It‰Ûªs my water.,4
20503,Sheldon,23," Well, that‰Ûªs it then. I‰Ûªm dead.",4
20504,Leonard,23, Here we go.,4
20505,Sheldon,23," I‰Ûªm sorry, do I really need to connect the dots for you? The backwash into this glass is every pathogen that calls your mouth home, sweet home. Not to mention the visitors who arrive on the dancing tongue of your subtropical girlfriend.",4
20506,Raj,23," Hey! That‰Ûªs my sister and my country you‰Ûªre talking about. Leonard may have defiled one, but I won‰Ûªt have you talking smack about the other.",4
20507,Bernadette,23, You guys ready to order?,4
20508,Sheldon,23," Yes, I‰Ûªd like a seven-day course of penicillin, some, uh, syrup of ipecac, to induce vomiting, and a mint.",4
20509,Bernadette,23, I don‰Ûªt understand.,4
20510,Howard,23, He drank from Leonard‰Ûªs glass.,4
20511,Sheldon,23, He drank from Leonard‰Ûªs glass. Words they‰Ûªll be carving into my tombstone.,4
20512,Leonard,23, That‰Ûªs actually my napkin.,4
20513,Sheldon,23," Oh, this is a nightmare!",4
20514,Howard,23, Where are you going?,4
20515,Sheldon,23," To the bar, to sterilize my mouth with alcohol. Gang way! Dead man walking!",4
20516,Scene,23, The same. ,4
20517,Bernadette,23," All right. Here you go. Two lemonades, one iced tea and a root beer for Priya.",4
20518,Priya,23, Is it diet?,4
20519,Bernadette,23, That‰Ûªs what you ordered.,4
20520,Priya,23," Thank you. Hey, have you and Howard started planning your wedding yet?",4
20521,Bernadette,23, Yeah. We‰Ûªre thinking of having it on a cliff overlooking the ocean.,4
20522,Howard,23, Nothing soothes those pre-wedding jitters like the thought of falling and drowning.,4
20523,Leonard,23, What did your mother say when you told her you were getting married?,4
20524,Bernadette,23, He hasn‰Ûªt told her yet. He‰Ûªs waiting for the right time.,4
20525,Howard,23, I was thinking of weaving it into her eulogy.,4
20526,Priya,23," Howard, you‰Ûªve got to tell your mother.",4
20527,Howard,23," Hey, have you told your parents you‰Ûªre dating this short glass of skim milk here?",4
20528,Priya,23," Uh, that‰Ûªs different. First of all, we‰Ûªre not engaged, and second, Indian parents are very protective of their children.",4
20529,Howard,23," Right, right, whereas Jewish mothers take a casual, la-di-da approach to their sons.",4
20530,Sheldon,23, I gargled with tequila and may have swallowed a teeny bit.,4
20531,Leonard,23, You all right?,4
20532,Sheldon,23, Fine. Thank you for asking. I love you so much.,4
20533,Scene,23, The apartment. ,4
20534,Sheldon,23, Fire demon.,4
20535,Raj,23," Ooh, fire demon. Sheldon‰Ûªs turning up the heat.",4
20536,Howard,23, Troll master.,4
20537,Raj,23, Check it! Howard pulls one out from under the bridge. Nice!,4
20538,Leonard,23, Water nymph.,4
20539,Raj,23," Oh, yeah, she‰Ûªs got puddles in all the right places.",4
20540,Sheldon,23, Could you please play the game without commenting on every card?,4
20541,Raj,23, Sorry. Walking tree.,4
20542,Sheldon,23, Last one.,4
20543,Raj,23, I‰Ûªm taking a stroll and I‰Ûªm sporting wood.,4
20544,Howard (reading a text),23," Okay, the Eagle has landed.",4
20545,Leonard,23, What‰Ûªs going on?,4
20546,Howard,23, Bernadette and my mother are having a get-to-know-you lunch at the Old Town Deli.,4
20547,Raj,23," Oh, that sounds lovely.",4
20548,Howard,23," Hope so. Of course, if history is any indication, my mother will swallow her whole and spit out her bones like an owl.",4
20549,Leonard,23, Have you met Bernadette‰Ûªs parents?,4
20550,Howard,23, You mean Adolf and Eva? Not yet. One goose step at a time.,4
20551,Raj,23," Sheldon, that‰Ûªs my water.",4
20552,Sheldon,23," Oh, dear Lord!",4
20553,Leonard,23, That‰Ûªs not your water.,4
20554,Raj,23, I know.,4
20555,Sheldon,23, Where‰Ûªs the mouthwash?,4
20556,Raj (holding it),23, Where indeed.,4
20557,Scene,23, Howard‰Ûªs house. ,4
20558,Howard,23," Ma, I‰Ûªm home! Where are you?",4
20559,Mrs Wolowitz (off),23, I‰Ûªm in the toilet.,4
20560,Howard,23," So, how‰Ûªd it go?",4
20561,Mrs Wolowitz,23, Too soon to say. I‰Ûªm not done yet.,4
20562,Howard,23," No, I mean lunch, today, with Bernadette.",4
20563,Mrs Wolowitz,23, Oh! I had a pastrami sandwich. She had eggplant lasagna. Like that‰Ûªs what a person orders in a Jewish deli.,4
20564,Howard,23," Besides food, did you get along? Did you talk?",4
20565,Mrs Wolowitz,23," Oh, sure. Did you know she‰Ûªs going to school to become a microbiologist?",4
20566,Howard,23," No, she never mentioned it.",4
20567,Mrs Wolowitz,23, I bet she did and you didn‰Ûªt listen.,4
20568,Howard,23," Yeah, that‰Ûªs probably it. So, what do you think? Do you like her? She‰Ûªs great, huh?",4
20569,Mrs Wolowitz,23, She‰Ûªs a lovely girl. Cute as a button.,4
20570,Howard,23," That‰Ûªs good to hear, ‰Ûªcause I‰Ûªve got some news.",4
20571,Mrs Wolowitz,23," I hope it‰Ûªs good news, because I‰Ûªve got nothing but disappointment in here!",4
20572,Howard,23," Bernadette and I are getting married. Ma? You too busy bearing down? Ma? (crashing sound from in bathroom) Oh, my God, Ma? Ma? Ma? Stand back, I‰Ûªm gonna break the door down! (Runs at door. It doesn‰Ûªt break down. Falls over.) Son of a bitch! Ma, help!",4
20573,Scene,23, The laundry room.,4
20574,Penny,23, Hey.,4
20575,Sheldon,23, Hello.,4
20576,Penny,23, Haven‰Ûªt seen you in a while. How‰Ûªs it going?,4
20577,Sheldon,23," Oh, other than waiting out the exponential growth period of the virulent organisms trooping through my microvilli into my circulatory system, hunky-dory. (Penny laughs) Did I say something amusing?",4
20578,Penny,23," I don‰Ûªt know, maybe, I have no idea what you said.",4
20579,Sheldon,23, So your mirth is merely a discharge of nervous energy with no semantic content at all?,4
20580,Penny,23, My mirth. Classic.,4
20581,Sheldon,23, Is there a station coming up where I can board your giggling train of thought?,4
20582,Penny,23," It‰Ûªs not a big deal, Sheldon. It‰Ûªs just, ever since Leonard‰Ûªs been dating Raj‰Ûªs sister, I‰Ûªve had to keep my distance. I don‰Ûªt get to hear all your jibber-jabber.",4
20583,Sheldon,23, Jibber-jabber? I don‰Ûªt jibber-jabber.,4
20584,Penny,23, What are you doing at work these days?,4
20585,Sheldon,23," Oh, I‰Ûªm working on time-dependent backgrounds in string theory, specifically quantum field theory in D-dimensional de Sitter space.",4
20586,Penny,23," Alright, come on, even you have to admit that‰Ûªs jibber-jabber.",4
20587,Sheldon,23," Interesting, do you know where the phrase jibber-jabber comes from?",4
20588,Penny,23," Oh, my God, you‰Ûªre about to jibber-jabber about jibber-jabber.",4
20589,Leonard,23," Howard and his mother are at the hospital. Come on, we gotta go.",4
20590,Penny,23," Oh, my God! What happened?",4
20591,Leonard,23," I don‰Ûªt know, I just got a text. Come on, hurry.",4
20592,Penny,23, Okay.,4
20593,Leonard,23," Sheldon, let‰Ûªs go!",4
20594,Sheldon,23," To a hospital? Full of sick people? Oh, I don‰Ûªt think so.",4
20595,Penny,23," Okay, well, your friend and his mother are there, we‰Ûªre going.",4
20596,Sheldon,23, I can‰Ûªt.,4
20597,Penny,23," Oh, don‰Ûªt tell me you‰Ûªre afraid of germs.",4
20598,Sheldon,23," Not all germs. Just the ones that will kill me. It‰Ûªs the same way I‰Ûªm not afraid of all steak knives, just the ones that might be plunged in my thorax.",4
20599,Leonard,23," Right, fine. I‰Ûªll tell Howard you didn‰Ûªt come because you‰Ûªre more concerned about your own well-being than his.",4
20600,Sheldon,23, I would think he would know that.,4
20601,Penny,23," Okay, you know what? You are unbelievable. You buy all these superhero T-shirts, but when it‰Ûªs time for you to step up and do the right thing, you just hide in the laundry room.",4
20602,Sheldon,23," Fine, I‰Ûªll go. Just for the record, my Aunt Ruth died in a hospital. She went in to visit my Uncle Roger, caught something and bit the dust a week later. The two of them now share a coffee can on my mother‰Ûªs mantel.",4
20603,Scene,23, A hospital waiting room. ,4
20604,Howard,23," So I knocked down the bathroom door, picked up my poor unconscious mother, carried her to the car, and drove like a madman to the emergency room.",4
20605,Bernadette,23," You‰Ûªre a real hero, Howard.",4
20606,Howard,23," No, I did what any son would do.",4
20607,Penny,23," Hang on a second, you picked up your mother? Her own legs are barely able to do that.",4
20608,Howard,23, I was filled with adrenaline. It happens to be how women lift cars off babies.,4
20609,Penny,23," Yeah, I‰Ûªm saying, it‰Ûªd be easier to lift a car.",4
20610,Howard,23," What can I tell you? After I found the courage to put her pants back on, I was unstoppable.",4
20611,Leonard,23," So, how is she?",4
20612,Howard,23, They‰Ûªre running tests. I don‰Ûªt know. It may have been a heart attack or heart-attack-like event.,4
20613,Penny,23, What‰Ûªs the difference?,4
20614,Sheldon,23, A heart-attack-like event is an event that‰Ûªs like a heart attack.,4
20615,Penny,23, Thanks for clearing that up.,4
20616,Sheldon,23," Regardless, coronary problems are eminently treatable. What‰Ûªs more likely going to kill Howard‰Ûªs mother are the antibiotic-resistant super-bugs festering in every nook and cranny of this hospital.",4
20617,Penny,23," Okay, you‰Ûªre not helping.",4
20618,Sheldon,23, Disagree.,4
20619,Leonard,23, Go sit over there.,4
20620,Sheldon,23," I‰Ûªll sit over there, it looks cleaner.",4
20621,Leonard,23, Is there a history of heart disease in your family?,4
20622,Howard,23, My family is the history of heart disease. There‰Ûªs a cave painting in France of one of my ancestors doing this (clutches chest).,4
20623,Bernadette,23, So it‰Ûªs probably genetic.,4
20624,Howard,23," Well, maybe. Mom also had just gotten some news that might have upset her.",4
20625,Bernadette,23, What?,4
20626,Howard,23, It‰Ûªs not important.,4
20627,Bernadette,23," Come on, Howard, I‰Ûªm going to be your wife. You can share anything with me.",4
20628,Howard,23, You‰Ûªd think that. But no.,4
20629,Bernadette,23, You told her we were going to get married and she had a heart attack?,4
20630,Howard,23, You can‰Ûªt take that personally.,4
20631,Penny,23, How else is she supposed to take it?,4
20632,Howard,23," What you‰Ûªve got to keep in mind is that ever since my dad left, I‰Ûªve been the whole world to my mother. I mean, she‰Ûªd be threatened by any woman who can give me what she can‰Ûªt.",4
20633,Bernadette,23, You mean sexual intercourse?,4
20634,Howard,23," Well, when you say it like that you make it sound creepy.",4
20635,Priya (arriving),23, What happened?,4
20636,Bernadette,23, Howard‰Ûªs mother had a heart attack because I have sex with him and she can‰Ûªt.,4
20637,Howard,23," Bernie, wait!",4
20638,Sheldon (to Raj),23," I‰Ûªll give you $1,000 if you‰Ûªll drive me home.",4
20639,Scene,23," The same, later.",4
20640,Priya,23, Nice of you to come for Howard.,4
20641,Penny,23," Well, he‰Ûªs my friend. It‰Ûªs what you do. (Laughs)",4
20642,Priya,23," I‰Ûªm sorry, did I miss something?",4
20643,Penny,23," It‰Ûªs just so weird. Howard Wolowitz is my friend. You know, once he tried to stick his tongue down my throat and I broke his nose.",4
20644,Priya,23, That‰Ûªs a little easier to believe than he‰Ûªs your friend.,4
20645,Penny,23," Yeah, tell me about it.",4
20646,Priya,23," You know, my brother had a group of friends like this in India. They dressed up in leotards and goggles and called themselves the New Delhi Power Rangers.",4
20647,Penny,23, You mean when he was little.,4
20648,Priya,23, Not as little as you‰Ûªd want him to be.,4
20649,Penny,23," You know, this stuff is horrible. You want to see if we can find the cafeteria and get real coffee?",4
20650,Priya,23, Sure. We‰Ûªre going to the cafeteria to get some coffee. You want anything?,4
20651,Leonard,23, I‰Ûªm fine. That‰Ûªs nice that they‰Ûªre getting along.,4
20652,Raj,23," Your girlfriend and your ex-girlfriend are hanging out together? Oh, yeah, that can only be good for you.",4
20653,Leonard,23, What are you talking about?,4
20654,Raj,23, One of them broke up with you. Do you really want her telling the other one why?,4
20655,Leonard,23, I don‰Ûªt care. I don‰Ûªt have anything to hide.,4
20656,Raj,23," Good, good. Then you have nothing to worry about.",4
20657,Leonard,23," No, I do not. You are a mean little man.",4
20658,Raj,23," You‰Ûªd think it‰Ûªd be because my parents didn‰Ûªt love me, but actually they loved me a great deal.",4
20659,Howard,23," Bernie, it‰Ûªs not you. She‰Ûªs just set in her ways.",4
20660,Bernadette,23, How can we be together if the thought of us getting married might kill your mother?,4
20661,Howard,23," It‰Ûªs the circle of life, sweetie. One day our son will marry someone and it will kill you.",4
20662,Sheldon,23," Howard, I have to go to the bathroom and no one will take me home.",4
20663,Howard,23, What‰Ûªs wrong with the bathroom here?,4
20664,Sheldon,23," Pneumococcus, streptococcus, staphylococcus and other assorted coccuses.",4
20665,Howard,23," Sheldon, my mother is on her deathbed and my fiancÌ©e is grief-stricken over putting her there. I‰Ûªm not taking you home.",4
20666,Sheldon,23," Will you at least go with me to the restroom here, so you can open the door and flush the urinal?",4
20667,Howard,23, No!,4
20668,Sheldon,23," This might be a good time to point out, Howard, that friendship requires a certain give and take. Hold the door!",4
20669,Doctor,23, Mr. Wolowitz?,4
20670,Howard,23, Is she okay?,4
20671,Doctor,23," It wasn‰Ûªt a heart attack. She‰Ûªs awake, she‰Ûªs resting comfortably. We‰Ûªre still running a few tests.",4
20672,Howard,23, Can I see her?,4
20673,Doctor,23," Actually, she said, and I quote, she‰Ûªd like to see the little Catholic girl first.",4
20674,Bernadette,23, Me? Why me?,4
20675,Howard,23, Jews have been asking that for centuries. There‰Ûªs no real good answer.,4
20676,Bernadette,23," Okay, well, wish me luck.",4
20677,Howard,23," Don‰Ûªt worry, you‰Ûªll be fine. Let‰Ûªs just hide Mr. Cross. If it touches her, it burns.",4
20678,Doctor,23, You brought a Catholic girl home to your mother?,4
20679,Howard,23, Yeah.,4
20680,Doctor,23, Why don‰Ûªt I write you a prescription for Xanax.,4
20681,Scene,23, Outside the hospital washroom. A man enters. 339,4
20682,Sheldon (exiting while the door is open),23," Finally. (Goes down corridor. Dodges into a door to avoid a coughing patient on a trolley. The room is full of doctors in hazmat suits.) Oh, what fresh hell is this?",4
20683,Doctor,23," Wait, you can‰Ûªt leave here, you‰Ûªve been exposed.",4
20684,Sheldon,23," No, I haven‰Ûªt. It‰Ûªs all good.",4
20685,Scene,23, A hospital corridor. ,4
20686,Penny,23," You want to talk about crazy mothers, Leonard‰Ûªs mom wouldn‰Ûªt give him any sort of approval growing up.",4
20687,Priya,23," Oh, the poor thing.",4
20688,Penny,23, It makes him desperate to please women. That‰Ûªs why the foreplay goes on and on.,4
20689,Priya,23," It does, doesn‰Ûªt it?",4
20690,Penny,23," It‰Ûªs like he‰Ûªs trying to win a prize. A word of advice, don‰Ûªt doze off. You will never hear the end of it.",4
20691,Sheldon (through glass door pane),23, Help me! Come back! Penny!,4
20692,Scene,23, The waiting room. ,4
20693,Leonard,23," There are a couple of things I did with Penny that might be a little silly, but‰Û_",4
20694,Raj,23, Like what?,4
20695,Leonard,23," Every once in a while, before we‰Ûªd go to bed, I‰Ûªd put on a little show for her.",4
20696,Raj,23," What do you mean, a show?",4
20697,Leonard,23," Well, you know, the way I took my clothes off.",4
20698,Raj,23," Like, to music?",4
20699,Leonard,23, I‰Ûªd look pretty stupid if there was no music.,4
20700,Raj,23, So you‰Ûªd do a striptease?,4
20701,Leonard,23, I wasn‰Ûªt swinging around a pole.,4
20702,Raj,23," Good, good.",4
20703,Leonard,23, There was one time I put body glitter on.,4
20704,Raj,23," Well, I don‰Ûªt think you have to worry about Penny telling my sister that.",4
20705,Leonard,23," No, she wouldn‰Ûªt.",4
20706,Raj,23, Your big problem is me telling her.,4
20707,Leonard,23, You really are a mean little man.,4
20708,Priya,23," Oh, God, that‰Ûªs so true.",4
20709,Penny,23," Yeah, I know, right?",4
20710,Leonard,23," Hey, what took you guys so long?",4
20711,Priya,23," Oh, we were just chatting.",4
20712,Leonard,23, That‰Ûªs nice. What about?,4
20713,Penny,23, We were just comparing notes about how you are in the sack.,4
20714,Leonard,23, That‰Ûªs funny.,4
20715,Penny,23, Yeah.,4
20716,Raj,23, What if she wasn‰Ûªt kidding?,4
20717,Leonard,23, It doesn‰Ûªt matter. I‰Ûªm the king of foreplay.,4
20718,Howard,23," Hey, how‰Ûªd it go?",4
20719,Bernadette,23, You‰Ûªre a putz. You know what that means?,4
20720,Howard,23, Yeah. Do you?,4
20721,Bernadette,23, Your mother just taught it to me. She thinks she got food poisoning from that deli and she just wanted to make sure I was okay.,4
20722,Howard,23, And are you?,4
20723,Bernadette,23," No, because I‰Ûªm engaged to a putz. You let me believe I was the reason she had a heart attack.",4
20724,Howard,23," Well, based on the available evid‰Û_",4
20725,Bernadette,23, Shut up! She said I‰Ûªm a wonderful girl and that you‰Ûªre lucky to have me.,4
20726,Howard,23, Where are you going?,4
20727,Bermadette (in a voice like Mrs Wolowitz),23, To the toilet! Is that okay with you?,4
20728,Howard,23," Is it just me, or does she sound sexy when she‰Ûªs angry?",4
20729,Scene,23, A hospital room. The guys except for Sheldon are in Hazmat suits. ,4
20730,Sheldon,23, Mountain Elf.,4
20731,Raj,23, He takes the elf from off the shelf.,4
20732,Leonard,23, Hell Hounds.,4
20733,Raj,23, Hell Hounds. Who let the Satanic dogs out? Who? Who-who?,4
20734,Howard,23, Colossal Serpent.,4
20735,Raj,23, I got a colossal serpent right here.,4
20736,Sheldon,23, Must you?,4
20737,Raj,23," Sorry, I‰Ûªm just trying to cheer my buddy up. Rotting Zombie. Sheldon‰Ûªs new Facebook photo.",4
20738,Sheldon,23," Zandor, Wizard of the North. Ha! I win.",4
20739,Howard,23," If you skip the part about being under a two-week quarantine because you were exposed to a deadly disease, absolutely.",4
20740,Scene,24, The Cheesecake Factory,4
20741,Penny,24," Hey, you guys ready to order?",4
20742,Howard,24, Uh..,4
20743,Leonard,24, Sure,4
20744,Penny,24," Okay, Priya?",4
20745,Priya,24," Uh, I‰Ûªll have the Shepherd‰Ûªs Pie. You want to split that with me?",4
20746,Leonard,24," Oh, no, no, no, he doesn‰Ûªt.",4
20747,Priya,24, Why not?,4
20748,Leonard,24," Well, you have milk in the taters, milk in the gravy, parmesan crust. Your lactose-intolerant boyfriend will turn into a gas-filled Macy‰Ûªs Day balloon.",4
20749,Sheldon,24," Not quite accurate. The Macy‰Ûªs balloons are filled with helium, whereas Leonard produces copious amounts of methane.",4
20750,Leonard,24," So, no, on the Shepherd‰Ûªs Pie. Can we move on?",4
20751,Leonard,24, Sea bass. I‰Ûªll have the sea bass.,4
20752,Howard,24," You gotta like this, the girlfriend and the ex-girlfriend bonding over your rooty-tooty stinky booty.",4
20753,Leonard,24, Kill me.,4
20754,Sheldon,24, It wouldn‰Ûªhelp. The human body is capable of being flatulent for hours after death.,4
20755,Bernadette,24," Guys, sorry I‰Ûªm late. I have amazing news.",4
20756,Sheldon,24," Bernadette, before you change the subject, does anyone have any final comments on Leonard‰Ûªs faulty digestive system?",4
20757,Leonard,24," So, what‰Ûªs your news, Bernadette?",4
20758,Bernadette,24, The thesis committee accepted my doctoral dissertation. I‰Ûªm getting my PhD.,4
20759,Penny,24, Oh!,4
20760,Sheldon,24," Oh, congratulations.",4
20761,Penny,24," Wow, so that means you‰Ûªre a doctor, you‰Ûªre a doctor, you‰Ûªre a doctor, you‰Ûªre a doctor, and Howard, you know a lot of doctors.",4
20762,Howard,24," Congratulations, honey.",4
20763,Bernadette,24, Thank you.,4
20764,Leonard,24," So, Howard, tell us, how‰Ûªs it feel knowing that when you two get married, you‰Ûªll be referred to as Mr. and Dr. Wolowitz?",4
20765,Sheldon,24," Unless he takes Bernadette‰Ûªs last name. And considering her advanced status, that could open some doors for him.",4
20766,Howard,24," Please, this isn‰Ûªt about me. I‰Ûªm proud of you.",4
20767,Bernadette,24," Well, you‰Ûªll be really be proud of this. I was headhunted by a big pharmaceutical company. They‰Ûªre gonna pay me a buttload of money!",4
20768,Howard,24, What?,4
20769,Leonard,24," Bernadette, that‰Ûªs great. Howard, do you make a buttload?",4
20770,Howard,24, Better than what you‰Ûªve got a buttload of.,4
20771,Leonard,24," Hey, if I roll down the windows in the car, everything‰Ûªs peachy. If you do it, you‰Ûªre still not a doctor.",4
20772,Penny,24," Yeah, just a heads-up on the car window deal. It helps, but everything is not peachy.",4
20773,Scene,24, Raj‰Ûªs apartment. ,4
20774,"Raj (earphones in, singing)",24," Oh, if there was a problem, you can‰Ûªt solve it, check out the hook while my DJ revolves it. Ice, Ice, baby. Ice, Ice, baby. (Removes headphones and goes to refrigerator).",4
20775,Priya (off),24," Oh, God, I feel ridiculous in this dress.",4
20776,Leonard (off),24," You look beautiful, Lieutenant Uhura. Now prepare for inspection.",4
20777,Priya (off),24," Shh, my brother‰Ûªs going to hear you.",4
20778,Leonard (off),24," Relax, he‰Ûªs got headphones on. And we‰Ûªre ten miles above Earth in a starship.",4
20779,Raj,24," Really, ten miles? You‰Ûªre orbiting inside the atmosphere? Moron.",4
20780,Priya (off),24, I can‰Ûªt believe I‰Ûªm wearing my brother‰Ûªs Halloween costume.,4
20781,Leonard (off),24," I can‰Ûªt believe you think he only wears it on Halloween. Open the landing bay doors, shuttle craft approaching.",4
20782,Raj,24," Okay, gotta go.",4
20783,Scene,24, Howard‰Ûªs house.,4
20784,Howard,24," Hey, what‰Ûªs up?",4
20785,Mrs Wolowitz (off),24," Is that my future daughter-in-law, the doctor?",4
20786,Howard,24," No, Ma! It‰Ûªs Raj!",4
20787,Mrs Wolowitz (off),24," He‰Ûªs a doctor too, right?",4
20788,Howard,24, Yes!,4
20789,Mrs Wolowitz (off),24, Like Leonard and the skinny weirdo!,4
20790,Howard,24," Sheldon, yes! Everybody‰Ûªs a doctor but me!",4
20791,Mrs Wolowitz (off),24," Well, whose fault is that?",4
20792,Howard,24, What‰Ûªs up?,4
20793,Raj,24, Leonard‰Ûªs putting disgusting memories in my memory foam mattress. Can I stay here tonight?,4
20794,Howard,24," Sure, but I‰Ûªm going out with Bernadette. It‰Ûªll just be you and my mother.",4
20795,Raj,24, I guess that‰Ûªs okay.,4
20796,Howard,24," Ma, can Rajesh sleep over?!",4
20797,Mrs Wolowitz (off),24," Of course, he and I can play doctor!",4
20798,Raj,24," She‰Ûªs kidding, right?",4
20799,Howard,24," I don‰Ûªt know, she‰Ûªs pretty feisty since they put her on hormone-replacement therapy.",4
20800,Mrs Wolowitz (off),24, Paging Dr. Cutie Pie!,4
20801,Scene,24, The apartment. Sheldon is talking to Amy on webcam. ,4
20802,Sheldon,24," I must say, Amy, I was very impressed to see that Bernadette got her PhD.",4
20803,Amy,24," It‰Ûªs indeed admirable. Although, it is microbiology.",4
20804,Sheldon,24, Your doctorate is in neurobiology. I fail to see the distinction.,4
20805,Amy,24," I‰Ûªll make it simple for you. I study the brain, the organ responsible for Beethoven‰Ûªs Fifth Symphony. Bernadette studies yeast, the organism responsible for Michelob Lite. Is there something wrong with your neck?",4
20806,Sheldon,24, It‰Ûªs a little stiff. What a remarkably fragile structure to support such a valuable payload. Not unlike balancing a Faberge egg on a Pixie Stick.,4
20807,Amy,24, Have you considered massage?,4
20808,Sheldon,24," I‰Ûªd like to respond to that sarcastically. Yes, I relish the thought of a stranger covering my body with oil and rubbing it.",4
20809,Amy,24, I was proposing you massage your muscles with your own hands.,4
20810,Sheldon,24, Still sounds like a lot of unnecessary touching.,4
20811,Amy,24," Trust me. With your right hand, locate the spot where the scapula meets the acromion process.",4
20812,Sheldon,24, All right.,4
20813,Amy,24," Now push your third finger along the ridge of the shoulder blade, making a small rotation as you do so.",4
20814,Sheldon,24, Rotating.,4
20815,Amy,24, You should feel a small node-like object rolling back and forth along the bone.,4
20816,Sheldon,24, You mean the myofascial point?,4
20817,Amy,24, Obviously. Now bear down on it like the seventh grade noogies we all know too well.,4
20818,Sheldon,24," Oh, dear Lord, yes, yes, oh, yes! Amy, I‰Ûªve never been touched like this before! Oh! Oh, my hands are magic!",4
20819,Amy,24, Don‰Ûªt flatter yourself. Your hands are blunt tools guided by my knowledge of the nervous system. I could just as easily have paralyzed you.,4
20820,Sheldon,24, There‰Ûªs someone at my door.,4
20821,Amy,24, That doesn‰Ûªt interest me. Goodbye.,4
20822,Raj (at door),24, Can I sleep here tonight?,4
20823,Sheldon,24, Why?,4
20824,Raj,24, Leonard‰Ûªs having astronomically inaccurate Star Trek sex with my sister.,4
20825,Sheldon,24, I can see how that would be upsetting. Come in. I‰Ûªll get the sheets and blankets for the couch.,4
20826,Raj,24," Oh, don‰Ûªt bother. I‰Ûªll just sleep in Leonard‰Ûªs room.",4
20827,Sheldon,24," No, I can‰Ûªt authorize that.",4
20828,Raj,24," Well, he‰Ûªs in my bed. Why can‰Ûªt I be in his?",4
20829,Sheldon,24," The Hammurabic Code is an eye for an eye, not a bed for a bed.",4
20830,Raj,24," Come on, dude, I‰Ûªm exhausted, and Tyra Banks says the most important item in your makeup bag is a good night‰Ûªs sleep.",4
20831,Sheldon,24," All right. This is a form indemnifying me from your use of Leonard‰Ûªs bedroom. Sign here, indicating that I tried to stop you and did so using a stern facial expression.",4
20832,Raj,24," Good night, Sheldon.",4
20833,Sheldon,24," Wait. Not yet. We still have to go over safety procedures. Now, the apartment has three emergency exits located here, here, and here. In the event of a power outage, luminous paint will guide you to the nearest exit.",4
20834,Raj,24, You‰Ûªre kidding.,4
20835,Sheldon,24, I never kid about safety.,4
20836,Scene,24," Leonard‰Ûªs bedroom. Leonard enters, and accidentally sits on Raj. Both exclaim.",4
20837,Leonard,24, What are you doing here?,4
20838,Raj,24, I was sleeping.,4
20839,Leonard,24, In my bed?,4
20840,Raj,24," Well, I would‰Ûªve slept in my own bed, but it was being used to bring shame to my family. And the memory of Gene Roddenberry.",4
20841,Leonard,24," Oh, you heard?",4
20842,Raj,24," Scotty, I need more power.",4
20843,Leonard,24, Sorry. Does Sheldon know you‰Ûªre sleeping in here?,4
20844,Raj,24," Are you kidding? He made me sign a waiver, participate in an emergency fire drill and take a refresher course in CPR. Thank God he had a dummy.",4
20845,Leonard,24," Oh, yeah. Mouth-to-Mouth Mona. You know, she used to date Howard?",4
20846,Raj,24," Oh, my God, she‰Ûªs that Mona? Why can‰Ûªt you and my sister spend your nights here?",4
20847,Leonard,24, We tried. She doesn‰Ûªt get along with Sheldon.,4
20848,Raj,24, Sheldon doesn‰Ûªt get along with Sheldon. It‰Ûªs still no reason for me to have to listen to you arm your photon torpedoes every night.,4
20849,Leonard,24," Okay, well, how about this. Until Priya gets her own place, you stay here and I‰Ûªll stay at your apartment.",4
20850,Raj,24, Can I bring girls here?,4
20851,Leonard,24, You? Sure. Bring as many as you want.,4
20852,Raj,24," Okay, deal.",4
20853,Leonard,24, Just not against their will.,4
20854,Scene,24, The cafeteria. ,4
20855,Leonard,24, Do you really think you should be eating that cake?,4
20856,Howard,24, Why?,4
20857,Leonard,24," If you‰Ûªre gonna be a trophy husband for a rich wife, you might want to watch your waistline.",4
20858,Raj,24," He‰Ûªs right. A minute on the lips, a lifetime on the hips.",4
20859,Howard,24," Yeah, ha-ha. First of all, I‰Ûªm not threatened by my fiancÌ©e‰Ûªs success. I‰Ûªm proud of her. And secondly, I have my own career.",4
20860,Leonard,24, Until you have kids.,4
20861,Sheldon,24," Good news, Raj. I got the blood work back from the lab. You‰Ûªre okay to stay for a while.",4
20862,Raj,24, When did you take my blood?,4
20863,Sheldon,24," Not important. Your sugar was a little high. I‰Ûªd follow up with your regular physician. In the meantime, I have some paperwork here for you to go over.",4
20864,Raj,24, What the hell is this?,4
20865,Sheldon,24, Boilerplate stuff. A modified roommate agreement for a temporary house guest. And a living will and durable power of attorney.,4
20866,Raj,24, This says you can make end of life decisions for me.,4
20867,Sheldon,24," As your friend, let‰Ûªs hope it doesn‰Ûªt come to that. Please sign.",4
20868,Raj,24, Did you sign this?,4
20869,Leonard,24," There‰Ûªs a reciprocity clause. You get to pull the plug on him, too.",4
20870,Raj,24," Well, that seems fair.",4
20871,Sheldon,24," Congratulations and welcome temporarily aboard. Here‰Ûªs your I.D. Card, your key and your lapel pin. Which Leonard was too cool to wear. FYI, part of your responsibilities as roommate pro tem will be to drive me to and from work, the comic book store, the barbershop and the park for one hour every other Sunday for fresh air.",4
20872,Leonard,24," Bring a ball or a Frisbee, you know, something he can chase.",4
20873,Sheldon,24," Also, you‰Ûªre tasked with bringing home all takeout dinners. Tonight is Thai food. You‰Ûªll find the standard order in appendix B or downloadable from my FTP server. If you have any questions, here‰Ûªs the FAQ sheet, or if you prefer the human touch, I do a live web chat called Apartment Talk on Tuesday nights.",4
20874,Leonard,24, No backsies.,4
20875,Scene,24, The apartment. ,4
20876,Raj,24," Sheldon, dinner!",4
20877,Sheldon,24, What is this?,4
20878,Raj,24, This is the difference between eating and dining.,4
20879,Sheldon,24, Remarkable. I‰Ûªm just realizing how much Leonard‰Ûªs been skating by all these years.,4
20880,Raj,24, It‰Ûªs not a big thing. Just think of me as a brown Martha Stewart.,4
20881,Penny (at door),24," Hey, Sheldon, did you change your Wi-Fi password again?",4
20882,Sheldon,24," Yes, it‰Ûªs ‰ÛÏPenny, get your own Wi-Fi.‰Û No spaces.",4
20883,Penny,24, Thanks. Wow! What‰Ûªs with the fancy spread?,4
20884,Sheldon,24," My new roommate is bending over backwards to ingratiate himself to me. (Pointing to lapel badge) Uh, nice touch, by the way.",4
20885,Penny,24," What do you mean, new roommate? What happened to Leonard?",4
20886,Sheldon,24, The same thing that happened to Homo Erectus. He was replaced by a superior species.,4
20887,Raj,24, I‰Ûªm the new Homo in town. That came out wrong.,4
20888,Penny,24," All right, let me try this again. Where‰Ûªs Leonard?",4
20889,Raj,24," He‰Ûªs living at my place, so I‰Ûªm living here.",4
20890,Sheldon,24, You‰Ûªre living here provisionally. But I must say it‰Ûªs looking good.,4
20891,Penny,24," Woah, Leonard and Priya are living together? That‰Ûªs big.",4
20892,Sheldon,24," No. Origami napkin swans, that‰Ûªs the headline.",4
20893,Raj,24, It‰Ûªs a good thing.,4
20894,Scene,24, Bernadette‰Ûªs bedroom. ,4
20895,Howard,24, So do you know what kind of research you‰Ûªll be doing at this pharmaceutical company?,4
20896,Bernadette,24," Well, there are a couple of opportunities available, but I volunteered for the premature ejaculation project. I mean, it‰Ûªs not like either one of us has heart disease. Oh, I almost forgot. I got you a little present.",4
20897,Howard,24," Oh, Bernie, no. You didn‰Ûªt have to.",4
20898,Bernadette,24," I wanted to. Come on, open it.",4
20899,Howard,24, You bought me a Rolex? How much did this cost?,4
20900,Bernadette,24," Oh, you let me worry about the money. I just want my baby to have pretty things.",4
20901,Scene,24, The apartment.,4
20902,Raj,24, More wine?,4
20903,Penny,24," Oh, no, no, no. I‰Ûªve had way too much already.",4
20904,Sheldon,24, Here‰Ûªs an interesting fact about alcohol.,4
20905,Penny,24, Hit me.,4
20906,Sheldon,24," Man is not the only species that ferments fruit in order to become intoxicated. Can you guess what the other is? Hint, sometimes they pack the alcohol in their trunks.",4
20907,Penny,24, Monkeys.,4
20908,Sheldon,24, When does a monkey have a trunk?,4
20909,Penny,24, When a suitcase just won‰Ûªt do.,4
20910,Sheldon,24," Mmm, all right. It would appear as if alcohol is playing keep-away with your intelligence. Good night. Please note, it is now past ten p.m. Per our roommate agreement, kindly refrain from raucous laughter, clinking of glasses, and celebratory gunfire.",4
20911,Penny,24," Okay, explain something to me. You watch Leonard put up with that guy for years and years. What has to break inside your brain for you to think, Oh, Krishna, I‰Ûªve got to get me some of that?",4
20912,Raj,24," Well, it‰Ûªs a lot better than having to wear noise-cancelling headphones in my own apartment.",4
20913,Penny,24," What? Oh, God, yeah. Yeah. Leonard‰Ûªs a noisy little dude in the sack.",4
20914,Raj,24, Every night.,4
20915,Penny,24," Really? Even during allergy season, when he has to alternate between kissing and breathing?",4
20916,Raj,24, It‰Ûªs my sister. Can we not talk about this any more?,4
20917,Penny,24," Yeah. Sorry, sorry. Can I tell you a secret?",4
20918,Raj,24, Yeah.,4
20919,Penny,24, I screwed up. Leonard‰Ûªs a great guy. Never should have broken up with him.,4
20920,Raj,24," Well, uh, to paraphrase Shakespeare, It‰Ûªs better to have loved and lost than to stay home every night and download increasingly shameful pornography.",4
20921,Penny,24," Oh, you poor baby.",4
20922,Raj,24," What‰Ûªs wrong with me, Penny?",4
20923,Penny,24," Nothing, nothing. You know, if we weren‰Ûªt friends, and you hadn‰Ûªt brought up that creepy pornography story, I‰Ûªd be on you like the speed of light squared on matter to make energy.",4
20924,Raj,24," Hey, you totally got that right! E equals M C squared.",4
20925,Penny,24," I listen. I have no idea what it means, but I listen. To friendship.",4
20926,Raj,24, To friendship.,4
20927,Sheldon (off),24, Would you booze hounds please stop that infernal clinking? And the answer was elephant!,4
20928,Scene,24, Raj‰Ûªs apartment. Leonard and Priya are kissing. ,4
20929,Leonard,24, Mmm. Mmm.,4
20930,Priya,24," Leonard, sweetheart, we‰Ûªre kissing, not eating hot soup.",4
20931,Leonard,24, Sorry.,4
20932,Priya (computer tone),24, That‰Ûªs my parents on video chat. Go hide in the bedroom.,4
20933,Leonard,24," Oh, come on! Why don‰Ûªt we just tell them that we‰Ûªre dating?",4
20934,Priya,24," Oh, we‰Ûªve been through this. It‰Ûªs not the time.",4
20935,Leonard,24, When is the time?,4
20936,Priya,24," I‰Ûªve got five brothers and sisters. One of them is bound to screw up real big, and then I‰Ûªll tell my parents about you. Now, shoo.",4
20937,Leonard,24, Fine.,4
20938,Priya,24," Hello, Mummy. Hello, Daddy.",4
20939,Dr Koothrappali,24, We heard there was a tornado in Kansas City. Is that close to you?,4
20940,Priya,24, No.,4
20941,Mrs Koothrappali,24, Where is your brother?,4
20942,Priya,24, Out with friends.,4
20943,Dr Koothrappali,24," I don‰Ûªt like it, a young girl alone in an apartment.",4
20944,Mrs Koothrappali,24, I‰Ûªll sleep so much better when you move back here next month.,4
20945,Leonard,24, You‰Ûªre moving back to India?,4
20946,Dr Koothrappali,24, Who‰Ûªs that?,4
20947,Mrs Koothrappali,24," Oh, my God! There‰Ûªs someone in your apartment. Call the police in America!",4
20948,Leonard,24, When were you going to tell me about this?,4
20949,Priya,24," Oh, hello, Leonard. What a pleasant surprise! Mummy, Daddy, you remember Rajesh‰Ûªs friend Leonard.",4
20950,Dr Koothrappali,24, I thought you said Rajesh was out with his friends.,4
20951,Priya,24, He has many friends.,4
20952,Dr Koothrappali,24, Rajesh has many friends?,4
20953,Mrs Koothrappali,24, Why are you lying to us?,4
20954,Leonard,24, She‰Ûªs lying because she doesn‰Ûªt want you to know we‰Ûªre dating.,4
20955,Priya,24, Leonard!,4
20956,Leonard,24," Well, what difference does it make? If you‰Ûªre moving back to India, we‰Ûªre obviously breaking up.",4
20957,Priya,24, You know what? I don‰Ûªt want to deal with this right now.,4
20958,Leonard,24, So. Hot in India?,4
20959,Dr Koothrappali,24," Of course it is. It always is. It‰Ûªs India. Now, what do you have to say for yourself?",4
20960,Leonard,24, Uh. That is a beautiful tapestry.,4
20961,Scene,24, Leonard‰Ûªs bedroom. Raj and Penny are in bed. ,4
20962,Penny (waking up),24," Oh, God. Oh, God! Oh. Okay, look. This never happened. Do you understand me? (Raj nods) Really? Still can‰Ûªt talk to me?",4
20963,Scene,24, The living room. Leonard is asleep on the couch. ,4
20964,Sheldon,24, What are you doing here?,4
20965,Leonard,24, What?,4
20966,Sheldon,24," I said, what are you doing here?",4
20967,Leonard,24, I live here.,4
20968,Sheldon,24, I have paperwork that says differently.,4
20969,Leonard,24, Priya‰Ûªs going back to India.,4
20970,Sheldon,24, Irrelevant. Rajesh and I have a good thing going and you‰Ûªre not going to ruin it. (Knock on door) What are you doing here?,4
20971,Howard,24, I‰Ûªve been up all night. I had a fight with Bernadette.,4
20972,Sheldon,24, Why?,4
20973,Howard,24, She gave me a beautiful watch.,4
20974,Sheldon,24," Leonard, do you understand this?",4
20975,Leonard,24, Yes.,4
20976,Sheldon,24, Talk to him.,4
20977,"Penny (entering room dishevelled, with a half naked Raj behind)",24, Damn.,4
20978,Leonard,24, What‰Ûªs going on?,4
20979,Penny,24," Oh. It‰Ûªs, it‰Ûªs not what it looks like.",4
20980,Sheldon,24, What does it look like?,4
20981,Scene,1, The Cafeteria,5
20982,Sheldon,1, It‰Ûªs not what it looks like. It‰Ûªs not what it looks like.,5
20983,Leonard,1, What are you grinding about?,5
20984,Sheldon,1," Penny‰Ûªs brain teaser this morning. She and Koothrappali emerge from your bedroom. She is dishevelled, and Raj is dressed only in a sheet. The sole clue, it‰Ûªs not what it looks like.",5
20985,Leonard,1," Just let it go, Sheldon.",5
20986,Sheldon,1," If I could, I would, but I can‰Ûªt, so I shan‰Ûªt. Now, knowing Penny, the obvious answer is, they engaged in coitus. But, since that‰Ûªs what it looked like, we can rule that out. Let‰Ûªs put on our thinking cap, shall we? (Mimes doing so) Raj is from India, a tropical country. Third World hygiene. Parasitic infections are common, such as pinworms. Mm-hmm. The procedure for diagnosing pinworms is to wait until the subject is asleep, and the worms crawl out of the rectum for air. (Leonard spits out food) Yes, just like that. Penny could have been inspecting Raj‰Ûªs anal region for parasites. Oh, boy. That‰Ûªs a true blue friend.",5
20987,Leonard,1," They slept together, Sherlock.",5
20988,Sheldon,1," No, you weren‰Ûªt listening. She said, it‰Ûªs not what it looks like.",5
20989,Leonard,1, She lied.,5
20990,Sheldon,1, Oh. Well don‰Ûªt I look silly sitting here wearing this?,5
20991,Scene,1, The Cafeteria,5
20992,Howard,1, Hey.,5
20993,Raj,1, Hey.,5
20994,Leonard,1, Hey.,5
20995,Sheldon,1," Hey. Leonard, is it awkward for you knowing that one of your dear friends had sexual intercourse with a woman you used to love in the very place you lay your head?",5
20996,Leonard,1," No, I‰Ûªm fine with it.",5
20997,Sheldon,1," That sounds like sarcasm, but I‰Ûªm going to disregard it, because I have an agenda. Paintball. Specifically, the interdepartmental tournament this weekend. Now, in order to function better as a fighting unit, I thought we should establish a chain of command. Now, it goes without saying that I would outrank the three of you, but the question remains, by how much? Now, I don‰Ûªt see me as some four-star general, back at HQ riding a desk and playing golf with the Secretary of Defence. But I also can‰Ûªt be Sergeant Cooper, because that might lead you to think of me as just a regular Joe. This might take some thought. As you were.",5
20998,Leonard,1, What the hell is wrong with you?,5
20999,Howard,1," Yeah, how could you do that?",5
21000,Raj,1, What is it to you?,5
21001,Howard,1, I got his back.,5
21002,Raj,1," Yeah, right. You‰Ûªre just jealous because it turns out I‰Ûªm Penny‰Ûªs number two choice after Leonard.",5
21003,Howard,1," Hey, if I wasn‰Ûªt engaged to Bernadette, that totally could have been me.",5
21004,Leonard,1," Please. Sheldon would have been before you, and he might not even have genitals.",5
21005,Raj,1," Why do you care so much? You‰Ûªre dating my sister, and Penny and I are in love.",5
21006,Leonard and Howard together,1, What?,5
21007,Sheldon,1," Gentlemen, if I may interject, I‰Ûªve decided my rank will be captain. If it‰Ûªs good enough for Kirk, Crunch and Kangaroo, it‰Ûªs good enough for me.",5
21008,Howard,1, You‰Ûªre not in love with Penny.,5
21009,Raj,1," Yes, I am. The god Kamadeva has shot us with his flowery arrows of love.",5
21010,Howard,1, Who?,5
21011,Raj,1," He‰Ûªs the Hindu version of Cupid, but way better, because he rides a giant parrot.",5
21012,Leonard,1," Raj, come on. You fall in love with any girl who smiles at you. A month ago, you were writing poems about his fiancee.",5
21013,Howard,1, I‰Ûªm sorry. What?,5
21014,Raj,1, Rubbish. He‰Ûªs talking rubbish.,5
21015,Leonard,1," Oh, Bernadette, please play my clarinet.",5
21016,Raj,1," That could have been about anyone. Besides, you have nothing to worry about, because now I‰Ûªm the dusky half of Koothrapenny.",5
21017,Sheldon,1," For the record, I do have genitals. They‰Ûªre functional and aesthetically pleasing.",5
21018,Scene,1, Penny‰Ûªs apartment. Penny has a bottle of wine. She can‰Ûªt find a glass. Finds a measuring jug and uses that instead. There is a knock on the door.,5
21019,Penny,1," Coming. Yup, that‰Ûªs good. Wine glasses should have handles.",5
21020,Amy,1, Keeping accurate track of your alcohol intake. Smart idea considering how trampy you get when you‰Ûªve had a few.,5
21021,Penny,1, You heard what I did?,5
21022,Amy,1," Well, I heard who you did.",5
21023,Penny,1," Oh, my God, I screwed up everything. I hurt Leonard, I hurt Raj, I mean, what is wrong with me? I feel like two totally different people, Dr. Jekyll and Mrs. Whore.",5
21024,Amy,1, Don‰Ûªt be so hard on yourself. Do you know the story of Catherine the Great?,5
21025,Penny,1, No.,5
21026,Amy,1," She ruled Russia in the late seventeen hundreds, and one night, when she was feeling particularly randy, she used an intricate system of pulleys to have intimate relations with a horse.",5
21027,Penny,1, I‰Ûªm‰Û_ I‰Ûªm sorry. What does this have to do with me?,5
21028,Amy,1," She engaged in interspecies hanky-panky, and people still call her great. I‰Ûªm sure your reputation can survive you shagging a little Indian boy.",5
21029,Scene,1, Raj‰Ûªs apartment. There is a knock on the door. He opens it.,5
21030,Bernadette,1, You jerk face! What did you tell Howard? Did you say there was something going on between us? Because he thinks there is. He‰Ûªs completely freaking out!,5
21031,Raj,1," Please, come in.",5
21032,Bernadette,1, What the hell is wrong with you?,5
21033,Raj,1," Well, you were always so nice to me, I thought maybe you liked me.",5
21034,Bernadette,1, I‰Ûªm nice to everyone.,5
21035,Raj,1, I‰Ûªm sorry.,5
21036,Bernadette,1," Damn right, you‰Ûªre sorry. And you tell Howard there‰Ûªs never been anything between us.",5
21037,Raj,1," I will. Hey, Bernadette?",5
21038,Bernadette,1, What?!,5
21039,Raj,1, Do you think I have a shot with Penny?,5
21040,Bernadette,1, Of course you do. You‰Ûªre a cutie pie. Any girl would be lucky to have you.,5
21041,Scene,1, Penny‰Ûªs apartment.,5
21042,Penny,1," You know, I‰Ûªve done this before. In kindergarten, I was supposed to marry Jason Sorensen at recess, but by the time my class got out there, he was already engaged to Chelsea Himmelfarb. So what did I do? Hung upside down from the monkey bars, let all the boys see my underpants.",5
21043,Amy,1," You can‰Ûªt blame yourself. When your prefrontal cortex fails to make you happy, promiscuity rewards you with the needed flood of dopamine. We neurobiologists refer to this as the skank reflex.",5
21044,Penny,1, You know what? Let‰Ûªs get out of here.,5
21045,Amy,1, Where are we going?,5
21046,Penny,1, Somewhere where no one‰Ûªs seen me naked. We may have to drive awhile. (Opens door. Sees Leonard and Sheldon. Slams it shut again.),5
21047,Sheldon,1," Subtlety isn‰Ûªt her strong suit, is it?",5
21048,Penny,1, Can I stay at your place for a few nights?,5
21049,Amy,1, Really? A best friend sleepover? Yay.,5
21050,Penny,1," Yeah, sure. Yay!",5
21051,Amy,1," We‰Ûªll make popcorn, stay up all night and I‰Ûªll teach you my secret language, Op.",5
21052,Penny,1, Sounds great.,5
21053,Amy,1, Nope. Sounds Gop Rop E A Top.,5
21054,Penny,1," Yeah, I‰Ûªm gonna go pack a bag.",5
21055,Amy,1," No, you‰Ûªre not. You‰Ûªre gonna Pop A Cop Kop A Bop A Gop.",5
21056,Scene,1, The apartment.,5
21057,Leonard,1, Do we really have to wear this camouflage crap to play paintball?,5
21058,Sheldon,1," Who said that? Leonard, I can hear your voice, but I can‰Ûªt see you.",5
21059,Leonard,1," I‰Ûªm not in the mood, Sheldon.",5
21060,Sheldon,1," Oh, there you are. Leonard, I know you‰Ûªre upset about recent events, and I have someone here to help. (Showing laptop screen)",5
21061,Leonard,1, I don‰Ûªt want to talk to Amy.,5
21062,Sheldon,1," No, it‰Ûªs not Amy.",5
21063,Dr Hofstadter,1," Hello, dear.",5
21064,Leonard,1, You called my mother?,5
21065,Sheldon,1," Oh, Leonard, is it really necessary to caption the obvious?",5
21066,Dr Hofstadter,1," He‰Ûªs been like that since he was a toddler. Look, Mommy, a butterfly. Maddening.",5
21067,Leonard,1, What‰Ûªs going on? What do you want?,5
21068,Dr Hofstadter,1," Sheldon informed me that you‰Ûªre experiencing an emotional upheaval, and I‰Ûªm here to help.",5
21069,Leonard,1, That‰Ûªs so nice.,5
21070,Dr Hofstadter,1," And we‰Ûªre back to the obvious. Now, what‰Ûªs up?",5
21071,Leonard,1," Well, uh, okay, um, I don‰Ûªt want to get back together with Penny. We tried it, it was crazy, it didn‰Ûªt work, but I can‰Ûªt deal with the fact that she slept with my friend Raj. And then I find out that Raj‰Ûªs sister Priya, who I‰Ûªve been going out with for eight months, is moving back to India. So I‰Ûªm just completely confused and alone.",5
21072,Dr Hofstadter,1, I understand.,5
21073,Leonard,1, Got any advice?,5
21074,Dr Hofstadter,1, Yes. Buck up.,5
21075,Leonard,1," Excuse me. You‰Ûªre a world-renowned expert in parenting and child development, and all you‰Ûªve got is buck up?",5
21076,Dr Hofstadter,1," Sorry. Buck up, sissy pants.",5
21077,Leonard,1," Thanks, Mother. I feel much better.",5
21078,Dr Hofstadter,1," If you need any more help from me, my books are available on Amazon. Logging off.",5
21079,Scene,1, Amy‰Ûªs apartment. Amy is brushing Penny‰Ûªs hair.,5
21080,Amy,1," Ninety-nine, one hundred. It‰Ûªs like a waterfall of liquid gold. My turn.",5
21081,Penny,1," You know, I don‰Ûªt even know what the point of me staying in L.A. is. I haven‰Ûªt gotten a single acting job since I moved out here. The closest I came was last month, I got a callback for a hemorrhoid commercial.",5
21082,Amy,1," Oh, I could so see you being the face of haemorrhoids.",5
21083,Penny,1," I know, right? Maybe I should just move back to Nebraska.",5
21084,Amy,1," No, I can‰Ûªt let you do that.",5
21085,Penny,1, Why not? (There is a knock on the door),5
21086,Amy,1," For the first time ever, I have a thriving social life. And no pressure, but it kind of lives and dies with you.",5
21087,Raj,1," Hi, Amy. Can I talk to Penny?",5
21088,Amy,1, A guest in my trundle bed and a boy at my door? I wish I could tell 13-year-old me it does get better.,5
21089,Penny,1, How did you know I was here?,5
21090,Raj,1, It‰Ûªs all over her Facebook page.,5
21091,Amy,1, I‰Ûªll take your stuff to the bedroom and clear out a drawer.,5
21092,Penny,1, Thanks.,5
21093,Amy,1," No problem. Try and keep it in your pants, okay?",5
21094,Penny,1," So, hi. What‰Ûªs up?",5
21095,Raj,1," I was wondering if you‰Ûªre free Friday. They‰Ûªre having a Totally ‰Ûª80s Night at the Greek. Hall & Oates, Katrina and the Waves and three-fifths of Kajagoogoo.",5
21096,Penny,1," Oh. Gee, that‰Ûªs really sweet, but the thing is‰Û_",5
21097,Raj,1," Aw, there‰Ûªs a thing.",5
21098,Penny,1," Look, honey, I was really drunk and made a huge mistake last night. We should‰Ûªve never slept together. It‰Ûªs what ruins friendships.",5
21099,Raj,1, You can‰Ûªt ruin a friendship with sex. That‰Ûªs like trying to ruin ice cream with chocolate sprinkles.,5
21100,Penny,1," Come here. Just listen to me. I want to go back to the way we were before. You know, friends. No sprinkles.",5
21101,Raj,1, Oh. All right.,5
21102,Penny,1, Thank you.,5
21103,Raj,1," Well, uh, as your friend, you might like to know that, um, we didn‰Ûªt have sex in the conventional sense.",5
21104,Penny,1," Oh, God. Did you pull some weird Indian crap on me?",5
21105,Raj,1," No, no. After we got undressed and jumped in bed, you, you asked if I had protection.",5
21106,Penny,1," Oh, you did, didn‰Ûªt you?",5
21107,Raj,1," Of course. I‰Ûªm always packing. Anyway, um, I had trouble putting it on and you tried to help and, that was all she wrote.",5
21108,Penny,1," So, we didn‰Ûªt actually‰Û_",5
21109,Raj,1, I did. It was beautiful.,5
21110,Penny,1, Oh!,5
21111,Raj,1," Penny, please, please promise me you won‰Ûªt tell anybody about this.",5
21112,Penny,1," Of course I won‰Ûªt. No, I won‰Ûªt.",5
21113,Raj,1," Oh, good. Um, can I tell people that our love burned too bright and too quickly? Kind of a Candle in the Wind deal?",5
21114,Penny,1, Sure.,5
21115,Raj,1," Cool. Can I say it fell apart because you were all, I want to have your babies, and I was like, I‰Ûªm too rock and roll to be tied down?",5
21116,Penny,1, No.,5
21117,Raj,1, Can I say I ruined you for white men?,5
21118,Penny,1, Also no.,5
21119,Raj,1," Okay, just the candle thing.",5
21120,Penny,1, Yeah.,5
21121,Raj,1, Cool. All right friend.,5
21122,Penny,1, Hmm.,5
21123,Raj,1, I‰Ûªll see you around.,5
21124,Penny,1," Okay. Raj, wait. Thank you for being my friend. (She hugs him.)",5
21125,Raj,1, Penny?,5
21126,Penny,1, Mm-hmm?,5
21127,Raj,1, It‰Ûªs getting beautiful again.,5
21128,Scene,1, A shed on the paintball range.,5
21129,Sheldon,1," All right, this is a Google Earth view of the field of battle.",5
21130,Howard,1, I don‰Ûªt see anything.,5
21131,Sheldon,1," Give it a second to load. Whenever you‰Ûªre ready, AT&T! Okay, here we go. This is us here. To the south is Professor Loomis and the Geology Department. According to their Twitter feed, they‰Ûªre out of sunblock, which means they‰Ûªll have to hug the tree line or risk melanoma. That‰Ûªs our edge. All we have to do is move quickly over this ridge, the rock-worshipping pasty-faced bastards won‰Ûªt know what hit them. All right, let‰Ûªs move out.",5
21132,Leonard,1," Hang on, Sheldon. How could you not tell me your sister was moving back to India?",5
21133,Howard,1, Maybe he was too busy writing clumsy penis metaphors about my fiancee.,5
21134,Raj,1, Screw you. That was a beautifully written penis metaphor.,5
21135,Leonard,1," You know what, guys, I‰Ûªm not in the mood for paintball. What do you say we just bag it?",5
21136,Howard,1, Fine with me.,5
21137,Raj,1," Sure, whatever.",5
21138,Sheldon,1, You can‰Ûªt quit. That‰Ûªs a court-martial offence. That‰Ûªs punishable by‰Û_ You can‰Ûªt quit.,5
21139,Leonard,1," Sorry, Sheldon, it‰Ûªs just not a good time for playing games.",5
21140,Sheldon,1," This is a game to you? Uh, was the Battle of Antietam a game? Huh? Was the sack of Rome a game?",5
21141,Leonard,1," Yes, no and no.",5
21142,Sheldon,1," Wait. I just want you all to know that I forgive you. This mutiny isn‰Ûªt your fault, it‰Ûªs mine. I haven‰Ûªt earned these bars. Although what I lack in leadership, apparently I more than make up for in sewing.",5
21143,Howard,1," Let it go, Sheldon. I‰Ûªll get you a Jamba Juice on the way home.",5
21144,Sheldon,1, No. Jamba Juice is for heroes. And that‰Ûªs what we‰Ûªre going to be.,5
21145,Leonard,1, What are you doing?,5
21146,Sheldon,1," Following in the footsteps of Kirk, Crunch and Kangaroo. (Walks outside) Geology isn‰Ûªt a real science! (Gets hit by countless paintball pellets)",5
21147,Howard,1, Damn those sons of bitches!,5
21148,Leonard,1, Let‰Ûªs get ‰Ûªem!,5
21149,Sheldon,1," If there‰Ûªs ever a Church of Sheldon, this will be when it started. Ow!",5
21150,Scene,1, The apartment.,5
21151,Leonard,1," I‰Ûªd like to propose a toast to the man whose noble sacrifice inspired our victory, Captain Sheldon Cooper.",5
21152,Howard and Raj,1," Here, here.",5
21153,Sheldon,1," Excuse me. It‰Ûªs Major Sheldon Cooper. With my last breath, I awarded myself a battlefield promotion. It‰Ûªs kind of a big deal.",5
21154,Penny,1, Hi. You guys have a minute?,5
21155,Leonard,1," Uh, yeah, sure.",5
21156,Penny,1," Okay. Um. Well, I already talked to Raj, but I wanted to apologize to the rest of you for, you know, everything.",5
21157,Raj,1," Please, Penny, let me. We‰Ûªve decided to let our crazy, wonderful night together be just one of those memories you have and can call to mind when you‰Ûªre feeling blue or you‰Ûªre in the shower.",5
21158,Penny,1," Hey, what you doing, Quick Draw?",5
21159,Raj,1, Sorry. Go on.,5
21160,Penny,1," Anyways, I wanted you guys all to know that I‰Ûªve been taking a really hard look at things and come to the conclusion I have to stop kidding myself. I suck at acting. It‰Ûªs time for me to move back to Nebraska.",5
21161,Leonard,1, You‰Ûªre leaving?,5
21162,Penny,1, Yeah.,5
21163,Howard,1, What are you going to do in Nebraska?,5
21164,Penny,1," I don‰Ûªt know, maybe teach acting. (Phone rings) Oh, sorry. Hold on. Hello?",5
21165,Leonard,1," Penny, Penny, listen, I hope you‰Ûªre not doing this ‰Ûªcause of you and me, because I have a girlfriend, and you‰Ûªre a single woman.",5
21166,Penny,1," Shh! It‰Ûªs my agent, it‰Ûªs my agent. You‰Ûªre kidding. Oh, my gosh. I can‰Ûªt believe it! Really? Oh, I‰Ûªm so excited, thank you, thank you so much. Okay, bye. I got the haemorrhoid commercial! I start Monday.",5
21167,Sheldon,1, What about Nebraska?,5
21168,Penny,1," Oh, hell with Nebraska. I‰Ûªm gonna be a star!",5
21169,Sheldon (to Leonard),1, Have you ever thought of teaching physics?,5
21170,Scene,1, The apartment. Penny‰Ûªs ad is on the television. She is at a stables.,5
21171,Actress,1, Ready to ride?,5
21172,Penny (on screen),1," I don‰Ûªt think so, Mom. Not today.",5
21173,Actress,1," Oh, sweetie. Haemorrhoids acting up again?",5
21174,Penny (on screen),1, You don‰Ûªt know the half of it.,5
21175,Actress,1," Oh, yes, I do. Try a dab of this.",5
21176,Penny (on screen),1, Rose-scented Preparation-H for women?,5
21177,Actress,1," Now, the H is for Her.",5
21178,Leonard,1, I‰Ûªm proud of you.,5
21179,Penny,1, Shh! Here comes my joke.,5
21180,Actress,1, How are you doing?,5
21181,Penny (on screen),1, Sittin‰Ûª pretty.,5
21182," _Û“ö÷“Ê¥ said this on								November 24, 2011 at 2",1,"34 pm ",5
21183,Scene,2, The apartment. Leonard is laying out wine and napkins in front of his laptop.,5
21184,Sheldon,2, What are you doing?,5
21185,Leonard,2," Oh, uh, Priya‰Ûªs calling in a few minutes on Skype, and we are gonna have a dinner date.",5
21186,Sheldon,2, It‰Ûªs eight o‰Ûªclock in the morning in Mumbai. How can she have dinner?,5
21187,Leonard,2," Fine, whatever. Priya will be having breakfast.",5
21188,Sheldon,2," All right, so technically it‰Ûªs not a dinner date. I suppose you could call it a, uh, dinfast date. But if you did, you‰Ûªd open yourself to peer-based mocking, such as, Hey, Leonard, how was your dinfast with Priya last night?",5
21189,Leonard,2, That doesn‰Ûªt sound like mocking.,5
21190,Sheldon,2, You didn‰Ûªt let me finish. Dinfast (rolls eyes). Are those soy-based candles?,5
21191,Leonard,2, I don‰Ûªt know. Why?,5
21192,Sheldon,2, Paraffin candles may contain carcinogens. Unless lung cancer is the ambiance you were going for at your dinfast. Dinfast (rolls eyes).,5
21193,Leonard,2," Listen, I don‰Ûªt want to be rude, but Priya‰Ûªs gonna be calling any minute, so‰Û_",5
21194,Sheldon,2," Oh, yes, Priya. Leonard, you know I make a point of never interfering in your personal affairs.",5
21195,Leonard,2," Yes, I‰Ûªve always admired that about you.",5
21196,Sheldon,2, As well you should. But I‰Ûªm going to make an exception here.,5
21197,Leonard,2," Oh, good.",5
21198,Sheldon,2," Priya has moved back to India to pursue her law career. Instead of desperately trying to keep this intercontinental relationship alive, you could use that time to take up a hobby.",5
21199,Leonard,2, A hobby?,5
21200,Sheldon,2, Yes. I read recently about a fellow in Kansas with an enormous ball of twine. I bet you could give him a run for his money.,5
21201,Leonard,2," You know, some people might say that it‰Ûªs great that we‰Ûªre trying to make things work long distance. They‰Ûªd say things like, love is stronger than the miles between you.",5
21202,Sheldon,2," When I rise to power, those people will be sterilized.",5
21203,Leonard,2, You video-chat with Amy all the time. How is this different?,5
21204,Sheldon,2, Don‰Ûªt you like Amy?,5
21205,Leonard,2, Of course I like Amy.,5
21206,Sheldon,2," Well, there‰Ûªs the difference. (Skype tone rings)",5
21207,Leonard,2," Excuse me, that‰Ûªs Priya.",5
21208,Priya (on screen),2," Hi, Leonard.",5
21209,Leonard,2," Hey, honey.",5
21210,Priya,2, I miss you.,5
21211,Leonard,2," Oh, I miss you, too.",5
21212,Sheldon,2, I miss the old days when your romantic partners could be returned to the video store.,5
21213,Scene,2, Penny‰Ûªs apartment.,5
21214,Sheldon,2, Thanks for letting me stay here while Leonard Skypes with his girlfriend.,5
21215,Penny,2," Oh, it‰Ûªs no problem. It‰Ûªs actually kind of nice. You reading, me reading. We‰Ûªre like an old married couple.",5
21216,Sheldon,2," If we were an old married couple, the wife would serve iced tea and snickerdoodles.",5
21217,Penny,2, I don‰Ûªt have iced tea and snickerdoodles.,5
21218,Sheldon,2, A good wife would go to the store.,5
21219,Penny,2, I want a divorce.,5
21220,Sheldon,2," Good. On the way to see the lawyer, pick up some tea and cookies. I must say, I am enjoying your new chair.",5
21221,Penny,2," It‰Ûªs great, isn‰Ûªt it?",5
21222,Sheldon,2," It is. Aligns the lumbar, cradles the coccyx, balances the buttocks. This is a chair worthy of the name.",5
21223,Penny,2, What name?,5
21224,Sheldon,2, Chair.,5
21225,Penny,2," Oh, all right, well, I‰Ûªm glad you like it. I mean, I still can‰Ûªt get over the fact someone just threw it away.",5
21226,Sheldon,2, What?,5
21227,Penny,2," Yeah, it was just sitting on the street. I paid a homeless guy ten bucks to help me get it up here.",5
21228,Sheldon (jumps up),2," Oh, dear. Oh, dear. Oh, dear. (Starts stripping off clothing)",5
21229,Penny,2, What is wrong?,5
21230,Sheldon,2, I‰Ûªve been sitting in garbage!,5
21231,Penny,2," Sheldon, take it easy.",5
21232,Sheldon,2, You take it easy! I need to use your shower.,5
21233,Penny,2, I went into this marriage with so much hope.,5
21234,Sheldon,2, There‰Ûªs a wet Band-Aid on the shower floor. (Runs out of apartment).,5
21235,Scene,2, Howard‰Ûªs workshop. ,5
21236,Raj,2, This is fun. I‰Ûªve never used a hydraulic thermoforming press before.,5
21237,Howard,2," Pretty sweet, huh? This little baby set the university back 175 grand.",5
21238,Leonard,2, That‰Ûªs three minutes. Should we see what we got?,5
21239,Howard,2, Hang on.,5
21240,Raj,2," Oh, yeah. This is one good-looking panini.",5
21241,Howard,2, Hand me the tuna melt.,5
21242,Leonard,2, Yep.,5
21243,Howard,2, Thank you. How‰Ûªs it going with the long-distance love affair?,5
21244,Leonard,2," Not easy, but we‰Ûªre making it work.",5
21245,Howard,2," When you say making it work, does that include doing the cyber nasty?",5
21246,Leonard,2, What?,5
21247,Howard,2," You know, the virtual pickle tickle. The digital bow-chicka-bow-bow.",5
21248,Raj,2," Come on, dude. This is my sister you‰Ûªre talking about.",5
21249,Howard,2," Hey, Leonard jiggling his junk at her through a webcam has got to be easier for you to deal with than him actually touching her with it.",5
21250,Leonard,2, There‰Ûªs no junk jiggling. We just talk.,5
21251,Howard,2," Are you insane? With high-speed Internet, you have at your fingertips the greatest advancement in the field of sex since the invention of the washcloth.",5
21252,Leonard,2, I can‰Ûªt do that.,5
21253,Howard,2," Well, if you don‰Ûªt, you‰Ûªre gonna lose Priya to some fancy guy in a turban who grew up with Kama Sutra coloring books.",5
21254,Raj,2, How can you be so racist?,5
21255,Howard,2," Oh, come on, tell me I‰Ûªm wrong.",5
21256,Sheldon (entering),2," Oh, Leonard, good. There you are. I need you to check my head for chair lice.",5
21257,Leonard,2," I did it last night, I‰Ûªm not doing it again.",5
21258,Howard,2," Just his head, right?",5
21259,Leonard,2, I don‰Ûªt want to talk about it. You didn‰Ûªt catch bugs from Penny‰Ûªs chair.,5
21260,Sheldon,2," Yes, I did. And now they‰Ûªre cavorting at the base of my hair follicles like dancing hippies at the Redwood National Forest.",5
21261,Leonard,2," Sheldon, you do this all the time. You fixate on some crazy idea and then blow it way out of proportion.",5
21262,Sheldon,2, Name one time I‰Ûªve ever done that.,5
21263,Leonard,2, How about when you put GPS trackers in your garbage because you were convinced North Korean spies were stealing your doodles? The chicken nuggets you were sure were human nuggets. The strangely-shaped cloud that was following you around town. The time you put on my shirt by mistake and were convinced you‰Ûªd started growing again.,5
21264,Sheldon,2," I said, name one. You really need to work on your listening skills.",5
21265,Scene,2, Penny‰Ûªs apartment door.,5
21266,Sheldon,2," (Knock, knock, knock) Penny. (Knock, knock, knock) Penny. (Knock, knock, knock) Penny.",5
21267,Penny,2, Yello.,5
21268,Sheldon,2, You need to remove that chair from the building. It‰Ûªs a health hazard.,5
21269,Penny,2," Okay, relax. I took off the slipcovers, had them dry-cleaned and then fumigated the cushions.",5
21270,Sheldon,2, Really?,5
21271,Penny,2, Yeah. It‰Ûªs cleaner than my couch. Found half a Hot Pocket in there.,5
21272,Sheldon,2, It certainly looks okay. Has a strong toxic chemical smell. That‰Ûªs reassuring.,5
21273,Penny,2," Why don‰Ûªt you give it a try, Sheldon?",5
21274,Sheldon,2, All right. It is a comfortable chair.,5
21275,Penny,2, Why don‰Ûªt you just admit you overreacted?,5
21276,Sheldon,2," No, thank you. (Sees insect. More appear and swarm all over him. He jumps out of a daydream on his own couch. Jumps up and runs out to Penny‰Ûªs apartment.",5
21277,Leonard,2, It‰Ûªs like living with a Chihuahua.,5
21278,Sheldon (at Penny‰Ûªs door),2," (Knock, knock, knock) Penny. (Knock, knock, knock) Penny. (Knock, knock, knock) Penny.",5
21279,Penny,2," What‰Ûªs up, buttercup?",5
21280,Sheldon,2, You have to get rid of the chair.,5
21281,Penny,2, Nope. (Closes door) ,5
21282,Sheldon,2," (Knock, knock, knock) Penny. (Knock, knock, knock) Penny. (Knock, knock, knock) Penny.",5
21283,Penny,2," What‰Ûªs the word, hummingbird?",5
21284,Sheldon,2," For your safety, please wait in my apartment as I call the authorities so they may remove the chair of death.",5
21285,Penny,2, No. (Closes door),5
21286,Sheldon,2," (Knock, knock, knock) Penny. (Knock, knock, knock) Penny. (Knock, knock, knock) Penny.",5
21287,Penny,2," What‰Ûªs the gist, physicist?",5
21288,Sheldon,2," Under my authority as a self-appointed member of the Centres for Disease Control street team, these premises are condemned. (Penny tries to close door) As a man with a keen sense of style, I must tell you, that chair does not work with the room. (Penny closes door). (Knock, knock, knock) Penny. (Knock, knock, knock) Penny. (Penny opens door and waves seat cushion at him. He screams and runs off. She closes door. He sneaks back) (Knock, knock, knock) Penny.",5
21289,Scene,2, Leonard‰Ûªs bedroom.,5
21290,Leonard,2," So, here we are. Back in bed together.",5
21291,Priya (on laptop screen),2," Yep, here we are.",5
21292,Leonard,2," Okay, so I, I, I guess I‰Ûªll just jump right in.",5
21293,Priya,2, All right.,5
21294,Leonard,2," Uh, you‰Ûªre a naughty girl. And, and, uh, I, I want to punish you with my love?",5
21295,Priya,2, What?,5
21296,Leonard,2, Not good?,5
21297,Priya,2, That‰Ûªs terrible. Try again.,5
21298,Leonard,2," Okay. Uh, uh, you‰Ûªre not naughty. Uh, you‰Ûªre, you‰Ûªre, you‰Ûªre dirty. You‰Ûªre, you‰Ûªre a, a dirty girl?",5
21299,Priya,2," Oh, yes. Yes, I am.",5
21300,Leonard,2," Yeah, yeah. Uh, okay. You‰Ûªre a, you‰Ûªre a, you‰Ûªre a, a dirty, disgusting, revolting girl. Ugh!",5
21301,Priya,2," God, Leonard, stop talking.",5
21302,Leonard,2, Why don‰Ûªt you just give me five minutes? I‰Ûªll Google how to do this. I‰Ûªll call you right back.,5
21303,Priya,2, Shh-shh-shh. Just be quiet and do what I tell you.,5
21304,Leonard,2," Okay, like usual. Good.",5
21305,Priya,2, Take off your shirt.,5
21306,Leonard,2, All rightie. Shirt coming off. Ta-da! Man nipples.,5
21307,Priya,2, I said be quiet.,5
21308,Leonard,2," Yes, ma‰Ûªam.",5
21309,Priya,2, Now take off your shorts.,5
21310,Leonard,2," Taking shorts off. There we go. Naked, naked, naked!",5
21311,Priya,2, Wonderful. Now I‰Ûªll take off my clothes.,5
21312,Leonard,2, Cool. (computer screen bugs out) Uh-oh!,5
21313,Priya,2," Here I am, baby. You miss these?",5
21314,Leonard,2," Oh, damn it!",5
21315,Priya,2," Oh, Leonard! Already?",5
21316,Leonard,2," No, no! No-no-no! The screen froze. It‰Ûªs probably just buffering, just give it a second.",5
21317,Priya,2, Fine.,5
21318,Leonard,2," So, how are your mom and dad?",5
21319,Priya,2," Yeah, I really don‰Ûªt want to talk about my parents now.",5
21320,Leonard,2," Yeah. Sure, sure.",5
21321,Sheldon (calling from outside),2," If your video‰Ûªs frozen, try resetting the TCP/IP stack.",5
21322,Leonard,2, Oh! I didn‰Ûªt even think of that. Thanks.,5
21323,Sheldon (still off),2, You‰Ûªre welcome. Please let me know when you and your girlfriend are done hogging the bandwidth for your self-abuse. I‰Ûªm trying to stream a movie on Netflix in here.,5

21329,Amy,2," Denial. Denial, denial. Come in.",5
21330,Sheldon,2, Thank you.,5
21331,Amy,2, Would you like to hear me play a bossa nova standard on the harp?,5
21332,Sheldon,2, No.,5
21333,Amy,2, How about the theme song to the classic television show Diff‰Ûªrent Strokes? Now the world don‰Ûªt move to the beat‰Û_,5
21334,Sheldon,2, No.,5
21335,Amy,2," Well, that‰Ûªs every song I know. What‰Ûªs up?",5
21336,Sheldon,2," You‰Ûªre good friends with Penny, right?",5
21337,Amy,2," Best friends, besties, BFFs, peas in a pod, sisters who would share travelling pants. Go on.",5
21338,Sheldon,2, I was hoping she might listen to you about the dangers of owning unhygienic furniture.,5
21339,Amy,2," For general educational purposes, or has she acquired a bar stool dipped in cholera?",5
21340,Sheldon,2, Cholera is water-borne. You‰Ûªre mocking me.,5
21341,Amy,2," Yes, I am.",5
21342,Sheldon,2, Penny has dragged a chair in off the street whose unknown provenance jeopardizes the health and welfare of every resident in our building.,5
21343,Amy,2," Sheldon, just because you have a focus on cleanliness bordering on the psychotic doesn‰Ûªt mean I have to participate.",5
21344,Sheldon,2," All right, name your price.",5
21345,Amy,2, Kiss me where I‰Ûªve never been kissed before.,5
21346,Sheldon,2, You mean like Salt Lake City?,5
21347,Amy,2, Never mind. I‰Ûªll talk to Penny.,5
21348,Sheldon,2, Thank you.,5
21349,Amy,2, Will you listen to me play my harp now?,5
21350,Sheldon,2," No. I dislike the sound of the harp. Its overuse in classic television sitcoms always makes me think I‰Ûªm going to experience an episode from my past. (Amy plays glissando) I‰Ûªm sorry, Mommy. Don‰Ûªt be mad at me. Don‰Ûªt do that!",5
21351,Scene,2, Howard‰Ûªs workshop. ,5
21352,Leonard,2," I don‰Ûªt know about this, Howard.",5
21353,Howard,2," What? You‰Ûªre having trouble with the long-distance lovemaking. This is your answer. There are two interfaces that simulate a human mouth. You have one, Priya has one in India. When you move your lips and tongue on yours, it transmits exactly what you‰Ûªre doing to hers. See? Internet kissing. (Howard kisses device) Give it a try.",5
21354,Leonard,2, I don‰Ûªt think so.,5
21355,Raj,2, I‰Ûªll try it. Like this?,5
21356,Howard,2," Almost. Really get your tongue in there, to activate the motion sensor.",5
21357,Raj,2, Like this?,5
21358,Howard,2, Close. Really French it.,5
21359,Raj,2, Better?,5
21360,Howard,2," Yeah, you got it, you got it.",5
21361,Raj,2, I‰Ûªm impressed. This is very lifelike.,5
21362,Howard,2, Whoa! You just bit my tongue!,5
21363,Raj,2," I, I nibbled. I was being playful.",5
21364,Howard,2, Why do you have to make everything weird?,5
21365,Raj,2, Sorry. Better?,5
21366,Howard,2," Oh, yeah.",5
21367,Scene,2, Penny‰Ûªs apartment. ,5
21368,Penny,2," Pretty cool, huh? Probably would cost, like, two hundred bucks in a store.",5
21369,Amy,2, I do appreciate a bargain. This entire ensemble once belonged to my dead grandmother.,5
21370,Penny,2, You‰Ûªre kidding.,5
21371,Amy,2, Everything except bra and panties. And they‰Ûªre a leopard-spotted secret I share with Victoria.,5
21372,Penny,2, And now me.,5
21373,Amy,2, I just have one question about the chair.,5
21374,Penny,2, And what‰Ûªs that?,5
21375,Amy,2, Aren‰Ûªt you worried about it being unhygienic?,5
21376,Penny,2," No, it‰Ûªs completely fine. Hmm. I get it. Sheldon sent you. He put you up to this.",5
21377,Amy,2," No, he didn‰Ûªt.",5
21378,Penny,2, Really?,5
21379,Amy,2," Yes, he did. He absolutely did.",5
21380,Penny,2," My God, Amy, that‰Ûªs really crappy of you.",5
21381,Amy,2, It is?,5
21382,Penny,2, Yeah! Letting Sheldon use you to manipulate me? I thought you were my friend.,5
21383,Amy,2," No, I am your friend. Please don‰Ûªt be mad at me.",5
21384,Penny,2," I can‰Ûªt even believe this. You know, maybe you should just go.",5
21385,Amy,2," No, no, I‰Ûªm sorry, I‰Ûªm so sorry. I take it all back. Look. I‰Ûªm, uh, I‰Ûªm sitting in your chair. There‰Ûªs nothing wrong with it. It‰Ûªs a great chair. Please let me continue to be part of your world. Ow!",5
21386,Penny,2, What‰Ûªs wrong?,5
21387,Amy,2, Something in the chair‰Ûªs biting my tushy. It‰Ûªs not important. Ow!,5
21388,Penny,2," Wait. Get up, get up! (She does. Something is moving in the seat cushion. They both run out of the apartment screaming.) Swear you won‰Ûªt tell Sheldon what happened!",5
21389,Amy (between screams),2, I swear! Can I tell my doctor? I‰Ûªm probably gonna need shots!,5
21390,Penny (also still screaming),2," Yeah, sure!",5
21391,Scene,2, Leonard‰Ûªs bedroom. ,5
21392,Leonard,2," Oh, hey, babe, I think I figured this thing out.",5
21393,Priya (on screen),2," Oh, Leonard, listen‰Û_",5
21394,Leonard,2," No, you listen. You‰Ûªre my woman, and I‰Ûªm gonna make you feel things you have never felt before.",5
21395,Priya,2, Leonard‰Û_,5
21396,Leonard,2," That‰Ûªs right, say my name, and beg me for more, ‰Ûªcause, I‰Ûªm gonna give it to you.",5
21397,Priya,2, My parents are here.,5
21398,Dr Koothrappali,2," Hello, Leonard, if I may also say your name.",5
21399,Scene,2, The street outside the apartment block.,5
21400,Howard,2, Check it out. Free chair.,5
21401,Raj,2," Yeah. Hey, you know, if this was in Sheldon and Leonard‰Ûªs apartment, I wouldn‰Ûªt wind up sitting on the floor all the time.",5
21402,Howard,2, On three?,5
21403,Together,2, Three!,5
21404,Raj,2, What kind of idiot throws away a terrific chair like this?,5
21405,Scene,3, The apartment.,5
21406,Leonard,3, Who wants the last dumpling?,5
21407,Penny,3," Ooh, me.",5
21408,Sheldon,3," Penny, a moment. We just had Thai food. In that culture, the last morsel is called the krengjai piece, and it is reserved for the most important and valued member of the group.",5
21409,Penny,3, Thank you all for this high honour.,5
21410,Sheldon,3," I‰Ûªve seen pictures of your mother, keep eating.",5
21411,Howard,3," All right, honey, if we‰Ûªre gonna make the movie, we should go. (Raj stands) This may be hard for you to hear, but when I say honey, I mean my fiancÌ©e. (Raj whispers to him) Yeah, well, now it means her.",5
21412,Bernadette,3, It‰Ûªs okay if he wants to come.,5
21413,Howard,3," Fine. But next time, we get a sitter.",5
21414,Penny,3," All right, I got to go to work. I‰Ûªll walk down with you.",5
21415,Sheldon,3," Wait. Uh, which is closer to the new train store in Monrovia, the movie theatre or the Cheesecake Factory?",5
21416,Howard,3, Neither of them are close.,5
21417,Sheldon,3," Oh, well, then I guess it doesn‰Ûªt matter which one of you drives me. Let‰Ûªs play a fun guessing game to see who gets to take me. All right, this four-letter word describes either a printer‰Ûªs type size or a compulsion to eat dirt.",5
21418,Penny,3," Okay, I‰Ûªm not driving him.",5
21419,Sheldon,3," No, Penny, don‰Ûªt give up, you can get this.",5
21420,Leonard,3, Aren‰Ûªt you going with Sheldon?,5
21421,Amy,3," No, I have no interest in model trains, stores that sell them, nor their heartbreaking clientele.",5
21422,Leonard,3," Oh. Well, I have some work to do, so‰Û_",5
21423,Amy,3, I can‰Ûªt imagine that would disturb me. Carry on.,5
21424,Leonard,3, Okay. Wouldn‰Ûªt you be more comfortable at home?,5
21425,Amy,3," Not really, no.",5
21426,Leonard,3, All righty then. Guess I‰Ûªll just get started.,5
21427,Amy,3," Leonard, please. I don‰Ûªt need the running commentary.",5
21428,Scene,3, The apartment. Amy is staring into space.,5
21429,Leonard,3, Amy?,5
21430,Amy,3, Yo.,5
21431,Leonard,3, You okay?,5
21432,Amy,3," Oh, sure.",5
21433,Leonard,3, I thought you were reading.,5
21434,Amy,3," I was. Now I‰Ûªm thinking about what I read. You all right, Leonard? You seem very uncomfortable.",5
21435,Leonard,3," I, I‰Ûªm fine.",5
21436,Amy,3, Should I go? I‰Ûªve been told sometimes I overstay my welcome.,5
21437,Leonard,3," What, who told you that?",5
21438,Amy,3," Well, most recently my gynaecologist.",5
21439,Leonard,3," Well, you stay as long as you‰Ûªd like.",5
21440,Amy,3," I‰Ûªm glad to hear you say that, because I‰Ûªm having a wonderful time. Hmm, I said the same thing to my gynaecologist.",5
21441,Scene,3, Raj‰Ûªs car.,5
21442,Bernadette,3," What are you going to get at the train store, Sheldon?",5
21443,Sheldon,3," Oh, I‰Ûªm not buying anything. They‰Ûªre having a lecture. H-O gauge railroading. Half the size of O-gauge, but twice the fun. Very controversial topic.",5
21444,Howard,3, Which side do you come down on?,5
21445,Sheldon,3," I‰Ûªll let you know after tonight. Unlike some people, I‰Ûªm going in with an open mind. Who am I kidding? Of course we all know it‰Ûªs O-gauge or no gauge.",5
21446,Howard,3, Can you believe grown men sit around and play with toy trains?,5
21447,Bernadette,3, That‰Ûªs pretty big talk for a man with a closet full of magic tricks at his mother‰Ûªs house.,5
21448,Howard,3," First of all, they‰Ûªre not tricks, they‰Ûªre illusions. And, secondly, when we get married, they‰Ûªre all going up in the attic so you can have that closet for clothes.",5
21449,Bernadette,3, Why would I keep clothes at your mother‰Ûªs house?,5
21450,Howard,3," Well, don‰Ûªt think of it that way. Once we move in, it‰Ûªll be our house.",5
21451,Bernadette,3, Is she moving out?,5
21452,Howard,3, Why would she move out? It‰Ûªs her house.,5
21453,Bernadette,3, Hang on. You seriously think I‰Ûªm going to live with your mother?,5
21454,Sheldon,3," Howard, I think I can help here. Yes, Bernadette, that‰Ûªs exactly what he thinks.",5
21455,Howard,3," Why not? It‰Ûªs a great house, plenty of room, and if we have kids, Mom‰Ûªs there to help. You know, when she tells the Three Little Pigs story, she actually has hair on her chinny-chin-chin.",5
21456,Bernadette,3," I‰Ûªm not gonna live with your mother. Not now, not ever.",5
21457,Howard,3," Wow, someone obviously has some mommy issues.",5
21458,Bernadette,3," Raj, take me home.",5
21459,Howard,3, Don‰Ûªt listen to her. Go to the movie theatre.,5
21460,Bernadette,3, Take me home now.,5
21461,Howard,3, Movie theatre.,5
21462,Raj,3, Mmmmmm.,5
21463,Sheldon,3," Okay, everybody calm down. There is a simple solution here. Raj, take me to the train store, and then I don‰Ûªt care what you people do.",5
21464,Scene,3, The apartment.,5
21465,Amy,3, How was your shower?,5
21466,Leonard,3," It was good, good. Just out of curiosity, what time do you usually go to bed?",5
21467,Amy,3," Oh, I‰Ûªm up all night. I‰Ûªm like a possum. Boy, you were not liked in high school, were you?",5
21468,Leonard,3, Not really. Is that my yearbook?,5
21469,Amy,3," Mm-hmm. Dear Leonard, you‰Ûªre really good at science. Maybe one day you‰Ûªll come up with a cure for being a dork.",5
21470,Leonard,3," Well, it wasn‰Ûªt spray-painting a lightning bolt on my briefcase, I can tell you that.",5
21471,Amy,3," If it makes you feel any better, the only person who signed my yearbook was my mother.",5
21472,Leonard,3, Aw.,5
21473,Amy,3," Dear Amy, self-respect and a hymen are better than friends and fun. Love, Mom.",5
21474,Sheldon (entering),3," Well, you can add Jerry‰Ûªs Junction to the list of train stores Sheldon Cooper will never set foot in again.",5
21475,Leonard,3," Rough night, Casey Jones?",5
21476,Sheldon,3, You don‰Ûªt know the half of it. It was billed as a lively give-and-take on the merits of model train sizes. But it was actually a set-up to intimidate weak-minded spineless rubes into buying H-O starter sets.,5
21477,Leonard,3, What‰Ûªs in the bag?,5
21478,Sheldon,3," I don‰Ûªt want to talk about it. But it‰Ûªs not a spine,I‰Ûªll tell you that.",5
21479,Amy,3," Well, I had a delightful evening, Leonard. We should do this again sometime.",5
21480,Leonard,3," Ah, sure. That‰Ûªd be nice.",5
21481,Amy,3, Glad to hear it. I need someone to accompany me to the wedding of Dr. Moranelli and Dr. Gustufson this Friday. They‰Ûªre kind of the Brad and Angelina of the primatology department.,5
21482,Leonard,3, Wouldn‰Ûªt you rather bring Sheldon?,5
21483,Amy,3," I would, but the last wedding we went to was a disaster. He behaved like a child the entire time.",5
21484,Sheldon,3, Not my fault. You said there‰Ûªd be other scientists there my age.,5
21485,Amy,3," Doesn‰Ûªt matter. You‰Ûªre out, he‰Ûªs in. No date to the prom, two dates to a wedding. Hmm, how times change.",5
21486,Sheldon,3," Ha-ha, you have to go to a wedding.",5
21487,Scene,3, Outside Howard‰Ûªs house. Amy rings the bell.,5
21488,Howard (off),3, I‰Ûªll get it!,5
21489,Mrs Wolowitz (off),3, Could you get it?,5
21490,Howard (off),3, I said I‰Ûªm getting it!,5
21491,Mrs Wolowitz (off),3," Fine, I‰Ûªll get it!",5
21492,Howard,3," I got it! Oh, hi.",5
21493,Bernadette,3, Hey. I don‰Ûªt want to fight. I was just surprised when you sprung the whole living-with-your-mom stuff on me.,5
21494,Howard,3," Yeah, well, I‰Ûªm sorry I didn‰Ûªt run it by you first.",5
21495,Mrs Wolowitz (off),3," I don‰Ûªt know who you‰Ûªre talking to, but in or out! We don‰Ûªt need bugs!",5
21496,Howard,3," The bugs only come here because you‰Ûªre their queen! Listen, how about this. Before we make any kind of decision about where we live, we have a trial run. Stay here for a weekend, see what it‰Ûªs like.",5
21497,Bernadette,3, And your mom would be okay with that?,5
21498,Howard,3," Sure she would. Ma, do you mind if Bernadette stays here this weekend?",5
21499,Mrs Wolowitz (off),3," Hey, if she‰Ûªs willing to give the milk away for free, who am I to say no?",5
21500,Howard,3, See? She‰Ûªs good with it.,5
21501,Mrs Wolowitz (off),3," Frankly, after all your sleepovers with the little brown boy, a girl is a big relief!",5
21502,Scene,3, The apartment. Sheldon is playing with his train set.,5
21503,Sheldon,3," All this years, I‰Ûªve been so wrong. The tinier the train, the more concentrated the fun.",5
21504,Penny,3, You‰Ûªre a brain scientist. Can you explain to me why a brilliant man likes playing with toy trains?,5
21505,Amy,3," Not without cutting his head open, no. How about making my eyes like Cleopatra?",5
21506,Penny,3, Really? For a wedding?,5
21507,Amy,3, Perhaps you‰Ûªre right. My cheekbones and beckoning pelvis already have a certain hello sailor quality to them.,5
21508,Leonard,3, Ready.,5
21509,Penny,3, Aw. So handsome. Like James Bond.,5
21510,Sheldon,3," Better than James Bond, because he‰Ûªs tinier.",5
21511,Amy,3, I got you this to give to me.,5
21512,Penny,3," Oh, sweetie, guests don‰Ûªt normally wear corsages to a wedding. That‰Ûªs more of a prom thing.",5
21513,Amy,3," I never went to my prom. My mom paid my cousin to take me, but he just used the money to buy drugs.",5
21514,Penny,3, Put the corsage on her.,5
21515,Leonard,3," Amy, this is for you.",5
21516,Amy,3," When you‰Ûªre done copping a feel, that goes on my wrist.",5
21517,Sheldon,3, All aboard! Woo-woo! It‰Ûªs official. I‰Ûªm an H-O trainiac.,5
21518,Scene,3, Howard‰Ûªs bedroom.,5
21519,Howard,3," So, dinner went nice.",5
21520,Bernadette,3," Yeah. Yeah, I guess. Does your mother always cut your meat for you?",5
21521,Howard,3," Only when it‰Ûªs fatty. Well, don‰Ûªt be jealous, babe. Someday you‰Ûªll get to cut it for me.",5
21522,Mrs Wolowitz (off),3, Bernadette! I found the extra head for the Waterpik if you want to use it!,5
21523,Bernadette,3," I‰Ûªm okay, Mrs. Wolowitz.",5
21524,Mrs Wolowitz (off),3, You sure? I just squirted half a brisket outta my teeth!,5
21525,Howard,3," Hey, Ma, how about a little privacy?",5
21526,Mrs Wolowitz (off),3," Oh, I know what that means! Hubba-hubba!",5
21527,Bernadette,3," Oh, God.",5
21528,Howard,3," Relax, it‰Ûªll be fine.",5
21529,Bernadette,3, Okay.,5
21530,Mrs Wolowitz (off),3, Let me know when you‰Ûªre done canoodling! Mommy needs a foot rub!,5
21531,Scene,3, The wedding.,5
21532,Amy,3, Would you like to dance?,5
21533,Leonard,3," No, thank you. I‰Ûªm really not much of a dancer.",5
21534,Amy,3," You‰Ûªre not exactly winning any trophies as a conversationalist, either.",5
21535,Leonard,3, I‰Ûªm sorry. The bride and groom seem happy.,5
21536,Amy,3," Why shouldn‰Ûªt they be? They have a feverish night of socially-approved copulation ahead of them. In some cultures, we‰Ûªd stand outside of their bedroom cheering as they achieved orgasm.",5
21537,Leonard,3," That sounds like a late night, and I have work in the morning, so‰Û_",5
21538,Amy,3," Leonard, you may not have noticed, but I am being a delight here. And you‰Ûªre not holding up your end of the evening.",5
21539,Leonard,3," Oh, sorry. This wedding just reminds me of my kinda-sorta girlfriend 9,000 miles away.",5
21540,Amy,3," I have a kinda-sorta boyfriend who‰Ûªs playing with a model train right now, you don‰Ûªt hear me bitching about it. Leonard, a word of advice, moody self-obsession is only attractive in men who can play guitar and are considerably taller than you.",5
21541,Leonard,3, I‰Ûªm not moody. I‰Ûªm fun.,5
21542,Amy,3, You have any evidence to support that statement?,5
21543,Leonard,3," Well, hey, I‰Ûªm just as much fun as you are.",5
21544,Amy,3, Really? Are you willing to draw a moustache on your finger as a conversational icebreaker? I am.,5
21545,Leonard,3," Okay, fine, what do you suggest?",5
21546,Amy,3," We just had a lovely meal, the band is on fire, and you‰Ûªre sitting next to a beautiful woman wearing whorish makeup. Why don‰Ûªt we head outon the dance floor and see if I can sweat through these dress shields.",5
21547,Leonard,3," Once again, I, I‰Ûªm really not much of a dancer.",5
21548,Amy,3," Don‰Ûªt worry, I‰Ûªll lead. (They do the Birdie Song dance)",5
21549,Scene,3, Howard‰Ûªs bedroom. Howard is playing with a lightsabre.,5
21550,Amy,3, Howard?,5
21551,Howard,3, Ready for bed?,5
21552,Bernadette,3," No. I need to brush my teeth, but your mother‰Ûªs been in the bathroom for, like, an hour.",5
21553,Howard,3," Oh. Yeah, she sometimes has problems doing her business. Hang on. Ma, give up! Tonight‰Ûªs not your night!",5
21554,Mrs Wolowitz (off),3, You don‰Ûªt know that! I just sat down!,5
21555,Howard,3," Come on, take a break! Bernadette needs to brush her teeth!",5
21556,Mrs Wolowitz (off),3, She can come in and brush her teeth! I‰Ûªm not embarrassed!,5
21557,Howard,3, Problem solved.,5
21558,Bernadette,3," No, it‰Ûªs not. I‰Ûªm not going in there.",5
21559,Howard,3," Oh, come on, honey. She‰Ûªs just sitting in there reading a magazine. You can‰Ûªt see anything. I go in all the time.",5
21560,Mrs Wolowitz (off),3, Ha! The eagle has landed!,5
21561,Howard,3," And we have splashdown. Wait here, I‰Ûªm gonna go light a candle. And then we make passionate love.",5
21562,Scene,3, The stairwell. Amy is helping Leonard up the stairs.,5
21563,Amy,3," There we go, last floor.",5
21564,Leonard,3," I just can‰Ûªt figure out what happened. I put my left leg in, I took my left leg out, I put my left leg in, and something just snapped.",5
21565,Amy,3, The hokey pokey is a young man‰Ûªs game.,5
21566,Leonard,3, I did have a great time. Thank you for reminding me it‰Ûªs okay to have fun once in a while.,5
21567,Amy,3, You‰Ûªre welcome.,5
21568,Leonard,3, And also for breaking the head off the ice swan so I could hold it against my pulled groin.,5
21569,Amy,3," I excel at spatial reasoning, and I had a hunch that the graceful slope of its neck would cradle your genitals nicely.",5
21570,Leonard,3," Well, okay. Again, thank you.",5
21571,Amy,3," And again, you‰Ûªre welcome.",5
21572,Leonard,3," Want to come in, have a cup of tea?",5
21573,Amy,3," No, thanks. I‰Ûªm gonna head home.",5
21574,Leonard,3," Okay. Well, good night.",5
21575,Amy,3, Good night. (Heads across corridor and knocks on Penny‰Ûªs door),5
21576,Penny,3," Ames, hi. How was the wedding?",5
21577,Amy,3, Great. Until I accidentally made Leonard fall in love with me.,5
21578,Penny,3," Come in, let‰Ûªs talk. Do you want a glass of wine?",5
21579,Amy,3, Wine is one of the reasons I‰Ûªm in this fix. That and this dang pelvis.,5
21580,Penny,3," Okay, I‰Ûªm sorry, what exactly happened?",5
21581,Amy,3," The inevitable, he was lonely and vulnerable from missing his girlfriend, while I was charming, supportive and, let‰Ûªs face it, in this dress, the perfect combination of Madonna and whore.",5
21582,Penny,3," Oh, God, did he make a move on you?",5
21583,Amy,3," No, but it‰Ûªs only a matter of time. How could I have not seen this coming? Now I‰Ûªm gonna have to break the little sad sack‰Ûªs heart.",5
21584,Penny,3," Yeah, I‰Ûªm sure he‰Ûªll be okay.",5
21585,Amy,3," Oh, Penny, much as I would treasure knowing that the two of us had been defiled by the same man, Leonard just doesn‰Ûªt get my motor running.",5
21586,Penny,3," So, um, what are you gonna do? Do you want me to talk to Leonard, let him down easy?",5
21587,Amy,3," No. I‰Ûªll let him have tonight. Then in the morning, I‰Ûªll send him an e-mail letting him know this body is never gonna be his wonderland. I mean, frankly, you‰Ûªve got a better shot than he does.",5
21588,Scene,3, The apartment.,5
21589,Sheldon,3," Leonard. Check it out. I bought an N-gauge locomotive. Half the size of H-O. Look, it fits in my mouth.",5
21590,Leonard,3, Sounds like you had a great night.,5
21591,Sheldon,3, I did. How was yours?,5
21592,Leonard,3, Not bad. I had a lot more fun with Amy than I thought I would.,5
21593,Sheldon,3, What exactly do you mean by that?,5
21594,Leonard,3," Well, it turns out she really knows how to help a guy loosen up and have a good time. Although, truth be told, my groin‰Ûªs a little worse for wear. (Sheldon hits him) Ow! Why did you do that?",5
21595,Sheldon,3, To send a message. She is not for you.,5
21596,Leonard,3, What?,5
21597,Sheldon,3, Not for you!,5
21598,Scene,3, Howard‰Ûªs bedroom.,5
21599,Bernadette,3," Good morning, handsome.",5
21600,Howard,3," Morning, Mom.",5
21601,Bernadette,3, It‰Ûªs me.,5
21602,Howard,3," Yes, it is, and you‰Ûªre so pretty in the morning.",5
21603,Bernadette,3, Your mom and I made you breakfast.,5
21604,Howard,3," Oh, wow. So you guys are getting along?",5
21605,Bernadette,3," Yeah, I guess. We‰Ûªre very different people, Howard, so communication‰Ûªs a little tricky.",5
21606,Mrs Wolowitz (off),3, Does he like the pancakes?!,5
21607,Bernadette (in a similar voice),3, He didn‰Ûªt try them yet!,5
21608,Howard,3, Is there any butter?,5
21609,Bernadette,3, It‰Ûªs butter-flavoured syrup.,5
21610,Howard,3, Oh.,5
21611,Mrs Wolowitz (off),3," So, what‰Ûªs the word?",5
21612,Bernadette,3, He wants butter!,5
21613,Mrs Wolowitz (off),3, It‰Ûªs butter-flavoured syrup,5
21614,Bernadette,3, I just told him that!,5
21615,Howard,3, I don‰Ûªt need any butter.,5
21616,Bernadette,3," If you want butter, I‰Ûªll get you butter.",5
21617,Howard,3," Well, I guess I‰Ûªll cut these by myself.",5
21618,Scene,4, The apartment.,5
21619,Sheldon,4," The entrance to the dungeon is a moss covered door. You manage to open it only to find yourself face-to-face with a hideous, foul-smelling, moss-covered ogre. What do you do?",5
21620,Howard,4," I say, hey Ma, what‰Ûªs for dinner?‰Û",5
21621,Sheldon,4," Seventeen. The ogre is amused by your joke and allows you to pass. By the by, I liked it, too.",5
21622,Leonard,4," Hey, how go the wedding plans, Howard?",5
21623,Howard,4, Great. We spent five hours last night at Macy‰Ûªs registering for gifts. Looks like I‰Ûªm finally going to have that darling little earthenware asparagus dish I‰Ûªve always wanted.,5
21624,Leonard,4," See, this is the good thing about having a girlfriend 9,000 miles away. I can spend my nights doing whatever I want.",5
21625,Howard,4, You mean like playing nerd games with us and then taking a suspiciously long shower?,5
21626,Leonard,4, Maybe. We enter the dungeon.,5
21627,Sheldon,4, You see a dragon.,5
21628,Howard,4," Really? So we‰Ûªre playing Dungeons and Dragons, and we walk into a dungeon and see a dragon? Isn‰Ûªt that a little on the nose?",5
21629,Sheldon,4," When you play Chutes and Ladders, do you complain about all the chutes and all the ladders?",5
21630,Leonard,4, Are you gonna eat that whole pie?,5
21631,Raj,4, Maybe. Why not? Who do I have in my life to watch my figure for?,5
21632,Leonard,4," Oh, God, did you watch Bridget Jones again?",5
21633,Raj,4," No, it‰Ûªs just that everybody‰Ûªs got someone. Sheldon‰Ûªs with Amy, Howard‰Ûªs getting married, you‰Ûªre dating my sister.",5
21634,Leonard,4," Now that Howard‰Ûªs getting married, maybe he‰Ûªll inflate one of his old girlfriends for you.",5
21635,Raj,4, You know who I blame for my loneliness? The United States of America. Your movies and your TV shows promised streets paved with beautiful blonde women with big bazongas.,5
21636,Howard,4," Eat another pie, you‰Ûªll have your own bazongas.",5
21637,Raj,4, That‰Ûªs cruel. You know it goes straight to my hips.,5
21638,Sheldon,4," Gentlemen, please focus. You‰Ûªre facing a fire-breathing dragon.",5
21639,Raj,4, I don‰Ûªt know if I want to play anymore.,5
21640,Sheldon,4," Because you don‰Ûªt have a girlfriend? Well, good Lord, if that becomes a reason not to play Dungeons and Dragons, this game‰Ûªs in serious trouble.",5
21641,Scene,4, Penny‰Ûªs apartment.,5
21642,Amy,4," Now, I assume we use this same wax later on to neaten up each other‰Ûªs bikini regions.",5
21643,Penny,4," Yeah, my bikini region is fine.",5
21644,Amy,4," Who‰Ûªs shocked? I‰Ûªm not. So, Bernadette, how‰Ûªs the wedding planning going? And I‰Ûªm not asking as a prospective bridesmaid. Pick me! Pick me!",5
21645,Bernadette,4, We went cake-tasting yesterday. Raj came along. He cried and ate half the samples.,5
21646,Penny,4," Oh, the poor guy‰Ûªs so lonely. We should set him up with someone.",5
21647,Bernadette,4," You know, I met a really cute girl at work. She‰Ûªs married to a guy in one of our drug trials.",5
21648,Penny,4," Well, hello? She‰Ûªs married.",5
21649,Bernadette,4," Yeah, but her husband is in serious congestive heart failure, and a little birdie told me he‰Ûªs in the placebo group.",5
21650,Penny,4," Okay, so future grief-stricken widow is the one to beat.",5
21651,Scene,4, The Cheesecake Factory.,5
21652,Leonard,4, Are we ready to order?,5
21653,Sheldon,4, One moment. I‰Ûªm conducting an experiment.,5
21654,Howard,4, With Dungeons and Dragons dice?,5
21655,Sheldon,4," Yes. From here on in, I‰Ûªve decided to make all trivial decisions with a throw of the dice, thus freeing up my mind to do what it does best, enlighten and amaze. Page 14, item seven.",5
21656,Howard,4," So, what‰Ûªs for dinner?",5
21657,Sheldon,4, A side of corn succotash. Hmm. Interesting.,5
21658,Penny,4," Um, Howard, can I see you for a minute, please?",5
21659,Howard,4," Uh, I don‰Ûªt want to show any more of your friends how I can fit in the booster seats.",5
21660,Penny,4," Uh, no, that‰Ûªs not it. Just come with me, please.",5
21661,Sheldon,4, Let‰Ûªs see what I‰Ûªll be washing that succotash down with. A pitcher of margaritas.,5
21662,Leonard,4, Do you really want that?,5
21663,Sheldon,4, That‰Ûªs the great thing. It doesn‰Ûªt matter. My mind is freed up to think about more important things.,5
21664,Raj,4, What‰Ûªs it thinking about now?,5
21665,Sheldon,4, Hamburgers and lemonade.,5
21666,Penny,4," Um, Raj, there‰Ûªs someone I want you to meet. This is my friend Emily. I know her from my spin class. Raj, relax. She can‰Ûªt hear you. She‰Ûªs deaf.",5
21667,Howard (signing),4," Emily, this is our friend Raj.",5
21668,Penny,4, Oh! Look at you guys just hitting it off. I am so good.,5
21669,Raj,4, Hi.,5
21670,Howard,4, She says it‰Ûªs nice to meet you.,5
21671,Raj,4, Does she really mean that or was she signing it sarcastically?,5
21672,Howard,4," Raj says it‰Ûªs nice to meet you, too. She says she has to go back to her family, but Penny has her number if you want to text her and get together.",5
21673,Raj,4," Okay, I‰Ûªm going to play it cool. Tell her, maybe. Whatever, babe.",5
21674,Howard,4, He‰Ûªll text you.,5
21675,Raj,4," Ah, look at that. I have a date. I love America again.",5
21676,Sheldon,4," And now for dessert, come on, hot fudge sundae, come on, hot fudge sundae. Bam! That‰Ûªs what I‰Ûªm talking about!",5
21677,Scene,4, A coffee shop.,5
21678,Raj,4," Okay, as soon as she gets here, so she knows I‰Ûªm cool with it, I‰Ûªm going to make a joke about her being deaf. I was thinking, hey, did you hear the one about‰Û_? Oh, no, I bet you didn‰Ûªt.",5
21679,Howard,4, Maybe we should revisit your lonely fat guy plan.,5
21680,Raj,4," Oh, she‰Ûªs here.",5
21681,Howard,4," No joke. Oh, she says she‰Ûªs sorry she‰Ûªs late.",5
21682,Raj,4," Tell her it doesn‰Ûªt matter. Tell her, her eyes shimmer like opalescent lilies in the lake of the palace of the celestial maidens.",5
21683,Howard,4, Really? That‰Ûªs the first thing you want to say?,5
21684,Raj,4, I worked on it all night. Use it.,5
21685,Howard,4," Look, I don‰Ûªt know the sign for opalescent.",5
21686,Raj,4, Then spell it.,5
21687,Howard,4, I don‰Ûªt know how to spell it.,5
21688,Raj,4, You‰Ûªre blowing this for me!,5
21689,Howard,4, He likes your eyes.,5
21690,Raj,4, You‰Ûªre making me sound like a caveman.,5
21691,Howard,4," She says, thank you, you have nice eyes, too.‰Û",5
21692,Raj,4," Really? Ask her how many children she wants, and whatever number she says, say, me too.",5
21693,Howard,4, No.,5
21694,Raj,4," Fine. Tell her I have a deep, sexy voice like James Earl Jones.",5
21695,Howard,4, She doesn‰Ûªt know what James Earl Jones sounds like.,5
21696,Raj,4, Great. Then she won‰Ûªt know I‰Ûªm lying.,5
21697,Scene,4," The same, later.",5
21698,Raj,4," Let‰Ûªs see, what else can I tell you about me that would make you like me? Ooh, I love music. Do you love music?",5
21699,Howard,4, You really want to ask her that?,5
21700,Raj,4, You‰Ûªre right. Everyone loves music.,5
21701,Howard,4," She says, do you play an instrument?",5
21702,Raj,4," No, but when I was six years old, I tried to start a boy band called Frankie Goes to Bollywood. But I couldn‰Ûªt get any other boys to join, so my parents asked the servants to be my backup dancers. Wait, when you sign servants, don‰Ûªt sign it like I‰Ûªm bragging. Sign it in a way that I sound humble with just a hint of, that‰Ûªs right, I had servants.",5
21703,Howard,4, Do you hear yourself,5
21704,Raj,4," Yes, but she doesn‰Ûªt. So get signing, hand monkey.",5
21705,Scene,4," The same, later.",5
21706,Howard (translating for Emily),4," I think I wrote a letter to Santa Claus every day. And then on Christmas morning, under the tree is a little puppy with a red ribbon.",5
21707,Raj,4, What are you doing?,5
21708,Howard,4, Texting Bernadette that I‰Ûªm gonna be late.,5
21709,Raj,4," Dude, what is she saying?",5
21710,Howard,4," It‰Ûªs a funny story about a puppy. Just smile and laugh. Quick, quick, stop smiling.",5
21711,Raj,4, What? Why?,5
21712,Howard,4," The puppy died, it choked on a doll head. Sad face, sad face!",5
21713,Scene,4, Outside the coffee shop.,5
21714,Raj,4," It‰Ûªs a little hard to see with the city lights, but that W-shaped constellation is Cassiopeia. And she was the mother of Andromeda who‰Ûªs over there.",5
21715,Howard,4," Look, pretty stars. This is her car. She hopes she can see you again sometime.",5
21716,Raj,4," Good, good. Oh, boy, help me out here. Does she want me to kiss her or not?",5
21717,Howard,4," I speak sign language, I don‰Ûªt read minds.",5
21718,Raj,4," If you were me, would you kiss her?",5
21719,Howard,4," Yeah, but I‰Ûªm a make out king. (She kisses Raj and gets into car)",5
21720,Raj,4, I was so smooth on that date.,5
21721,Howard,4, You? I made you smooth. You were an idiot.,5
21722,Raj,4," Whatever, dude. She kissed me.",5
21723,Howard,4," It might‰Ûªve been on your lips, but it was my kiss.",5
21724,Raj,4," Oh, fine. Let‰Ûªs agree she kissed both of us.",5
21725,Howard,4, Okay.,5
21726,Scene,4, The apartment. ,5
21727,Penny,4," Mustache is looking good there, Sheldon.",5
21728,Sheldon,4, Don‰Ûªt thank me. Thank the dice. They told me what percentage of my face to shave.,5
21729,Howard,4, Why are you still doing this?,5
21730,Sheldon,4," Because it‰Ûªs working. In the past few weeks, unburdened by trivial decisions, I‰Ûªve co-authored two papers in notable peer-reviewed journals, and I‰Ûªm close to figuring out why the Large Hadron Collider has yet to isolate the Higgs boson particle.",5
21731,Leonard,4," You left out, got chafed testicles because you no longer wear underpants.",5
21732,Sheldon,4, The dice giveth and the dice taketh away.,5
21733,Penny,4, Is Raj out with Emily again?,5
21734,Leonard,4," Yeah, every night for the last month.",5
21735,Penny,4," Wow, can‰Ûªt believe he has a girlfriend.",5
21736,Sheldon (rolls dice),4, Me neither.,5
21737,Howard,4, Here‰Ûªs some other fun news on the Raj/Emily front. He gave her a pair of diamond earrings and leased her a car.,5
21738,Penny,4, You‰Ûªre kidding.,5
21739,Leonard,4, You think she‰Ûªs taking advantage of him?,5
21740,Penny,4," Oh, of course not. She wouldn‰Ûªt do something like that. She‰Ûªs deaf.",5
21741,Leonard,4, Deaf women can‰Ûªt be gold diggers?,5
21742,Penny,4," Handicapped people are nice, Leonard. Everyone knows that.",5
21743,Sheldon,4," Yeah, I actually have information about Raj that would be helpful with this discussion.",5
21744,Leonard,4, Could you tell us?,5
21745,Sheldon,4," Let‰Ûªs see. (Rolls dice) Snake eyes. Sorry, bud.",5
21746,Penny,4," Wait, hang on. Doubles. Roll again.",5
21747,Sheldon,4," Okay, get this. It doesn‰Ûªt matter if he‰Ûªs showering her with gifts, because the Koothrappalis are vastly wealthy.",5
21748,Penny,4," What do you mean, vastly wealthy?",5
21749,Sheldon,4," Well, wealthy means a lot of money, and vastly means even more. I‰Ûªm not sure what‰Ûªs tripping you up.",5
21750,Leonard,4," Look, I know they have money. I don‰Ûªt think it‰Ûªs that much.",5
21751,Sheldon,4," No, you‰Ûªre wrong. See, as you know, a few years ago, I achieved one of my lesser dreams and became a notary public. Well, from time to time, I notarize banking documents for Raj. The Koothrappalis aren‰Ûªt just rich, they‰Ûªre Richie Rich rich.",5
21752,Penny,4," Well, so how much is that?",5
21753,Sheldon,4, About halfway between Bruce Wayne and Scrooge McDuck.,5
21754,Howard,4," What the hell? The last time we went to the zoo, that son of a bitch made me buy him a churro.",5
21755,Leonard,4," Listen, guys, I‰Ûªm sorry, I don‰Ûªt mean to be rude, but I need to go call Raj‰Ûªs sister, who I love so much. So vastly much.",5
21756,Penny,4," Okay, so he‰Ûªs got money, and it‰Ûªs a few gifts and a car.",5
21757,Howard,4, And she got him to pay off all her credit cards.,5
21758,Penny,4," What? He paid off her credit cards? Damn it, I could‰Ûªve dated Raj for a couple months. But I, I wouldn‰Ûªt have, because I‰Ûªm not that kind of girl. We should really talk to Raj.",5
21759,Howard,4," He‰Ûªs not going to listen, he‰Ûªs in love.",5
21760,Sheldon,4," Can‰Ûªt figure out what to do? I remember those days. Now, if you‰Ûªll excuse me, I have to‰Û_ (rolls dice) stay right here.",5
21761,Scene,4, The gym.,5
21762,Howard,4," Yeah, this is a bad idea. We should go.",5
21763,Penny,4, No. I‰Ûªm the one that introduced him to her. I‰Ûªve got to say something.,5
21764,Howard,4, Wow.,5
21765,Penny,4, You‰Ûªre engaged to my friend.,5
21766,Howard,4," Hey, Bernadette doesn‰Ûªt mind where I get my motor running, as long as I park in the right garage.",5
21767,Penny,4," I can‰Ûªt believe you‰Ûªre engaged to my friend. Oh, here she comes.",5
21768,Howard,4, Smart. Whisper so the deaf chick can‰Ûªt hear you.,5
21769,Penny,4, Hi.,5
21770,Howard (translating),4," Oh, hey, hi. Nice to see you.",5
21771,Penny,4," Um, can we talk to you about Raj?",5
21772,Howard,4," She says, sure, what about him?",5
21773,Penny,4," Okay, um, gosh, how do I start? Um, see, Raj is kind of naive. I mean, he hasn‰Ûªt dated a whole lot of women. And I‰Ûªm concerned that, without meaning to, you might be taking advantage of him. You know, by letting him buy you a bunch of expensive things.And I.. I‰Û_ Howard, focus. Tell her what I‰Ûªm saying.",5
21774,Howard,4," Right. Are you a gold digger or not? Oh, uh, something, something, who the something do you think you are? Mind your own something business and go something yourself. Oh, wait, I got this now.",5
21775,Scene,4, Penny‰Ûªs apartment. She answers the door.,5
21776,Raj,4, I‰Ûªm so mad at you!,5
21777,Penny,4," Okay, wait‰Û_",5
21778,Raj,4, How dare you ambush my girlfriend at the gym!,5
21779,Penny,4," We didn‰Ûªt mean for it to be an ambush. Just, it‰Ûªs kind of impossible not to sneak up on deaf people. And hey, since when are you so chatty?",5
21780,Raj,4, I‰Ûªm hammered.,5
21781,Penny,4," Raj, come here. This girl is trouble. I mean, what kind of relationship is it where you buy her gifts and she gives you sex?",5
21782,Raj,4, The best one I ever had!,5
21783,Penny,4," Okay, come on. You know you can do better.",5
21784,Raj,4," Aha. I see what‰Ûªs going on here. You and I had our crazy night together, and now you can‰Ûªt stand to see me with another woman.",5
21785,Penny,4," Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!",5
21786,Raj,4, It‰Ûªs okay. I can‰Ûªt get mad at your feelings.,5
21787,Penny,4, I don‰Ûªt have feelings.,5
21788,Raj,4," Yeah, that‰Ûªs good. Keep telling yourself that. (Storms out)",5
21789,Penny,4, He is cuter now that I know he‰Ûªs rich.,5
21790,Scene,4, Raj‰Ûªs apartment.,5
21791,Raj,4," I have a surprise for you. Cover your eyes. Open them. It‰Ûªs a real ruby. It was a little expensive, but no one can put a price on love. Although, the people at Cartier took a pretty good shot at it. (Skype tone from computer) Oh, Mummy, Daddy. What a nice surprise.",5
21792,Dr Koothrappali,4," No, it‰Ûªs not a nice surprise, it‰Ûªs a bad surprise.",5
21793,Mrs Koothrappali,4, Penny called us.,5
21794,Raj,4, Penny?,5
21795,Mrs Koothrappali,4, She told us you‰Ûªre spending all our money on your new girlfriend.,5
21796,Raj,4," I just got her a couple of things. She gives me things, too.",5
21797,Dr Koothrappali,4," Yeah, yeah, I‰Ûªm a gynaecologist. I know exactly what she gives you.",5
21798,Mrs Koothrappali,4," You need to find a nice Indian girl from a good family. If you keep seeing this woman, you‰Ûªre cut off.",5
21799,Raj,4, What? You‰Ûªre going to make me choose between the woman I love and the money I have very strong feelings for?,5
21800,Dr Koothrappali,4, It‰Ûªs up to you.,5
21801,Raj,4," Well, I choose love.",5
21802,Dr Koothrappali,4," Hah. You‰Ûªre an idiot. Love doesn‰Ûªt last. Well, he‰Ûªs going to find out eventually. Think about it.",5
21803,Raj,4," My parents are making me choose between money and you. I choose you. (She signs) No, I think we‰Ûªll have to return the car. (Again) And that necklace, yeah, that, too. But none of those things matter, because we have something better. We have love.",5
21804,Scene,4, Penny‰Ûªs apartment.,5
21805,Raj,4," Oh, Penny, I hurt so bad.",5
21806,Penny,4," I know, I know.",5
21807,Raj,4, Sometimes I put the TV on mute just to pretend she‰Ûªs still with me. But I can‰Ûªt watch the closed captioning without crying.,5
21808,Penny,4," Oh, I‰Ûªm so sorry. I wish I could make you feel better.",5
21809,Raj,4, Seriously? I‰Ûªm heartbroken and you‰Ûªre hitting on me?,5
21810,Penny,4, What? No!,5
21811,Raj,4," Look, Penny, you‰Ûªre great, but I had a long talk with my parents, and they said if I date an Indian girl, I get a Maserati.",5
21812,Scene,4, The Cheesecake Factory.,5
21813,Raj,4," Mmm. Oh, cheesecake, you‰Ûªre just as good as a woman, even though I can‰Ûªt have sex with you.",5
21814,Howard,4, Try throwing it in the microwave for a few seconds.,5
21815,Sheldon,4," Should I use the rest room or wait until we get home? Come on, papa needs to void his bladder. Oh, that‰Ûªs not what you want to see after three buttermilks.",5
21816,Penny,4," Here you go, boys. I‰Ûªll pick it up when you‰Ûªre ready.",5
21817,Howard,4," Thanks for dinner, buddy.",5
21818,Leonard,4," Yeah, real big of you.",5
21819,Sheldon,4," Hurry, hurry, hurry.",5
21820,Penny,4," Oh, and don‰Ûªt cheap out on the tip. We all know you‰Ûªre loaded now.",5
21821,Scene,5, The comic book store.,5
21822,Leonard,5, It‰Ûªs from Game of Thrones. What do you think?,5
21823,Sheldon,5," I don‰Ûªt know. If we‰Ûªre going to start a fantasy sword collection, and I‰Ûªve long thought we should, is this really the sword to start with?",5
21824,Leonard,5, What did you have in mind?,5
21825,Sheldon,5," Well, off the top of my head, I‰Ûªd have to go with Excalibur. It gives you the right to rule England.",5
21826,Leonard,5, It would be a replica of a movie prop.,5
21827,Sheldon,5, Fair enough. It‰Ûªd give you the right to rule a replica of England.,5
21828,Leonard,5," Well, they don‰Ûªt have an Excalibur here, so what do you want to do?",5
21829,Sheldon,5," Mm. Tough decision. There‰Ûªs no weaponry from Lord of the Rings, forged in a Chinese sweatshop?",5
21830,Leonard,5, Just Bilbo Baggins‰Ûª sword over there.,5
21831,Sheldon,5," Two grown men with a hobbit‰Ûªs dagger; wouldn‰Ûªt we look silly? Okay, let‰Ûªs go for it.",5
21832,Stuart,5," Oh, I see you guys have found my little treasure.",5
21833,Leonard,5," Yeah. It‰Ûªs okay, I guess.",5
21834,Sheldon,5, Okay? It‰Ûªs magnificent.,5
21835,Leonard,5, Buh-buh-buh-buh! What do you want for it?,5
21836,Stuart,5," Oh, it‰Ûªs hard to put a price on something that‰Ûªs a copy of something that was on pay cable. But for my friends, let‰Ûªs say 250?",5
21837,Leonard,5," Oh, that‰Ûªs pretty steep.",5
21838,Stuart,5," Well, it‰Ûªs a limited edition. They only made 8,000 of these bad boys.",5
21839,Sheldon,5," Only 8,000? We‰Ûªre wasting precious time. Buy it.",5
21840,Leonard,5, Hang on. Can you do any better?,5
21841,Stuart,5, Are you kidding? I‰Ûªm already giving you the friends and family discount.,5
21842,Sheldon,5," Oh, did you hear that? We‰Ûªre getting the friends and family discount. We are honoured and we will take it.",5
21843,Leonard,5, Slow down. Two hundred.,5
21844,Sheldon,5, What are you doing? Two fifty is already the discounted price.,5
21845,Leonard,5, Will you shut up?,5
21846,Stuart,5," Tell you what, I‰Ûªll go two thirty-five.",5
21847,Leonard,5, Nope. Maybe another time.,5
21848,Stuart,5," Okay, two twenty five, my final offer.",5
21849,Sheldon,5," Take it, take it.",5
21850,Leonard,5, Two hundred.,5
21851,Stuart,5," Man, you‰Ûªre killing me!",5
21852,Sheldon,5, Killing you? I can‰Ûªt breathe.,5
21853,Stuart,5," Two ten, and I‰Ûªm losing money.",5
21854,Sheldon,5," Oh, now, we can‰Ûªt let him lose money, Leonard. I‰Ûªm so sorry.",5
21855,Leonard,5, Two ten and you throw in the Iron Man helmet.,5
21856,Stuart,5, Are you crazy? That helmet‰Ûªs signed by Robert Downey Jr.,5
21857,Leonard,5, So?,5
21858,Stuart,5," Okay, if you‰Ûªre going to question the importance of an actor‰Ûªs signature on a plastic helmet from a movie based on a comic book, then all of our lives have no meaning!",5
21859,Leonard,5," Okay, fine. Just the sword, two ten.",5
21860,Stuart,5, Thank you. I can eat meat this week.,5
21861,Leonard,5, See that? I just saved us forty bucks.,5
21862,Sheldon,5," I‰Ûªve long said, what you lack in academic knowledge you make up for in street smarts.",5
21863,Stuart,5, You want me to wrap it?,5
21864,Leonard,5," No, it‰Ûªs okay. I‰Ûªm gonna stab my friend in the chest.",5
21865,Wil Wheaton (entering),5," Hey, Stuart.",5
21866,Stuart,5," Ah, hey, Wil.",5
21867,Sheldon,5," Hello, Wil Wheaton.",5
21868,Wil,5," Hi, Sheldon. Nice sword.",5
21869,Sheldon,5, It‰Ûªs part of my sword collection. Do you have a sword collection?,5
21870,Wil,5, No.,5
21871,Sheldon,5, I‰Ûªm not surprised.,5
21872,Stuart,5, Here‰Ûªs the Batman 612 with the Jim Lee alternate cover that you wanted.,5
21873,Wil,5, Awesome. What do I owe you?,5
21874,Stuart,5, Forty bucks.,5
21875,Wil,5, Good deal.,5
21876,Sheldon,5, Sucker. Didn‰Ûªt even ask for the friends and family discount.,5
21877,Wil,5," Hey, I‰Ûªm having a party at my house on Friday, and I was hoping you would stop by.",5
21878,Stuart,5, Will there be girls there?,5
21879,Wil,5," Yeah, of course.",5
21880,Stuart,5, ‰Û÷Cause there wasn‰Ûªt last time.,5
21881,Wil,5, There will be girls. You guys are invited if you want to come by.,5
21882,Leonard,5, Thank you.,5
21883,Wil,5," All right, great. Later.",5
21884,Sheldon,5," I see what you‰Ûªre doing. You accept an invitation to a party at the home of my sworn enemy, he tells everyone we‰Ûªre going to be there, and when we don‰Ûªt show, he looks the fool. Fiendishly clever.",5
21885,Leonard,5, I was actually thinking about going.,5
21886,Sheldon,5," And then declaring the party a fiasco and storming out, leaving him humiliated in front of his guests. Love it.",5
21887,Leonard,5," No, I was gonna grab Raj and Howard and have a good time.",5
21888,Stuart,5," Oh, great, more guys. It‰Ûªs gonna be another Wil Wheaton sausage-fest.",5
21889,Scene,5, The apartment.,5
21890,Leonard,5," Sheldon, can you grab me a water?",5
21891,Sheldon,5, Possibly.,5
21892,Leonard,5, Can you or can‰Ûªt you?,5
21893,Sheldon,5," It‰Ûªs not that simple, Leonard.",5
21894,Leonard,5," It never is, is it?",5
21895,Sheldon,5," At this moment, our relationship exists in two mutually contradictory states. Until you either do not go or go to Wil Wheaton‰Ûªs party, you are simultaneously my friend and not my friend. I‰Ûªm characterizing this phenomenon as Schrodinger‰Ûªs Friendship.",5
21896,Leonard,5, Got it. Can I have my water?,5
21897,Sheldon,5," Of course. Now get it yourself, you traitor.",5
21898,Penny,5," Wait, what is going on?",5
21899,Sheldon,5," In case you have forgotten, Schrodinger‰Ûªs cat is a thought experiment‰Û_",5
21900,Penny,5," No, no, no, no, I didn‰Ûªt forget. Um, there‰Ûªs this cat in a box and until you open it, it‰Ûªs either dead or alive or both. Although, back in Nebraska, our cat got stuck in my brother‰Ûªs camp trunk, and we did not need to open it to know there was all kinds of dead cat in there.",5
21901,Amy,5," Homespun stories, knowledge of physics and a bosom that defies it. You‰Ûªre the whole package, aren‰Ûªt you?",5
21902,Howard (arriving),5," Sorry I‰Ûªm late. Uh, I got great news. NASA picked my team‰Ûªs design for the deep field space telescope that‰Ûªs going on the International Space Station this spring.",5
21903,All,5, Wow.,5
21904,Bernadette,5," Howie, that‰Ûªs wonderful! Congratulations!",5
21905,Howard,5," It gets better. Someone has to go up with the telescope as a payload specialist, and guess who that someone is.",5
21906,Sheldon,5, Mohammed Lee.,5
21907,Howard,5, Who‰Ûªs Mohammed Lee?,5
21908,Sheldon,5," Mohammed is the most common first name in the world, Lee, the most common surname. As I didn‰Ûªt know the answer, I thought that gave me a mathematical edge.",5
21909,Howard,5," It‰Ûªs me, Sheldon. It‰Ûªs me. I‰Ûªm going up in space! Technically, I‰Ûªm an astronaut.",5
21910,All,5," Wow, that‰Ûªs amazing!",5
21911,Bernadette,5, Hang on a second. NASA doesn‰Ûªt have a shuttle any more. How are you going to get up there?,5
21912,Howard,5," Oh, well, it‰Ûªs really cool. You fly to Moscow, they take you out to Kazakhstan, and then you get into a Russian Soyuz rocket which shoots you into a low earth orbit. Or just sits there on the launch pad because the Kazakhi mafia sold the rocket fuel on the black market.",5
21913,Bernadette,5, Are those Russian rockets safe?,5
21914,Howard,5," Well, I mean, safe as it can be when it was built by the good folks who brought you Chernobyl.",5
21915,Leonard,5," I‰Ûªd like to propose a toast. The dream to go up into space is one we all share, and Howard‰Ûªs making that a reality. We‰Ûªre all very proud of you.",5
21916,All,5, Cheers.,5
21917,Sheldon,5, That was a lovely toast. Kudos.,5
21918,Leonard,5, Thank you.,5
21919,Sheldon,5," Simultaneously, a festival of cloying clichÌ©s. You sicken me.",5
21920,Scene,5, Bernadette‰Ûªs car.,5
21921,Howard,5, You‰Ûªre really quiet. Is everything okay?,5
21922,Bernadette,5, Fine. Just a little tired.,5
21923,Howard,5," I hope not too tired, because I‰Ûªm feeling particularly masculine right now. All systems go, if you catch my drift.",5
21924,Bernadette,5, I always catch your drift.,5
21925,Howard,5," All right, well, something‰Ûªs obviously bugging you. What is it?",5
21926,Bernadette,5, I just can‰Ûªt believe you signed up for the space program without even talking to me.,5
21927,Howard,5," Oh, I get it. You‰Ûªre worried about me. That is so sweet. You know, there‰Ûªs a saying we have at NASA. What makes the right stuff so right is that it always comes home.",5
21928,Bernadette,5," Just stop talking, Howard.",5
21929,Howard,5, This isn‰Ûªt the reaction I expected when I told you I was gonna be an astronaut.,5
21930,Bernadette,5, What did you think was going to happen?,5
21931,Howard,5, Honestly? Sex.,5
21932,Bernadette,5, Howard.,5
21933,Howard,5, Do you realize what a big deal this is? What an honour it is to be chosen to go into space?,5
21934,Bernadette,5," Yeah, I get it. I just wish you included me in the decision. We‰Ûªre supposed to be partners. We‰Ûªre supposed to be a team.",5
21935,Howard,5," I‰Ûªm sorry. You‰Ûªre right. Okay, let‰Ûªs try this again. Bernadette, an opportunity has come up that impacts both of us, and I‰Ûªd like to discuss it.",5
21936,Bernadette,5, Okay.,5
21937,Howard,5, I‰Ûªve been offered a chance to go up to the International Space Station for three weeks. What are your thoughts on that?,5
21938,Bernadette,5," Well, first of all, thank you for including me in the decision-making process.",5
21939,Howard,5," Hey, we‰Ûªre a team. So, what do you think?",5
21940,Bernadette,5, No.,5
21941,Howard,5, No?,5
21942,Bernadette,5, No.,5
21943,Howard,5, Well why not?,5
21944,Bernadette,5," Howard, my father was a police officer. We never knew from one night to the next if he was going to come home alive. It was horrible. And I don‰Ûªt want to live that way with you.",5
21945,Howard,5," Hey, my father abandoned me and my mother when I was 11. We never saw him again.",5
21946,Bernadette,5," Oh, boo-hoo, you‰Ûªre not going to space!",5
21947,Scene,5, The apartment.,5
21948,Leonard,5," Pretty cool about Howard, huh?",5
21949,Sheldon,5," Don‰Ûªt talk to me as if nothing‰Ûªs happened between us. And yes, it sure is, buddy.",5
21950,Leonard,5," For God‰Ûªs sake, will you stop with the Schrodinger stuff.",5
21951,Sheldon,5," Would you prefer a simpler application of Heisenberg‰Ûªs uncertainty principle, in which I could either know where you are or whether I like you, but not both?",5
21952,Leonard,5," You never stop talking, do you?",5
21953,Amy,5, I don‰Ûªt understand. What differences does it make if Leonard goes to Wil Wheaton‰Ûªs party?,5
21954,Penny,5, Wil Wheaton is Sheldon‰Ûªs mortal enemy.,5
21955,Amy,5, Mortal enemy?,5
21956,Penny,5, Mm-hmm.,5
21957,Amy,5," Sheldon, I know you‰Ûªre a bit of a left-handed monkey wrench, but, you really have a mortal enemy?",5
21958,Sheldon,5," In fact, I have 61 of them. Would you like to see the list?",5
21959,Penny,5," Oh, say no, say no, say no, say no.",5
21960,Sheldon,5, You just got off the list. Would you like back on it? This‰Ûªll just take a moment. It‰Ûªs on a five and a quarter inch floppy.,5
21961,Amy,5, A floppy disk?,5
21962,Sheldon,5," Well, I started the list when I was nine.",5
21963,Amy,5, How did Wil Wheaton get on the list?,5
21964,All,5," Oh! Oh, God!",5
21965,Sheldon,5," As a child, I loved Wesley Crusher, Wil Wheaton‰Ûªs character on Star Trek. So, I drove for hours by bus to a Star Trek convention at which Wil Wheaton was scheduled to appear, so that I could get my Wesley Crusher action figure signed. But he never showed, because apparently, it was cooler for him to be the lower-left corner on Hollywood Squares. Oh, damn! The floppy failed. Well, whoever was in charge of quality control at the Verbatim Corporation in 1989, congratulations, you just made the list.",5
21966,Scene,5, Howard‰Ûªs bedroom.,5
21967,Bernadette,5, Howard?,5
21968,Howard,5," Change your mind about sex? I‰Ûªm still mad, but I‰Ûªll do it.",5
21969,Bernadette,5," No, I‰Ûªve just been thinking. It doesn‰Ûªt matter if I‰Ûªm afraid for your safety. I don‰Ûªt want to be the person who stands between you and your dreams.",5
21970,Howard,5, Really?,5
21971,Bernadette,5," Really. If going into space means that much to you, I will never say another word about it.",5
21972,Howard,5, Thank you.,5
21973,Bernadette,5, I love you.,5
21974,Howard,5," I love you, too. So, sex now?",5
21975,Bernadette,5, Okay. I just forgot to brush my teeth. I‰Ûªll be right back. (Exits),5
21976,Mrs Wolowitz (off),5, Over my dead body my son goes into outer space!,5
21977,Bernadette,5, I‰Ûªm ready.,5
21978,Scene,5, The cafeteria.,5
21979,Leonard,5," Wait, let me see if I got this right. You actually asked Bernadette to leave your house in the middle of the night?",5
21980,Howard,5, What choice did I have? She went behind my back and turned my own mother against me.,5
21981,Raj,5, Wow. You‰Ûªre not only our first astronaut. You‰Ûªre also the first one of us to kick a girl out of bed. You‰Ûªre like a rock star.,5
21982,Howard,5, Little bit.,5
21983,Leonard,5," I hate to say it, but she did kind of betray you.",5
21984,Sheldon,5," Interesting. You see betrayal in others, but not yourself.",5
21985,Leonard,5, Going to Wheaton‰Ûªs party is not betraying you.,5
21986,Sheldon,5," Oh, of course you would have to believe that. Evil always thinks it‰Ûªs doing right. Excuse me, Stormtrooper. These are the droids you‰Ûªre looking for.",5
21987,Leonard,5, I‰Ûªm going to a party. I‰Ûªm not turning R2-D2 and C-3PO over to the empire!,5
21988,Sheldon,5, Not yet.,5
21989,Raj,5," So, what‰Ûªs gonna happen next? Are you and Bernadette going to break up?",5
21990,Howard,5," I don‰Ûªt know. If we‰Ûªre going to get back together, she‰Ûªs going to have to apologize and accept that I‰Ûªm a grown man who can make his own decisions.",5
21991,Raj,5, Then she‰Ûªs going to have to convince your mother to let you go into space.,5
21992,Howard,5, Obviously.,5
21993,Scene,5, Penny‰Ûªs apartment.,5
21994,Bernadette,5, I had no choice. I had to tell his mother. He can‰Ûªt go to space. He‰Ûªs like a baby bird. Do you know he once got an asthma attack from reading an old library book?,5
21995,Amy,5, You‰Ûªre kidding.,5
21996,Penny,5," No, I was there that day. Sheldon threw his back out handing him that book.",5
21997,Bernadette,5, I don‰Ûªt know what I‰Ûªm going to do. I don‰Ûªt want to break up over this.,5
21998,Penny,5," Okay, why don‰Ûªt you just tell him you made a mistake?",5
21999,Bernadette,5, Do you guys think it was a mistake? Am I the bad guy in this?,5
22000,Amy,5, It‰Ûªs not for us to judge. We‰Ûªre just here to provide comfort and support while you come to grips with what a despicable thing you‰Ûªve done.,5
22001,Bernadette,5," Oh, God, you‰Ûªre right. I took our love and threw it under his bus-sized mother. I need to apologize.",5
22002,Penny,5," Well, that, that‰Ûªs good. I‰Ûªm glad you came to that. But before you do, let me just ask you a big picture question.",5
22003,Bernadette,5, What?,5
22004,Penny,5, Are you a hundred percent positive you love and want to marry Howard Wolowitz?,5
22005,Bernadette,5," I do, with all my heart.",5
22006,Penny,5, Got it. Just had to check.,5
22007,Amy,5, He‰Ûªs great.,5
22008,Scene,5, The apartment.,5
22009,Leonard,5," All right, Sheldon, we‰Ûªre going to Wil‰Ûªs. This is your last chance.",5
22010,Sheldon,5," No, Leonard, this is your last chance. One day, a historian is going to come to you and say, is it true you were friends with Dr. Sheldon Cooper? And you‰Ûªre going to have to choke back a hot sob of regret and humiliation as you mumble, I was, but I chose to go to a party thrown by the one kid from Stand By Me that no one remembers.",5
22011,Leonard,5, You want to drive?,5
22012,Raj,5, Sure.,5
22013,Leonard,5," Hey, Sheldon?",5
22014,Sheldon,5," Oh, good. You picked me, you picked me.",5
22015,Leonard,5," No, I just got a text from Stuart. Brent Spiner is at the party.",5
22016,Sheldon,5, Brent Spiner?,5
22017,Leonard,5, Yes.,5
22018,Sheldon,5, I don‰Ûªt care.,5
22019,Leonard,5," Really? Brent Spiner, Mr. Data himself. You love him.",5
22020,Sheldon,5," I did, but I think I‰Ûªve kind of outgrown Star Trek. You know, stock characters, ludicrous plots, beam me up. What a load of hooey.",5
22021,Leonard,5," I‰Ûªm going. Live long and prosper, Sheldon.",5
22022,Sheldon,5," Yeah, even that. You look like a dork.",5
22023,Scene,5, Howard‰Ûªs bedroom.,5
22024,Mrs Wolowitz (off),5," Howard, Bernadette‰Ûªs here!",5
22025,Howard,5, Tell her I‰Ûªm not home!,5
22026,Mrs Wolowitz (off),5, What kind of a schmuck play is that? She can hear you shouting!,5
22027,Bernadette,5, Can we talk?,5
22028,Howard,5, You can. I have nothing to say.,5
22029,Bernadette,5, All right. I just wanted to tell you I‰Ûªm sorry I said something to your mother.,5
22030,Howard,5," I was gonna tell her eventually, but you went behind my back.",5
22031,Bernadette,5, I know. I‰Ûªm sorry. I got scared.,5
22032,Howard,5," If you‰Ûªre gonna love me, you‰Ûªre gonna have to love the whole package, the tenderhearted poet and the crazy daredevil.",5
22033,Bernadette,5, I know.,5
22034,Howard,5," Well, don‰Ûªt say it if you‰Ûªre not gonna mean it, ‰Ûªcause I‰Ûªm not just gonna stop with the space station. Yeah, I want to go to the Moon, I want to go to Mars. I want to take a one-man sub to the lowest depths of the ocean.",5
22035,Bernadette,5, Really? You got seasick on Pirates of the Caribbean.,5
22036,Howard,5," Well, those big kids were rocking it.",5
22037,Bernadette,5," I just did what I did because I love you so much, and the thought of losing you is more than I can handle.",5
22038,Howard,5, Really?,5
22039,Bernadette,5, You‰Ûªre my soul mate. This is where you kiss me.,5
22040,Howard,5," Right, right.",5
22041,Mrs Wolowitz (off),5, Make up all you want! Your tuchus is not leaving this planet!,5
22042,Scene,5, Wil Wheaton‰Ûªs party.,5
22043,Raj,5," Hey, you know that beautiful actress who plays the Borg Queen in First Contact?",5
22044,Leonard,5, Yeah.,5
22045,Raj,5," Well, I just met her gynaecologist!",5
22046,Leonard,5, What are you doing here?,5
22047,Sheldon,5," Fighting for our friendship. As peculiar and annoying as you can be, you‰Ûªre still my little buddy. I‰Ûªm not going to let that end here tonight. Now put down that drink, let‰Ûªs meet Brent Spiner and go home.",5
22048,Wil,5," Hey, Sheldon, I‰Ûªm so glad you made it. I found something I think you might like.",5
22049,Sheldon,5, What I‰Ûªd like is for him to have a more depressing home. This is quite lovely.,5
22050,Wil,5, This is for you.,5
22051,Sheldon,5, An original mint-in-package Wesley Crusher action figure.,5
22052,Wil,5," I remembered your story about the time you went to a convention when you were a kid to get one signed, and I didn‰Ûªt show up.",5
22053,Wil,5, Look at what I wrote.,5
22054,Sheldon,5," To Sheldon, sorry this took so long. Your friend, Wil Wheaton.",5
22055,Wil,5, It‰Ûªs my last one. I want you to have it.,5
22056,Sheldon,5," Look, everyone. Wil Wheaton is my friend!",5
22057,Brent Spiner,5," Oh, wow. I haven‰Ûªt seen one of these in years. (Rips open action figure packaging) Remember how we used to make these things look like they were masturbating?",5
22058,Sheldon,5," Brent Spiner, what have you done? That was an original mint-in-package Wesley Crusher action figure signed by my close personal friend, Wil Wheaton.",5
22059,Brent,5," Sorry, Slim. I‰Ûªve got some Mr. Data dolls in the trunk of my car. You want me to sign one for you?",5
22060,Sheldon,5," You‰Ûªve already signed something, Brent Spiner. Your name on my list. From this moment on, you are my mortal enemy.",5
22061,Wil,5, Don‰Ûªt worry. It doesn‰Ûªt take up a whole lot of your time.,5
22062,Sheldon,5," Come on, buddy. Let‰Ûªs not waste another second on this loser. Love your house.",5
22063,Leonard,5, Can we get autographed dolls?,5
22064,Brent,5, Sure. Twenty bucks.,5
22065,Leonard,5, Ten.,5
22066,Brent,5, Eighteen.,5
22067,Leonard,5, Twelve.,5
22068,Brent,5, Sixteen.,5
22069,Leonard,5, Two for thirty. And you come to my birthday party.,5
22070,Brent,5, Done.,5
22071,Scene,6, The apartment. Sheldon‰Ûªs mother is visiting.,5
22072,Leonard,6, So what kind of cruise is this you‰Ûªre going on?,5
22073,Mrs Cooper,6," It‰Ûªs called the Born Again Boat Ride. Christian Quarterly gave it their highest rating, five thorny crowns. I do wish you‰Ûªd come with me, Sheldon.",5
22074,Sheldon,6," Well, Mom, if I did, it would be conclusive proof that your God can work miracles.",5
22075,Mrs Cooper,6," You‰Ûªre missing out. It‰Ûªs gonna be wall-to-wall fun. It‰Ûªs all themed. There‰Ûªs Jonah and the Whale Watching, all-you-can-eat Last Supper Buffet, and my personal favourite, Gunning with God.",5
22076,Leonard,6, What‰Ûªs Gunning with God? I‰Ûªm afraid to ask.,5
22077,Mrs Cooper,6," Oh, it is a hoot and a half. You write your sins on a clay pigeon, they fire ‰Ûªem up in the air, and you pulverize them with a 12-gauge shotgun full of our Lord‰Ûªs forgiveness.",5
22078,Sheldon,6," Frankly, Mom, I‰Ûªm encouraged to see how advanced your group has become, willing to sail out into the ocean without fear of falling off the edge.",5
22079,Mrs Cooper,6," For example, if Shelly was aboard, he‰Ûªd write ‰ÛÏsmart mouth‰Û on his pigeon, and then bam!",5
22080,Sheldon,6," The Lord giveth and the Lord bloweth away. Well, Mom, according to my itinerary for our weekend together, the fun begins with fried chicken.",5
22081,Mrs Cooper,6, Sounds delicious.,5
22082,Sheldon,6," Good, ‰Ûªcause I got you everything you need to make it. You are in for a treat. My mother‰Ûªs fried chicken is why we had to buy my dad the extra large coffin.",5
22083,Leonard,6," Sheldon, she just got off the plane. She doesn‰Ûªt want to cook.",5
22084,Sheldon,6, Of course she does. Making me food is her way of saying I love you. Making me food when she‰Ûªs too tired to cook is her way of saying I really love you.,5
22085,Mrs Cooper,6," Actually, I wouldn‰Ûªt mind going out for a bite, Sheldon.",5
22086,Sheldon,6, Won‰Ûªt that spoil our appetites for the chicken you‰Ûªre going to make me?,5
22087,Leonard,6," All right, that settles it, we‰Ûªre going out. Do you like sushi? There‰Ûªs a great little place down the street.",5
22088,Mrs Cooper,6," I‰Ûªve never had it, but there‰Ûªs no harm in trying something new.",5
22089,Sheldon,6, There‰Ûªs a lot of harm in trying something new. That‰Ûªs why we test out drugs and cosmetics on bunny rabbits.,5
22090,Leonard,6," Sheldon, you‰Ûªre talking like a crazy person.",5
22091,Mrs Cooper,6," Actually, I had him tested as a child. Doctor says he‰Ûªs fine.",5
22092,Sheldon,6, Told you.,5
22093,Mrs Cooper,6," Although, I do regret not following up with that specialist in Houston.",5
22094,Scene,6, A sushi bar.,5
22095,All,6, Irasshaimase!,5
22096,Sheldon,6, Stop yelling! I‰Ûªm not happy about this.,5
22097,Leonard,6, What‰Ûªs the last thing you were ever happy about?,5
22098,Sheldon,6, The prospect of fried chicken.,5
22099,Mrs Cooper,6," This is exciting. Back home, the diner on Route Four serves sushi, but it‰Ûªs just cut up fish sticks and a side of Uncle Ben‰Ûªs. They put it on the menu in those kung fu letters, but that don‰Ûªt make it sushi.",5
22100,Leonard,6," Uh, kung fu letters might not be politically correct.",5
22101,Mrs Cooper,6," Oh, I thought the one we couldn‰Ûªt say was ching chong.",5
22102,Leonard,6," Yeah, yeah, that, too.",5
22103,Mrs Cooper,6," So, Shelly, what‰Ûªs up with you and your friend Amy, if you don‰Ûªt mind a mother prying a bit?",5
22104,Sheldon,6," Well, there‰Ûªs actually big news on the Amy front. She‰Ûªs been studying the neurobiology of addiction in lower animals. She is this close to getting a starfish hooked on cocaine.",5
22105,Mrs Cooper,6, Do you have any idea what‰Ûªs going on with those two?,5
22106,Leonard,6," It‰Ûªs kind of like the Loch Ness monster. Maybe there‰Ûªs something there, maybe there isn‰Ûªt. We‰Ûªll probably never know. But sometimes it‰Ûªs fun to creep yourself out thinking about it.",5
22107,Mrs Cooper,6, How are you doing on the young lady front? I hear you‰Ûªre in some sort of a long distance situation?,5
22108,Leonard,6," Uh, yeah, it‰Ûªs Raj‰Ûªs sister. It‰Ûªs kind of tough. She‰Ûªs in India. Also, her parents aren‰Ûªt happy she‰Ûªs dating someone white.",5
22109,Mrs Cooper,6," Oh, that‰Ûªs a funny turn, isn‰Ûªt it? You never think about it going the other way. Well, you can‰Ûªt force things. You need to figure out if you‰Ûªre in a relationship or if you‰Ûªre just calling it one. It‰Ûªs like they say, a cat can have kittens in the oven but that don‰Ûªt make ‰Ûªem biscuits.",5
22110,Sheldon,6," And that reminds me of another saying. You can lead a chicken to Crisco, but you can‰Ûªtmake your mother fry it.",5
22111,Mrs Cooper,6," Sheldon, you pester me one more time about chicken, I will put you over my knee right here in this restaurant.",5
22112,Leonard,6," Please pester her. Please, for me.",5
22113,Scene,6, The stairwell.,5
22114,Leonard,6," So, Mrs. Cooper, what did you think of the sushi?",5
22115,Mrs Cooper,6," It was good. The only thing that would have made it better is if it was cooked and if it was beef. Sheldon, when is your landlord going to fix the elevator?",5
22116,Sheldon,6, I don‰Ûªt know. Lately we‰Ûªve been talking about converting it into a missile silo.,5
22117,Leonard,6, Your son seems to think we need to launch a pre-emptive strike on Burbank.,5
22118,Sheldon,6, Get them before they get us.,5
22119,"Raj (Sitting against their front door, drinking a beer)",6," Hey, look who decided to show up.",5
22120,Leonard,6," Raj, what are you doing?",5
22121,Raj,6," I couldn‰Ûªt find you guys so I bought six new friends. Three, sadly, are dead.",5
22122,Sheldon,6," Mom, you remember Rajesh? Rajesh, my mother.",5
22123,Raj,6, Of course. Mrs. Cooper. So nice to see you again.,5
22124,Mrs Cooper,6," Well, it‰Ûªs so nice to see you, too. I thought it was our Indians that had the occasional alcohol problem.",5
22125,Leonard,6," We don‰Ûªt say that, either. I‰Ûªll make you a list.",5
22126,Mrs Cooper,6," Oh, that would be mighty white of you. So, Raj, what pain are you trying to cover up with alcohol?",5
22127,Raj,6," Nothing, I‰Ûªm fine.",5
22128,Mrs Cooper,6, Are ya?,5
22129,Raj,6, No. (Bursts into tears),5
22130,Mrs Cooper,6, That‰Ûªs better. Now tell me what‰Ûªs bothering you.,5
22131,Raj,6, I‰Ûªm so lonely.,5
22132,Sheldon,6," Oh, yes, born alone, die alone. It‰Ûªs a tragic human condition. Now, Raj, if you‰Ûªll excuse my mother, she‰Ûªs about to make a pecan pie that‰Ûªll be so good I‰Ûªll almost forget how she blew it with the fried chicken.",5
22133,Mrs Cooper,6," Sheldon, your friend is hurtin‰Ûª. What do we do when someone‰Ûªs hurtin‰Ûª?",5
22134,Sheldon,6, Offer them a hot beverage.,5
22135,Mrs Cooper,6," And when they‰Ûªre drunk as a skunk, what beverage do we offer?",5
22136,Sheldon,6, Coffee.,5
22137,Mrs Cooper,6," And what do we do it with? (Sheldon fixes a large false smile.) Now you listen to me. I know you feel like you can‰Ûªt find someone, but there‰Ûªs a lock for every key. Back home, there‰Ûªs a girl works at the Wal-Mart. Tall, tall girl. Woman could hunt geese with a rake. Thought she‰Ûªd never find a man, then one day, wouldn‰Ûªt ya know, Harlem Globetrotters come to town. Long story short, today that woman travels the world with a semi-professional basketball player and two beautiful mixed-race babies.",5
22138,Raj,6," I didn‰Ûªt get a lot of that because of your accent, but the general tone was soothing and somehow I feel better.",5
22139,Sheldon,6," I‰Ûªm not going to get my pecan pie, am I?",5
22140,Leonard,6, You want some Oreos?,5
22141,Sheldon,6, Double Stuf?,5
22142,Leonard,6," No, regular.",5
22143,Sheldon,6, Nice. Kick a man when he‰Ûªs down.,5
22144,Scene,6, The laundry room.,5
22145,Sheldon,6," I‰Ûªm glad we‰Ûªre finally getting to do something together, just the two of us.",5
22146,Mrs Cooper,6, Sure. One thing you really miss when you‰Ûªre on vacation is laundry.,5
22147,Sheldon,6," Careful, you‰Ûªre using too much Downey. You know if my clothes get too soft it makes me sleepy.",5
22148,Mrs Cooper,6," Well, this takes me back. Me doing your laundry, you next to me criticizing.",5
22149,Sheldon,6," It is nice, isn‰Ûªt it?",5
22150,Penny (arriving),6, Mrs. Cooper. Hi!,5
22151,Mrs Cooper,6," Oh, hello, darlin‰Ûª.",5
22152,Penny,6," Sheldon, you didn‰Ûªt tell me your mom was coming.",5
22153,Sheldon,6," It was in my weekly e-mail blast. Right between beet season is finally here, and uh-oh, red stool from beets leads to cancer scare.",5
22154,Mrs Cooper,6," So, how‰Ûªve you been?",5
22155,Penny,6," Good, good.",5
22156,Mrs Cooper,6, I hear that Leonard has a new girlfriend. How are you doing with all that?,5
22157,Penny,6," Oh, fine. You know, it‰Ûªs been a while. I‰Ûªm getting back out there.",5
22158,Mrs Cooper,6," Let me ask you, when you get back out there, are you wearing this? (Holds up a skimpy top)",5
22159,Penny,6," Well, it‰Ûªs super cute on. That top has paid for itself in free drinks like ten times what it cost.",5
22160,Sheldon,6," Yes, Penny has a lot of her money tied up in promiscuity futures.",5
22161,Mrs Cooper,6," Hon, you think maybe the reason why you‰Ûªre having trouble finding a guy to settle down with is because you‰Ûªre letting them ride the roller coaster without buying a ticket?",5
22162,Penny,6," Oh, they don‰Ûªt always get to ride the roller coaster. Sometimes they only get to spin the teacups. Now I‰Ûªm going out tonight. Would it be crazy to ask you to look at the outfit I‰Ûªm going to wear?",5
22163,Mrs Cooper,6," Oh, not crazy at all. And don‰Ûªt beat yourself up. When I was your age, you could have me for a car ride and a bottle of strawberry wine.",5
22164,Sheldon,6, Now that will not be in this week‰Ûªs e-mail blast.,5
22165,Scene,6, The apartment.,5
22166,Howard,6," So, this spring, I get to go to the International Space Station.",5
22167,Mrs Cooper,6," Oh, my word, a trip to the heavens. If you ever want to live there eternally, I‰Ûªve got a good book you could read.",5
22168,Howard,6," Thanks, but I watch the Charlie Brown Christmas special every year, so I get the gist.",5
22169,Mrs Cooper,6, I bet your mom is really proud of you.,5
22170,Howard,6," Nope. She says if I don‰Ûªt back out she‰Ûªs going to go on a hunger strike. It would take years before she‰Ûªd be in any kind of danger, but still.",5
22171,Sheldon,6," I‰Ûªve got a treat for us tomorrow, Mom. I‰Ûªm taking you to see Saul Perlmutter give a lecture about his Nobel Prize-winning work in cosmology. And the best part is, at the Q and A afterward, I‰Ûªve worked up a couple of Q‰Ûªs that will stump his sorry A.",5
22172,Mrs Cooper,6," I don‰Ûªt know, Shelly. I thought we could do a little sightseeing.",5
22173,Sheldon,6, What sight is better than your little boy embarrassing a Nobel laureate?,5
22174,Mrs Cooper,6," Come on, Sheldon, we‰Ûªll take your mom to see the Hollywood sign, the wax museum, the Walk of Fame.",5
22175,Penny,6," Ooh, maybe a little Rodeo Drive.",5
22176,Mrs Cooper,6," Well, I can‰Ûªt spend twelve thousand dollars on a handbag, but it‰Ûªs free to look upon those who do with righteous condemnation.",5
22177,Howard,6, What do you say?,5
22178,Sheldon,6," What do I say? I say you people need to stop ruining my mom‰Ûªs visit with your sushi, and your sadness and your slutty shirts. Stop it.",5
22179,Howard (after Raj whispers to him),6, He‰Ûªs not talking about your shirt. Your shirt is fine.,5
22180,Scene,6, The kitchen.,5
22181,Leonard,6, These are delicious.,5
22182,Mrs Cooper,6, The trick to pancakes is bacon grease. I cook everything in it.,5
22183,Leonard,6, Everything? Aren‰Ûªt you worried about your health?,5
22184,Mrs Cooper,6," Oh, doctors are always changing their mind. One week bacon grease is bad for you. The next week we‰Ûªre not getting enough of it. Good morning, Shelly.",5
22185,Sheldon,6," Mom, I want to apologize for my behaviour last night.",5
22186,Mrs Cooper,6, Apology accepted.,5
22187,Sheldon,6," Great. Now, you‰Ûªre going to love the Perlmutter lecture. Look, he will be stating that the universe is older than 6,000 years, but I thought you could stick your fingers in your ears and hum Amazing Grace during those parts.",5
22188,Mrs Cooper,6, I am still going out with your friends.,5
22189,Sheldon,6, But I apologized. And that was hard for me because I didn‰Ûªt do anything wrong.,5
22190,Mrs Cooper,6," Shelly, I hung out with you in enough dusty lecture halls while you were growing up. I want to go sightseeing. So why don‰Ûªt you have some pancakes, get dressed and come with us.",5
22191,Sheldon,6," I‰Ûªm not going, and you can‰Ûªt make me.",5
22192,Mrs Cooper,6," You‰Ûªre right, I can‰Ûªt. Have a nice day.",5
22193,Sheldon,6," Well, I‰Ûªm going to stand here until you change your mind.",5
22194,Mrs Cooper,6," Well, then you are going to stand there all day.",5
22195,Leonard,6, I‰Ûªm just gonna take my bacon grease and slide over there.,5
22196,Sheldon,6, I can‰Ûªt believe my own mother is abandoning me.,5
22197,Mrs Cooper,6," I am not abandoning you. Sheldon, abandoning you is leaving you in a basket on a church doorstep. I am going to Hollywood and thank a wax Ronald Reagan for his service to our country.",5
22198,Sheldon,6," We appear to be at a crossroads in our relationship, Mother.",5
22199,Mrs Cooper,6," Well, I guess we are.",5
22200,Leonard,6, Sorry. Syrup.,5
22201,Sheldon,6," All right, Mom. When you‰Ûªre at the Ripley‰Ûªs Believe It Or Not Museum, if they have an exhibit about a mother who threw away a chance to spend the day with the world‰Ûªs most wonderful son, believe it, because it‰Ûªs true. (Grabs pancakes and snatches syrup from Leonard‰Ûªs hand)",5
22202,Leonard,6, I hadn‰Ûªt‰Û_,5
22203,Scene,6, Amy‰Ûªs apartment.,5
22204,Sheldon,6, That lecture was a waste of time. I made more accurate diagrams of the expansion of the early universe on the nursery wall with the contents of my diaper. (Sneezes),5
22205,Amy,6, Are you getting sick?,5
22206,Sheldon,6," No, I‰Ûªm just allergic to people who get Nobel Prizes for no good reason.",5
22207,Amy,6," Sheldon, is it possible that your foul mood, or, to use the clinical term, bitchiness, is because your mother isn‰Ûªt making you a priority?",5
22208,Sheldon,6," No. Or to use the clinical term, nuh-uh.",5
22209,Amy,6, Are you sure? The infant-mother pair-bond is the building block of primate psychology.,5
22210,Sheldon,6," Oh, there it is. It always comes back to monkeys with you. Just monkeys, monkeys, monkeys.",5
22211,Amy,6," Sheldon, we‰Ûªre all animals. And granted, there are aspects of you that are extraordinary, but when it comes to emotions and relationships, you‰Ûªre just like everybody else.",5
22212,Sheldon,6, Are you trying to suggest that my emotional problems are no different than those of a stupid person?,5
22213,Amy,6," Actually, some research indicates that by not over-thinking, the less intelligent handle emotions better. (He sneezes again) Sure you‰Ûªre not coming down with a cold?",5
22214,Sheldon,6," Oh, yes, the common cold. Just like everyone else. You‰Ûªd love that, wouldn‰Ûªt you?",5
22215,Scene,6, A church.,5
22216,Mrs Cooper,6," Oh, this one‰Ûªs sweet. You know, for your rosary rattlers.",5
22217,Leonard,6," Mrs. Cooper, we say Catholics, not rosary rattlers.",5
22218,Mrs Cooper,6," My goodness, it‰Ûªs a wonder you people in California can talk at all.",5
22219,Penny,6, This is like the worst Hollywood tour ever.,5
22220,Leonard,6, What are you gonna do? She wanted to see churches.,5
22221,Penny,6," Hey, they have wine here, don‰Ûªt they?",5
22222,Raj (pointing at a crucifixion statue),6," Hey, none of our gods have abs like that.",5
22223,Howard,6," Yep, that‰Ûªs the last Jew who did sit-ups. And look where it got him.",5
22224,Mrs Cooper,6," Hey, while we‰Ûªre here, why don‰Ûªt we all do some praying? Let‰Ûªs put a little church in this church.",5
22225,Leonard,6," Oh, I‰Ûªm not sure we should.",5
22226,Mrs Cooper,6," It‰Ûªs easy. I‰Ûªll show you how. Lord, Mary Cooper here. Coming to you from Gomorrah, California. I want to thank you for the blessing that is my little Shelly. I also want to thank you for the continued strength not to coldcock him with my Bible. All right, Penny, your turn.",5
22227,Penny,6," Okay, um, hey, God. What‰Ûªs up? Um, I‰Ûªm good, but, uh, it would be a big help to my family if you could get my brother to stop cooking meth. But no cops. Be cool.",5
22228,Mrs Cooper,6," She also goes a little overboard on the love thy neighbour. Could probably use that chat you had with Mary Magdalene. Leonard, you‰Ûªre up. Wasserman, you‰Ûªre on deck.",5
22229,Leonard,6," Okay. I don‰Ûªt know, it‰Ûªs probably a little late to ask you to make me taller. Oh, um, if you could help out with me and my girlfriend. She‰Ûªs all the way in India. That would be great.",5
22230,Mrs Cooper,6, Hear that? Girl trouble. Turns out we were both wrong on that front. How about you?,5
22231,Howard,6," Oh, me? No. Thanks, I‰Ûªm good. I‰Ûªm really just trying not to burst into flames.",5
22232,Mrs Cooper,6, Rajesh?,5
22233,Howard,6, He says he‰Ûªs having trouble dropping those last five pounds.,5
22234,Mrs Cooper,6," Huh, I might have gone with the talking-to-girls thing.",5
22235,Howard,6," No, you only get one wish.",5
22236,Scene,6, A park bench. Sheldon is sitting. A stranger sits next to him.,5
22237,Sheldon,6," Look at the two of us. Me, a highly regarded physicist. The kind of mind that comes along once, maybe twice in a generation. You, the common man, tired from your labours as a stockbroker, or vacuum cleaner salesman, or bootblack. But deep down inside, apparently we‰Ûªre just two peas in a pod. A regular pea, and the kind of pea that comes along once, maybe twice in a generation. Rain. Another great equalizer. Falling on the head of the brilliant and the unremarkable alike. (The stranger puts up an umbrella) Smarty-pants.",5
22238,Scene,6, The kitchen.,5
22239,Penny,6," Oh, Mrs. Cooper, it smells so good.",5
22240,Mrs Cooper,6," You take notes, darlin‰Ûª. The real way to get a man is with melted cheese and cream of mushroom soup. He‰Ûªll die at 50 but his love will be true.",5
22241,"Sheldon (entering, soaked)",6, I need a tissue.This one got wet.,5
22242,Leonard,6, Here.,5
22243,Sheldon,6," Thank you. Yeah, I‰Ûªve learned something today. You and I, in so many ways, other than intelligence and what counts, we‰Ûªre the same. (Sneezes)",5
22244,Mrs Cooper,6," Sweetheart, are you sick?",5
22245,Sheldon,6," I hope so, because if this is well, life isn‰Ûªt worth living.",5
22246,Mrs Cooper,6," Oh, sugarpie, you are burning up. We‰Ûªve got to get you to bed.",5
22247,Sheldon,6, Okay.,5
22248,Mrs Cooper,6, Don‰Ûªt worry. Mama‰Ûªs here to take care of her baby.,5
22249,Sheldon,6," And just to be clear, only her baby and not these other people.",5
22250,Mrs Cooper,6, Of course.,5
22251,Sheldon,6, Can I have tea with honey and toast with the crust cut off?,5
22252,Mrs Cooper,6, You can have whatever you want.,5
22253,Sheldon,6," Thanks, Mom.You‰Ûªre the best.",5
22254,Scene,6, Sheldon‰Ûªs bedroom.,5
22255,Mrs Cooper,6," Boy, last time I put VapoRub on you, you didn‰Ûªt have hair on your chest.",5
22256,Sheldon,6," I know, it filled in last year. I didn‰Ûªt get to spend a lot of time with you on this visit.",5
22257,Mrs Cooper,6, And whose fault was that?,5
22258,Sheldon,6, Yours.,5
22259,Mrs Cooper,6," Shelly, you‰Ûªre not eight years old any more. We have to have a different relationship.",5
22260,Sheldon,6," No, we don‰Ûªt. The one we have works great.",5
22261,Mrs Cooper,6," Sweetheart, you are a grown man.",5
22262,Sheldon,6," Or maybe I‰Ûªm part of a new species, that lives for hundreds of years, which means I‰Ûªm still basically a toddler.",5
22263,Mrs Cooper,6," Oh, I so should have taken you to Houston.",5
22264,Sheldon,6, Does this mean you‰Ûªre not going to sing Soft Kitty?,5
22265,Mrs Cooper,6," No, I will always sing you Soft Kitty. (Sings) Soft kitty, warm kitty, little ball of fur‰Û_",5
22266,Leonard (at door),6," Mrs. Cooper, were we supposed to take that pie out of the oven?",5
22267,Sheldon,6, Get out!,5
22268,Mrs Cooper,6," Well, that was rude.",5
22269,Sheldon,6," Well, I know, but he means well. Sing.",5
22270,Mrs Cooper,6," Happy kitty, sleepy kitty‰Û_",5
22271,Sheldon,6," What are you trying to pull, Mom? From the top.",5
22272,Mrs Cooper (to God),6," This is what I‰Ûªm talking about. (Sings) Soft kitty, warm kitty, little ball of fur‰Û_",5
22273,Scene,7, Sheldon‰Ûªs office.,5
22274,Sheldon,7," And reverse the spin on the antiproton, and gamma becomes alpha, multiplied by a matrix of negative I comma zero, and there we have it. Conclusive proof that I am absolutely worthless after nine o‰Ûªclock.",5
22275,Ghostly voice,7," Sheldon, Sheldon.",5
22276,Sheldon,7," Hmm. (Looks outside office door. Corridor lamp sparks and goes out. Corridor is bathed in an eerie glow) All right, all right. I see what‰Ûªs going on. A little pre-Halloween hijinkery. A ghostly moan, a rattling of chains, a witch‰Ûªs cackle. The trifecta of haunted house clichÌ©s. Instead of eek, I say yawn.",5
22277,Ghostly voice,7, Sheldon.,5
22278,Sheldon,7," Oh, the walls are dripping blood, which looks nothing like a phenolphthalein indicator exposed to a sodium carbonate solution. (Reading message on wall) See you in hell Sheldon. The most frightening thing about that is the missing comma. (A luminous skeleton rushes towards him) Ah. Okay, all right. That one was clever. Skeleton with phosphorous on a zip line. Come on out, merry pranksters. Take a bow.",5
22279,Raj,7, You should‰Ûªve seen your face.,5
22280,Sheldon,7," Yes, there‰Ûªs nothing quite like the slightly widened eyes of mildly startled.",5
22281,Howard,7," Come on, admit it. We got you, Sheldon.",5
22282,Sheldon,7," Please, fright depends on an element of surprise. The simple fact is, because I am much smarter than you, and able to anticipate your actions, it is highly unlikely that you two rubes could ever surprise me. (Leonard creeps out behind him wearing a Star Trek Balok mask)",5
22283,Raj,7, He‰Ûªs probably right.,5
22284,Howard,7, We can‰Ûªt beat him. He‰Ûªs just too smart.,5
22285,Sheldon,7, Gentlemen. (Turns and sees Leonard. Screams and faints).,5
22286,Howard,7, Who had money on faints?,5
22287,Raj,7, I had pee his pants.,5
22288,Leonard,7, Hang on. Looks like everyone‰Ûªs a winner.,5
22289,Scene,7, The comic book store.,5
22290,Leonard,7," Oh. Watch out, Sheldon. This little boy Casper is a g-g-g-ghost!",5
22291,Sheldon,7, Droll.,5
22292,Howard,7,Not as droll as a grown man passed out in a puddle of his own urine.,5
22293,Leonard,7, That was pretty droll. With a hint of ammonia.,5
22294,Sheldon,7," Yes, enjoy your japes, gentlemen. You think you‰Ûªve poked fun at a milquetoast academic. Well, you‰Ûªve forgotten one thing. I am also a son of the Lone Star state. I‰Ûªm Texas through and through. And we know how to settle scores down there. If you doubt me, ask Mexico.",5
22295,Stuart,7," Hot girl, nine o‰Ûªclock. Don‰Ûªt everybody look at once!",5
22296,Raj,7, What is she doing in a comic book store?,5
22297,Stuart,7," I don‰Ûªt know, she might be lost. Doesn‰Ûªt matter. Watch and learn. Hi.",5
22298,Hot girl,7, Hi.,5
22299,Stuart,7, Um‰Û_ it-it-it‰Û_ (returns to guys) Shut up.,5
22300,Hot girl (to Leonard),7, Are you getting this Next Men?,5
22301,Leonard,7," Uh, yeah. It‰Ûªs issue number 21. First appearance of Hellboy.",5
22302,Hot girl,7, I know. I‰Ûªve been looking for it for years.,5
22303,Leonard,7, Sorry.,5
22304,Hot girl,7," Hey, if I pretended to hit on you, could I distract you enough to sneak it away?",5
22305,Leonard,7," Yes, but you‰Ûªd be using your superpowers for evil.",5
22306,Hot girl,7," Damn, I‰Ûªm forbidden by my Kryptonian father to do so. I am Alice.",5
22307,Leonard,7, Leonard.,5
22308,Alice,7," You are very cute, Leonard.",5
22309,Leonard,7," Thanks. You, too. You know, go ahead and take it.",5
22310,Alice,7," No, no. No, no, I, I, I did evil. Would you be open to a trade?",5
22311,Leonard,7," Uh, yeah, yeah, sure, I guess.",5
22312,Alice,7," Okay. Here. This is my number, call me.",5
22313,Leonard,7," Sorry, palm‰Ûªs a little sweaty. What‰Ûªs that word?",5
22314,Alice,7, Alice.,5
22315,Leonard,7," Oh, right, your name. That makes more sense than penis.",5
22316,Alice,7, Later.,5
22317,Howard,7, Did we just see you pick up a girl in a comic book store?,5
22318,Stuart,7," ‰Û÷Cause if you did, you get your picture up there on the Wall of Heroes.",5
22319,Leonard,7," No, I don‰Ûªt think I picked her up. Besides, I have a girlfriend.",5
22320,Stuart,7," Doesn‰Ûªt matter. This is the closest anyone‰Ûªs ever come. You‰Ûªre going on the wall, my friend.",5
22321,Scene,7, Entering the apartment building.,5
22322,Sheldon,7, Be sure to check the mail.,5
22323,Leonard,7, How many times are you gonna tell me? What‰Ûªs with you?,5
22324,Sheldon,7, Nothing. It‰Ûªs not suspicious that I‰Ûªm fixating. It‰Ûªs consistent with my personality.,5
22325,Leonard,7, Right.,5
22326,Penny,7," Hey, guys.",5
22327,Leonard,7, More Halloween candy? Didn‰Ûªt you just buy a bunch of it yesterday?,5
22328,Penny,7, Oh. Yeah. That‰Ûªs gone. It‰Ûªs a rough month when Halloween and PMS hit at the same time.,5
22329,Sheldon,7," Leonard doesn‰Ûªt have time to chat, he has to get the mail.",5
22330,Leonard,7," Will you relax? I‰Ûªll get it in a minute. Hey, how was work?",5
22331,Sheldon,7, Open the mail!,5
22332,Leonard,7," Excuse me. (Sheldon holds fingers in ears) A couple of circulars, nothing important.",5
22333,Penny,7, What‰Ûªs with him?,5
22334,Leonard,7," Hang on. (Sheldon opens mail box. A loud horn blows and a balloon with Leonard‰Ûªs face on pops out. Sheldon faints again.) You might be from Texas, but I‰Ûªm from New Jersey.",5
22335,Scene,7, The apartment. Leonard is with Alice.,5
22336,Leonard,7, Check it out. Jim Lee drew this of me two years ago at Comic Con.,5
22337,Alice,7, What are you wearing?,5
22338,Leonard,7," Well, you know, it‰Ûªs Comic Con. I‰Ûªm Lion-O from ThunderCats.",5
22339,Alice,7," Wow, you must have gotten so laid.",5
22340,Leonard,7, No. But Jessica Alba did rub my furry belly.,5
22341,Alice,7, Want to see a comic I draw?,5
22342,Leonard,7, You‰Ûªre kidding. You have your own book?,5
22343,Alice,7, Yeah. It‰Ûªs kinda based on my life.,5
22344,Leonard,7," Cool. Oh, look. That‰Ûªs you having sex with a guy in the top half of a Chewbacca costume. Comic Con?",5
22345,Alice,7," You‰Ûªd think, but no.",5
22346,Leonard,7, You‰Ûªre very talented. This is really good. Did you do‰Û_ (she kisses him.),5
22347,Alice,7," So, can I trade you my comic for the Hellboy?",5
22348,Leonard,7, You can have my car.,5
22349,Scene,7, Sheldon‰Ûªs office.,5
22350,Sheldon (creeps into office carrying a box),7," Oh, dear. (Reaches into box, picks up a snake) Oh, dear. (Puts snake into Raj‰Ûªs top drawer) Oh, dear, oh, dear. Oh, dear, oh, dear. Oh, dear. Oh, dear. Purell, Purell, Purell, Purell.",5
22351,Raj (entering),7," Good morning, Sheldon.",5
22352,Sheldon,7," It is, isn‰Ûªt it? Oh, bother. Isn‰Ûªt that just always the way? You go to staple something, and you‰Ûªre out of staples. Gosh, I wish I‰Ûªd known that earlier today when I was at Staples.",5
22353,Raj,7, You have a thing of paper clips right there.,5
22354,Sheldon,7," well, no, no, I need something more permanent to join these papers. Say, don‰Ûªt you keep staples in your top desk drawer?",5
22355,Raj,7, I don‰Ûªt know. Maybe.,5
22356,Sheldon,7, Be a lamb and check.,5
22357,Raj,7, All right. (Opening drawer) Who do we have here?,5
22358,Sheldon,7, It‰Ûªs a snake. A terrifying snake.,5
22359,Raj,7," Oh, did some bad man put us in a drawer?",5
22360,Sheldon,7, Stop talking like that. You‰Ûªve been rendered speechless by fear.,5
22361,Raj,7, Let‰Ûªs go to the biology lab and find you some nice yummy mice.,5
22362,Sheldon,7," I tried to scare an Indian with a snake. Come on, Cooper. You‰Ûªre better than this.",5
22363,Scene,7, Penny‰Ûªs apartment. There is a knock.,5
22364,Penny,7, It‰Ûªs open.,5
22365,Leonard,7," Hey, you got a minute?",5
22366,Penny,7," Yeah, sure, come on in.",5
22367,Leonard,7, Thanks.,5
22368,Penny,7, Want some mac and cheese?,5
22369,Leonard,7, No. Lactose. Gas.,5
22370,Penny,7, Glass of wine?,5
22371,Leonard,7, No. Sulfites. Migraines.,5
22372,Penny,7," Okay, well, I‰Ûªd offer you Halloween candy, but that‰Ûªs gone. So, what‰Ûªs up?",5
22373,Leonard,7," Okay, we used to go out, right?",5
22374,Penny,7," Oh, my God, that‰Ûªs where I know you from.",5
22375,Leonard,7," I‰Ûªm dealing with a situation and it‰Ûªs kind of about my love life, so I know that might be weird for us to talk about, but in this area, as you know, all my other friends are just so stupid.",5
22376,Penny,7," All right, what‰Ûªs going on?",5
22377,Leonard,7," So, you‰Ûªre okay talking about this?",5
22378,Penny,7, Yes.,5
22379,Leonard,7, You‰Ûªre sure it‰Ûªs not weird.,5
22380,Penny,7, It‰Ûªs okay.,5
22381,Leonard,7," You know what, if you ever want to talk to me about a problem in your life with a guy, then I would be fine with that.",5
22382,Penny,7," Okay, good, because there‰Ûªs this one guy I used to date who‰Ûªs about to be force-fed wine and cheese if he doesn‰Ûªt get to the point.",5
22383,Leonard,7," Okay, uh, here it is. Is it cheating if a guy has a girlfriend‰Û_",5
22384,Penny,7," Yeah, probably.",5
22385,Leonard,7, Come on.,5
22386,Penny,7," I‰Ûªm sorry, go ahead.",5
22387,Leonard,7," I met this girl, and she‰Ûªs great. We have a lot in common.",5
22388,Penny,7, Did you guys do it?,5
22389,Leonard,7, No. We just made out a little.,5
22390,Penny,7," Oh, look at you, you bad boy. Did you tell her about Priya?",5
22391,Leonard,7," Well, I was gonna, but there were too many tongues in my mouth.",5
22392,Penny,7, That‰Ûªs gross.,5
22393,Leonard,7," Here‰Ûªs the thing, I, I‰Ûªm not one of those guys who sneaks around and sleeps with more than one woman.",5
22394,Penny,7," Well, good for you.",5
22395,Leonard,7," The problem is, I want to be one of those guys.",5
22396,Penny,7, So sleep with the new girl and lie to Priya.,5
22397,Leonard,7," Oh, that‰Ûªs not who I am.",5
22398,Penny,7," All right, then break it off with the new girl.",5
22399,Leonard,7," Now, let‰Ûªs not do anything rash. She‰Ûªs really hot.",5
22400,Penny,7," If you like this girl so much, why don‰Ûªt you just end things with Priya?",5
22401,Leonard,7, Priya and I are in love. I think we could get married someday.,5
22402,Penny,7," Leonard, you‰Ûªre looking for a way to sleep with both women and have everybody be happy about it.",5
22403,Leonard,7, Now we‰Ûªre getting somewhere.,5
22404,Penny,7, What does your gut tell you?,5
22405,Leonard,7, Go ask Penny; she‰Ûªll know what to do.,5
22406,Scene,7, The apartment. Sheldon is adjusting a device on his arm.,5
22407,Sheldon,7," Hello, Howard. I‰Ûªve realized that you scaring me was all in jest. Allow me to say, job well done. (Grabs his own hand. Electrocutes himself.) Perfect.",5
22408,Leonard,7, What are you doing?,5
22409,Sheldon,7, Science. You wouldn‰Ûªt understand.,5
22410,Leonard,7," Hey, well, see you. I‰Ûªm going out. (Starts to go out. Doesn‰Ûªt.)",5
22411,Sheldon,7, I thought you were leaving the apartment.,5
22412,Leonard,7," Yeah, me, too. I can‰Ûªt make up my mind.",5
22413,Sheldon,7, Are you concerned because the world is filled with big dogs and bullies?,5
22414,Leonard,7, No. I‰Ûªm having a moral crisis.,5
22415,Sheldon,7," Well, if it‰Ûªs of any help, I‰Ûªve read all the great moral philosophers, including Dr. Seuss.",5
22416,Leonard,7," Oh, what the hell. I‰Ûªm supposed to go see that girl from the comic book store, Alice, but I don‰Ûªt know if I should, because I‰Ûªm going out with Priya, but she‰Ûªs in India.",5
22417,Sheldon,7," All right. So the topic at hand is sexual fidelity. Probably won‰Ûªt be relying on Seuss here. Although One Fish, Two Fish, Red Fish, Blue Fish might be surprisingly applicable. Go on.",5
22418,Leonard,7," Well, they say at the end of your life, you regret the stuff you didn‰Ûªt do more than the stuff that you did, and I‰Ûªm pretty sure Alice is the stuff I want to do.",5
22419,Sheldon,7," You know, the German philosopher, Friedrich Nietzsche, believed that morality is just a fiction used by the herd of inferior human beings to hold back the few superior men.",5
22420,Leonard,7, That actually does help.,5
22421,Sheldon,7, It‰Ûªs worth noting that he died of syphilis.,5
22422,Leonard,7," Screw it, I‰Ûªm going.",5
22423,Sheldon,7," On your way home, will you pick up some orange juice?",5
22424,Leonard,7, Do you mind? I‰Ûªm questioning a lot of things in my life right now.,5
22425,Sheldon,7, Is one of those things your fondness for orange juice?,5
22426,Leonard,7, No.,5
22427,Sheldon,7," Great. Tropicana, no pulp.",5
22428,Scene,7, Howard‰Ûªs house. Sheldon rings the doorbell.,5
22429,Howard,7," Hey, Sheldon.",5
22430,Bernadette (off),7, Who is it?,5
22431,Sheldon,7," It‰Ûªs me, Sheldon, Mrs. Wolowitz.",5
22432,Howard,7," That‰Ûªs not my mom, it‰Ûªs Bernadette.",5
22433,Sheldon,7, Really? That‰Ûªs very unsettling.,5
22434,Bernadette,7," Hi, Sheldon.",5
22435,Sheldon,7, Hi.,5
22436,Howard,7, What‰Ûªs up?,5
22437,Sheldon,7," It just occurred to me that I never formally congratulated you on your pending nuptials. So I hopped on the first bus and hightailed it down here to shake your hand. Put ‰Û÷er there, you old so-and-so.",5
22438,Howard,7," Well, I, I‰Ûªm gonna see you at work in 12 hours, don‰Ûªt you think it could have waited until then?",5
22439,Sheldon,7," Holy smoke, why didn‰Ûªt I think of that? You‰Ûªre a better man than I, Howard Wolowitz. You put ‰Û÷er there, you son of a gun!",5
22440,Howard,7, Whatever. (Takes his hand. Starts to be electrocuted) My‰Û_ oh‰Û_ it‰Ûªs‰Û_ (Clutches heart and collapses),5
22441,Bernadette,7," Oh, my God, Howard! What did you do?",5
22442,Sheldon,7, It was a harmless Halloween prank. Look.,5
22443,Bernadette,7, Howard has a heart condition! You know that!,5
22444,Sheldon,7," Well, I thought he made that up. Isn‰Ûªt hypochondria a common idiosyncrasy of Jewish people?",5
22445,Bernadette,7," This is adrenaline, we‰Ûªre gonna have to inject it into his heart.",5
22446,Sheldon,7, We are?,5
22447,Bernadette,7," You are. I‰Ûªm not strong enough to get it through his chest plate, and we‰Ûªve only got one shot.",5
22448,Sheldon,7," Oh, no! I can‰Ûªt!",5
22449,Bernadette,7, Hurry! We‰Ûªre running out of time!,5
22450,Sheldon,7, Okay.,5
22451,Bernadette,7, Just do it!,5
22452,Sheldon,7," Oh, God! One, two, three!",5
22453,Howard,7," Trick or treat, bubbeleh.",5
22454,Sheldon,7," What? No. You mean this was all a ruse? Oh, how could I be so stu‰Û_ (puts hand to forehead. Electrocutes himself).",5
22455,Scene,7, Alice‰Ûªs apartment. Alice and Leonard are kissing.,5
22456,Leonard,7," Damn it, I can‰Ûªt. I can‰Ûªt, I can‰Ûªt do this.",5
22457,Alice,7," Uh, is it my tongue stud? ‰Û÷Cause if that freaks you out, you‰Ûªre in for a real surprise later on.",5
22458,Leonard,7," No, no, no. I, I can‰Ûªt do this. Believe me, I really want to.",5
22459,Alice,7, But?,5
22460,Leonard,7, But I kind of have a girlfriend.,5
22461,Alice,7, Are you kidding?,5
22462,Leonard,7," You‰Ûªre cool with you and me just being friends, right?",5
22463,Alice,7, I don‰Ûªt believe this.,5
22464,Leonard,7," Wait, I don‰Ûªt, which part?",5
22465,Alice,7," I‰Ûªm so stupid. I thought for once I‰Ûªd met a good guy, but you‰Ûªre just another jackass.",5
22466,Leonard,7," Oh, no, no, you have it wrong. No. I, I was going to be a jackass, but I stopped myself. I stayed a good guy, so, I‰Ûªm gonna pass on the sex. But you should know, that‰Ûªs not a comment on your hotness but on my goodness. That‰Ûªs kind of my superpower. I‰Ûªm, like, Captain Good Guy.",5
22467,Scene,7, Leonard being ejected into the corridor.,5
22468,Leonard,7, It‰Ûªs okay. Did the right thing. You idiot!,5
22469,Scene,7, The apartment. Leonard is on skype.,5
22470,Leonard,7," Hey, Priya.",5
22471,Priya,7," Hey, sweetheart. How‰Ûªs it going?",5
22472,Leonard,7," Uh, not so good. We have to talk.",5
22473,Priya,7," Oh, sounds serious. What‰Ûªs up?",5
22474,Leonard,7," Okay, uh, here it is. I met this girl and I kissed her, and I feel terrible about it. But it‰Ûªs done, it‰Ûªs never gonna happen again. And I am so, so sorry.",5
22475,Priya,7," Leonard, relax. It‰Ûªs okay.",5
22476,Leonard,7, It is?,5
22477,Priya,7," Yeah, these things happen. They happen to everybody.",5
22478,Leonard,7," Oh, my God, you are amazing. I mean, I don‰Ûªt deserve you. Wh, what do, what do you mean everybody?",5
22479,Priya,7," Leonard, I didn‰Ûªt know if I should tell you, but I kind of cheated on you, too.",5
22480,Leonard,7," Uh, kind of?",5
22481,Priya,7," A couple of weeks ago, I slept with my ex-boyfriend. So, I guess we both messed up a little.",5
22482,Leonard,7," No, no, I messed up a little. You messed up a lot.",5
22483,Priya,7," Well, it‰Ûªs not a competition.",5
22484,Leonard,7," Oh yeah, it is, and you won. I, I, I‰Ûªm, I‰Ûªm sorry, I have to go. I don‰Ûªt believe this.",5
22485,Sheldon (leaping out of the base of the sofa),7," Bazinga, punk. Now we‰Ûªre even.",5
22486,Scene,8, The apartment.,5
22487,Penny,8," So, Bernadette, how goes the hunt for bridesmaid dresses?",5
22488,Bernadette,8," Well, if you don‰Ûªt mind looking like an orange traffic cone, great.",5
22489,Amy,8," Girlfriends, I have the answer to our dress problems.",5
22490,Bernadette,8, Really?,5
22491,Amy,8," Twelve years ago, my cousin Irene and her entire family died in a horrific carbon monoxide accident the night before her wedding.",5
22492,Bernadette,8, That‰Ûªs horrible.,5
22493,Amy,8," Yes and no. All those bridesmaids dresses remain unused and available to us for free. So it seems that cloud of odourless deadly gas had a silver lining after all. Check it out, still in the bags. The gowns, not the bridesmaids.",5
22494,Bernadette,8, I don‰Ûªt know. Dead people‰Ûªs dresses?,5
22495,Penny,8," Yeah, and cap sleeves? U-u-uh.",5
22496,Amy,8," Uh, I was hoping you wouldn‰Ûªt notice. Irene was always a slave to a good bargain when it came to clothes, and sadly as it turned out, space heaters.",5
22497,Sheldon,8," Ladies, please. These four walls once housed an intellectual salon where the mind received nourishment as well as the stomach. But through no one‰Ûªs fault, Penny, the quality of dinner conversation in this apartment has declined. And again, I‰Ûªm looking at no one in particular, Penny.",5
22498,Leonard,8," Fine. What would you like to talk about, Sheldon?",5
22499,Howard,8," What would you like to talk about, Sheldon? Why do you hate us?",5
22500,Sheldon,8, I‰Ûªve prepared a number of topics that should appeal to both the advanced and novice conversationalists.,5
22501,Penny,8," Okay, that time you looked at me.",5
22502,Amy,8, Who didn‰Ûªt? Your skin is like alabaster. Do you even have pores?,5
22503,Sheldon,8," Topic one. Faster-than-light particles at CERN, paradigm-shifting discovery or another Swiss export as full of holes as their cheese? And converse.",5
22504,Penny,8," All right, who wants to go to my apartment and look at bridal magazines?",5
22505,Bernadette,8," Oh, me.",5
22506,Penny,8," Through no one‰Ûªs fault, Sheldon, we‰Ûªre leaving.",5
22507,Amy,8, Wait for moi.,5
22508,Sheldon,8, You‰Ûªre leaving?,5
22509,Amy,8," Sheldon, sometimes you forget, I‰Ûªm a lady. And with that comes an oestrogen fuelled need to page through thick glossy magazines that make me hate my body.",5
22510,Sheldon,8," Ah. New topic. Women, delightfully mysterious or bat-crap crazy?",5
22511,Raj,8," Totally. What‰Ûªs wrong with cap sleeves? If you have the right figure for it, they‰Ûªre adorable.",5
22512,Scene,8, The cafeteria.,5
22513,Leonard,8," Hey, Amy, what brings you to our neck of the woods?",5
22514,Amy,8, Your neurology department loaned me a culture of prions for my research on bovine spongiform encephalopathy.,5
22515,Sheldon,8, She popped by to borrow a cup of mad cow disease.,5
22516,Amy,8," It‰Ûªs hard to make degenerative brain maladies hilarious, and yet somehow you do it.",5
22517,Howard,8, That‰Ûªs fun to have in a lunchroom.,5
22518,Amy,8," The real fun starts when you get to pick the rat you‰Ûªre going to feed it to, and maybe you choose the beady-eyed little mother who‰Ûªs been biting you all week.",5
22519,Howard,8," Please, we‰Ûªre eating. Can we get that off the table and change the subject?",5
22520,Sheldon,8, Can we? Stand back while I turn this conversation into a conver-sensation.,5
22521,Leonard,8," This time, it‰Ûªs your fault.",5
22522,Sheldon,8," I have 100 alphabetized topics from artichoke, come on, people, it‰Ûªs just a giant thistle, to zzz, the onamona-poetry of sleep.",5
22523,Leonard,8," Amy, how long would it take for that mad cow disease to kill me?",5
22524,Amy,8," I don‰Ûªt know, four or five years.",5
22525,Leonard,8," No, it‰Ûªs not gonna do it.",5
22526,Howard,8, Oy. Bernadette keeps texting me pictures of Penny in bridesmaid dresses.,5
22527,Amy,8, They‰Ûªre out shopping right now?,5
22528,Howard,8, Yeah.,5
22529,Amy,8, Just the two of them?,5
22530,Howard,8, I guess.,5
22531,Amy,8," That‰Ûªs cool, that‰Ûªs cool.",5
22532,Howard,8, Why are they asking me about this stuff? What guy knows what a sweetheart neckline is? (Raj raises his hand),5
22533,Scene,8, The apartment. Leonard is horseracing on a Kinnect game.,5
22534,Leonard,8," Leonard‰Ûªs coming down the home stretch! Come on, horsey, you can do this! Damn. Come on, thigh muscles, you can do this! Yes! First place. I would have been a great jockey if I weren‰Ûªt too tall. And scared of horses. Sheldon, you‰Ûªre up.",5
22535,Sheldon,8, What?,5
22536,Leonard,8," Come on, it‰Ûªs your turn. We said we‰Ûªd get more fresh air.",5
22537,Sheldon,8," Sorry. I‰Ûªm a little distracted. I can‰Ûªt seem to get in touch with Amy. I tried e-mail, video chat, tweeting her, posting on her Facebook wall, texting her, nothing.",5
22538,Leonard,8, Did you try calling her on the telephone?,5
22539,Sheldon,8," The telephone. You know, Leonard, in your own simple way, you may be the wisest of us all. Voice mail. Curiouser and curiouser.",5
22540,Leonard,8," If you‰Ûªre worried, we can go over there and see if she‰Ûªs all right.",5
22541,Sheldon,8," Okay. You know, I heard in the news a bobcat has been spotted in her neighbourhood.",5
22542,Leonard,8, I don‰Ûªt think Amy was eaten by a bobcat.,5
22543,Sheldon,8, Who thinks Amy was eaten by a bobcat?,5
22544,Leonard,8, You do?,5
22545,Sheldon,8," Leonard, I was just mentioning an interesting local news item. Now, thanks to you, I‰Ûªm worried Amy‰Ûªs been eaten by a bobcat.",5
22546,Leonard,8, Forget about the bobcat.,5
22547,Sheldon,8, How can I? You won‰Ûªt stop talking about it.,5
22548,Scene,8, Amy‰Ûªs apartment. Amy is playing the harp.,5
22549,Amy (singing),8," Everybody hurts, sometimes everybody cries. Everybody hurts, sometimes.",5
22550,Sheldon (outside),8, She sounds weepy. I don‰Ûªt like weepy. Let‰Ûªs go.,5
22551,Leonard,8," Uh, she‰Ûªs your friend. Step up.",5
22552,Leonard,8," (Knock, knock, knock) Amy. (Knock, knock, knock) Amy. (Knock, knock, knock) Amy. Bye.",5
22553,Sheldon,8, Where are you going?,5
22554,Leonard,8," I‰Ûªm single, I don‰Ûªt need this crap.",5
22555,Amy,8," Sheldon, what are you doing here?",5
22556,Sheldon,8, You didn‰Ûªt respond to any of my electronic communications.,5
22557,Amy,8, I wanted to be alone.,5
22558,Sheldon,8, Would you like to talk about it? And keep in mind that no is a perfectly viable answer.,5
22559,Amy,8," Sheldon, my world is crumbling around me.",5
22560,Sheldon,8," Point of order. As you‰Ûªre in distress, it would be customary for me to offer you a hot beverage. But I‰Ûªm a guest in your home, so it would be customary for you to offer me a beverage. How do you want to proceed vis-a-vis beverages?",5
22561,Amy,8, It doesn‰Ûªt matter. Nothing matters.,5
22562,Sheldon,8," If you‰Ûªd like to take your mind off what‰Ûªs troubling you, uh, word on the street is a bobcat has been spotted.",5
22563,Amy,8, Penny and Bernadette went shopping for bridesmaids dresses without me.,5
22564,Sheldon,8, And that made you feel sad?,5
22565,Amy,8, Yes.,5
22566,Sheldon,8," I knew it. Just keep going, I guess I‰Ûªm good at this.",5
22567,Amy,8," It‰Ûªs just, I thought they liked hanging out with me, but I guess I was fooling myself.",5
22568,Sheldon,8," When they were over here, did you fail to offer them a beverage? ‰Û÷Cause I can see how that could stick in someone‰Ûªs craw.",5
22569,Amy,8," Sheldon, I‰Ûªm going to ask you something, and I‰Ûªd like you to keep an open mind.",5
22570,Sheldon,8, Always.,5
22571,Amy,8," At this moment, I find myself craving human intimacy and physical contact.",5
22572,Sheldon,8," Oh, boy. You know ours is a relationship of the mind.",5
22573,Amy,8, Proposal. One wild night of torrid lovemaking that soothes my soul and inflames my loins.,5
22574,Sheldon,8," Counterproposal. I will gently stroke your head and repeat, aw, who‰Ûªs a good Amy.",5
22575,Amy,8," How about this? French kissing, seven minutes in heaven culminating in second base.",5
22576,Sheldon,8," Neck massage, then you get me that beverage.",5
22577,Amy,8, We cuddle. Final offer.,5
22578,Sheldon,8," Very well. Oh, boy. (They cuddle, awkwardly.)",5
22579,Amy,8," I‰Ûªm just saying, second base is right there.",5
22580,Scene,8, The cafeteria.,5
22581,Raj,8," Mm, I‰Ûªm thinking about adopting some quirky affectation, like a pipe or a monocle or a handlebar moustache.",5
22582,Leonard,8, For all those girls out there looking for the Indian Monopoly man?,5
22583,Raj,8, This is not a safe place. You can‰Ûªt share anything here.,5
22584,Sheldon,8, The two of you need to get your women in line!,5
22585,Howard,8, What?,5
22586,Sheldon,8," Last night I was strong-armed into an evening of harp music and spooning with an emotional Amy Farrah Fowler. This on a night that I had originally designated for solving the space-time geometry in higher-spin gravity and building my Lego Death Star. And why? Your gal pals, Penny and Bernadette, went out shopping for some wedding nonsense without Amy, an action they took with no thought or regard as to how it would affect me, the future of string theory or my Lego fun time.",5
22587,Howard,8, What do you want us to do about it?,5
22588,Sheldon,8," You clearly weren‰Ûªt listening to my topic sentence, get your women in line! You make them apologize to Amy and set things right. I am a man of science, not someone‰Ûªs snuggle bunny!",5
22589,Leonard,8, Why do I have to talk to Penny? She‰Ûªs not my girlfriend.,5
22590,Sheldon,8," You invited her to lunch four years ago. Everything about her is on you, you make it so!",5
22591,Scene,8, The apartment.,5
22592,Leonard,8, Moo-shu is Penny.,5
22593,Penny,8, Thank you. Where‰Ûªs Sheldon?,5
22594,Leonard,8," Oh, he was up late last night, so I gave him an early dinner and put him to bed.",5
22595,Bernadette,8, That‰Ûªs so sweet.,5
22596,Leonard,8," Yeah, but now he‰Ûªs gonna be up at dawn and want to play.",5
22597,Howard,8," So, listen, guys, the reason he was up late is because he was taking care of Amy. She‰Ûªs kind of upset.",5
22598,Penny,8, Why?,5
22599,Leonard,8, Her feelings got hurt because you guys went dress shopping without her.,5
22600,Bernadette,8, I told you that would happen.,5
22601,Penny,8," Okay, look, this is her first time being a bridesmaid and she‰Ûªs just getting a little crazy with it.",5
22602,Bernadette,8," She keeps on telling us stories about bridesmaid traditions in other cultures, and they‰Ûªre all about getting naked and washing each other.",5
22603,Penny,8," Yeah, and she keeps trying to figure out if our cycles have synced up so we can call ourselves the Three Menstra-teers",5
22604,Bernadette,8, We thought it would be easier to look at dresses one time without her. I feel terrible.,5
22605,Penny,8," I know. Me, too. We‰Ûªll talk to her. Hey, wait, how did she find out?",5
22606,Howard,8," Raj did it. And he says he would do it again. Okay, I‰Ûªm sorry. You sent me the picture, I wasn‰Ûªt thinking.",5
22607,Bernadette,8," Oh, Howie.",5
22608,Howard,8," Well, hey, I‰Ûªm usually pretty good at not blabbing. You tell me tons of stuff about these guys, and I never repeat it.",5
22609,Penny,8, What do you tell him?,5
22610,Bernadette,8," Oh, you know, just pillow talk. You guys have nothing to worry about.",5
22611,Leonard,8," Hold on, did you talk about us when we were dating?",5
22612,Penny,8, No. All your little secrets are fine.,5
22613,Bernadette,8," Yes, absolutely fine.",5
22614,Howard (after Raj whispers to him),8, I‰Ûªll tell you later.,5
22615,Scene,8, Amy‰Ûªs lab. Amy is dissecting a brain.,5
22616,Amy,8," Come on, tumour. Come on, tumour, Mama needs an aggressive little glioblastoma. Yay, brain tumour! Probably not the same reaction you had when you got the news.",5
22617,Penny,8, Hi.,5
22618,Bernadette,8, Hello.,5
22619,Amy,8, What are you doing here?,5
22620,Penny,8," Well, look, we just wanted to apologize for not bringing you with us the other day.",5
22621,Amy,8," That‰Ûªs not necessary, it‰Ûªs like Sesame Street says, one of these things is not like the other, one of these things should die alone.",5
22622,Penny,8," Look, come on, Amy, look, let us make it up to you. We‰Ûªll have a girl‰Ûªs night, we‰Ûªll do whatever you want.",5
22623,Bernadette,8, We can go down to the Korean baths and do that thing you were talking about where we wash each other.,5
22624,Penny,8," With-with loofah mitts, no hands.",5
22625,Amy,8, It‰Ûªs okay. I‰Ûªm glad this happened. I can stop pretending that some beautiful girl and her cute-in-,5
22626,Bernadette,8," Amy, we‰Ûªre really sorry.",5
22627,Penny,8," Yeah, we feel awful.",5
22628,Amy,8," Don‰Ûªt. I‰Ûªll be okay. You‰Ûªre not the first girls I thought were friends with me who ended up shunning me. It‰Ûªs like elementary school, junior high, high school, undergrad, grad school, and that semester abroad in Norway all over again.",5
22629,Penny,8," Oh, come on, Amy.",5
22630,Amy,8, You don‰Ûªt get it. Look at this brain.,5
22631,Penny,8, I don‰Ûªt really want to.,5
22632,Amy,8," This is us. Bernadette, you are the analytical, scientific left hemisphere. Penny, you‰Ûªre the creative, spontaneous right hemisphere. And where‰Ûªs Amy? She‰Ûªs right here, the sad little tumour no one wants to go dress shopping with.",5
22633,Bernadette,8," Amy, you‰Ûªre not a tumour. Penny, tell her she‰Ûªs not a tumour. (Penny is vomiting in the dustbin). ",5
22634,Scene,8," The apartment, Sheldon is building his Lego Death Star. Phone rings.",5
22635,Sheldon,8," Did you know that when Alexander Graham Bell invented the telephone, he proposed answering it with ahoy? Ahoy. I like it. Amy? Is that you? Have you been drinking? I‰Ûªm sorry, I bet my sweet what? Well, all right. We‰Ûªre on our way.",5
22636,Leonard,8, What‰Ûªs going on?,5
22637,Sheldon,8, It would seem Amy is drunk in a liquor store parking lot.,5
22638,Leonard,8, Really? Amy?,5
22639,Sheldon,8," Leonard, be glad you can‰Ûªt keep a woman. They are a handful.",5
22640,Scene,8, A liquor store parking lot.,5
22641,Amy,8," Oh, look. It‰Ûªs Sheldon and little Leonard. Hi, little Leonard.",5
22642,Leonard,8," Hi, Amy.",5
22643,Amy,8," Hey, Cuddles.",5
22644,Leonard,8, Cuddles?,5
22645,Sheldon,8," Yes, Cuddles. We cuddled. Grow up, Leonard.",5
22646,Leonard,8," Amy, what are you doing here?",5
22647,Amy,8," Well, I came here to get a bottle of wine like Penny taught me to do when you‰Ûªre sad.",5
22648,Leonard,8," Yeah, but why didn‰Ûªt you go back to your apartment?",5
22649,Amy,8," Didn‰Ûªt you go to high school, Leonard? Parking lots are where all the cool kids hang out. Not that the rat bastards ever invited me.",5
22650,Leonard,8, Maybe we should get you home.,5
22651,Amy,8," Oh, hang on, hang on, hang on. Sheldon, what would it take for you to go into that liquor store, buy a bottle of hooch, take me across the street to that motel, and have your way with me?",5
22652,Leonard,8," Yeah, Sheldon, what would it take?",5
22653,Sheldon,8," I‰Ûªm begging both of you, please, let‰Ûªs go.",5
22654,Leonard,8, Okay. Come on. Upsy-daisy.,5
22655,Amy,8," Whee! Ooh, finally someone found second base.",5
22656,Scene,8, Amy‰Ûªs lab. She is dissecting a brain.,5
22657,Amy,8," I know how you feel. I got a knife slicing through my frontal lobe, too.",5
22658,Penny,8, Hi.,5
22659,Amy,8, What do you want? Do you want me to give the friendship bracelet back?,5
22660,Penny,8, I never gave you a friendship bracelet.,5
22661,Amy,8," When we first met, I made one and pretended you gave it to me. You can have it back if you want.",5
22662,Penny,8," No, you made that for you, I want you to have it.",5
22663,Bernadette,8," We know you‰Ûªre upset, and you have every right to be, but if it‰Ûªs okay with you, we‰Ûªd like a second chance to make things right.",5
22664,Penny,8," We are really sorry, and we were trying to think of some way to show you how much we care about you.",5
22665,Bernadette,8, Which is why it would mean so much if you would agree to be the maid of honour at my wedding.,5
22666,Amy,8," What? Wait, is this some kind of practical joke? Like in Norway, when my friends trapped me in a sauna with a horny otter?",5
22667,Bernadette,8," No. I, I want you to be the maid of honour.",5
22668,Amy,8," Oh, my gosh. No one‰Ûªs every asked me to be the maid of honour before. Well, that‰Ûªs not true. Once, but then they all died.",5
22669,Bernadette,8, So is that a yes?,5
22670,Amy,8," Yes. Yes. Oh, my gosh, I, I have so much to do. There‰Ûªs the bridal shower and the bachelorette party. What should we do for the bachelorette party? Oh, I know, we‰Ûªll go to a Native American sweat lodge, we‰Ûªll take peyote, roll around in the mud, and paint fertility symbols on Bernadette‰Ûªs naked body. So that‰Ûªs happening.",5
22671,Penny,8," Yeah, sure, sure. Vegas is fun, too.",5
22672,Amy,8," I feel like crying. Of course, I could just be hormonal. Oh, wait. Maybe our menses are finally syncing up. Bernadette? No? Penny?",5
22673,Penny,8, Sorry.,5
22674,Amy,8, Really?,5
22675,Penny,8," Okay, yeah.",5
22676,Amy,8, Yay!,5
22677,Scene,8, A bridal store.,5
22678,Amy,8," Maid of honour Amy Farrah Fowler‰Ûªs amazing behind-the-scenes wedding video, take one.",5
22679,Bernadette,8," We‰Ûªre just trying on dresses, do we really need to record this?",5
22680,Amy,8," I‰Ûªm sorry, are you the maid of honour?",5
22681,Bernadette,8, I am the bride.,5
22682,Amy,8, So no. And action.,5
22683,Penny (in a red bridesmaid dress),8, What do you think?,5
22684,Bernadette,8, I love it!,5
22685,Amy,8," What are you, a nun? Come on, bestie, let‰Ûªs see some skin.",5
22686,Bernadette,8," Oh, Amy! Looking sexy!",5
22687,Amy,8, You think they don‰Ûªt have mirrors in there? I know how I look.,5
22688,Penny,8," Oh! Bernadette, you look beautiful!",5
22689,Amy,8, You do.,5
22690,Bernadette,8, Thank you.,5
22691,Amy,8," Not Penny beautiful, but beautiful.",5
22692,Amy,8," Come on, bestie, you‰Ûªre up.",5
22693,Penny (off),8, Give me a minute.,5
22694,Amy,8, What is taking you so long? (Opens door. Penny is in her underwear),5
22695,Penny,8," Oh, Amy! Get the hell out of here!",5
22696,Amy,8," ‰ÛÒ Sorry, sorry. (Swings camera away. Then back again)",5
22697,Penny,8," Oh, God. Amy!",5
22698,Amy,8, Sorry.,5
22699, Scene,9, The lobby.,5
22700,Penny,9, Hey.,5
22701,Leonard,9," Oh, hey. You work the lunch shift?",5
22702,Penny,9, Yeah. I‰Ûªve got eight pounds of salmon that‰Ûªs about to go bad. Do you know how to cook it?,5
22703,Leonard,9, Not really.,5
22704,Penny,9, Damn it. Should have liberated the iffy chicken. What are you and Professor Fussyface up to tonight?,5
22705,Leonard,9, Star Wars on Blu-ray.,5
22706,Penny,9," Haven‰Ûªt you seen that movie, like, a thousand times?",5
22707,Leonard,9, Not on Blu-ray. Only twice on Blu-ray.,5
22708,Penny,9," Oh, Leonard.",5
22709,Leonard,9," I know, it‰Ûªs high-resolution sadness.",5
22710,Penny,9," Well, I‰Ûªm going to take myself out to a movie tonight. You want to go?",5
22711,Leonard,9, Really? Do we do that?,5
22712,Penny,9, What do you mean?,5
22713,Leonard,9," You know, we haven‰Ûªt spent time alone together since we broke up.",5
22714,Penny,9," Oh, it‰Ûªs not a date, Leonard. It‰Ûªs just a man and a woman hanging out, and not having sex at the end of the night.",5
22715,Leonard,9, Sounds like most of my dates.,5
22716,"Sheldon (off, voice heard through apartment door as they approach)",9," Oh, dear Lord, get away from me, you monster!",5
22717,Penny,9, What is that about?,5
22718,Leonard,9," Well, he‰Ûªs smart and crazy enough, he may have actually created a monster. (They enter. Sheldon is by the window.)",5
22719,Sheldon,9," Shoo, shoo! Be gone!",5
22720,Leonard,9, What the hell is going on?,5
22721,Sheldon,9," There‰Ûªs a bird outside the window, and he won‰Ûªt go away. That is the hell that is going on. We have no worms or seeds here. Shoo, shoo.",5
22722,Penny,9," Really? On top of everything else, you‰Ûªre afraid of birds?",5
22723,Sheldon,9," It‰Ûªs called ornithophobia. And someday it will be recognized as a true disability, and the landlord will be required by law to put a giant net over the building. Which is unfortunate, because I have a fear of nets.",5
22724,Penny,9," So movies, yes or no?",5
22725,Leonard,9," Movies, yes.",5
22726,Penny,9," Great. I‰Ûªll see you later. And remember, he‰Ûªs more afraid of you than you are of him.",5
22727,Sheldon,9, That doesn‰Ûªt help.,5
22728,Penny,9," No, I was talking to the bird.",5
22729,Sheldon,9," (Knock, knock, knock) Go away, bird. (Knock, knock, knock) Go away, bird. (Knock, knock, knock) Go away, bird.",5
22730,Leonard,9," Sheldon, just ignore him.",5
22731,Sheldon,9," Good idea. Attention is what birds want. (Pulls curtain) Oh, much better. All right. Now I‰Ûªll just get along with my life. (Bird squawks) Make a pot of tea, Leonard. It‰Ûªs going to be a long night.",5
22732,Scene,9, The apartment.Sheldon is trying to scare the bird away making cat noises.,5
22733,Leonard,9, The bird‰Ûªs still there?,5
22734,Sheldon,9," Quick, what does a hawk sound like?",5
22735,Leonard,9, I don‰Ûªt know. Scree-scree.,5
22736,Sheldon,9," Please, that‰Ûªs a seagull. If you‰Ûªre not going to help, don‰Ûªt help.",5
22737,Leonard,9, Sorry. Do you think I‰Ûªm overdressed?,5
22738,Sheldon,9," It depends on the activity. For a prostate exam, yes. If you‰Ûªre playing Vegas, I‰Ûªd add sequins.",5
22739,Leonard,9, I‰Ûªm going to the movies with Penny. I don‰Ûªt want her to think that I think it‰Ûªs a date.,5
22740,Sheldon,9, Do you think it‰Ûªs a date?,5
22741,Leonard,9," No, but she might think I think it‰Ûªs a date even though I don‰Ûªt.",5
22742,Sheldon,9, Or you might think she thinks you think it‰Ûªs a date even though she doesn‰Ûªt.,5
22743,Leonard,9, Are we overthinking this?,5
22744,Sheldon,9, Not at all.,5
22745,Leonard,9, You‰Ûªre right. I‰Ûªm fine. I‰Ûªm wearing this.,5
22746,Sheldon,9," Really? A blazer? All right. (Leonard takes off blazer and heads back to his room. Sheldon dials phone) Yes, hello. This is Dr. Sheldon Cooper. Yeah, I‰Ûªm at 2311 North Robles Avenue. Yeah, I‰Ûªd like to report a dangerous wild animal. A blue jay. I‰Ûªm sorry, this is Animal Control. I don‰Ûªt understand the laughter. No, the bird is not in my home. If he was in my home, I obviously would have called 911. Sir, I have no doubt that there are things that you‰Ûªre frightened of. Being stuck in a dead-end public service job? Or your wife stepping out on you because you‰Ûªre stuck in a dead-end public service job? Or spiders? Don‰Ûªt you think I tried making cat noises?",5
22747,Leonard (returning in a tee shirt and backwards cap),9, Too casual?,5
22748,Sheldon,9," For an audience with the queen, yes. For an evening of passing a bottle of fortified wine around a flaming trash can, you look great. (Leonard leaves again. Sheldon draws a picture of a cats face and returns to making cat noises at the window.) What am I thinking? Whiskers!",5
22749,Scene,9, The cinema.,5
22750,Penny,9," Oh, hey, if we hurry, we can make the new Jennifer Aniston movie.",5
22751,Leonard,9," Oh, yeah, sure. There‰Ûªs also an amazing documentary about building a dam on river in South America.",5
22752,Penny,9," Okay, but the Jennifer Aniston movie has Jennifer Aniston, and she‰Ûªs not building a dam.",5
22753,Leonard,9, Can‰Ûªt argue with that. I‰Ûªll get the tickets.,5
22754,Penny,9, Okay.,5
22755,Leonard,9," Actually, you know what? I think it‰Ûªs about time I pick a movie we see.",5
22756,Penny,9, You pick plenty of movies.,5
22757,Leonard,9," No. You always picked, and it was always the same. An hour and a half of beach houses in the rain until the woman turns around and realizes love was here all along.",5
22758,Penny,9," But come on, that is a great movie, and it starts in ten minutes.",5
22759,Leonard,9, I hate those movies.,5
22760,Penny,9," No, you don‰Ûªt.",5
22761,Leonard,9," Yes, I do. The only reason I went is because you wanted to see them, and I wanted to have sex. To this day, I can‰Ûªt see a Sandra Bullock movie poster without getting both bored and aroused.",5
22762,Penny,9," Okay, so while we were going out, how often would you pretend to like things just to have sex with me?",5
22763,Leonard,9, All the time.,5
22764,Penny,9, You‰Ûªre kidding.,5
22765,Leonard,9," Does this sound familiar? I‰Ûªd love to go shoe shopping with you. Hiking? It‰Ûªs great. It‰Ûªs two a.m., of course I want to go to Korea Town and sing karaoke with your friends. Who wouldn‰Ûªt?",5
22766,Penny,9," Okay, we were going out. You were going to get sex anyway.",5
22767,Leonard,9, Really? You would have slept with me after a three-hour documentary on dams?,5
22768,Penny,9, No. No woman would.,5
22769,Leonard,9," See? Now, that‰Ûªs the great thing. We‰Ûªre out as friends. This is not a date. Sex is off the table. So, let‰Ûªs go learn why hydroelectric power might not be the environmental bargain you think it is. Sorry. Spoiler alert.",5
22770,Penny,9," All right, fine.",5
22771,Leonard,9, Thanks. Tickets are eleven bucks. Not a date.,5
22772,Scene,9, The apartment.,5
22773,Raj,9," Come on, Sheldon, Star Wars.",5
22774,Howard,9, I‰Ûªm pushing play.,5
22775,Sheldon,9, A minute.,5
22776,Howard,9," If we don‰Ûªt start soon, George Lucas is going to change it again.",5
22777,Sheldon,9, This would go a lot faster if you put your trade school diploma to work and helped me set up this high frequency tone generator.,5
22778,Howard,9, I have a Masters degree from M.I.T.,5
22779,Sheldon,9," Yeah, but you‰Ûªve got a can-do attitude and that‰Ûªs what‰Ûªs important.",5
22780,Raj,9, I really don‰Ûªt get your problem with birds.,5
22781,Sheldon,9," The question you should be asking is what is their problem with me? My first memory, a hummingbird dive-bombing my stroller to get at the apple juice in my sippy cup.",5
22782,Raj,9, Hummingbirds are pretty.,5
22783,Sheldon,9, Hummingbirds are the vampires of the flower world.,5
22784,Raj,9," Still my first choice for an ankle tattoo. Or a dolphin, I go back and forth.",5
22785,Sheldon,9," Age seven, a blood-thirsty chicken chases me up a tree. Age twelve, a magpie tries to steal the retainer out of my mouth. Age sixteen, a parrot in a pet store called me fat ass. Need I go on?",5
22786,Raj,9," Yes, please. This is way better than the movie.",5
22787,Howard,9," All right, Sheldon, your bird death ray is ready.",5
22788,Sheldon,9," It‰Ûªs not a death ray. It‰Ûªs just a little ultrasonic blast to scare him off. Trust me, if I had a death ray, I wouldn‰Ûªt be living here. I‰Ûªd be in my lair enjoying the money the people of Earth gave me for not using my death ray. All right, and in three, two, one. (Switches on. All the windows shatter. The bird doesn‰Ûªt move.)",5
22789,Raj,9, That is one tough birdie.,5
22790,Scene,9, A bar.,5
22791,Leonard,9," Come on, you enjoyed the movie. I saw you tearing up when the village got flooded, and everyone had to relocate.",5
22792,Penny,9," No, I was thinking how come they get to leave and I can‰Ûªt.",5
22793,Leonard,9, I‰Ûªm going to get some fries. You want anything?,5
22794,Penny,9," Uh, no, thanks.",5
22795,Leonard,9," Are you sure? Because you always say no, and then you eat half my fries.",5
22796,Penny,9, I just eat the little crispy ones you don‰Ûªt like.,5
22797,Leonard,9," No, I love them. I save them for the end, but they‰Ûªre gone because you ate them. And why did I let you eat them?",5
22798,Penny,9, To get sex.,5
22799,Leonard,9," Exactly. But this is not a date. So I ask again, would you like anything?",5
22800,Penny,9," All right, I‰Ûªd like an order of fries.",5
22801,Leonard,9, Great. That‰Ûªll be five dollars. I am having the best time. I‰Ûªm so glad you suggested we do this.,5
22802,Penny (accidentally nudging the man sitting behind her),9," Oh, sorry.",5
22803,Man,9, No problem.,5
22804,Penny,9, What you writing there?,5
22805,Man,9, A screenplay. Its about a guy whose roommate is having sex and tells him go to a bar and work on his screenplay.,5
22806,Man,9, It‰Ûªs a working title.,5
22807,Penny,9, Oh.,5
22808,Man,9, I‰Ûªm Kevin.,5
22809,Penny,9, Oh. Penny. Nice to meet you.,5
22810,Kevin,9, I‰Ûªll let you get back to your date.,5
22811,Penny,9," Oh, no, no. This isn‰Ûªt a date, no. Right?",5
22812,Leonard,9," Uh, right.",5
22813,Penny,9, So have you written anything I might have seen?,5
22814,Kevin,9, That depends. How much time do you spend on Yelp?,5
22815,Scene,9, The apartment.,5
22816,Sheldon,9," This is ridiculous. I‰Ûªm a grown man from Texas. This isn‰Ûªt a terrifying bird like a swan or a goose. It‰Ûªs just a blue jay. (Opens window) That‰Ûªs a pretty big blue jay. (Closes window. Goes to cabinet. Comes out wearing a Boba Fett helmet and a broom) One, two, three. (Opens window) Go! Shoo! Am-scray, ird-bay! (Bird flies in window) Bird in the apartment! Bird in the apartment! (Sees the bird sitting in his place) No!",5
22817,Scene,9, The bar.,5
22818,Penny (to Kevin),9," So it is an amazing documentary. They need the electricity from the dam, but at the same time they want to preserve the environment.",5
22819,Leonard,9," You‰Ûªre kidding me. Uh, can I see you for a sec over here?",5
22820,Penny,9," Oh, yeah. Sure. Just one sec?",5
22821,Kevin,9, No problem.,5
22822,Penny,9, What‰Ûªs up?,5
22823,Leonard,9, I know what you‰Ûªre doing.,5
22824,Penny,9, What am I doing?,5
22825,Leonard,9, You‰Ûªre going out of your way to talk to that guy because I said we weren‰Ûªt on a date.,5
22826,Penny,9," No, I‰Ûªm talking to him because he‰Ûªs cute.",5
22827,Leonard,9," Come on, he‰Ûªs not that cute.",5
22828,Penny,9," Yes, he is. With his dorky T-shirt and his little hipster glasses.",5
22829,Leonard,9, I wear dorky T-shirts and glasses.,5
22830,Penny,9," Yes, but when you‰Ûªre tall and have great cheekbones, you‰Ûªre doing it ironically.",5
22831,Leonard,9," If that‰Ûªs so, what if I start talking to a girl?",5
22832,Penny,9, You should.,5
22833,Leonard,9, I‰Ûªm serious. I‰Ûªll do it.,5
22834,Penny,9, Good! Go! There are some girls right over there. What are you waiting for?,5
22835,Leonard,9, They‰Ûªre in a group. I‰Ûªm scared.,5
22836,Scene,9, The apartment.,5
22837,Amy,9," Sheldon, what do you expect us to do?",5
22838,Sheldon,9," You‰Ûªre biologists. Biology is the study of living things. That‰Ûªs a living thing, get cracking.",5
22839,Bernadette,9," I specialize in microorganisms, and Amy studies brains.",5
22840,Amy,9," Yeah, neither of us minored in bird-shooing.",5
22841,Sheldon,9," Oh, come now. Your undergraduate work must have included a varmints and critters class.",5
22842,Bernadette,9," Come back in, Sheldon, he‰Ûªs not going to hurt you. He looks friendly. I think he might be someone‰Ûªs pet.",5
22843,Sheldon,9," No, Bernadette, don‰Ûªt be a hero!",5
22844,Bernadette,9," Oh, he‰Ûªs a sweetie.",5
22845,Sheldon,9," Yes. It‰Ûªs very sweet. Now, slowly and carefully, flush him down the toilet.",5
22846,Amy,9," Sheldon, the only way to get past this fear is to interact with it. Just like you did with the mailman.",5
22847,Sheldon,9, Every year tens of people around the world are killed by birds. I‰Ûªm not going to be another statistic.,5
22848,Bernadette,9," Look how sweet he is. Come over and say hi. Come on. You can do it. Don‰Ûªt be scared. Come on. Oh, just pet the bird, you big baby!",5
22849,Sheldon,9," I did it! I actually did it. Okay, now flush him.",5
22850,Scene,9, The bar.,5
22851,Woman,9," So, Leonard, what do you do for fun?",5
22852,Leonard,9," Um, let‰Ûªs see. Hiking. Karaoke in Koreatown. Any Jennifer Aniston movie.",5
22853,Penny,9, Hey. Sorry I ditched you.,5
22854,Leonard,9," No, it‰Ûªs fine. You can ditch away.",5
22855,Penny,9," Oh, no, no. We said we were going to hang out, let‰Ûªs hang out.",5
22856,Leonard,9, It‰Ûªs cool. Go back to Kevin.,5
22857,Penny,9," Oh, he had to leave.",5
22858,Leonard,9," Interesting. So now that he‰Ûªs gone, you want to hang out with me.",5
22859,Woman,9, This must be Penny.,5
22860,Leonard,9, Yep.,5
22861,Woman,9, I totally get it.,5
22862,Penny,9," Huh? I‰Ûªm sorry, get what?",5
22863,Leonard,9," Don‰Ûªt worry about it. You know, there‰Ûªs some guys over there. You should go talk to them.",5
22864,Penny,9," No, no. I want to know what you told her.",5
22865,Leonard,9, That‰Ûªs kind of between me and‰Û_,5
22866,Woman,9, Laura.,5
22867,Leonard,9, Laura.,5
22868,Penny,9," Oh. Okay, I see. So while he was telling you things, did he mention he owns not one, but two Star Trek uniforms?",5
22869,Laura,9, Really?,5
22870,Penny,9, Yeah. Wears them. Not just for Halloween.,5
22871,Leonard,9," Hey, pal. You didn‰Ûªt see me telling Kevin that you thought cold wars were only fought in winter.",5
22872,Penny,9," Okay. Then I‰Ûªll return the favour, and I won‰Ûªt tell‰Û_",5
22873,Laura,9, Laura.,5
22874,Penny,9, Laura that half the dirty movies you own are animated.,5
22875,Leonard,9," When you were telling Kevin about your acting career, did you mention your long-running role as Waitress in a local production of The Cheesecake Factory?",5
22876,Penny,9, Did you tell her about your lucky asthma inhaler?,5
22877,Leonard,9," Oh, yeah? Spell asthma.",5
22878,Penny,9, A‰Û_ S‰Û_ Take me home.,5
22879,Leonard,9," Maybe I‰Ûªm not done hanging out with‰Û_ (Laura has gone) You‰Ûªre right, it‰Ûªs getting late.",5
22880,Scene,9, The apartment. Sheldon has the bird on his arm.,5
22881,Sheldon,9," It‰Ûªs remarkable. All that time spent in fear. And for what? He‰Ûªs magnificent. Oh, dear. I just realized I haven‰Ûªt offered you a beverage.",5
22882,Bernadette,9," Oh, it‰Ûªs just like my grandma with her parrot. And after she lost her marbles with her remote control.",5
22883,Sheldon,9," My phone‰Ûªs on the desk over there. Take a picture of us together. Make it good enough to go on a mug, a mouse pad, and a calendar. If you were a dove, I‰Ûªd call you Lovey-Dovey. Oh. Who am I kidding? This isn‰Ûªt a moment for strict adherence to the literal. You‰Ûªre just my little Lovey-Dovey, aren‰Ûªt you?",5
22884,Amy,9, Guess you gotta have hollow bones to get some sugar around here.,5
22885,Bernadette,9, I still think he looks like someone‰Ûªs pet. Maybe we should put up posters.,5
22886,Sheldon,9," Yes. It should have a big picture of him, and the words, is this your bird? Not anymore. We‰Ûªre going to have so much fun together. You can carry messages to all my enemies. I can tie a string to your leg and fly you like a kite.",5
22887,Amy,9," If you‰Ûªre keeping him, I‰Ûªve got a cage you can borrow. One of the test monkeys slipped on a banana peel and broke his neck. It was both tragic and hysterical.",5
22888,Sheldon,9," Nonsense. No. Lovey-Dovey doesn‰Ûªt sleep in a cage. No. Lovey-Dovey sleeps in his very own nest, which I‰Ûªm going to get off the windowsill and put in my room. Isn‰Ûªt that right, LD? (Opens window. Bird flies out.) No. Where are you going? Come back, Lovey-Dovey! This is your home now! I already ordered 20 pounds of bird feed off of Amazon! He‰Ûªs gone.",5
22889,Amy,9," I‰Ûªm sorry, Sheldon.",5
22890,Sheldon,9," How could he do this to me? Get back here, you stupid bird, so I can love you!",5
22891,Scene,9, The stairwell. They ascend without talking.,5
22892,Leonard,9," Okay. So, we went out, saw a movie, met some nice people, said horrible things about each other in public, all in all, a pretty magical night.",5
22893,Penny,9," Okay, I‰Ûªm not innocent in all this, but you basically called me stupid, you asthmatic dumbass.",5
22894,Leonard,9," I know, I, I, I crossed a line. And I‰Ûªm sorry. No, no, no, hang on. I really mean it. And it‰Ûªs not like when we were going out, I‰Ûªd just apologize for everything so we could end up in bed. This is a 100% sex-is-off-the-table I‰Ûªm sorry.",5
22895,Penny,9," All right. Thank you. I‰Ûªm sorry, too.",5
22896,Leonard,9," Just to be clear, sex is off the table, right?",5
22897,Penny,9, Way off.,5
22898,Leonard,9, Maybe we‰Ûªre not ready to hang out as friends.,5
22899,Penny,9," I don‰Ûªt know. Up until the last part, I was kind of enjoying take-charge Leonard with a little backbone. Picking the movie, knowing what he wants, a little cocky.",5
22900,Leonard,9, Really?,5
22901,Penny,9, Yeah.,5
22902,Leonard,9," Well, then, I‰Ûªm putting sex back on the table. What do you think about that?",5
22903,Penny,9, Ooh. Maybe I like it.,5
22904,Leonard,9," You do? Because if that‰Ûªs what you like, I can be that guy. I swear, I‰Ûªll be anything you want me to be.",5
22905,Penny,9," Good night, Leonard.",5
22906,Leonard,9, I am such an asthmatic dumbass. I had a weird night.,5
22907,Sheldon,9, Mine was great. I‰Ûªm going to be a mommy. (Reveals nest with an egg in it.),5
22908,Scene,10, The comic book store.,5
22909,Howard,10, It‰Ûªs amazing people keep coming to comic book stores instead of just downloading comics digitally.,5
22910,Leonard,10," It‰Ûªs probably for the best. For a lot of these guys, the weekly trip here is the only chance their mom has to go down to the basement and change their sheets.",5
22911,Howard,10," Oh, that reminds me, I get fresh sheets tonight. Yay.",5
22912,Sheldon,10," Well? What do you think of New Comic Book Night? Magic, huh?",5
22913,Amy,10," Sheldon, I‰Ûªm disappointed. As a brilliant man, you‰Ûªre entitled to a vice. I could understand frequenting an opium den or hunting your fellow man for sport. But this? Lame-o.",5
22914,Sheldon,10," Well, A, comic books employ storytelling through sequential art, a medium that dates back 17,000 years to the cave paintings of Lascaux, and B, you play the harp. Like that‰Ûªs cool.",5
22915,Stuart,10, Can I help you find anything?,5
22916,Amy,10, A comic that depicts a woman whose bosom can‰Ûªt be used as a floatation device.,5
22917,Stuart,10, Sorry. Most of the guys who come in here like big boobs. Couple of them have big boobs.,5
22918,Raj,10," Hey, look, the new Warlords of Ka‰Ûªa expansion pack is out.",5
22919,Howard,10," A new one? Unbelievable. They just keep making up more cheesy monsters, slapping them on cards and selling them at 25 bucks a pop. It‰Ûªs like a secret tax on guys who can‰Ûªt get laid.",5
22920,Raj,10," They‰Ûªre not even trying. Remember the Satanimals pack with the Hellephant? Why, absurd. What was he, a bad elephant who died and went to hell? What could an elephant possibly do that would cause him eternal damnation?",5
22921,Howard,10, Wild West and Witches? What kind of loser cares about a showdown between Billy the Kid and the White Wizard of the North?,5
22922,Raj,10, A total loser. Obviously a guy with a six-shooter beats an old man with a magic wand.,5
22923,Leonard,10," Well, ho-hold on. What if the wizard casts a Helmet of Confusion spell on Billy the Kid‰Ûªs cowboy hat?",5
22924,Howard,10," What? Please! This is Billy the Kid we‰Ûªre talking about. I mean, the wizard would get shot between the eyes before he could ever get out the words, what the hell is Billy the Kid doing in the mystic realm of Ka‰Ûªa?",5
22925,Stuart,10," Leonard, what‰Ûªs the deal with Sheldon‰Ûªs friend Amy? Are they a couple?",5
22926,Leonard,10, Couple of weirdos. Why?,5
22927,Howard,10, You interested in Amy?,5
22928,Stuart,10," Well, I mean, she didn‰Ûªt look through me with soul-sucking, ball-shriveling hatred and contempt. I like that in a woman. Could you run it by Sheldon if I could ask her out?",5
22929,Leonard,10, Sure. I guess.,5
22930,Raj,10," Stuart, settle an argument for us. Who would win, Billy the Kid or the White Wizard?",5
22931,Stuart,10," If I tell you that, I‰Ûªm robbing you of the hours of fun you could have for the magical, rootin‰Ûª tootin‰Ûª low price of $24.95.",5
22932,Raj,10, I‰Ûªll take one.,5
22933,Howard,10," Mmm, make it two.",5
22934,Leonard,10, I hate all of you and myself. Three.,5
22935,Stuart,10, I‰Ûªll ring it up. Like shooting nerds in a barrel.,5
22936,Scene,10, The apartment.,5
22937,Leonard,10," Hey, can I talk to you about something? It‰Ûªs a little awkward.",5
22938,Sheldon,10," I know what this is about. Given the professional standstill you‰Ûªre at, you‰Ûªre wondering if this is the appropriate time to abandon your research and focus on teaching. Yes. And if I may suggest, consider changing disciplines. Yeah, to the humanities, perhaps history. One of the advantages of teaching history is that you don‰Ûªt have to create things, you know, you just have to remember stuff that happened and then parrot it back. You could have fun with that.",5
22939,Leonard,10," Yeah, that‰Ûªs not it. Stuart‰Ûªs kind of interested in Amy.",5
22940,Sheldon,10," Oh, of course he is. She‰Ûªs very interesting. Did you know, when she was 14, she severed the webbing between her own toes?",5
22941,Leonard,10, No. He wanted me to find out if you‰Ûªd have a problem with him asking her out.,5
22942,Sheldon,10," I‰Ûªm not sure how to respond, Leonard. I don‰Ûªt own Amy. Can‰Ûªt own a person. At least not since? 1863. President Lincoln freed the? Slaves! Come on Leonard, if you‰Ûªre going to teach history, these are the kind of facts you‰Ûªll have to know.",5
22943,Leonard,10, You know what? Never mind. I‰Ûªm going to tell him it‰Ûªs okay to ask her out.,5
22944,Sheldon,10," The question is moot. There is no way that Stuart, an impoverished peddler of picture books, would be at all appealing to Amy Farrah Fowler, a noted neurobiologist capable of performing surgery on her own feet with nothing but nitrous oxide from cans of whipped cream as anesthesia.",5
22945,Leonard,10," All right, but just for the record, I checked in with you to see how you‰Ûªd feel about it.",5
22946,Sheldon,10," Fine. The record shall so reflect. Now, getting back to the problem at hand, what to do with a washed-up experimental physicist.",5
22947,Leonard,10, I am not washed-up.,5
22948,Sheldon,10," Oh, Leonard. Lots of people love you and want to help you, but they can‰Ûªt until you admit the problem.",5
22949,Scene,10, Penny‰Ûªs apartment.,5
22950,Penny,10," Well, ladies, we killed the bottle.",5
22951,Amy,10, I had half a glass.,5
22952,Bernadette,10, I didn‰Ûªt have any.,5
22953,Penny,10," Okay, don‰Ûªt judge me. So, what do you want to do, go to the movies, go dancing, lay down for a little bit?",5
22954,Amy,10, Or we play Travel Twister.,5
22955,Bernadette,10," Amy, really? Twister?",5
22956,Amy,10," Excuse me. I‰Ûªve passed many an enjoyable evening playing this game. And I‰Ûªm sure it‰Ûªs a lot more exciting when you play with other people. What do you say, bestie? We can do shirts and skins. I‰Ûªm shirts. Called it.",5
22957,Bernadette,10," I‰Ûªm too small for Twister. And roller coasters. And sitting with my feet on the floor. Hope you enjoyed the prenatal cigarettes, Mom.",5
22958,Penny,10," Hey, you know, my mom smoked pot when she was pregnant with me, and I turned out just fine. Hey, look, I have peach schnapps. Thank God.",5
22959,Amy (reading a text on her phone),10," Guys, something happened.",5
22960,Penny,10, What‰Ûªs wrong?,5
22961,Amy,10, I think a boy likes me.,5
22962,Bernadette (reading),10, Hi. It‰Ûªs Stuart. We met at the comic book store. I was wondering if you‰Ûªd like to get coffee sometime. It‰Ûªs okay if you say no. It might be the kick in the pants I need to start taking Zoloft.,5
22963,Penny,10," Amy, little vixen. Just working it under all those layers of wool and polyester.",5
22964,Bernadette,10, What are you going to do? Doesn‰Ûªt he know you have a boyfriend?,5
22965,Penny,10," Oh, she doesn‰Ûªt have a boyfriend, she has a Sheldon. So do you like Stuart?",5
22966,Amy,10," I don‰Ûªt know. He‰Ûªs nice. He‰Ûªs funny. He has the sallow, drawn countenance associated with an overactive thyroid gland. That‰Ûªs kind of hot.",5
22967,Penny,10," Okay, look, sweetie, we all love Sheldon, but you‰Ûªve been with him over a year now. If it‰Ûªs not going anywhere, what does it hurt to look around?",5
22968,Bernadette,10," Well, yeah, I guess they‰Ûªre not engaged like me and Howie.",5
22969,Penny,10," Yeah, for what it‰Ûªs worth, engaged people can look around, too. Lot of options out there.",5
22970,Scene,10, The comic book store.,5
22971,Sheldon,10, Where‰Ûªs Stuart?,5
22972,Speccy Guy Behind Counter (sniggering),10, Out.,5
22973,Sheldon,10, Who are you?,5
22974,Speccy Guy,10, I‰Ûªm Dale. He left me in charge.,5
22975,Leonard,10, Really?,5
22976,Dale,10," Yeah. I don‰Ûªt get it, either.",5
22977,Leonard,10, I want to return this Wild West and Witches Ka‰Ûªa expansion pack.,5
22978,Dale,10, Sorry. I don‰Ûªt do returns. They‰Ûªre hard.,5
22979,Leonard,10," Sure, sure. Uh, when will Stuart be back?",5
22980,Dale,10, I don‰Ûªt know. He went out for coffee. With a girl.,5
22981,Sheldon,10," Oh, I guess I was wrong.",5
22982,Leonard,10, You okay?,5
22983,Sheldon,10," Am I okay? Leonard, I‰Ûªm on a lifelong trajectory that includes a Nobel Prize and cities named after me, all four wisdom teeth fit comfortably in my mouth without need of extraction, and my bowel movements run like a German train schedule. Am I okay?",5
22984,Dale,10," I‰Ûªm okay, too!",5
22985,Scene,10, The apartment. They are playing Warlords of Ka‰Ûªa.,5
22986,Raj,10, Wild Bill Witchcock.,5
22987,Leonard,10, A tribe of Abra-Comanches.,5
22988,Sheldon,10," Flaming Spittoon. And for the record, I‰Ûªm very disappointed in you cowpokes. We‰Ûªre playing our inaugural round of Wild West and Witches, and I‰Ûªm the only one who bothered to dress for the occasion. (Spits into a spittoon) Patooie.",5
22989,Howard,10," We‰Ûªre not wearing cowboy hats, Sheldon. It looks ridiculous.",5
22990,Sheldon,10," And I suppose my boots and spurs are ridiculous, too?",5
22991,Leonard,10, Yeah.,5
22992,Howard,10, Very.,5
22993,Raj,10, Incredibly so.,5
22994,Sheldon,10, Did it look ridiculous when we got the Satanimals pack and I dressed up as a Beelzebobcat?,5
22995,Leonard,10, Yeah.,5
22996,Howard,10, Very.,5
22997,Raj,10, Incredibly so.,5
22998,Sheldon,10," All right, fine. Let‰Ûªs just play.",5
22999,Leonard,10, We should go easy on him. Amy‰Ûªs out with Stuart tonight.,5
23000,Howard,10, Wait a minute. Are you telling me that Sheldon‰Ûªs patented blend of condescension and no sex isn‰Ûªt enough to hold on to a woman?,5
23001,Sheldon,10," Cluck, cluck, cluck. What are we, ladies at a quilting bee? Or are we men playing a fantasy card game set in a magical frontier town?",5
23002,Howard,10, Sorry. Creepy Tepee.,5
23003,Raj,10, Annie Ogly.,5
23004,Leonard,10, Hocus Pocus Pocahontas.,5
23005,Sheldon,10," And may I point out it is the three of you who are obsessed with Stuart and Amy, not me. I think you need to ask yourselves who‰Ûªs really being ridiculous here. (Walks away with spurs jangling)",5
23006,Leonard,10, It‰Ûªs you.,5
23007,Howard,10, You are.,5
23008,Raj,10, Totally you.,5
23009,Scene,10, The cafeteria.,5
23010,Raj,10," Hey, guys, check it out. The deluxe limited edition Wild West and Witches expansion pack in the signed and numbered collector‰Ûªs tin.",5
23011,Leonard,10," Oh come on, no! We just bought the regular pack.",5
23012,Howard,10," Ooh, a sheriff‰Ûªs badge.",5
23013,Raj,10," Yeah, it‰Ûªs also a wand.",5
23014,Leonard,10," With a hologram? Nice. Hey, do you see this?",5
23015,Sheldon,10," I‰Ûªm in the matrix, Leonard, I see everything.",5
23016,Leonard,10, You‰Ûªve got to be kidding me. You friended Stuart on Facebook?,5
23017,Howard,10, I thought you didn‰Ûªt like Facebook anymore.,5
23018,Sheldon,10, Don‰Ûªt be silly. I‰Ûªm a fan of anything that tries to replace actual human contact.,5
23019,Raj,10, Please. You‰Ûªre looking at Facebook to find out how their date went.,5
23020,Sheldon,10," Really? You think I care if a man, what, shared a pumpkin latte with a dynamite lady?",5
23021,Raj,10, You‰Ûªre so full of it.,5
23022,Sheldon,10, You are free to believe whatever you like. And unfriend Rajesh Koothrappali.,5
23023,Raj,10, You unfriended me? Seriously?,5
23024,Howard,10," Oh, yeah. Now he‰Ûªs gonna miss all those great updates like, I can‰Ûªt believe I waited this long to make my own potpourri.",5
23025,Leonard,10," Sheldon, why don‰Ûªt you just acknowledge that you have feelings for Amy and you don‰Ûªt want her going out with other men?",5
23026,Sheldon,10, And unfriend Leonard Hofstadter.,5
23027,Howard,10," Here‰Ûªs a radical thought. Go old-school, challenge Stuart to a fight. I mean, nothing makes the ladies hotter than two skinny white guys swatting at each other with their eyes closed.",5
23028,Sheldon,10, And unfriend Howard Wolowitz.,5
23029,Leonard,10, That‰Ûªs all of us. Can I use the laptop?,5
23030,Sheldon,10, Why?,5
23031,Leonard,10, I have to buy that stupid collector‰Ûªs tin.,5
23032,Scene,10, Penny‰Ûªs apartment door. Sheldon knocks three times.,5
23033,Penny (off),10, Who do we love?,5
23034,Sheldon,10," Penny. (Knock, knock, knock)",5
23035,Penny (off),10, Who do we love?,5
23036,Sheldon,10," Penny. (Knock, knock, knock)",5
23037,Penny (off),10, Who do we love?,5
23038,Sheldon,10, Penny.,5
23039,Penny,10," Hello, Sheldon. Come on in.",5
23040,Sheldon,10, Thank you.,5
23041,Penny,10, What‰Ûªs up?,5
23042,Sheldon,10, I came to ask if you would like to go on a date with me.,5
23043,Penny,10," I‰Ûªm sorry, what?",5
23044,Sheldon,10," A date. You and me. Dining, dancing, perhaps you‰Ûªd like to take in a prizefight.",5
23045,Penny,10," God, are you trying to make Amy jealous?",5
23046,Sheldon,10, No. Why is everyone so obsessed with Amy and Stuart? And whether or not they may be having more pumpkin lattes or intercourse tonight.,5
23047,Penny,10," Okay, listen to me. Playing games is not gonna help get Amy back.",5
23048,Sheldon,10," I am not trying to get her back. But, out of curiosity, what is a way?",5
23049,Penny,10," All right, honey, let me tell you a story. There was a guy I liked, and I never told him how I felt. Eventually, he started going out with someone else, and I always regretted it. Do you see where I‰Ûªm going with this?",5
23050,Sheldon,10, I believe I do.,5
23051,Penny,10, Mm.,5
23052,Sheldon,10, I‰Ûªm the guy.,5
23053,Penny,10, You‰Ûªre not the guy.,5
23054,Sheldon,10," Are you sure? That would explain so much. Your constant presence in my apartment, that baffling dalliance with Leonard just to be near me, the way you call me sweetie all the time.",5
23055,Penny,10, I call everyone sweetie.,5
23056,Sheldon,10, You tramp.,5
23057,Penny,10," Look, Sheldon, all I‰Ûªm saying is strap on a pair and go talk to Amy.",5
23058,Sheldon,10," Strap on a pair? Of what, skates?",5
23059,Penny,10," Oh, sweetie, you are so not the guy.",5
23060,Scene,10, A cinema.,5
23061,Stuart,10," If you‰Ûªre bored, you can go. I understand.",5
23062,Amy,10," No, I‰Ûªm having a nice time.",5
23063,Stuart,10, Don‰Ûªt patronize me.,5
23064,Sheldon,10," Excuse me. Excuse me. Pardon me. Pardon me. Excuse me. Hi, Stuart.",5
23065,Stuart,10," Hi, Sheldon.",5
23066,Sheldon,10, Pardon me. Excuse me.,5
23067,Amy,10," Sheldon, what are you doing here?",5
23068,Sheldon,10," The thought of you sitting in a darkened theatre with a character like Stuart is repellent. No offence, Stuart.",5
23069,Stuart,10," None taken. Although repellent is kind of a, kind of a strong word.",5
23070,Amy,10," I‰Ûªm sorry this causes you discomfort, but based on the currently established parameters of our relationship, I can put myself in any repellent situation I want.",5
23071,Stuart,10," Um, again‰Û_",5
23072,Sheldon,10," Stuart, please. You‰Ûªre being rude.",5
23073,Amy,10, Anything else?,5
23074,Sheldon,10, I believe I would like to alter the paradigm of our relationship.,5
23075,Amy,10, I‰Ûªm listening.,5
23076,Sheldon,10," With the understanding that nothing changes whatsoever, physical or otherwise, I would not object to us no longer characterizing you as not my girlfriend.",5
23077,Amy,10, Interesting. Now try it without the quadruple negative.,5
23078,Sheldon,10, You‰Ûªre being impossible.,5
23079,Amy,10," Hi, Stuart.",5
23080,Sheldon,10," Fine. Amy, will you be my girlfriend?",5
23081,Amy,10, Yes.,5
23082,Sheldon,10," Well, that‰Ûªs enough of that. Sorry to interrupt. You two enjoy your date. Here‰Ûªs a dollar for your troubles. Get yourself some Sour Patch Kids.",5
23083,Scene,10, Outside Amy‰Ûªs apartment.,5
23084,Stuart,10," So, other than you taking your relationship to the next level with another guy, this was nice.",5
23085,Amy,10," Yes, well, thanks for seeing me to my door.",5
23086,Stuart,10," Oh, you‰Ûªre welcome.",5
23087,Sheldon (inside),10," (Knock, knock, knock) Amy. (Knock, knock, knock) Amy. (Knock, knock, knock) Amy. Let‰Ûªs wrap things up out there.",5
23088,Amy,10," Um, good night, Stuart.",5
23089,Stuart,10, Good night.,5
23090,Sheldon (inside),10," Take the hint, Stuart. The lady said good night.",5
23091,Amy,10, How did you get into my apartment?,5
23092,Sheldon,10, Wow. Is that the kind of nagging I can expect now that you‰Ûªre my girlfriend? Good thing I drew this up.,5
23093,Amy,10, What‰Ûªs that?,5
23094,Sheldon,10," I present to you the relationship agreement. A binding covenant that, in its 31 pages, enumerates, iterates and codifies the rights and responsibilities of Sheldon Lee Cooper, here and after known as the boyfriend, and Amy Farrah Fowler, here and after known as the girlfriend.",5
23095,Amy,10, It‰Ûªs so romantic.,5
23096,Sheldon,10, Mutual indemnification always is. Why don‰Ûªt you start perusing while I set up my notary stamp.,5
23097,Sheldon,10, Feel free to retain a lawyer.,5
23098,Scene,10, Penny‰Ûªs apartment. The girls are playing twister.,5
23099,Amy,10," Penny, I said right hand red.",5
23100,Penny (picking up wine),10," Yeah, I heard you. I got red.",5
23101,Amy,10," Bernadette, left foot yellow.",5
23102,Bernadette,10, We should play limbo next. No one beats me at limbo.,5
23103,Sheldon,10," (Knock, knock, knock) Penny. (Knock, knock, knock) Amy. (Knock, knock, knock) Bernadette.",5
23104,Amy,10, That‰Ûªs my boyfriend. It‰Ûªs open!,5
23105,Sheldon,10, I got a splinter.,5
23106,Amy,10, What do you want me to do about it?,5
23107,Sheldon,10," Relationship agreement Section 4, Boo-boos and Ouchies. You have to take care of it.",5
23108,Amy,10, I should‰Ûªve gotten a lawyer.,5
23109,Bernadette,10," Looks like it‰Ûªs just us playing. (Penny snores) Penny? (Penny snores louder) Penny, we‰Ûªre out of wine!",5
23110,"Penny (waking, bleary)",10, You should probably drive.,5
23111,Scene,11, The apartment.,5
23112,Penny (entering),11, Hi. Did Sheldon change the Wi-Fi password again?,5
23113,Leonard,11," Yeah, it‰Ûªs ‰ÛÏPenny already eats our food, she can pay for Wi-Fi.‰Û No spaces.",5
23114,Penny,11," Okay. If you can‰Ûªt get me to stop eating your food, what makes you think you can get me to stop using your Wi-Fi?",5
23115,Sheldon,11, I believe that you‰Ûªre capable of great change. Like when I finally got you to stop saying Valentimes Day.,5
23116,Leonard,11, You want to hear something weird?,5
23117,Penny,11, Sure.,5
23118,Sheldon,11," In the year 2000, Pope John Paul II was named an honorary Harlem Globetrotter.",5
23119,Leonard,11, What are you talking about?,5
23120,Sheldon,11, You asked Penny if she wanted to hear something weird.,5
23121,Leonard,11," Yeah, because I have something weird to tell her.",5
23122,Sheldon,11, Oh. I thought it was a game.,5
23123,Penny,11, What‰Ûªs yours?,5
23124,Leonard,11," There‰Ûªs this guy, Jimmy Speckerman, who used to torment me in high school. He sent me a message through Facebook. He‰Ûªs in town and wants to have drinks.",5
23125,Sheldon,11," Okay, Penny, if it were a game, here are your choices. An e-mail from an old acquaintance, or the head of one of the largest religious institutions in the world slam dunking to Sweet Georgia Brown. Pick.",5
23126,Leonard,11," Just do it, ‰Ûªcause he‰Ûªs not gonna let it go.",5
23127,Penny,11, Basketball Pope.,5
23128,Sheldon,11, And that‰Ûªs how it‰Ûªs done.,5
23129,Penny,11, What are you gonna do about your bully? Are you gonna see him?,5
23130,Leonard,11, I don‰Ûªt know.,5
23131,Sheldon,11, Is this the fellow who peed in your Hawaiian Punch?,5
23132,Leonard,11," No, that was a different guy.",5
23133,Sheldon,11," Was he the one who wedgied you so hard, your testicle reascended, and you spent your whole Christmas break waiting for it to come back down?",5
23134,Leonard,11," No, that was a different, different guy.",5
23135,Sheldon,11, Was he the one who used your head to open a nut?,5
23136,Leonard,11, No.,5
23137,Sheldon,11," Oh, oh, oh. Was he the one who made you eat your arm hair?",5
23138,Leonard,11," No, but, actually, that was this guy‰Ûªs sister.",5
23139,Penny,11," All right, well, what do you think he wants?",5
23140,Leonard,11, I don‰Ûªt know.,5
23141,Sheldon,11," You know, the holidays are just around the corner. Maybe he wants to see if he can lodge the other testicle up there.",5
23142,Leonard,11, I told you. That was a different guy.,5
23143,Penny,11, Hmm. That‰Ûªs too bad. We could have spent New Year‰Ûªs Eve waiting for the ball to drop.,5
23144,Scene,11, The apartment.,5
23145,Leonard,11, It‰Ûªs two a.m. What are you doing up?,5
23146,Sheldon,11, Nobel Prize acceptance ceremony streaming live from Stockholm.,5
23147,Leonard,11, Sure. You want to see what all the scientists are wearing this year.,5
23148,Sheldon,11," Look at these men. They‰Ûªve managed to win the top science prize in the world with no more understanding of the quantum underpinnings of the expansion of the early universe than God gave a goose. You should pay attention, Leonard. Someday this could be you up there.",5
23149,Leonard,11, Thanks.,5
23150,Sheldon,11," So, what‰Ûªs got you up? Did you have a bad clam?",5
23151,Leonard,11, I didn‰Ûªt have clams.,5
23152,Sheldon,11, I don‰Ûªt watch you 24 hours a day. I don‰Ûªt know what you do.,5
23153,Leonard,11," It‰Ûªs this Jimmy Speckerman thing. I can‰Ûªt decide if I should agree to see him or not. Of course that might be because the last time I ran into him, he made me floss with my own shoelaces.",5
23154,Sheldon,11," Wear loafers. Look at Dr. Saul Perlmutter up there, clutching that Nobel Prize. What‰Ûªs the matter, Saul? You afraid someone‰Ûªs going to steal it? Like you stole Einstein‰Ûªs cosmological constant?",5
23155,Leonard,11," You know what? I am tired of living in fear of this guy. I‰Ûªm gonna go see him and finally say all the things I should have said in high school. You know, pick on someone your own size, you did not have sex with my mother, and yes, I do know why I‰Ûªm hitting myself.‰Û",5
23156,Sheldon,11," Oh, now Perlmutter‰Ûªs shaking the King‰Ûªs hand. Yeah, check for your watch, Gustaf. He might have lifted it.",5
23157,Scene,11, Penny‰Ûªs bedroom.,5
23158,Bernadette,11, I love this dress. How come I never see you wear it?,5
23159,Penny,11," ‰Û÷Cause when I wear it, it‰Ûªs a shirt. So, what‰Ûªs Howard doing tonight?",5
23160,Bernadette,11," Oh, they all went with Leonard to confront his childhood bully.",5
23161,Penny,11," Oh, terrific. High school quarterback against four mathletes.",5
23162,Amy,11," When Leonard gets back, I‰Ûªd love to check his serotonin levels. Do you think he‰Ûªd let me draw a syringe full of his blood?",5
23163,Penny,11," Hmm, he‰Ûªs not crazy about needles, but if you get him to go jogging, it‰Ûªll just pour out of his nose.",5
23164,Bernadette,11," I don‰Ûªt think I can meet the girl who was always mean to me. Tammy Bodnick. One time while I was in gym class, she stole all my clothes and left an elf costume in my locker.",5
23165,Penny,11," Oh, that‰Ûªs awful.",5
23166,Bernadette,11," Worst part was, it was too big.",5
23167,Amy,11," That‰Ûªs nothing. In ninth grade, the girls put Rogaine in my hand lotion. Within six months, the nicknames began to fly. I think the one that hurt the most was Gorilla Fingers Fowler.",5
23168,Penny,11, Wow. You poor thing.,5
23169,Bernadette,11, What about you?,5
23170,Penny,11, Oh. I don‰Ûªt know. I guess my school was a nice place. We didn‰Ûªt really have bullies.,5
23171,Amy,11," Come on, no one ever gave anyone mean nicknames or picked on them or put gum in their hairy knuckles so the school nurse had to use peanut butter to get it out?",5
23172,Penny,11," No, we weren‰Ûªt really like that. I mean, look, we played pranks on each other, but it was never mean. Like, okay, this one girl, Kathy Geiger, got really good grades, so we blindfolded her, tied her up and left her in a cornfield overnight.",5
23173,Bernadette,11," Oh, my God, that‰Ûªs awful.",5
23174,Penny,11," No, it was funny. Everyone laughed.",5
23175,Amy,11, Did Kathy Geiger laugh?,5
23176,Penny,11," Uh, probably. It‰Ûªs hard to say. She kind of had an ear of corn in her mouth.",5
23177,Amy,11, Who would have thought Fuzzy Fingers Fowler is best friends with a bully?,5
23178,Penny,11, What? I was not a bully.,5
23179,Bernadette,11, Kind of sounds like you were. And maybe a felon.,5
23180,Amy,11, Shh. That‰Ûªs how you wind up in a cornfield.,5
23181,Scene,11, A bar.,5
23182,Raj,11, Is that him over there?,5
23183,Leonard,11, No.,5
23184,Raj,11, How about that guy? He looks like he‰Ûªd hate you.,5
23185,Leonard,11," You know, I can really do this by myself.",5
23186,Howard,11," Hey, we‰Ûªre here to support you, buddy.",5
23187,Leonard,11," No, you‰Ûªre not. You‰Ûªre here to see if I get my underwear pulled over my head.",5
23188,Howard,11, You wore underwear? You fool.,5
23189,Raj,11," So, have you figured out what you‰Ûªre going to say to him?",5
23190,Leonard,11, You bet. I am going to make him apologize for all the crap he pulled on me in school.,5
23191,Howard,11," That‰Ûªs quite a list. I can‰Ûªt read your handwriting, what‰Ûªs that word?",5
23192,Leonard,11, Scrotum.,5
23193,Raj,11, What‰Ûªs that one?,5
23194,Leonard,11," Uh, stapled.",5
23195,Jimmy (arriving),11, Leonard.,5
23196,Leonard,11," Oh, hi.",5
23197,Jimmy,11," Holy crap, man, it‰Ûªs good to see you.",5
23198,Leonard,11," Yeah. You, too. Uh, Jimmy, this is Sheldon and Raj and Howard.",5
23199,Jimmy,11," Hi. Fellas. Hey, can I get a beer? Wow. Look at you. Little Leonard Hofstadter. I hear you‰Ûªre a big-time scientist now.",5
23200,Sheldon,11, And there‰Ûªs the first zinger. Ouch.,5
23201,Leonard,11," I‰Ûªm doing okay, I guess.",5
23202,Jimmy,11," Okay? Come on, I read online you‰Ûªre a physicist at a university, you won some medal.",5
23203,Leonard,11, The Newcomb medal.,5
23204,Jimmy,11," Yeah, congratulations.",5
23205,Sheldon,11," Congratulations? The Newcomb medal? Oh, please. That‰Ûªs the scientific equivalent of a smiley face sticker on your homework.",5
23206,Jimmy,11," From what I read, it sounded like a big deal.",5
23207,Sheldon,11," Oh, good Lord, are we going to stand here and listen to him tear Leonard apart like this?",5
23208,Raj,11," Hey, I won a Newcomb medal, too.",5
23209,Sheldon,11, My point.,5
23210,Jimmy,11," You should have seen this guy back in the day. Huh? He was so little, he could fit in just about anywhere. Lockers, trash cans. Oh, man, how did you get inside that backpack?",5
23211,Leonard,11," Oh, I can‰Ûªt take all the credit. You helped a lot.",5
23212,Jimmy,11, Yeah. We were practically a comedy team.,5
23213,Howard,11, Like the Black Death and Europe.,5
23214,Leonard,11," Jimmy, I‰Ûªm kind of curious why you wanted to see me.",5
23215,Jimmy,11," Okay, here it is. I have this great money-making idea. I just need a gear head to get it to the finish line.",5
23216,Sheldon,11," Technically, Howard‰Ûªs the gear head. Leonard‰Ûªs just a dime store laser jockey.",5
23217,Leonard,11, What‰Ûªs the idea?,5
23218,Jimmy,11," This is just between us, right?",5
23219,Leonard,11, Right.,5
23220,Jimmy,11, Okay. What do you think about a pair of glasses that makes any movie you want into 3D?,5
23221,Raj,11," That sounds amazing. First movie I‰Ûªm watching, Annie.",5
23222,Howard,11, How exactly would these glasses work?,5
23223,Jimmy,11, How the hell should I know? That‰Ûªs why I need a nerd.,5
23224,Leonard,11, I don‰Ûªt think something like that‰Ûªs even possible.,5
23225,Jimmy,11," Aw, come on, you can figure it out. You‰Ûªre like the smartest guy I‰Ûªve ever known.",5
23226,Sheldon,11," The smartest? All right, you know, I may not have a firm grasp on sarcasm, but even I know that was a doozy. Leonard, you can‰Ûªt live in fear of this man forever.",5
23227,Leonard,11," Sheldon, I got this.",5
23228,Sheldon,11," You clearly don‰Ûªt. What my spineless friend lacks the courage to say is you‰Ûªre a terrible person who took advantage of his tiny size, his uncoordinated nature and his congenital lack of masculinity.",5
23229,Leonard,11, Sheldon.,5
23230,Sheldon,11," Leonard, I platonically love you, man, but face it, you‰Ûªre a mess.",5
23231,Jimmy,11, I don‰Ûªt understand.,5
23232,Leonard,11, I think what he‰Ûªs trying to say is that maybe in high school you picked on me a little bit.,5
23233,Sheldon,11, A little bit? The man Super Glued Hershey‰Ûªs Kisses to your nipples.,5
23234,Raj,11, That‰Ûªs funny because those aren‰Ûªt the kind of kisses you want on your nipples.,5
23235,Jimmy,11, What is that?,5
23236,Sheldon,11, This is a list of your heinous acts against Leonard. One of which is certainly the cause of him wetting his bed well into his teens.,5
23237,Leonard,11," 14 is not, oh , yeah, never mind.",5
23238,Jimmy,11, What‰Ûªs this word?,5
23239,Leonard,11, Nancy. You called me Nancy for three years.,5
23240,Sheldon,11, You really need to work on your penmanship.,5
23241,Jimmy,11," Oh, man, I, I don‰Ûªt know what to say. I always thought we were just having some fun.",5
23242,Leonard,11, It wasn‰Ûªt fun for me.,5
23243,Sheldon,11," You‰Ûªre being too kind, Leonard. You ruined him.",5
23244,Leonard,11," Come on, guys.",5
23245,Raj,11," That was pretty badass, dude.",5
23246,Sheldon,11, I help the weak. It‰Ûªs yet another way I‰Ûªm exactly like Batman.,5
23247,Leonard,11," Hey, for the record, Jimmy wasn‰Ûªt the reason I wet the bed. That one has my mother written all over it.",5
23248,Scene,11, Penny‰Ûªs bedroom. Penny is on the phone.,5
23249,Penny,11," Anyway, I‰Ûªm really sorry I made fun of your stutter in high school.",5
23250,Bernadette,11, You‰Ûªre doing great.,5
23251,Penny,11," Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Oh, God, just finish the sentence. Okay, well, I‰Ûªm sorry you feel that way. Bye. No one wants to hear my apologies.",5
23252,Amy,11," I think your mistake is doing it over the phone. If they could look into your eyes, they‰Ûªd melt.",5
23253,Bernadette,11," Penny, it doesn‰Ûªt matter what you did in the past. You‰Ûªre a good person now.",5
23254,Penny,11, That‰Ûªs easy for you to say. You weren‰Ûªt just called a b-b-b-b-bitch.,5
23255,Amy,11, Perhaps you could assuage your guilt through altruism. Which word‰Ûªs tripping you up? Assuage or altruism?,5
23256,Penny,11, Both.,5
23257,Bernadette,11, You‰Ûªll feel better by doing something nice for someone.,5
23258,Penny,11, I actually knew that.,5
23259,Amy,11, I never doubted you.,5
23260,Bernadette,11, Every other week I serve at a soup kitchen downtown.,5
23261,Penny,11," Ooh, I can‰Ûªt do that. If I stand over a steaming pot, my hair just goes boing! What else could I do?",5
23262,Amy,11," There‰Ûªs Habitat for Humanity, building houses for the poor.",5
23263,Penny,11," Okay, come on, I don‰Ûªt even have my own house, I‰Ûªm going to build one for someone else?",5
23264,Amy,11, How about donating some of your clothes?,5
23265,Penny,11," Oh, my God, that‰Ûªs perfect. ‰Û÷Cause I have so many clothes I don‰Ûªt wear, and they‰Ûªre just taking up space, and I go shopping to buy more stuff and I have no place to put it. This will totally fix that.",5
23266,Bernadette,11, What about helping people?,5
23267,Penny,11, And helping people.,5
23268,Scene,11, The apartment.,5
23269,Leonard,11, Here‰Ûªs your cocoa.,5
23270,Sheldon,11," Oh, half and half instead of whole milk?",5
23271,Leonard,11, Yes.,5
23272,Sheldon,11, Heated to precisely 183 degrees?,5
23273,Leonard,11, Yes.,5
23274,Sheldon,11," Seven little marshmallows, no more no less?",5
23275,Leonard,11, You got one for good luck. (Knock on door) I‰Ûªll get it.,5
23276,Sheldon,11, One for good luck. Must be the kind of math they do at Princeton.,5
23277,Jimmy,11, Hey.,5
23278,Leonard,11, What are you doing here?,5
23279,Jimmy,11," I want to apologize for stapling your balls and throwing you naked in the girls‰Ûª locker room, stuffing that parrot down your pants. What‰Ûªs this word?",5
23280,Leonard,11, Laxative.,5
23281,Jimmy,11," Oh, right. Junior prom. That was not cool, man. I am so, so sorry.",5
23282,Leonard,11, Really?,5
23283,Jimmy,11, Yeah. I just hope you can forgive me.,5
23284,Leonard,11," Uh, yeah. Sure, I guess.",5
23285,Jimmy,11, You‰Ûªre a beautiful guy.,5
23286,Leonard,11," Well, yeah, thanks, Jimmy.",5
23287,Jimmy,11," Okay, I got to go.",5
23288,Leonard,11, Are you okay to drive?,5
23289,Jimmy,11," Yeah, yeah, yeah. I drive better drunk. You know, it makes you pay attention.",5
23290,Leonard,11," No, no, no, come on in. I‰Ûªll make you a cup of coffee.",5
23291,Jimmy,11, I wouldn‰Ûªt be imposing?,5
23292,Leonard,11, No.,5
23293,Sheldon,11, Yes.,5
23294,Leonard,11," Sheldon, we can‰Ûªt let him drive.",5
23295,Sheldon,11, Then take away his keys and make him wander the streets with the other drunks.,5
23296,Leonard,11, You remember Sheldon and Raj and Howard.,5
23297,Jimmy,11," Not really, no. It‰Ûªs funny, huh, Leonard? Back in school, I was the winner and you were the loser. And now we‰Ûªre reversed. You‰Ûªre the winner.",5
23298,Sheldon,11, You‰Ûªd think a winner could make a decent cup of cocoa.,5
23299,Jimmy,11, You mind if I use your bathroom?,5
23300,Leonard,11," Yeah, just back there.",5
23301,Howard,11," How about that? After all these years, your big bad high school bully finally apologizes.",5
23302,Leonard,11, Yeah. It kind of rekindles your faith in the basic goodness of people.,5
23303,Sheldon,11, You know what would be nice?,5
23304,Raj,11, What‰Ûªs that?,5
23305,Sheldon,11," As a symbolic gesture to all the bullies who‰Ûªve tormented us for years, we open our home to Jimmy and once he‰Ûªs asleep we kill him. I said it would be nice, I didn‰Ûªt say we should do it.",5
23306,Scene,11, The clothing bank.,5
23307,Penny,11," Ah, I feel just like Mother Teresa. Except for the virgin part. That ship sailed a long time ago.",5
23308,Bernadette,11, I think Mother Teresa would have washed the clothes first.,5
23309,Penny,11," Yeah, well, I bet her laundry room wasn‰Ûªt down five flights of stairs. You know, giving really is better than receiving. I used to think it was such a cliche, but it seems to be the‰Û_ oh, look at these cute jeans someone just threw away.",5
23310,Bernadette,11, Donated.,5
23311,Penny,11," Yes, to a poor waitress who loves a boot cut.",5
23312,Bernadette,11, Penny.,5
23313,Penny,11," Come on, they would be so cute on me, and, ah, they go great with this sweater!",5
23314,Amy,11," I don‰Ûªt think Mother Teresa‰Û_ Oh, that is adorable.",5
23315,Scene,11, The apartment.,5
23316,Sheldon,11, Leonard.,5
23317,Leonard,11, Yeah.,5
23318,Sheldon,11," In case it comes up again, this right here is an imposition.",5
23319,Leonard,11, What was I supposed to do? He needed a place to sleep it off.,5
23320,Sheldon,11, You‰Ûªre soft. This world‰Ûªs going to chew you up and spit you out.,5
23321,Jimmy (belching),11, When did I have tacos?,5
23322,Leonard,11," Morning, Jimmy.",5
23323,Sheldon,11," Oh, there it is, tacos.",5
23324,Jimmy,11," Man, I tied one on.",5
23325,Leonard,11," Yeah, you did. So, uh, listen, it was great to see you again. And , and, and thanks for the apology.",5
23326,Jimmy,11, What apology?,5
23327,Leonard,11, For all the crappy stuff you did to me in high school.,5
23328,Jimmy,11," Geez, you‰Ûªre still harping on that? What a puss.",5
23329,Leonard,11, That‰Ûªs my French toast.,5
23330,Jimmy,11," It‰Ûªs good. You really know your way around a kitchen, Nancy.",5
23331,Sheldon,11," I‰Ûªm not going to say I told you so, but we could have killed him.",5
23332,Leonard,11, I might kill him right now.,5
23333,Sheldon,11," The Dark Knight has your back. He‰Ûªs scared, but he has your back.",5
23334,Leonard,11," Okay, Jimmy, it‰Ûªs time for you to go.",5
23335,Jimmy,11," Yeah, all right, let me just finish this.",5
23336,Leonard,11," No, you‰Ûªre done. I want you out of my apartment right now.",5
23337,Sheldon,11," Well said, Boy Wonder.",5
23338,Jimmy,11, Or what?,5
23339,Sheldon,11, Don‰Ûªt answer that. It‰Ûªs a trick question. I speak from experience.,5
23340,Leonard,11," I‰Ûªm not afraid of you any more, Jimmy. Now get out! (Pushes him) Uh-oh.",5
23341,Scene,11, Running down the stairwell.,5
23342,Sheldon,11," You did it, Leonard, you stood up to your bully.",5
23343,Leonard,11," Yeah, I feel pretty good about myself. You think we can outrun him?",5
23344,Sheldon,11," I don‰Ûªt need to outrun him, I just need to outrun you.",5
23345,Scene,11, The clothes bank.,5
23346,Bernadette,11, I don‰Ûªt feel good about this.,5
23347,Penny,11, Then sit in the car and keep it running.,5
23348,Amy,11," You were right, a whole new load.",5
23349,Penny,11," Come on, yoga top. Mama needs a new yoga top.",5
23350,Amy,11," Check it out, Bernadette, suede boots, your size.",5
23351,Bernadette,11," God, they‰Ûªre cute. Oh, why did they have to be cute?",5
23352,Penny,11," Wait, wait, wait, guys, just hang on.",5
23353,Amy,11," What is it, the fuzz?",5
23354,Penny,11, Look at us. What are we doing?,5
23355,Amy,11," I was gleefully following you to a life of crime, looking forward to the day we might be cell mates. I don‰Ûªt know about Bernadette.",5
23356,Penny,11," You know, this is wrong. Let‰Ûªs put everything back. Here.",5
23357,Bernadette (taking boots and running),11," It‰Ûªs okay, I serve soup to poor people!",5
23358,Scene,12, The apartment.,5
23359,Howard,12, Completely empty box. If you‰Ûªd like to examine it?,5
23360,Leonard,12, Mm-hmm. Yep. I see nothing in this box but a wasted childhood.,5
23361,Howard,12," Little snarky there, cello lessons. And we have this completely ordinary cylinder. If you‰Ûªd like to examine it?",5
23362,Raj,12," Ordinary, yet I sense it is dripping with magical potential.",5
23363,Sheldon,12," Oh, dear Lord. A man pops out for a moment to evacuate his bowels and catch up on the adventures of the Caped Crusader, only to emerge and discover his apartment has been transformed into a cabaret.",5
23364,Leonard,12," Sheldon, he‰Ûªs just practising for his cousin‰Ûªs birthday party.",5
23365,Howard,12," As I was saying, empty box, empty cylinder, and, ooh, voila. (Pulls out a goldfish in a jar)",5
23366,Raj,12," I‰Ûªm telling you, dude, there‰Ûªs a seat on the Hogwarts Express with your name on it.",5
23367,Sheldon,12, This is how you‰Ûªre going to entertain your little cousin and his friends? By lying to them?,5
23368,Howard,12, How is this lying?,5
23369,Sheldon,12, A magic show is an inherently deceitful proposition. This is an ordinary top hat. You‰Ûªve chosen that card freely. I do not have a set of lock picks lodged in my keister.,5
23370,Raj,12," Can‰Ûªt you just enjoy the wonder, Sheldon? Why must you peek behind the curtain? Or up the butt?",5
23371,Sheldon,12," If we poison the critical thinking faculties of children by telling them that rabbits come out of hats, then we create adults who believe in astrology and homeopathy and that Ryan Reynolds was a better choice for Green Lantern than lovable rogue Nathan Fillion.",5
23372,Leonard,12," Sheldon, he‰Ûªs just gonna do a few magic tricks for some kids. I really don‰Ûªt think they‰Ûªre gonna end up liking the Green Lantern movie.",5
23373,Howard,12, Don‰Ûªt be so hard on him. It‰Ûªs natural to be a little cranky when you have a quarter in your ear!,5
23374,Sheldon,12," Coins lodged in body parts is not a source of amusement. When I was five, Billy Sparks put a Mexican peso up my nose.",5
23375,Howard,12, How is that not amusing?,5
23376,Sheldon,12, It‰Ûªs still there. Takes me 45 minutes to get through airport security. (Storms out),5
23377,Howard,12," Look, I made Sheldon disappear. Ta-da.",5
23378,Leonard,12," Next time, you should open with that.",5
23379,Scene,12, The Cheesecake Factory.,5
23380,Penny,12," Ooh, look who‰Ûªs out on a date. Pasadena‰Ûªs favourite power couple, Shamy.",5
23381,Sheldon,12," And that is the answer to the question, what is wrong with eating at The Cheesecake Factory?",5
23382,Penny,12," So, are we celebrating anything special tonight?",5
23383,Amy,12," Oh, yes. Our relationship agreement specifies that the second Thursday of every month, or the third Thursday in a month with five Thursdays, is date night.",5
23384,Penny,12, That is so hot.,5
23385,Sheldon,12," All right, without objection, the minutes of the previous date are considered read and agreed to. Any new business?",5
23386,Amy,12, How was your day?,5
23387,Sheldon,12," Superb. This morning I made a palindrome with my Alpha-Bits. Nice hat, Bob Tahecin.",5
23388,Amy,12, Sounds like you hit the ground running. I have a bit of good news myself. My most recent paper on how a cooperative long-term potentiation can map memory sequences in dendritic branches made the cover of Neuron.,5
23389,Sheldon,12," Ooh! Speaking of good news, somebody just hit 100 Twitter followers.",5
23390,Amy,12," That‰Ûªs nice. Anyway, I‰Ûªve been dreaming of this day for a long time.",5
23391,Sheldon,12," Yeah, me, too. Triple digits, I‰Ûªm not gonna lie, feels pretty good.",5
23392,Amy,12," Sheldon, I‰Ûªm the sole author on a paper being published in a distinguished journal that may change the course of my field.",5
23393,Sheldon,12," Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Ooh, 101! Air‰Ûªs getting a bit thin up here.",5
23394,Penny,12," So, are we ready to order?",5
23395,Amy,12, Give me a minute. I‰Ûªm gonna go wash up.,5
23396,Sheldon,12," Well, that‰Ûªs odd. We both washed up when we came in. It‰Ûªs probably a euphemism for urination.",5
23397,Penny,12," Sheldon, what is wrong with you?",5
23398,Sheldon,12," Not much. Although, I can be faulted for being overly fond of koala bears. I don‰Ûªt know what it is, when they smart munching on eucalyptus, I just melt inside.",5
23399,Penny,12," Okay, Amy just told you some exciting news, and you acted like it was no big deal.",5
23400,Sheldon,12," Oh, I see why you‰Ûªre confused. No, her news sounded important, but what you‰Ûªre forgetting is, it was an achievement in the field of biology. That‰Ûªs all about yucky, squishy things.",5
23401,Penny,12," Honey, she‰Ûªs upset. You‰Ûªre her boyfriend. You have to at least try to be excited by the things she‰Ûªs excited by.",5
23402,Sheldon,12, What if they simply don‰Ûªt excite me?,5
23403,Penny,12," Well, just smile and think about koalas.",5
23404,Sheldon,12," She‰Ûªd see right through that. We go to the zoo all the time. She knows my koala face. And for future reference, it‰Ûªs this.",5
23405,Scene,12, Howard‰Ûªs bedroom.,5
23406,Bernadette,12," Oh, you have a lot of magic stuff.",5
23407,Howard,12, Yeah. I started when I was a teenager. I thought I could show a girl a few tricks and invite her up to my bedroom to see the rest of the act.,5
23408,Bernadette,12, Did it work?,5
23409,Howard,12," Ah, let‰Ûªs just say the only wand that ever saw any action was this one. Oh, look what my mom made us for the act.",5
23410,Bernadette,12, Ooh. I like the fabric. Where‰Ûªd she get it?,5
23411,Howard,12," Well, she cut up one of her old bathing suits. She made these two vests and half a dozen napkins.",5
23412,Mrs Wolowitz (off),12, Has she tried on the vest yet?,5
23413,Howard,12, I just gave it to her!,5
23414,Mrs Wolowitz (off),12," I hope it fits, she has a tricky figure! She‰Ûªs short and stacked, like me!",5
23415,Howard,12," She‰Ûªs not stacked like you, Ma! She never steps on hers!",5
23416,Bernadette,12," Listen, Howie, maybe I‰Ûªm not the best choice to be a magician‰Ûªs assistant.",5
23417,Howard,12, You‰Ûªll do fine. Hand me those rings? See? You nailed it.,5
23418,Bernadette,12," You know, i-it‰Ûªs just that I‰Ûªm not that comfortable with little kids.",5
23419,Howard,12," Well, that‰Ûªs because you haven‰Ûªt been around them much. This is good practice. I mean, you are gonna be a mom someday, right?",5
23420,Bernadette,12," Mmm, yeah, sure.",5
23421,Howard,12," Oh-ho-ho! I haven‰Ûªt seen this trick in years. It‰Ûªs called the dove pan. You let everyone see the pan is empty, but there‰Ûªs a secret compartment in the lid. And then you open it and produce a live‰Û_ Don‰Ûªt look in there.",5
23422,Scene,12, The apartment.,5
23423,Leonard,12," Oh, a little Red Dead Redemption, huh?",5
23424,Sheldon,12, Yes.,5
23425,Leonard,12, How come you‰Ûªre not doing a mission? You‰Ûªre just wandering around.,5
23426,Sheldon,12, Had a rough night. I thought I‰Ûªd go for a walk and clear my head.,5
23427,Leonard,12, Some people go outside and do that.,5
23428,Sheldon,12," It‰Ûªs after nine o‰Ûªclock, at this hour the streets of Pasadena are teeming with drunken sailors and alley cats.",5
23429,Leonard,12, You want to talk about it?,5
23430,Sheldon,12, No. I think I‰Ûªll just go in this saloon and drink my troubles away.,5
23431,Leonard,12, You know digital alcohol is never a solution. What‰Ûªs going on?,5
23432,Sheldon,12," Hard as this may be to believe, it‰Ûªs possible that I‰Ûªm not boyfriend material.",5
23433,Leonard,12, Glad I was sitting down for that. Did you and Amy get in a fight?,5
23434,Sheldon,12, Amy had a fight. I was being perfectly reasonable. I‰Ûªm gonna have a whiskey. Do you want anything?,5
23435,Leonard,12," No, I can‰Ûªt. I‰Ûªm playing Grand Theft Auto later. Look, I‰Ûªm no expert in women.",5
23436,Sheldon,12, I‰Ûªll say.,5
23437,Leonard,12, That‰Ûªs not necessary when someone‰Ûªs trying to help you.,5
23438,Sheldon,12, I‰Ûªm sorry. It‰Ûªs the alcohol talking. Go on.,5
23439,Leonard,12, Sometimes with women you want to listen to what upsets them and then show them that you can grow and change.,5
23440,Sheldon,12, Nuts to that. What else you got?,5
23441,Leonard,12, I don‰Ûªt know what to tell you. Buy her something.,5
23442,Sheldon,12, How does that work?,5
23443,Leonard,12," Well, you skip over any attempt to repair your emotional connection and you win back her affection with an empty financial gesture.",5
23444,Sheldon,12," Well, that approach has Sheldon Cooper written all over it.",5
23445,Leonard,12, Glad I could help.,5
23446,Sheldon,12," It‰Ûªs appreciated. And if you ever manage to find a woman again, I‰Ûªll be glad to return the favour.",5
23447,Scene,12, The birthday party.,5
23448,Howard,12," And now, all the rings are magically linked together. My fiancee‰Ûªs wearing a magic ring, too. It made all my money disappear.",5
23449,Bernadette,12," Oh, ah, right. (Bangs drum and cymbal) And now, the great Howdini‰Ûªs next miraculous illusion.",5
23450,Child,12, When are we gonna have cake?,5
23451,Bernadette,12, After you‰Ûªve been thoroughly amazed.,5
23452,Child,12, But we want cake now.,5
23453,Bernadette,12," Well, you‰Ûªre not getting cake right now, capisce?",5
23454,Howard,12," Okay. Okay. Now, my lovely assistant is going to bring me an ordinary pitcher of milk.",5
23455,Second child,12, I know how you do that trick.,5
23456,Bernadette,12, Do you know how to pipe down?,5
23457,Howard,12," Okay, we‰Ûªre going to roll up this newspaper.",5
23458,Second child,12, It‰Ûªs a fake pitcher.,5
23459,Bernadette,12, You got wax in your ears? The man said it‰Ûªs an ordinary pitcher. Howdini.,5
23460,Howard,12," Okay, we‰Ûªre going to stick this in here (puts newspaper into trouser waistband) and then I‰Ûªm going to pour in the milk. I hope this works, because I didn‰Ûªt bring a change of pants.",5
23461,Second child,12," Look, I Googled it. It‰Ûªs a fake pitcher.",5
23462,Bernadette,12, That‰Ûªs it. No cake for you. Anyone else want to join the No Cake Club?,5
23463,Howard,12," She‰Ûªs just kidding, boys and girls. Everyone gets cake.",5
23464,Bernadette,12, Not him.,5
23465,Howard,12, Just give me the pitcher. Behold! Wrong pitcher.,5
23466,Scene,12, Bernadette‰Ûªs car.,5
23467,Bernadette,12, I told you I‰Ûªm not good with kids.,5
23468,Howard,12," Yes, you did. Oh, I think my crotch is starting to curdle.",5
23469,Bernadette,12," The thing is, my mother worked full-time. I had to take care of my brothers and sisters.",5
23470,Howard,12," Yeah, so?",5
23471,Bernadette,12," Ugh, it was horrible. With their snotty noses and their poopy diapers and their little shrieky voices, always complaining. I don‰Ûªt want to get dressed. Joey keeps spitting in my mouth. This isn‰Ûªt the way Mom makes waffles. Well, okay, put your hand in here. Let‰Ûªs see how you like this waffle!",5
23472,Howard,12," All right, settle down. Red light. Red light, red light! Okay, we‰Ûªre fine.",5
23473,Bernadette,12," I‰Ûªm sorry. I know it makes me sound like a bad person, but I just don‰Ûªt like children.",5
23474,Howard,12," Yeah, no, we all got that. But don‰Ûªt you think it‰Ûªll be different when the child is ours?",5
23475,Bernadette,12," Right, when it‰Ûªs our kid that‰Ûªs ruined my body and kept me up all night and I‰Ûªve got no career and no future and nothing to be happy about for the next 20 years, sure, that‰Ûªll be completely different.",5
23476,Howard,12," Well, yeah.",5
23477,Scene,12, A jewellery store.,5
23478,Sheldon,12, I don‰Ûªt think there‰Ûªs anything in this jewellery store that Amy would appreciate more than the humidifier we were just looking at at Sears.,5
23479,Penny,12," Oh, my God, now I know what I sound like to you when I say stupid stuff.",5
23480,Sheldon,12," Ooh, a pocket watch.",5
23481,Penny,12," Okay, I don‰Ûªt think Amy wants a pocket watch.",5
23482,Sheldon,12," No, but maybe she wants a man with a pocket watch.",5
23483,Penny,12," Still saying stupid stuff. Ooh, does she like bracelets?",5
23484,Sheldon,12," Well, she‰Ûªs very fond of her silver one that says allergic to penicillin. Maybe they have a dressier version of that?",5
23485,Assistant,12," Well, how are we doing this afternoon? Are we looking for anything special? Perhaps a ring for the lady?",5
23486,Penny,12," (Snorts) Trust me, we are not a couple.",5
23487,Sheldon,12, Excuse me. I don‰Ûªt see why you get to snort derisively and point that out. You‰Ûªd be lucky to land a fella like me.,5
23488,Penny,12," Fine, go ahead.",5
23489,Sheldon,12," (Snorts) Trust me, we are not a couple.",5
23490,Assistant,12, My apologies. How can I help you today?,5
23491,Penny,12, He‰Ûªs in trouble with his girlfriend and needs to buy her a present.,5
23492,Assistant,12," Great, trouble with girlfriends is what‰Ûªs putting my daughter through USC.",5
23493,Penny,12," Ooh, are these real diamonds?",5
23494,Assistant,12," Yes. Channel set baguettes, 20 points total weight.",5
23495,Sheldon,12," Remarkable. Diamonds, crystallized carbon. Every day, people go to the grocery store and come home with sacks full of carbon in the form of charcoal briquettes that they toss in their barbeques and set on fire. But just because you‰Ûªve got some carbon with the atoms stacked neatly, you expect me to plunk down thousands of dollars.",5
23496,Assistant,12," Actually, that‰Ûªs only 750. Everything‰Ûªs on sale.",5
23497,Sheldon,12, Really. Talk to me about that pocket watch.,5
23498,Scene,12, The apartment. The guys are playing Donkey Kong Jenga.,5
23499,Howard,12, I‰Ûªm still trying to wrap my mind around it. I always thought I‰Ûªd be a dad someday.,5
23500,Raj,12," Oh, me, too. You‰Ûªre so caring. I‰Ûªve often pictured you guiding a young boy into manhood.",5
23501,Leonard,12," There you go, Howard. Sounds like Raj‰Ûªll have your babies, problem solved.",5
23502,Raj,12," Hey, just because a man shows caring for another man doesn‰Ûªt mean he‰Ûªs displaying the love that dare not speak its name. Did she definitely say she didn‰Ûªt want kids?",5
23503,Howard,12," Yeah, she doesn‰Ûªt like them. And from what I saw, the feeling was mutual.",5
23504,Leonard,12, What are you gonna do?,5
23505,Howard,12," I don‰Ûªt know. I can‰Ûªt see a life where I don‰Ûªt have kids. I mean, people have kids. I mean, even Donkey Kong had Donkey Kong Jr. So he could teach someone how to kidnap princesses and throw barrels at Italian plumbers.",5
23506,Leonard,12," You know, there‰Ûªs no guarantee even if you have kids that you‰Ûªre going to like them.",5
23507,Raj,12," Wow, that‰Ûªs rough. Where‰Ûªd you get that?",5
23508,Leonard,12, It‰Ûªs right off the dust jacket of my mom‰Ûªs last book.,5
23509,Howard,12, Maybe me and Bernadette aren‰Ûªt right for each other.,5
23510,Leonard,12," Look, Howard, I‰Ûªd say there‰Ûªs a lot of fish in the sea, but I watched you dangle your hook in the water for years. Do not throw her back.",5
23511,Howard,12," I don‰Ûªt want to, but this is kind of a deal breaker.",5
23512,Raj,12, What‰Ûªs your mom going to say if you call off the wedding?,5
23513,Howard,12," Huh, it‰Ûªll kill her. On the other hand, if I don‰Ûªt give her grandchildren, that‰Ûªll kill her, too. So, either way, on the Mom front, I‰Ûªm golden.",5
23514,Scene,12, Penny‰Ûªs apartment.,5
23515,Sheldon,12, What time did you tell Amy to be here?,5
23516,Penny,12," Eight o‰Ûªclock. (Sheldon checks pocket watch) Sheldon, that pocket watch is ridiculous.",5
23517,Sheldon,12, Nonsense. I look like a train conductor. Under what pretext did you lure her here?,5
23518,Penny,12," I said, hey, want to come over and hang out?",5
23519,Sheldon,12," Good, good, if you had said something clever, she might‰Ûªve gotten suspicious.",5
23520,Amy,12, Hey.,5
23521,Penny,12, Hi.,5
23522,Amy,12, What‰Ûªs he doing here?,5
23523,Penny,12," Okay, he wants to talk to you.",5
23524,Amy,12," Well, I don‰Ûªt want to talk to him. And I‰Ûªm pretty disappointed in you, too. Although we both know that won‰Ûªt last.",5
23525,Penny,12," Sheldon, you‰Ûªre up.",5
23526,Sheldon,12," Thank you. Amy, I‰Ûªd like to apologize. Your accomplishment was impressive. And I‰Ûªm proud of you.",5
23527,Amy,12, We both know that‰Ûªs your koala face.,5
23528,Sheldon,12, I told you.,5
23529,Penny,12," Okay, look, he bought you this.",5
23530,Amy,12," Jewellery? Seriously? Sheldon, you are the most shallow, self-centred person I have ever met. Do you really think another transparently manip..oh! It‰Ûªs a tiara! A tiara! I have a tiara! Put it on me, put it on me, put it on me, put it on me, put it on me, put it on me, put it on me.",5
23531,Penny,12, You look beautiful.,5
23532,Amy,12," Of course I do, I‰Ûªm a princess, and this is my tiara!",5
23533,Sheldon,12," You‰Ûªre right, the tiara was too much.",5
23534,Scene,12, Howard‰Ûªs bedroom.,5
23535,Mrs Wolowitz (off),12," Howard! Bernadette‰Ûªs‰Û_ Oh, she slipped right by me.",5
23536,Bernadette,12, Here‰Ûªs your vest back.,5
23537,Howard,12, You should keep it. You could wear it again sometime.,5
23538,Bernadette,12, Where?,5
23539,Howard,12," I don‰Ûªt know, hunting?",5
23540,Mrs Wolowitz (off),12, Don‰Ûªt forget to talk to her about this mishegas where I don‰Ûªt get grandkids!,5
23541,Howard,12," Don‰Ûªt worry, Ma. I will, as soon as I can figure out a way to bring up such a sensitive issue!",5
23542,Bernadette,12," I guess you talked to your mom, huh?",5
23543,Howard,12," I was upset. My mom can be a pretty good shoulder to cry on, if the smell of Bengay doesn‰Ûªt burn your eyes.",5
23544,Bernadette,12," Look, it‰Ûªs obvious having kids is really important to you, and I think I came up with a solution.",5
23545,Howard,12, Really? That‰Ûªs great. What?,5
23546,Bernadette,12," Well, seeing as how I make way more money than you anyway, what if I work and you stay home with the kids?",5
23547,Howard,12, Me?,5
23548,Bernadette,12," Yeah. You know, you‰Ûªll watch Barney and pull Cheerios out of their noses and go on play dates, and I‰Ûªll work and have conversations with people my own age and enjoy my life.",5
23549,Howard,12, Yeah.,5
23550,Bernadette,12," Yay, so we‰Ûªre good.",5
23551,Howard,12," Yeah, we‰Ûªre good.",5
23552,Bernadette,12," You know, I don‰Ûªt know if this counted as a fight, but how about some make-up sex?",5
23553,Howard,12," I would love that. But what is that behind your ear? Oh, look, it‰Ûªs a condom.",5
23554,Scene,13, The stairwell.,5
23555,Leonard,13," You feel like trying something new for dinner? Maybe Indian, Tex-Mex?",5
23556,Sheldon,13, You ever wonder how humans would be different if they evolved from lizards instead of mammals?,5
23557,Leonard,13," Okay, let‰Ûªs talk about that.",5
23558,Sheldon,13," As you know, lizards, cold-blooded animals, lack the ability to sense temperature. But they do move more sluggishly when it‰Ûªs cold. So, lizard weathermen would say things like, bring a sweater, it‰Ûªs slow outside. I love my mind.",5
23559,Leonard,13," We all do. Now, how about dinner?",5
23560,Sheldon,13," Oh, I would assume we‰Ûªd enjoy insects or smaller lizards. We could also pull each other‰Ûªs tails off and grill them, they‰Ûªll just grow back. Oh! My life-size cardboard Mr. Spock is here! I know he wouldn‰Ûªt care for an outburst of human emotion, but, oh goodie, oh goodie, oh goodie. Commander Spock requesting permission to be unfolded.",5
23561,Leonard (seeing Penny‰Ûªs door open and the girls inside),13, Excuse me.,5
23562,Sheldon,13," Permission granted, Commander.",5
23563,Amy,13," Which is why the more intelligent the monkey, the more faeces they fling.",5
23564,Leonard,13," Excuse me, Amy. Penny, do you have plans for dinner tonight?",5
23565,Penny,13," Why, you guys going somewhere?",5
23566,Leonard,13," No, I mean just you and me.",5
23567,Penny,13," You mean, like a date?",5
23568,Leonard,13," Not like a date, a date.",5
23569,Amy,13, Ooh!,5
23570,Bernadette,13, Ooh!,5
23571,Penny,13," Um, o-okay. Sure.",5
23572,Amy,13, Ooh!,5
23573,Bernadette,13, Ooh!,5
23574,Sheldon,13," Oh, no! They sent the wrong Spock! Live long and suck it, Zachary Quinto.",5
23575,Scene,13, Penny‰Ûªs bedroom.,5
23576,Bernadette,13," This is so exciting. If Leonard and Penny get back together, Howard and I can go on double dates with them.",5
23577,Amy,13, How come you never invite Sheldon and me on a double date?,5
23578,Bernadette,13," Mm, uh‰Û_ How‰Ûªs it going in there, Penny?",5
23579,Penny,13, Just a sec. (Emerges in revealing slinky green dress) Too much?,5
23580,Bernadette,13, Yes.,5
23581,Amy,13, No.,5
23582,Penny,13," Okay, just hang on.",5
23583,Amy,13," You just can‰Ûªt handle her raw sexuality, can you?",5
23584,Bernadette,13, When did you and Leonard break up?,5
23585,Penny,13," Uh, about two years ago.",5
23586,Bernadette,13, Why do you think he asked you out again?,5
23587,Penny,13, I don‰Ûªt know.,5
23588,Amy,13, Maybe he‰Ûªs dying. That would be so romantic.,5
23589,Penny,13, He‰Ûªs not dying.,5
23590,Amy,13," Too bad. If he were, she could just throw him in bed and ride him right up until he flatlines.",5
23591,Penny,13, How about this?,5
23592,Bernadette,13, Maybe.,5
23593,Amy,13, Come on.,5
23594,Penny,13," Yeah, okay, no.",5
23595,Bernadette,13, Do you think you‰Ûªll sleep with him tonight?,5
23596,Penny,13," Absolutely not. Look, we‰Ûªre just gonna have dinner and, you know, see how it goes.",5
23597,Amy,13," If he were dying, would you sleep with him?",5
23598,Penny,13, What?,5
23599,Amy,13," Assuming he were dying of something that couldn‰Ûªt be sexually transmitted. You know, like a spear wound to the head.",5
23600,Penny,13," Okay, he is not dying.",5
23601,Amy,13, How do you know? Are you a doctor?,5
23602,Bernadette,13," You can make-believe, though. Sometimes Howard and I pretend that his arrhythmia is acting up and I‰Ûªm a sexy cardiologist. And the naughty part is I‰Ûªm not in his HMO network.",5
23603,Penny,13, Screw it. I‰Ûªm not gonna make a big deal out of this. It‰Ûªs just dinner.,5
23604,Amy,13, With a dead man.,5
23605,Penny,13," Amy, stop it. Oh, God, I‰Ûªm so nervous.",5
23606,Bernadette,13, Relax. You know Leonard‰Ûªs always been crazy about you. It‰Ûªs gonna be great.,5
23607,Penny,13," I know, but we‰Ûªve finally gotten to a place where we can hang out without it being weird. And what if something goes wrong? Then what?",5
23608,Amy,13, Guess it‰Ûªll just be Sheldon and me going on a double date with Howard and Bernadette.,5
23609,Bernadette,13," Sure, we‰Ûªd love that. Change your clothes, we got a lot riding on this.",5
23610,Scene,13, The apartment. The guys are playing a board game.,5
23611,Sheldon,13," Mm. I want to build a road, but I need wood. Do either of you fellows have wood? (Raj and Howard snigger) I don‰Ûªt understand the laughter. The object of Settlers of Catan is to build roads and settlements. To do so requires wood. Now, I have sheep; I need wood. Who has wood for my sheep?",5
23612,Leonard,13," Okay, how do I look?",5
23613,Howard,13," Well, more to the point, why are you doing this?",5
23614,Leonard,13, What are you talking about?,5
23615,Raj,13, Did you forget what Penny did to you? It took you two years and defiling my sister to turn that frown upside down.,5
23616,Leonard,13," I didn‰Ûªt defile your sister, we had a relationship.",5
23617,Raj,13," I heard you call her Brown Sugar. In my book, that‰Ûªs defilement.",5
23618,Sheldon,13, You want to know my opinion?,5
23619,Leonard,13," Oh, boy, do I?",5
23620,Sheldon,13, Sarcasm?,5
23621,Howard,13, No.,5
23622,Sheldon,13," All right, then. The reason you‰Ûªre fixated on a good-natured simpleton like Penny is that she‰Ûªs the exact opposite of your first romantic attachment, your brilliant yet intimidating mother.",5
23623,Leonard,13, Where on earth did you get that from?,5
23624,Sheldon,13," It‰Ûªs in her book, Needy Baby, Greedy Baby.",5
23625,Leonard,13, That doesn‰Ûªt make it true.,5
23626,Sheldon,13," It‰Ûªs called non-fiction for a reason, Leonard.",5
23627,Leonard,13, See you later.,5
23628,Raj,13," If they ever make a movie version of that book, you know who should play Leonard‰Ûªs mother? Sandra Bullock.",5
23629,Howard,13, Why?,5
23630,Raj,13, Because she‰Ûªs great in everything.,5
23631,Sheldon,13," Now, where were we? Oh, yes. Does anyone have any wood? Oh, come on! I just want wood. Why are you making it so hard?",5
23632,Scene,13, A restaurant.,5
23633,Leonard,13," So, do they have a name for a first date with someone you used to go out with?",5
23634,Penny,13," Oh, that‰Ûªs a good question. How about awkward?",5
23635,Leonard,13," Yeah, that sounds right.",5
23636,Penny,13, Yeah?,5
23637,Leonard,13," Hey, how about if we pretend we‰Ûªre actually on a first date? See how that goes.",5
23638,Penny,13, Okay.,5
23639,Leonard,13," So, Polly, tell me about yourself.",5
23640,Penny,13, It‰Ûªs Penny.,5
23641,Leonard,13," Oh, sorry, yeah. Awkward.",5
23642,Penny,13," Okay, uh, let‰Ûªs see. I‰Ûªm from Nebraska, and ever since I was a little girl, I dreamed of moving to L.A. and becoming a movie star. Anyway, after four years of acting lessons and waiting tables, I‰Ûªve done a haemorrhoid commercial and a production of Anne Frank above a bowling alley. So, you know, dreams do come true. Your turn.",5
23643,Leonard,13," Uh, let‰Ûªs see. Uh, I am an experimental physicist at Cal-Tech, most of my research is with high-powered lasers, and, oh, I‰Ûªve just gotten a big government grant to see if they can be used to knock out incoming ballistic missiles.",5
23644,Penny,13, Wow. Can they?,5
23645,Leonard,13," Oh, God, no. The money‰Ûªs pretty good. And I used the equipment to make my own Bat-signal.",5
23646,Penny,13," Bat-signal? What are you, some kind of nerd?",5
23647,Leonard,13," Not some kind of nerd, I am the king of the nerds.",5
23648,Penny,13, What does that mean?,5
23649,Leonard,13," Uh, it means if anyone displeases me, I don‰Ûªt help them set up their printer.",5
23650,Penny,13, You are so funny.,5
23651,Leonard,13, Good. Remember that when I take my shirt off.,5
23652,Penny,13," Leonard, this is nice. I‰Ûªm so glad we did this.",5
23653,Leonard,13," Me, too. So what do you think? Are we gonna get back together?",5
23654,Penny,13, Whoa. Not so fast.,5
23655,Leonard,13," I‰Ûªm sorry, what did I say?",5
23656,Penny,13," Leonard, you know I will always have feelings for you.",5
23657,Leonard,13," Oh, God.",5
23658,Penny,13, What?,5
23659,Leonard,13, You said always. You‰Ûªll always have feelings for me.,5
23660,Penny,13, So?,5
23661,Leonard,13," So, that sounds more like something you‰Ûªd say if you didn‰Ûªt want a relationship with someone. This isn‰Ûªt working out, but I‰Ûªll always have feelings for you. I‰Ûªm sorry I slept with your best friend, but I‰Ûªll always have feelings for you. Here‰Ûªs the thing, Lisa, I‰Ûªm into dudes now, but I‰Ûªll always have feelings for you.",5
23662,Penny,13, How would you say it?,5
23663,Leonard,13, I have feelings for you.,5
23664,Penny,13, It‰Ûªs the same thing.,5
23665,Leonard,13," No, it‰Ûªs not. Always made it worse.",5
23666,Penny,13, You‰Ûªre overthinking this.,5
23667,Leonard,13," No, I‰Ûªm not.",5
23668,Penny,13," Yes, you are. You always overthink things.",5
23669,Leonard,13, Ah now th-th-there you go. Always made it worse.,5
23670,Penny,13," See, this is where everything goes wrong, when we talk.",5
23671,Leonard,13," Well, I don‰Ûªt know how you have a relationship without talking.",5
23672,Penny,13," Hey, I went out with this guy TJ for eight months, we never talked. To this day, I don‰Ûªt even know what TJ stands for.",5
23673,Leonard,13," Wait, if you guys didn‰Ûªt talk, what did you‰Û_ never mind, stupid question.",5
23674,Scene,13, The apartment.,5
23675,Sheldon,13," And now that I have some wood, I‰Ûªm going to begin the erection of my settlement.",5
23676,Raj,13, He‰Ûªs got to be doing this on purpose.,5
23677,Howard (as Leonard enters),13," Ooh, eight thirty. You and Penny decide to go out and paint the town beige?",5
23678,Leonard,13, You‰Ûªre thirty years old and you live with your mother.,5
23679,Raj,13, I guess it didn‰Ûªt go well.,5
23680,Sheldon,13, We don‰Ûªt know that. Not to a certainty. All we know is that Leonard is home.,5
23681,Howard (as Leonard groans loudly in his room),13, How about now?,5
23682,Sheldon,13," Again, not enough evidence. For all we know, he‰Ûªs being murdered. Now, back to our game.",5
23683,Raj,13, You were in the middle of an erection.,5
23684,Sheldon,13," Oh, of course. It‰Ûªs right here in my hand.",5
23685,Scene,13, Leonard‰Ûªs bedroom. Leonard‰Ûªs phone text signal sounds.,5
23686,Leonard,13," What does she want from me now? (Goes to front door, where Penny is waiting) What‰Ûªs up?",5
23687,Penny,13," Do not overthink this. (Kisses him, then leads him to her apartment.) ",5
23688,Leonard,13, I don‰Ûªt understand.,5
23689,Penny,13, Bup-bup-bup-bup-bup-bup-bup.,5
23690,Leonard,13," Okay, but earlier it seemed like‰Û_",5
23691,Penny,13, No talking.,5
23692,Leonard,13, Even during? ‰Û÷Cause sometimes I have questions.,5
23693,Scene,13, Penny‰Ûªs bedroom. They are in bed.,5
23694,Penny,13," Well, that was fun.",5
23695,Leonard,13," Yeah, except for when I got the foot cramp.",5
23696,Penny,13," You hung in there, though.",5
23697,Leonard,13," Well, there was a lot at stake.",5
23698,Penny,13, So what do you want to do now?,5
23699,Leonard,13," Well, I want to go get my asthma inhaler, but it might ruin the moment. Just, just help me out here. How does a miserable date end in sex?",5
23700,Penny,13," I don‰Ûªt know, it‰Ûªs complicated.",5
23701,Leonard,13," Well, I‰Ûªm a pretty smart guy, and right now my brain has dibs on the blood supply, so give it a go.",5
23702,Penny,13," Okay, it‰Ûªs just, at the restaurant when you said you wanted us to be together again, it got very real very fast and I panicked.",5
23703,Leonard,13, Why? What are you afraid of?,5
23704,Penny,13," Well, what if we do go out and I do something stupid and dump you again?",5
23705,Leonard,13, What if I dump you?,5
23706,Penny,13," Come on, be serious.",5
23707,Leonard,13," Well, how about if we don‰Ûªt think about this as a relationship? It could be more like a new version of software. Penny and Leonard 2.0. We can test it internally, shake out the bugs, and if we both feel it‰Ûªs solid, then we‰Ûªll roll it out to the public.",5
23708,Penny,13, So we don‰Ûªt tell people we‰Ûªre back together?,5
23709,Leonard,13, Exactly. We pretend like our date went badly.,5
23710,Penny,13," Well, we don‰Ûªt really have to pretend.",5
23711,Leonard,13, And we let them think that we decided to just be friends and that everything‰Ûªs cool.,5
23712,Penny,13," Okay, great. Hey, I just remembered. I still got one of your inhalers.",5
23713,Leonard,13, I can‰Ûªt believe you kept this.,5
23714,Penny,13," Yeah, I was gonna throw it away, but I just couldn‰Ûªt.",5
23715,Leonard,13, That is so sweet. In 25 to 30 minutes I‰Ûªm gonna show you how much this means to me.,5
23716,Scene,13, The apartment. Leonard is sneaking back in.,5
23717,Sheldon,13, Leonard?,5
23718,Leonard,13," Yeah, hi, hi. How‰Ûªs it going?",5
23719,Sheldon,13," Uh, can‰Ûªt complain. Thanks for asking. Well, what were you doing out at three o‰Ûªclock in the morning?",5
23720,Leonard,13," Well, uh, uh, what are you doing up?",5
23721,Sheldon,13, I was using the bathroom.,5
23722,Leonard,13," Yeah, well, so was I.",5
23723,Sheldon,13, Really? I didn‰Ûªt see you in there.,5
23724,Leonard,13," Obviously, when I saw that you were in ours, I went and used another one.",5
23725,Sheldon,13, Where?,5
23726,Leonard,13," The, the gas station across the street.",5
23727,Sheldon,13, In your pyjamas?,5
23728,Leonard,13, Yes.,5
23729,Sheldon,13, Without shoes?,5
23730,Leonard,13, Yes.,5
23731,Sheldon,13, On a cold winter‰Ûªs night?,5
23732,Leonard,13, Yes.,5
23733,Sheldon,13, Seems unlikely. Did you bring your asthma inhaler?,5
23734,Leonard,13," Uh, uh, uh, yes, I did.",5
23735,Sheldon,13," Well, then, I guess it‰Ûªs plausible. Hang on a second, mister.",5
23736,Leonard,13, What?,5
23737,Sheldon,13," After you used the facilities at the gas station, did you make a purchase?",5
23738,Leonard,13, What?,5
23739,Sheldon,13," It‰Ûªs customary, when using the rest room at a retail establishment, to make a small purchase. Did you?",5
23740,Leonard,13, No.,5
23741,Sheldon,13, Here‰Ûªs two dollars. Go buy some beef jerky.,5
23742,Leonard,13, I don‰Ûªt want beef jerky.,5
23743,Sheldon,13, It‰Ûªs not about you. It‰Ûªs about a poor immigrant from Pakistan trying to make his way in America by working the graveyard shift at the Colorado Boulevard Chevron.,5
23744,Leonard,13, Fine.,5
23745,Sheldon,13," Needy Baby, Greedy Baby indeed.",5
23746,Scene,13, The Cheesecake Factory.,5
23747,Sheldon,13, Leonard will be here in a moment. He‰Ûªs looking for a different parking space.,5
23748,Howard,13, Why?,5
23749,Sheldon,13," We were next to a car with an ask me about my grandchildren bumper sticker, and I was afraid if we ran into them on the way out, I‰Ûªd be obligated to do so.",5
23750,Bernadette,13, I‰Ûªm so disappointed it didn‰Ûªt work with him and Penny.,5
23751,Amy,13," Me, too. Out of deference to them, let‰Ûªs not flaunt our happy relationship.",5
23752,Sheldon,13," You have a keen insight into the human heart, Amy Farrah Fowler.",5
23753,Leonard,13, We are next to a Suburu with a Gore/Lieberman bumper sticker.,5
23754,Sheldon,13," Well, I doubt they‰Ûªd want to talk about that, so we‰Ûªre fine.",5
23755,Howard,13, I‰Ûªm surprised to see you here after it went so badly with Penny.,5
23756,Leonard,13," Well, hey, we‰Ûªre grown-ups. We can still be friends.",5
23757,Bernadette,13," Boy, I don‰Ûªt know if I could be friends with Howie if we broke up.",5
23758,Howard,13, Why not?,5
23759,Bernadette,13, I‰Ûªm a very vengeful person.,5
23760,Howard,13, Really?,5
23761,Bernadette,13, With access to weaponised smallpox.,5
23762,Penny,13," Here you go, guys, let me get you going with some water. You need menus or you know what you want?",5
23763,Howard,13," Leonard knows what he wants, but it looks like he‰Ûªs not gonna get it from you.",5
23764,Bernadette,13, Howard.,5
23765,Penny,13," No, that‰Ûªs okay, Bernadette. Sometimes these things just don‰Ûªt work out.",5
23766,Leonard,13," Yeah, it‰Ûªs all good. We-We‰Ûªll always have feelings for each other.",5
23767,Bernadette,13," Oh, that‰Ûªs nice.",5
23768,Leonard,13," See, she knew what always meant.",5
23769,Penny,13," Wow, you‰Ûªre like a dog with a bone, aren‰Ûªt you?",5
23770,Leonard,13, I‰Ûªm just making a point.,5
23771,Penny,13, Is the point that you don‰Ûªt know when to let something go?,5
23772,Sheldon,13," People, people, please, before you say something you both regret, I‰Ûªd like to place my order.",5
23773,Penny,13," Yeah, just hang on, Sheldon. You know why we can‰Ûªt be together? Because you always have to be right.",5
23774,Leonard,13," Oh, that is not true.",5
23775,Sheldon,13, I‰Ûªve got to go with Leonard on this. He is wrong more than anyone I know.,5
23776,Penny,13, You know what? I just realized I‰Ûªm on a break. I‰Ûªll get someone else.,5
23777,Leonard,13, Well‰Û_,5
23778,Sheldon,13," Leonard, promise me that when our new waitress comes over, you will not start a complicated on-again, off-again relationship with her, because I am very, very hungry.",5
23779,Scene,13, Leonard‰Ûªs bedroom. Text signal.,5
23780,Leonard,13, Unbelievable. (Goes to door),5
23781,Penny,13, Mind explaining to me why you were being such a jerk at the restaurant?,5
23782,Leonard,13," Well, I was trying to act like we weren‰Ûªt seeing each other. That was the plan, right?",5
23783,Penny,13," No, the plan was to tell people we decided to stay friends. That‰Ûªs a little hard to do when you‰Ûªre always being such a tool bag.",5
23784,Leonard,13, You know what? I don‰Ûªt have to stand here and take this crap. (Goes to Penny‰Ûªs apartment.),5
23785,Penny,13, The hell do you think you‰Ûªre going?,5
23786,Leonard,13, Isn‰Ûªt sex after fighting kind of what we do now?,5
23787,Penny,13," Yeah, kind of, yeah.",5
23788,Scene,13, Penny‰Ûªs bedroom.,5
23789,Leonard,13, What are we doing?,5
23790,Penny,13, What do you mean?,5
23791,Leonard,13, Every scenario I play out for you and me ends badly.,5
23792,Penny,13, That‰Ûªs because you overthink everything.,5
23793,Sheldon‰Ûªs voice,13," Leonard, are you listening to me? (Leonard is in the hallway with Sheldon. It is the opening scene, and Sheldon has just found his cardboard Spock.) ",5
23794,Leonard,13, What? Yeah.,5
23795,Sheldon,13, This is a disaster. I distinctly ordered the Leonard Nimoy Mr. Spock cardboard standee. Why would I feel safer with Zachary Quinto at the foot of my bed?,5
23796,Leonard,13," I don‰Ûªt know, he was pretty badass on Heroes.",5
23797,Sheldon,13," You‰Ûªre right, I‰Ûªll give him a shot.",5
23798,Leonard,13," Hang on. Penny, do you have plans for dinner?",5
23799,Penny,13," Why, you guys going somewhere?",5
23800,Leonard,13," No, I mean just you and me.",5
23801,Amy,13, Ooh!,5
23802,Bernadette,13, Ooh!,5
23803,Penny,13," Uh, have you thought this through?",5
23804,Leonard,13," Yes, and I think we should go anyway.",5
23805,Sheldon,13," No, can‰Ûªt do it. Sorry, Quinto, you‰Ûªre going back.",5
23806,Scene,13, Penny‰Ûªs bedroom.,5
23807,Amy,13," If you and Leonard get back together, Sheldon and I will finally have someone to go on double dates with.",5
23808,Bernadette,13, What about me and Howard?,5
23809,Amy,13," Fine, we can double with you, too. So insecure.",5
23810,Bernadette,13, Where are you guys going to eat?,5
23811,Amy,13, Penny?,5
23812,Minister,13," Do you, Penny, take Leonard to be your lawful wedded husband?",5
23813,"Penny (turning, heavily pregnant)",13," Well, it‰Ûªs a little late for me to start saying no, isn‰Ûªt it?",5
23814,Amy,13, Penny?,5
23815,Penny,13," Sorry, just remembered I‰Ûªve got to stop by the drugstore.",5
23816,Scene,14, The apartment. Sheldon is making a video.,5
23817,Sheldon,14," Hello. I‰Ûªm Dr. Sheldon Cooper, and welcome to the premiere episode of Sheldon Cooper Presents Fun with Flags. Over the next 52 weeks, you and I are going to explore the dynamic world of vexillology.",5
23818,Amy,14," Hang on, Dr. C. What‰Ûªs vexillology?",5
23819,Sheldon,14, Vexillology is the study of flags.,5
23820,Amy,14, Cool. I think I just learned something.,5
23821,Sheldon,14, Did you have fun doing it?,5
23822,Amy,14, I‰Ûªll say.,5
23823,Sheldon,14," Fun and information are two sides to this video podcast, not unlike the only two-sided state flag, Oregon. Oh, look. Hello, Mr. Beaver. In future episodes, we‰Ûªll answer some burning questions. What‰Ûªs the only non-rectangular flag? What animal appears most often on flags? What animal appears second most often on flags? And more.",5
23824,Amy,14, Sweet!,5
23825,Sheldon,14, Why are you waving a white flag?,5
23826,Amy,14, I‰Ûªm surrendering to fun.,5
23827,Leonard,14," Excuse me, sorry, excuse me.",5
23828,Sheldon,14, Cut. Did you not see we are rolling?,5
23829,Leonard,14, Sorry. I‰Ûªm having dinner with Penny. I have to get out of here.,5
23830,Sheldon,14, And I have flag knowledge that I have to get out of here!,5
23831,Amy,14, You okay?,5
23832,Sheldon,14," No, I‰Ûªm a little rattled. But like the flag over Fort Sumter, I‰Ûªm still here. And, take two. Hello. I‰Ûªm Dr. Sheldon Cooper, and welcome to the premiere episode of Sheldon Cooper Presents Fun with Flags. Over the next 52 weeks, you and I are going to explore the dynamic world of vexillology.",5
23833,Amy,14," Hang on, Dr. Cooper. What‰Ûªs vexillology?",5
23834,Sheldon,14, Vexillology is‰Û_ why is there a face on that flag?,5
23835,Amy,14, It‰Ûªs Ferdinand T. Flag. I thought he might help bring in some younger viewers.,5
23836,Sheldon,14," Confound it! You‰Ûªre right, it‰Ûªs brilliant. Let‰Ûªs take it from the top.",5
23837,Scene,14, The stairwell.,5
23838,Penny,14, That was a really nice dinner. I‰Ûªm glad you asked me out again.,5
23839,Leonard,14," Me, too, I missed you.",5
23840,Penny,14, You see me all the time. You sure you just don‰Ûªt miss the sex?,5
23841,Leonard,14," Well, yeah, sex with you is pretty great. Have you ever tried it?",5
23842,Penny,14," I have. You are not wrong. I just think if we‰Ûªre gonna try dating again, we should take things slow.",5
23843,Leonard,14," Oh, I can take it slow. Did I ever tell you about my first girlfriend in high school, Karen Berberick? To this day she doesn‰Ûªt know we were going out. Made it easier on her when I broke things off.",5
23844,Penny,14," Okay, well, maybe not that slow.",5
23845,Leonard,14," How about this, are you familiar with the typical development for computer software?",5
23846,Penny,14," You know, just for fun, let‰Ûªs say I‰Ûªm not.",5
23847,Leonard,14," Before an application is released, they give it a trial run. W-We could do that. And if we hit a rough spot, instead of getting mad, just say, hey, we found a bug, and we report it so it can be fixed.",5
23848,Penny,14, You mean like a beta test?,5
23849,Leonard,14," Well, technically, this would be an alpha test. A beta test requires people that weren‰Ûªt involved in the development of the appli‰Û_",5
23850,Penny,14," Seriously, do I not get credit for knowing beta test?",5
23851,Leonard,14," No, you should. Absolutely. That was me being pedantic. That‰Ûªs our first bug. You reported it. I can fix that. See? This is good.",5
23852,Penny,14, All right. Let‰Ûªs give it a shot.,5
23853,Leonard,14," Great. You keep a list, I‰Ûªll keep a list. At some point, we‰Ûªll exchange.",5
23854,Penny,14," Okay. Good night, Leonard.",5
23855,Leonard,14," Night. Attaboy, Hofstadter. Nothing gets the ladies hotter than software development analogies. Hey, I‰Ûªm back.",5
23856,Sheldon,14, Cut! Take 47.,5
23857,Scene,14, Sheldon and Raj‰Ûªs office.,5
23858,Sheldon,14, Here‰Ûªs an interesting fact about flags.,5
23859,Raj,14, I will take that action.,5
23860,Sheldon,14," The flags of Liechtenstein and Haiti were identical by coincidence, a fact that wasn‰Ûªt discovered until they competed against each other at the 1936 Olympics. And thankfully, their embarrassment was overshadowed by the rise of Fascism.",5
23861,Howard,14, Let‰Ûªs see the new phone.,5
23862,Raj,14," I stopped on the way to work. Hey, do you want to peel the plastic off with me?",5
23863,Howard,14," Really? Me? That‰Ûªs, like, the best part.",5
23864,Raj,14," Grab a corner. Whoa, what‰Ûªs your hurry, cowboy? Savour the moment.",5
23865,Howard,14," Oh, yeah.",5
23866,Sheldon,14," Speaking of cowboys, do you know what country has not one but two cows on its flag? The tiny landlocked nation of Andorra. Oh, the next classic episode of Sheldon Cooper Presents Fun with Flags is writing itself.",5
23867,Howard,14," Oh, let me try the voice recognition.",5
23868,Raj,14," Hey, I let you peel the plastic, don‰Ûªt get greedy. (To phone) Hello?",5
23869,Phone,14, Hello.,5
23870,Raj,14, What‰Ûªs your name?,5
23871,Phone,14, My name is Siri.,5
23872,Howard,14, Look at that. There‰Ûªs finally a woman in your life you can talk to.,5
23873,Raj,14, Are you single?,5
23874,Siri,14," I don‰Ûªt have a marital status, if that‰Ûªs what you‰Ûªre asking.",5
23875,Raj,14," Yeah, you‰Ûªre right, that‰Ûªs too personal. We hardly know each other. How about a cup of coffee?",5
23876,Siri,14, I‰Ûªve found six coffee shops. Three of them are fairly close to you.,5
23877,Raj,14, I will see you gentlemen later.,5
23878,Howard,14, She is gonna break his heart.,5
23879,Scene,14, The apartment.,5
23880,Amy,14," For someone who has a machine that can travel anywhere in time and space, Doctor Who sure does have a thing for modern-day London.",5
23881,Sheldon,14," Careful, it‰Ûªs that kind of sass that can get a person uninvited to this year‰Ûªs Who Con.",5
23882,Penny,14," Uh, we‰Ûªre not counting this as a date, are we?",5
23883,Leonard,14," Um, I‰Ûªm not sure, but I think the right answer here is no.",5
23884,Leonard,14, Even Doctor Who?,5
23885,Penny,14, Even Doctor Who.,5
23886,Sheldon,14," All right, that‰Ûªs it. Who Con, you‰Ûªre out.",5
23887,Leonard,14," Okay, bug report taken. Next time I will have a better plan for our evening‰Ûªs activity.",5
23888,Penny,14," Well, thank you. I‰Ûªll see you tomorrow.",5
23889,Leonard,14," Oh, wait, here, almost forgot. Here.",5
23890,Penny,14, What‰Ûªs this?,5
23891,Leonard,14, My bug report to you.,5
23892,Penny,14," Well, that‰Ûªs quite a list you got there.",5
23893,Leonard,14, It‰Ûªs colour coded.,5
23894,Penny,14, Oh.,5
23895,Leonard,14," Uh, red means fix right away. Yellow is eh, whenever you get a chance. And green is I could probably learn to live with it. There‰Ûªs a key down here at the bottom. It‰Ûªs neat, huh?",5
23896,Penny,14, Yep.,5
23897,Leonard,14," So, have a good night.",5
23898,Penny,14, Yep.,5
23899,Leonard,14," Look at that. Some day, we will tell future generations that dating used to be hard.",5
23900,Amy,14, What‰Ûªs baffling me is what you could‰Ûªve possibly put on the list. Hair too golden? Laugh too musical? World too much a better place for her mere presence in it?,5
23901,Sheldon,14, How about constantly talks with food in her mouth?,5
23902,Amy,14," Her heart‰Ûªs full of love, no one cares what‰Ûªs in her mouth.",5
23903,Scene,14, Raj‰Ûªs apartment.,5
23904,Raj,14," So, Siri, what‰Ûªs happening? How are you?",5
23905,Siri,14, I am well.,5
23906,Raj,14, What are you doing right now?,5
23907,Siri,14, What am I doing? I‰Ûªm talking with you.,5
23908,Raj,14, You have a beautiful voice.,5
23909,Siri,14," Thank you, it‰Ûªs nice to be appreciated.",5
23910,Raj,14, I bet it is. Why don‰Ûªt women like me?,5
23911,Siri,14, Let me check on that. How about a Web search for why don‰Ûªt women like me?‰Û,5
23912,Raj,14," No need. I‰Ûªve already done that. Siri, do you have a last name?",5
23913,Siri,14, My name is Siri.,5
23914,Raj,14," Ah, one name. Like, uh, Cher, Madonna, Adele. All the women who rock me. My name is Rajesh, but you can call me Raj.",5
23915,Siri,14, Would you like me to call you Raj?,5
23916,Raj,14, I‰Ûªd like you to call me sexy.,5
23917,Siri,14," From now on, I‰Ûªll call you sexy. Okay?",5
23918,Raj,14, Okay.,5
23919,Scene,14, Sheldon and Raj‰Ûªs office.,5
23920,Siri,14, (chimes) I found ten restaurants whose reviews mention gelato. Seven of them are fairly close to you.,5
23921,Raj,14," Thank you, darling.",5
23922,Siri,14," You are most certainly welcome, sexy.",5
23923,Sheldon,14," Well done, Dr. Koothrappali.",5
23924,Raj,14, I‰Ûªm sorry?,5
23925,Sheldon,14, You‰Ûªve taken a great evolutionary leap by abandoning human interaction and allowing yourself to romantically bond with a soulless machine. Kudos.,5
23926,Raj,14, I haven‰Ûªt bonded with it.,5
23927,Sheldon,14," Oh, no, of course. I understand. You‰Ûªre afraid the world isn‰Ûªt ready for your taboo love. Your secret‰Ûªs safe with me.",5
23928,Raj,14, It‰Ûªs just a phone.,5
23929,Barry Kripke,14, Cooper.,5
23930,Sheldon,14, Kripke.,5
23931,Barry,14," Heads up. Pwofessor Wothman urinated in the particle physics wab again, so we‰Ûªre going to move up his wetirement party. Fwiday, five o‰Ûªcwock, pot wuck.",5
23932,Raj,14," Thanks, Barry. Siri, remind me Friday morning to make my famous popovers.",5
23933,Siri,14," All right, I‰Ûªll remind you.",5
23934,Barry (to his own phone),14," You got Siwi, huh? Voice wecognition on that thing is tewible. Wook. Siwi, can you wecommend a westauwant?",5
23935,Barry‰Ûªs Siri,14," I‰Ûªm sorry, Bawwy. I don‰Ûªt understand wecommend a westauwant.",5
23936,Barry,14," Wisten to me. Not westauwant, westauwant.",5
23937,Barry‰Ûªs Siri,14," I don‰Ûªt know what you mean by not westauwant, westauwant.",5
23938,Barry,14," See? Total cwap. You suck, Siwi.",5
23939,Raj,14," Hey, don‰Ûªt talk to her like that. She‰Ûªs a lady.",5
23940,Barry,14," Well, that wady took high-wes pictures of my junk wast night for Cwaigswist. Waiter.",5
23941,Scene,14, Penny‰Ûªs apartment door. Leonard knocks.,5
23942,Penny,14, It‰Ûªs open.,5
23943,Leonard,14, Hey. You ready to go?,5
23944,Penny,14," Yeah, hang on. Let me just finish this chapter.",5
23945,Leonard,14, Can you finish it later?,5
23946,Penny,14," No, I can‰Ûªt. Reading books is a big part of my life now because, you know, we‰Ûªd have more fun things to talk about if I read more.",5
23947,Leonard,14, Great. Good. Great. What are you reading?,5
23948,Penny,14, Two Weeks to Rock Hard Abs.,5
23949,Leonard,14," They kind of spoil the ending right in the name of that, don‰Ûªt they? All right. Look, just remember how this works. We don‰Ûªt get mad about these things. Uh, speaking of which, I‰Ûªve addressed your bug report on my date planning. Got a really fun evening for you. It‰Ûªs kind of a surprise.",5
23950,Penny,14," All right. Terrific. Well, let me just go find a pair of shoes that aren‰Ûªt so tall. We wouldn‰Ûªt want you to feel like you were out for a walk with your mommy.",5
23951,Leonard,14, Thank you.,5
23952,Penny,14," Yeah. Oh. Here‰Ûªs my list for you, right there.",5
23953,Leonard,14," All right, fair enough. I certainly can be quieter when we kiss. I thought it was an expression of passion, but if it‰Ûªs coming across as juicy and weird, who wants that? Uh, uh, I‰Ûªm sorry, can you be more specific on how my eyebrows are stupid? Nah, never mind, it‰Ûªs right here.",5
23954,Scene,14, Raj‰Ûªs apartment.,5
23955,Raj,14, Good timing. Dinner‰Ûªs almost ready.,5
23956,Howard,14, Great.,5
23957,Bernadette,14," Oh, smells amazing in here.",5
23958,Howard,14," Yeah, what are we eating?",5
23959,Raj,14," Oh, an exotic little treat. I was just talking to Siri about Peking duck, and she said she knew about four Chinese grocers, two of which were fairly close to me. Her spontaneity is contagious.",5
23960,Bernadette,14, Who‰Ûªs Siri? Is he dating somebody new?,5
23961,Howard,14, Yes. His phone.,5
23962,Bernadette,14, Oh. Is that cute or creepy?,5
23963,Howard,14, Uh-huh.,5
23964,Raj,14," Can I pour you some wine? I think you‰Ûªll enjoy it. The traditional choice with Peking duck is a Sauvignon Blanc, but Siri suggested an off-dry Riesling. I wasn‰Ûªt sure, but I didn‰Ûªt want to have an argument with her in the middle of Trader Joe‰Ûªs. Now, what should we put Siri in for dinner? Leopard, sparkles, or to paraphrase Coco Chanel, you can never go wrong with a little black case. Siri, play some smooth jazz.",5
23965,Siri,14, Playing smooth jazz.,5
23966,Raj,14," Oh, my God, Kenny G? This woman can read me like a book. I can‰Ûªt believe I bought my soul mate at Glendale Galleria.",5
23967,Bernadette,14, I don‰Ûªt know if I want to stay.,5
23968,Scene,14, A shooting range.,5
23969,Penny,14, This is amazing. How did you even get this idea?,5
23970,Leonard,14, I called your dad. I asked him what things you liked to do when you were a kid. This seemed easier than getting a cow out here so you could tip it.,5
23971,Penny,14," Okay, you‰Ûªre kind of really great.",5
23972,Leonard,14, You mean for a person whose neck massages feel like an eagle is trying to carry you to its nest?,5
23973,Penny,14," Okay, bug report. I just complimented you. You should take it and shut up.",5
23974,Leonard,14," Right. Sorry, sorry.",5
23975,Penny,14, And stop apologizing all the time.,5
23976,Leonard,14, Right. Sorry.,5
23977,Penny,14," All right, let‰Ûªs shoot stuff. You want me to show you what to do?",5
23978,Leonard,14, I play a lot of Grand Theft Auto. I think I know how to handle a gat.,5
23979,Penny,14, Wow. You are cute when you get all gangsta. (Kisses him. Leonard accidentally shoots himself in the foot.),5
23980,Scene,14, The stairwell.,5
23981,Leonard,14," So, I‰Ûªve got a gunshot wound. That‰Ûªs pretty badass.",5
23982,Penny,14," No, you‰Ûªve got a Reebok with a gunshot wound and an ouchie on your pinkie toe.",5
23983,Leonard,14, Hello? They gave me a Band-Aid. Hospitals do not issue Band-Aids unless it is medically necessary. That is the law.,5
23984,Penny,14," Well, thank you for a really cool evening.",5
23985,Leonard,14, Thank you for hiding my Star Wars socks at the emergency room. Is it a good time to evaluate the beta test and see where we stand?,5
23986,Penny,14, Things are looking good.,5
23987,Leonard,14," So, are we still taking things slow? Because a gunshot wound today, last week, I slammed my thumb in the kitchen drawer. We don‰Ûªt know how much time I have.",5
23988,Penny,14," Good night, you.",5
23989,Sheldon,14," Guten Tag, das YouTube. Ich bin ein Bavarian.",5

23996,Raj,14, Thank you. (Enters a door marked ‰ÛÏThe Office of Siri‰Û Inside is a red-headed woman sitting at a huge console desk.) ,5
23997,Siri,14," Dave, I found six vacuum cleaner repair shops in your area. Four are fairly close to you. (To Raj) Hello, sexy. What can I help you with? If you‰Ûªd like to make love to me, just tell me. (Raj tries to speak) I‰Ûªm sorry. I don‰Ûªt understand.",5
23998,Raj (waking from a dream),14, No!,5
23999,Scene,15, Leonard‰Ûªs bedroom. Sheldon enters in a hard hat and high-vis jacket. Sounds a klaxon on his phone.,5
24000,Leonard,15, Aaargh. What the hell?,5
24001,Sheldon,15, Emergency preparedness drill.,5
24002,Leonard,15," Oh, no, come on!",5
24003,Sheldon,15," Yeah, you know how it works. Once a quarter, keep our readiness up. Now, rise and shine, sleepy head. Half the town is probably dead.",5
24004,Leonard,15, I have to get a lock for my door.,5
24005,Sheldon,15," I think you‰Ûªll like the drill tonight. I‰Ûªve tried to make it fun. Each of these cards contains a detailed scenario of a possible apocalyptic event. Everything from wild fires to a surprise invasion by Canada. Pick a catastrophe, any catastrophe.",5
24006,Leonard,15," Sheldon, Canada is not going to invade California.",5
24007,Sheldon,15," Yeah, really? You think those hippies in Washington and Oregon can stop them?",5
24008,Leonard,15, Fine.,5
24009,Sheldon,15," All righty! An 8.2 magnitude earthquake devastates Pasadena, reducing mighty edifices to dust, engulfing the city in flames. The streets flow with blood and echo with the cries of the wounded. Oh, excellent choice. Now, put on your hard hat and safety vest.",5
24010,Leonard,15," Oh, fun. I get to spend another night in front of our apartment dressed like one of the Village People.",5
24011,Sheldon,15," You make that joke every three months. I still don‰Ûªt get it. Leonard, wait. What are you doing?",5
24012,Leonard,15," I don‰Ûªt know, what am I doing?",5
24013,Sheldon,15," Look around you, there‰Ûªs hypothetical broken glass everywhere. Really? You‰Ûªre going to face Armageddon without your orthotics? All right, your choice. (Grabs him and pushes him over) Uh-oh, hypothetical aftershock!",5
24014,Leonard,15, Aah!,5
24015,Sheldon,15, And that‰Ûªs why we wear hard hats.,5
24016,Scene,15, The cafeteria.,5
24017,Howard,15," Check it out, press release from NASA.",5
24018,Raj,15," Um, Expedition 31 will launch this spring to the International Space Station. Crew members will include Commander Tom ‰Û÷Tombo‰Ûª Johnson, astronaut Mike ‰Û÷Supernova‰Ûª Novacelik and Payload Specialist Howard Wolowitz.",5
24019,Howard,15, This is going right into my synagogue‰Ûªs newsletter.,5
24020,Raj,15," Dude, if you‰Ûªre going to be an astronaut, you need to pick a cool nickname.",5
24021,Howard,15, I don‰Ûªt get to pick it. The other guys have to give it to me.,5
24022,Raj,15," Oh. If I had one, it would be Brown Dynamite.",5
24023,Howard,15, Are you not listening to me? The other astronauts have to give you your nickname.,5
24024,Raj,15, Are you not looking at me? I am Brown Dynamite. Why do you put six sugars in your coffee?,5
24025,Leonard,15, Because the cafeteria doesn‰Ûªt offer little packets of methamphetamine.,5
24026,Howard,15," Emergency drill night last night, huh?",5
24027,Leonard,15, Uh-huh.,5
24028,Raj,15, How‰Ûªd you do?,5
24029,Leonard,15," You know what, I‰Ûªm so tired I can‰Ûªt even think straight. I‰Ûªm going home. Will one of you guys give this nutbag a ride back later?",5
24030,Sheldon,15, You can‰Ûªt go home. You have to take me to the dentist at four o‰Ûªclock.,5
24031,Leonard,15," Oh, can‰Ûªt you take the bus to the dentist?",5
24032,Sheldon,15," Of course I can. It‰Ûªs coming back under the residual effects of the anaesthesia, that‰Ûªs the problem. Two years ago after a deep gum cleaning, I thought I got on a bus but somehow wound up on a booze cruise to Mexico.",5
24033,Raj,15, They put you under for a cleaning?,5
24034,Sheldon,15," Yeah, they have to, I‰Ûªm a biter.",5
24035,Leonard,15," Whatever, Sheldon. I‰Ûªm exhausted. I‰Ûªm not taking you to the dentist.",5
24036,Sheldon,15," Wrong, sir. Wrong. Under section 37B of the roommate agreement, miscellaneous duties, you are obligated to take me to the dentist. See? It‰Ûªs right here after providing a confirmation sniff on questionable dairy products.‰Û",5
24037,Leonard,15," You know what, I am sick of the roommate agreement. It‰Ûªs ridiculous. I‰Ûªm your roommate, not your chauffeur. You know, I had better things to do yesterday than drive you all the way to the good model train store in Garden Grove because the one in Pasadena has gotten too big for its britches.",5
24038,Sheldon,15," Well, it has. Ask anybody.",5
24039,Leonard,15, I don‰Ûªt care. I‰Ûªm done.,5
24040,Sheldon,15, Hold on. Are you saying that you want to invoke Clause 209?,5
24041,Leonard,15," I don‰Ûªt know what that is, but if it means I can go home and sleep, then yes.",5
24042,Sheldon,15," Think carefully here. Clause 209 suspends our friendship, and strips down the roommate agreement to its bare essentials. Our responsibilities toward each other would only be rent, utilities and a perfunctory chin jut of recognition as we pass in the hall. (Demonstrating) ‰Û÷Sup?",5
24043,Leonard,15, Where do I sign?,5
24044,Sheldon,15, Right here. Use your finger.,5
24045,Leonard,15, There. Done.,5
24046,Sheldon,15," All right. That‰Ûªs it. We are now no longer companions, boon or otherwise. We are now merely acquaintances. To amend the words of Toy Story, you have not got a friend in me.",5
24047,Leonard,15, I‰Ûªm gonna go home and take a nap.,5
24048,Sheldon,15," Yeah, well, tell it to someone who cares.",5
24049,Scene,15, The apartment.,5
24050,Howard,15, I got pretty exciting NASA news today. Next week I fly to Houston for orientation and zero-gravity elimination drills.,5
24051,Penny,15, What does that mean?,5
24052,Bernadette,15, He‰Ûªs gonna learn to poop in space.,5
24053,Howard,15," Open the pod bay doors, HAL.",5
24054,Raj,15, Maybe your nickname should be Brown Dynamite.,5
24055,Sheldon,15," Hello, dear friends. And Dr. Hofstadter.",5
24056,Leonard,15, ‰Û÷Sup?,5
24057,Sheldon,15," ‰Û÷Sup? My apologies. I would‰Ûªve been here sooner, but the bus kept stopping for other people to get on it.",5
24058,Amy,15, I saved you a dumpling.,5
24059,Sheldon,15," Oh, your concern for me is touching. It will serve you well when you take me to the dentist tomorrow.",5
24060,Amy,15," I‰Ûªm sorry, Sheldon, I‰Ûªm busy. I‰Ûªm right in the middle of my addiction study. I‰Ûªve got a lab full of alcoholic monkeys, and tomorrow‰Ûªs the day we switch them to O‰ÛªDoul‰Ûªs.",5
24061,Sheldon,15," You‰Ûªre my girlfriend and you‰Ûªre not going to cater to my every need? Oh, where‰Ûªd the magic go?",5
24062,Penny,15," Sheldon, that‰Ûªs not what girlfriends are for. Although, you don‰Ûªt use them for what they‰Ûªre for, so what do I know?",5
24063,Bernadette,15," Howard doesn‰Ûªt make me do his shopping, or take him to the dentist, or pick up his dry cleaning, right?",5
24064,Howard,15," Absolutely. But when Ma‰Ûªs hips give out, you‰Ûªre up, kid.",5
24065,Sheldon,15," Well, if Amy‰Ûªs too busy, that gives the rest of you an opportunity to make my life easier, thus assuring yourselves a footnote in my memoirs, tentatively entitled You‰Ûªre Welcome, Mankind. All right, then, just shout when you hear the task you want to undertake. Uh, dentist. Okay, we can circle back to that one. Um, well, who wants to take me Wednesday morning to get new heels put on my dress shoes? Anyone? Oh. That one had hoot written all over it. Um, all right, uh, dermatologist? Allergist? Podiatrist? Supercuts? Okay, okay, here‰Ûªs a fun one. Um, I need a new picture frame and I have a hankering for Swedish meatballs. Who wants to spend the day with me at IKEA?",5
24066,Raj,15, Their meatballs are pretty good.,5
24067,Sheldon,15, What‰Ûªs that?,5
24068,Raj,15," Nothing, nothing.",5
24069,Scene,15, The comic book store.,5
24070,Sheldon,15," Hello, Stuart.",5
24071,Stuart,15," Oh, hey, Sheldon. Can I help you find something today?",5
24072,Sheldon,15," No, no. I was just sitting at home thinking about how it might be nice to catch up with my ninth favourite person.",5
24073,Stuart,15, Ninth?,5
24074,Sheldon,15," You moved up one. My pen pal in Somalia was kidnapped by pirates. So, uh, how are you?",5
24075,Stuart,15," Uh, not so good. My shrink just killed himself and blamed me in the note.",5
24076,Sheldon,15," Great. Great. So, what‰Ûªs new with your family? How‰Ûªs your mother? Is she alive?",5
24077,Stuart,15, Yeah.,5
24078,Sheldon,15, And your father? Alive?,5
24079,Stuart,15, Yes.,5
24080,Sheldon,15," How about your grandparents, they alive?",5
24081,Stuart,15, No.,5
24082,Sheldon,15," Oh, I‰Ûªm so sorry for your loss. On a cheerier note, I have a teeth-cleaning appointment this afternoon. What do you say you take me over there, buddy boy?",5
24083,Stuart,15," I‰Ûªm sorry, you want me to take you to the dentist?",5
24084,Sheldon,15," Yes. And now, I can‰Ûªt make any promises, but that‰Ûªs the sort of thing that gets a fella on the short list for the number eight friend slot.",5
24085,Stuart,15," Sheldon, I‰Ûªm working. I can‰Ûªt take you to the dentist. Also, and I can‰Ûªt stress this enough, I don‰Ûªt want to take you to the dentist.",5
24086,Sheldon,15," Can‰Ûªt help a friend out in a time of need, huh? I see where your therapist was coming from.",5
24087,Scene,15, The apartment.,5
24088,Raj,15," Ooh, ooh! What about we make your astronaut nickname Howard ‰ÛÏBuzz‰Û Wolowitz?",5
24089,Howard,15, You can‰Ûªt do Buzz. Buzz is taken.,5
24090,Raj,15, Buzz Lightyear is not real.,5
24091,Howard,15," No, that‰Ûªs not what I‰Ûªm talking about.",5
24092,Raj,15," Well, are you talking about when he thought he was real?",5
24093,Howard,15, No.,5
24094,Raj,15," Okay, um, how about Crash‰Û? Howard ‰ÛÏCrash‰Û Wolowitz.",5
24095,Howard,15," Yeah, terrific. The other astronauts would love to go hurtling through space with a guy named Crash.",5
24096,Raj,15," All right, um, how about, oh, how about Rocket Man?",5
24097,Leonard,15," That‰Ûªs not bad, Howard ‰ÛÏRocket Man‰Û Wolowitz.",5
24098,Howard,15," Yeah, it‰Ûªs great, but I told you, I don‰Ûªt get to pick my nickname. It has to come from the other astronauts.",5
24099,Raj,15, Maybe there‰Ûªs a way to get them to come up with it.,5
24100,Howard,15, Like how?,5
24101,Leonard,15," Once I tried carrying around a Duncan yo-yo, hoping the other kids would start calling me Duncan.",5
24102,Howard,15, Did it work?,5
24103,Leonard,15," No, they ended up calling me Sock Mouth. Because they took away my yo-yo and stuffed their socks in my mouth.",5
24104,Raj,15," Okay, uh, what if we make Rocket Man your ringtone, and the next time you talk to those guys, I‰Ûªll call you and they‰Ûªll hear it. Plant the seed.",5
24105,Howard,15, That‰Ûªs actually not a terrible plan.,5
24106,Raj,15, They don‰Ûªt call me Brown Dynamite for nothing.,5
24107,"Leonard (to Sheldon, entering)",15, ‰Û÷Sup?,5
24108,Sheldon,15, ‰Û÷Sup?,5
24109,Leonard,15," Hey, did you ever make it to the dentist?",5
24110,Sheldon,15," Not necessary. No. I found a service that‰Ûªll send a van to your house for a teeth cleaning. Mostly they cater to dogs, but the fellow on the phone seemed to have an open mind.",5
24111,Leonard,15," All right, Sheldon, if you need me to take you to the dentist, I will take you to the dentist.",5
24112,Sheldon,15, Are you suggesting that you‰Ûªve come to your senses and wish to re-establish the mutual benefits that stem from full participation in the roommate agreement?,5
24113,Leonard,15, Absolutely. If you admit that you‰Ûªre a 30-year-old man who‰Ûªs incapable of functioning on his own.,5
24114,Raj,15," Ooh, Sock Mouth‰Ûªs got him on the ropes.",5
24115,Sheldon,15," I will admit nothing of the sort. And now if you‰Ûªll excuse me, I have to call my dentist and see if I can also get my hair shampooed and my nails clipped.",5
24116,Scene,15, The apartment. Leonard is watching television. All the power goes off.,5
24117,Penny (entering),15," Oh, good, your power‰Ûªs out, too.",5
24118,Leonard,15, Why is that good?,5
24119,Penny,15," Because last month, I sent the electric company a Starbucks gift card, an apology note, and a few snapshots of me in a bra.",5
24120,Sheldon,15, Power failure. Implementing power-failure protocol.,5
24121,Leonard,15, What happened to all your glow-in-the-dark-emergency-exit stuff you had painted on the floor?,5
24122,Sheldon,15," Oh, that was wildly carcinogenic. Anyway, it‰Ûªs too bad you‰Ûªre no longer entitled to the full benefits of my friendship, because I happen to be extremely prepared for such an emergency. Please try not to see anything by this light. It‰Ûªs not for you.",5
24123,Leonard,15," It‰Ûªs just a blackout, I‰Ûªm sure the power will be back on soon.",5
24124,Sheldon,15, And I‰Ûªm sure some fool in the Donner party said the snow would stop any day now. I like to think they ate him first.,5
24125,Penny,15," You know, I got some candles in my apartment.",5
24126,Sheldon,15," But candles? During a blackout? Are you mad? That‰Ûªs a fire hazard. No, Pasadena Water and Power recommends the far safer glow stick.",5
24127,Leonard (pulling out a toy lightsabre),15," You call that a glow stick? That is a glow stick. Come on, let‰Ûªs go.",5
24128,Sheldon,15," Before you go, consider this. Not only do I have a deep-cycle marine battery power source which is more than capable of running our entertainment system, I also have all 61 episodes of the BBC series Red Dwarf and Fiddle-Faddle. All yours if you‰Ûªre willing to reinstate the roommate agreement.",5
24129,Penny,15, I‰Ûªve got wine at my place and some bubble wrap we could pop.,5
24130,Sheldon,15," Oh, he‰Ûªll be back. Wine and a girl in the dark, he‰Ûªs gonna be bored out of his mind.",5
24131,Scene,15, Penny‰Ûªs apartment.,5
24132,Leonard,15, To wine and bubble wrap. And to not having to watch Sheldon demonstrate his reverse osmosis machine that converts urine into drinking water.,5
24133,Penny,15," You know, in Girl Scouts, Tammie Dinisha said you could do that with panty hose. Boy, was she wrong. Anyway, you want to make out?",5
24134,Leonard,15," I thought because our relationship‰Ûªs in a beta test, you wanted to take things slow.",5
24135,Penny,15, Okay. Do you want to make out slow?,5
24136,Leonard,15, I can go so slow it‰Ûªll be like there‰Ûªs a snail in your mouth.,5
24137,Penny,15," Ugh. Well, lucky for you, there‰Ûªs nothing else to do right now.",5
24138,Sheldon,15," Excuse me, Leonard.",5
24139,Leonard,15, Since when don‰Ûªt you knock? It‰Ûªs like the only good thing about you.,5
24140,Sheldon,15," Social niceties have been suspended, Leonard. We‰Ûªre in a state of a emergency. The world has descended into darkened turmoil. Lawlessness and savagery are the order of the day.",5
24141,Leonard,15," Fine, what is it?",5
24142,Sheldon,15, I‰Ûªm making s‰Ûªmores. I wanted to alert you in case you smelled caramelizing marshmallows and thought a nearby candy factory was on fire.,5
24143,Leonard,15," S‰Ûªmores, huh? Good for you.",5
24144,Sheldon,15," Yes, or good for us if you sign here and reinstate the full roommate agreement.",5
24145,Leonard,15," No, thanks. I‰Ûªm good.",5
24146,Sheldon,15," Really? Huh! Okay. In that case, I will have a s‰Ûªmore by myself. And then I‰Ûªm gonna have s‰Ûªmore. By myself.",5
24147,Penny,15, Aw.,5
24148,Leonard,15," No, don‰Ûªt aw him. He brought this all on himself.",5
24149,Penny,15, But he‰Ûªs sad.,5
24150,Leonard,15," No, he‰Ûªs crazy. Sometimes crazy looks like sad so it‰Ûªll suck you back in.",5
24151,Penny,15, I think he misses his little buddy.,5
24152,Leonard,15," Fine. But mark my words, this frustrating, bogus teenage make-out session is not over.",5
24153,Scene,15, The apartment.,5
24154,Leonard,15, I thought you said candles were dangerous.,5
24155,Sheldon,15," This is a Bunsen burner. I‰Ûªm a scientist, I know what I‰Ûªm doing. Oh, drat. (His s‰Ûªmore is on fire. He dunks it in a glass of water.) Aw. It took me a gallon of urine to make that water.",5
24156,Leonard,15," Listen, Sheldon, this is stupid. I don‰Ûªt see why we can‰Ûªt be friends. And I‰Ûªm willing to drive you around and help you out with stuff. I just don‰Ûªt want to do it because of some silly roommate agreement.",5
24157,Sheldon,15, What are you proposing?,5
24158,Leonard,15," That we go back to the way things were. But when I do something for you, you show a little appreciation.",5
24159,Sheldon,15, And how would I do that?,5
24160,Leonard,15, You say thank you.,5
24161,Sheldon,15, Every time?,5
24162,Leonard,15, It‰Ûªs not crazy.,5
24163,Sheldon,15," Counter-proposal. We reinstate the full roommate agreement with the following addendum, in the spirit of Mother‰Ûªs Day or Father‰Ûªs Day, once a year, we set aside day to celebrate all your contributions to my life, both actual and imagined by you. We could call it Leonard‰Ûªs Day.",5
24164,Leonard,15, I kind of like the sound of that.,5
24165,Sheldon,15," Of course you do. It‰Ûªs about you, like everything else. (Lights come back on) Oh, thank goodness. I don‰Ûªt think I had it in me to make another glass of water.",5
24166,Leonard,15," So, do I get breakfast in bed on Leonard‰Ûªs Day?",5
24167,Sheldon,15, No.,5
24168,Leonard,15, Can I sit in your spot?,5
24169,Sheldon,15, No.,5
24170,Leonard,15, Can I control the thermostat?,5
24171,Sheldon,15, No.,5
24172,Leonard,15, Do I get a card?,5
24173,Sheldon,15, Of course you get a card. It‰Ûªs Leonard‰Ûªs Day.,5
24174,Penny,15," Hey, guys, the building manager said the reason the power went out is someone went down into the basement and just pulled the main breaker switch.",5
24175,Leonard,15," Really. Who do you think did that, Sheldon?",5
24176,Sheldon,15," Oh, I don‰Ûªt know. But whoever that mystery man was, you should be eternally grateful, for without him, there would be no Leonard‰Ûªs Day.",5
24177,Penny,15, Leonard‰Ûªs Day?,5
24178,Sheldon,15," Oh, no pressure. Just get him a crummy card, you‰Ûªre good.",5
24179,Scene,15, Howard‰Ûªs bedroom.,5
24180,Howard,15," All right, test my ring tone. That really is a good song.",5
24181,Raj,15," Oh, yeah. There‰Ûªs a reason he‰Ûªs Sir Elton John. They don‰Ûªt make you a knight for writing Wake Me Up Before You Go Go.",5
24182,Mrs Wolowitz (off),15," Howard, are you coming down for breakfast?",5
24183,Howard,15," Ma, I told you I have a video conference with NASA. I said don‰Ûªt bother me!",5
24184,Mrs Wolowitz (off),15, Oh! Listen to Mr. Big Shot Astronaut.,5
24185,Howard,15," Yes, please listen to Mr. Big Shot Astronaut. Hey, good morning.",5
24186,NASA Guy (on skype),15," Hey, Howard, thanks for getting up so early.",5
24187,Howard,15," No problem, Dr. Massimino.",5
24188,Dr Massimino,15, The guys here call me Mass.,5
24189,Howard,15, Mass. That‰Ûªs a cool nickname. ‰Û÷Cause force equals mass times acceleration.,5
24190,Mass,15," Yeah. It‰Ûªs just short for Massimino. Anyway, the plan for this morning is to go over the‰Û_",5
24191,Howard,15, Sorry. My phone.,5
24192,Mass,15, What is that? Is that Rocket Man?,5
24193,Howard,15," Yeah, my ring tone. Kind of my favourite song, Rocket Man.",5
24194,Mrs Wolowitz (off),15," Howard, your Fruit Loops are getting soggy!",5
24195,Howard,15, Not now!,5
24196,Mass,15, Who‰Ûªs that?,5
24197,Howard,15, My mom. Sorry.,5
24198,Howard,15," No problem, Fruit Loops.",5
24199,Scene,16, The cafeteria.,5
24200,Sheldon,16," Gentlemen, I think I‰Ûªve come up with a fun way to get young people interested in science. Physics Mad-Libs. Now, give me a number.",5
24201,Leonard,16, Five.,5
24202,Sheldon,16, Uh-huh. And an irrational constant.,5
24203,Howard,16, E.,5
24204,Sheldon,16, And a funny Greek letter.,5
24205,Raj,16, Gamma.,5
24206,Sheldon,16, I said funny.,5
24207,Raj,16, Upsilon?,5
24208,Sheldon,16, Good one. And an electrical charge.,5
24209,Leonard,16, Positive.,5
24210,Sheldon,16," Ha. Perfect. Okay. Get this. Professor Jones told the symposium he had a new method for calculating the mass of a muon. Five times the limit of E to the upsilon as in a (laughs uncontrollably). Okay. No, no. I‰Ûªll start over. Professor (laughs again)",5
24211,Howard,16, I haven‰Ûªt seen him laugh that hard since the day Leonard made that multiplication error.,5
24212,Sheldon,16," Oh, Oh, Lord, that multiplication error! He thought he carried the one. But he didn‰Ûªt.",5
24213,Leonard,16, It‰Ûªs not funny. That mistake got published.,5
24214,Sheldon,16, Stop! I‰Ûªm going to wet myself!,5
24215,Raj,16," Hey, guys, guys, President Siebert is headed this way.",5
24216,Howard,16, I wonder what he wants.,5
24217,Leonard,16," Doesn‰Ûªt look happy, so I‰Ûªm guessing he wants to talk to Sheldon.",5
24218,Seibert,16, Dr. Cooper?,5
24219,Leonard,16, Told ya.,5
24220,Sheldon,16," Oh, President Siebert, I assume you‰Ûªd like to respond to one of the suggestions I put in the box by your office.",5
24221,Seibert,16," No, and stop installing suggestion boxes everywhere.",5
24222,Sheldon,16," You don‰Ûªt like written suggestions. You don‰Ûªt like when I give them to you while we‰Ûªre urinating in the men‰Ûªs room. If I didn‰Ûªt know any better, I‰Ûªd say that you‰Ûªre one of those stubborn people who are not open to suggestions.",5
24223,Seibert,16," Dr. Cooper, the physics department chair tells me you‰Ûªre refusing to take your vacation.",5
24224,Sheldon,16, I don‰Ûªt need a vacation.,5
24225,Seibert,16," You‰Ûªre obligated to take one. And I‰Ûªd also like you to know the most-often received suggestion in my suggestion box you installed without asking me is can Dr. Cooper take a vacation? Okay, settled, then. I‰Ûªll see you all on Monday, except for you.",5
24226,Sheldon,16," But if I don‰Ûªt come into work, what am I supposed to do with myself?",5
24227,Seibert,16," Read, rest, travel. I hear Afghanistan is nice this time of year.",5
24228,Sheldon,16, Sarcasm?,5
24229,Howard,16, No. You should go.,5
24230,Scene,16, Leonard‰Ûªs car. Leonard is singing enthusiastically.,5
24231,Leonard,16," That tonight‰Ûªs gonna be a good night, and tonight‰Ûªs gonna be a good night, and tonight‰Ûªs gonna be a good, good night! Tonight‰Ûªs the night, uh, uh, let‰Ûªs live it up, uh, I got my money, let‰Ûªs spend it up‰Û_",5
24232,Sheldon (appearing in the back seat),16, Good Lord! Would you stop that caterwauling!,5
24233,Leonard,16, What the hell are you doing?,5
24234,Sheldon,16, Bleeding from my ears.,5
24235,Leonard,16, What are you doing hiding back there?,5
24236,Sheldon,16," I‰Ûªm sneaking into work. Now, if the guard at the university asks what‰Ûªs under the blanket, you tell him it‰Ûªs some lobster traps.",5
24237,Leonard,16, Lobster traps?,5
24238,Sheldon,16, Yes. That‰Ûªs how Velma and Scooby smuggled Shaggy into the old lighthouse.,5
24239,Leonard,16, What are you going to do when you get to the university? People are going to recognize you.,5
24240,Sheldon,16," Will they, Leonard? (Puts on cap and long-hair wig)",5
24241,Leonard,16," Fine. Just get back under your blanket, and I‰Ûªll drive you there.",5
24242,Sheldon,16, And no more singing.,5
24243,Leonard,16, Fine.,5
24244,Sheldon,16, I have GPS on my phone. I know you turned around.,5
24245,Scene,16, Penny‰Ûªs apartment.,5
24246,Penny,16, I‰Ûªm so glad you talked Howard out of having your wedding invitations in Klingon.,5
24247,Bernadette,16, Turn it over. I‰Ûªm hoping my relatives think it‰Ûªs Hebrew.,5
24248,Amy,16," This is really happening. I‰Ûªm gonna be a maid of honour. I‰Ûªm gonna wear a beautiful dress and walk down that aisle and, finally, I will have my special day.",5
24249,Bernadette,16, You mean my special day?,5
24250,Amy,16, They‰Ûªre gonna need an extra-large veil for somebody‰Ûªs head.,5
24251,Bernadette,16, If I ever actually ever get married.,5
24252,Penny,16, Why wouldn‰Ûªt you?,5
24253,Bernadette,16," My dad. Because I make a lot more money than Howie, he‰Ûªs putting a lot of pressure on me to get a pre-nup.",5
24254,Penny,16, Ouch.,5
24255,Bernadette,16, Yeah. Howie‰Ûªs gonna freak out.,5
24256,Amy,16," Parental pressure can be daunting. I remember the battle with my mother about shaving my legs. Last year, I finally gave in and let her do it.",5
24257,Bernadette,16, I just don‰Ûªt know how I‰Ûªm gonna break it to him.,5
24258,Penny,16," You know, I‰Ûªm a big believer in breaking bad news to a guy when you‰Ûªre in bed with him. That‰Ûªs how I told my high school boyfriend I slept with his brother. That‰Ûªs how I told his brother the same thing.",5
24259,Bernadette,16," I don‰Ûªt know, I don‰Ûªt want to manipulate him with sex.",5
24260,Penny,16," Oh, sweetie, that‰Ûªs what sex is for.",5
24261,Amy,16," You know, the connection between marriage and money is nothing new. In fact, the term wed referred to the money and livestock that the groom paid the bride‰Ûªs father. For example, you‰Ûªre adorable, intelligent and a good earner. I could conservatively see you going for at least two oxen and a goose. (To Penny) You would fetch a unicorn.",5
24262,Scene,16, The apartment.,5
24263,Leonard,16," Sheldon, there are a million great vacations you could take. What about Hawaii?",5
24264,Sheldon,16," Hawaii is a former leper colony on top of an active volcano where the disappointing ending to Lost was filmed. Mahalo for nothing, Hawaii.",5
24265,Howard,16," How about Florida? They‰Ûªve got Cape Canaveral, they‰Ûªve got Disney, they‰Ûªve got my Aunt Ida and the world‰Ûªs largest collection of diabetic candy. Plus, if you get sweaty enough, her plastic-covered furniture is like a flume ride.",5
24266,Sheldon,16, My family took a trip to Florida when I was a child. A seagull stole a hot dog from me on the beach. I got the message.,5
24267,Raj,16," You know, if I had a week off, I‰Ûªd go back to the Two Bunch Palms Resort and Spa in the desert. I tell you, an hour on the massage table with Trevor, and you‰Ûªll feel like you were born without bones.",5
24268,Howard,16, I don‰Ûªt think I could ever let a guy give me a massage.,5
24269,Raj,16, Really? What was I doing to your neck last night while you were playing X-Box?,5
24270,Sheldon,16," It‰Ûªs like I‰Ûªm living in a dictatorship. You must take a vacation, you must have fun, you must enjoy life.",5
24271,Howard,16, I don‰Ûªt think you have a good handle on dictatorships.,5
24272,Leonard,16," Sheldon, everybody takes vacations.",5
24273,Sheldon,16," One time they tried to make Richard Feynman take a vacation, but he chose instead to expand his mind and learn something new. He went to work in his friend‰Ûªs biology lab. Richard Feynman was a famous American physicist, part of the Manhattan Project.",5
24274,Howard,16, Everyone in the world of science knows who Richard Feynman was.,5
24275,Sheldon,16," Now you do, too. Oh! I have a brilliant idea. Amy‰Ûªs a biologist. I‰Ûªll go work in her lab.",5
24276,Howard,16, Isn‰Ûªt that just Feynman‰Ûªs idea?,5
24277,Sheldon,16," Ten seconds ago, you never heard of him. Now you‰Ûªre an expert.",5
24278,Scene,16, The hallway.,5
24279,Leonard,16, Hey.,5
24280,Penny,16," Hey, you.",5
24281,Leonard,16," Is that your laundry? You only have, like, six things in there.",5
24282,Penny,16," Yeah, I didn‰Ûªt have any quarters, so I‰Ûªve been sneaking stuff into other people‰Ûªs loads all day. Hey, if I tell you something, will you promise not to tell anybody?",5
24283,Leonard,16," It doesn‰Ûªt matter what I say, you‰Ûªre gonna tell me anyway.",5
24284,Penny,16, What? That is not true. Bernadette wants a pre-nup.,5
24285,Leonard,16, Wow. That‰Ûªs rough.,5
24286,Penny,16," So you‰Ûªre saying if I became a famous movie star, we got married, you wouldn‰Ûªt sign a pre-nup?",5
24287,Leonard,16," Absolutely not. If I‰Ûªm gonna be stuck at home with the kids while you‰Ûªre on location cheating on me with Ryan Gosling, then Leonard gots to get paid. So, you think about us getting married?",5
24288,Penny,16," I think about a lot of things. I think about us getting married, I think about us breaking up. Once in a while, I think about how I didn‰Ûªt leave a note on that Mercedes I dinged in the parking lot last month, but then I have a glass of wine and it passes.",5
24289,Leonard,16," Joke all you want, but you think about it.",5
24290,Penny,16," Well, tell you one thing, if I ever do get married, no Klingon invitations.",5
24291,Leonard,16, Good luck catching a man with that attitude.,5
24292,Scene,16, Amy‰Ûªs laboratory.,5
24293,Sheldon,16," Boy, oh, boy. This vacation is off to a wonderful start. The smell of formaldehyde, the whir of the centrifuge, the distant chatter of lab animals being dispatched for dissection. Mm, I can already feel my cares just melting away.",5
24294,Amy,16, I‰Ûªm excited to work with my boyfriend. It‰Ûªs gonna be romantic.,5
24295,Sheldon,16, Way to kill the mood.,5
24296,Amy,16," Come on, Sheldon. We can be like Marie Curie and her husband, Pierre, who spent their days working side by side, bathed in the glow of their love and the radium that ultimately killed her. Screw Beauty and the Beast, that‰Ûªs the love story Disney should tell.",5
24297,Sheldon,16," Okay, what do we start with? Maybe splicing some genes, clone a sheep, perhaps grow a human ear on a mouse‰Ûªs back? Ha-ha, I‰Ûªm a freak!",5
24298,Amy,16," Oh, I‰Ûªm gonna be doing some brain stem histology while you put yourself on the business end of a sponge and wash those beakers.",5
24299,Sheldon,16," Wash those bea‰Û_ Oh, I get it, a little hazing for the new fella. Yeah, I‰Ûªd better keep and eye out for, what, shoe polish on the microscope, or mad cow disease in my grilled cheese sandwich?",5
24300,Amy,16," No, I just need those beakers washed. Hippity-hop, quick like a bunny.",5
24301,Sheldon,16," What? Excuse me, you have Dr. Sheldon Cooper in your lab. You‰Ûªre gonna make him do the dishes? That‰Ûªs like asking the Incredible Hulk to open a pickle jar.",5
24302,Amy,16," Sheldon, you‰Ûªve never worked in a lab like this before. You have no experience in the field of biology.",5
24303,Sheldon,16, I have plenty of experience in biology. I bought a Tamagotchi in 1998. And it‰Ûªs still alive. Let‰Ûªs do this.,5
24304,Scene,16, The cafeteria.,5
24305,Leonard,16, Where‰Ûªs Howard?,5
24306,Raj,16," No hi, Raj? No how are you, Raj? Just straight to where‰Ûªs the other white guy?",5
24307,Leonard,16," I‰Ûªm sorry. So, listen, I heard something about him. Can you keep it between us?",5
24308,Raj,16," Ooh, gossip. When I first got here, I thought you Americans really gossiped around the water cooler. So I hung out there for, like, a month, but the only gossip I ever heard was about some creepy guy hanging out by the water cooler.",5
24309,Leonard,16, Bernadette wants to get a pre-nup.,5
24310,Raj,16," Oh, that‰Ûªs a shame, he‰Ûªs gonna be devastated.",5
24311,Leonard,16, I never know what to do in these situations. Should I give him a heads-up?,5
24312,Raj,16, Hmm. I‰Ûªm gonna give you the same advice I yell at the TV when the Bachelor‰Ûªs handing out roses. Follow your heart.,5
24313,Howard,16, Check it out. Look at the size of that Rice Krispie Treat. Same price.,5
24314,Leonard,16," Hey, Howard, I need to tell you something.",5
24315,Howard,16," I know, it‰Ûªs not on my wedding diet. I don‰Ûªt care.",5
24316,Leonard,16," Uh, listen, I heard that Bernadette‰Ûªs thinking about asking you for a pre-nup.",5
24317,Howard,16, A pre-nup? Wow.,5
24318,Leonard,16, What are you gonna do?,5
24319,Howard,16, I don‰Ûªt know.,5
24320,Raj,16, Follow your heart.,5
24321,Howard,16," You know what, it‰Ûªs not a big deal. She makes more money than me. She wants to protect her financial interests. It‰Ûªs completely reasonable.",5
24322,Howard,16," Yeah, actually, it‰Ûªs good for both of us. I have assets to protect, too.",5
24323,Raj,16, Like what?,5
24324,Howard,16, I‰Ûªve got some rare comic books. The Vespa‰Ûªs almost paid off. And Ma and I have a primo double cemetery plot at Mt. Sinai right near the guy who played Mr. Roper on Three‰Ûªs Company.,5
24325,Raj,16, Mr. Roper‰Ûªs dead? You can‰Ûªt just spring that on a guy.,5
24326,Scene,16, Amy‰Ûªs laboratory.,5
24327,Sheldon,16, Here you go. This is now the only lab with glassware washed by a man with two doctorates and a restraining order signed by Carl Sagan.,5
24328,Amy,16, Soap spots. Wash ‰Ûªem again.,5
24329,Sheldon,16, Y-you‰Ûªre being ridiculous. Those are perfectly clean.,5
24330,Amy,16," Sheldon, this beaker used to contain cerebral spinal fluid from an elephant that died of syphilis. If it‰Ûªs, in fact, perfectly clean, drink from it.",5
24331,Sheldon,16, Biologists are mean.,5
24332,Amy,16," All right, perhaps this task will be a little bit more up your alley. I need you to count the bacteria spores on these petri dishes.",5
24333,Sheldon,16, There was something wrong with that detergent. That was way too bubbly.,5
24334,Amy,16, I‰Ûªm sure it was.,5
24335,Sheldon,16, I intend to write that soap company a strongly worded letter.,5
24336,Amy,16," Yeah, good for you. Now, start counting.",5
24337,Sheldon,16, You know what this place needs? A suggestion box.,5
24338,Sheldon,16, 366‰Û_ 367‰Û_,5
24339,Amy,16, How‰Ûªs it going?,5
24340,Sheldon,16," How‰Ûªs counting going? When I was in kindergarten, I recited pi to a thousand places for the school talent show. I think I got this.",5
24341,Amy,16, Great.,5
24342,Sheldon,16," Aw, nuts! One‰Û_",5
24343,Sheldon,16," This is preposterous. I think you‰Ûªre giving me these tasks because you‰Ûªre afraid if you give me anything meaningful to do, I‰Ûªll show you up.",5
24344,Amy,16, Really? Is that what you think?,5
24345,Sheldon,16," Yes, that‰Ûªs what I think. And I‰Ûªm super smart, so it‰Ûªs probably true.",5
24346,Amy,16," Hey, I‰Ûªve been training in the field of neurobiology for 12 years. You‰Ûªve been here for three hours, and you‰Ûªve spent one of them in the bathroom.",5
24347,Sheldon,16, I‰Ûªm sorry. It takes me a while to get things going on an unfamiliar toilet.,5
24348,Amy,16," Sheldon, I‰Ûªve given you the simplest things to do, and you haven‰Ûªt done one of them right.",5
24349,Sheldon,16, Maybe that‰Ûªs because I‰Ûªm not being challenged. It‰Ûªs the same reason Einstein failed math.,5
24350,Amy,16, Maybe the math was too bubbly for him.,5
24351,Sheldon,16," You think you‰Ûªre doing science by cutting up that brain? They could do the same thing at any Quiznos. And they‰Ûªd offer to toast it for me, too.",5
24352,Amy,16," Okay, smart guy. I‰Ûªm about to remove the locus coeruleus, which is incredibly delicate work. Have at it.",5
24353,Sheldon,16, All right. I‰Ûªm no stranger to a little gray matter. Locus coeruleus. Locus coeruleus.,5
24354,Amy,16," You‰Ûªre getting warmer, it is, indeed, in the brain. Hope your hands are steady. It‰Ûªs the width of a single hair. But this is just biology, so I‰Ûªm sure it‰Ûªs no problem for a genius like you.",5
24355,Sheldon,16," It‰Ûªs not. I‰Ûªll have you know, in the field of physics, we work with particles so small, they make fat jokes about the locus coeruleus, i.e., when your locus coeruleus sits around the house, it sits around the house.",5
24356,Amy,16," Oh, are we nervous, Dr. Cooper?",5
24357,Sheldon,16, No. What you see is a man trembling with confidence. Does a locus coeruleus normally bleed that much?,5
24358,Amy,16, No. But your thumb does.,5
24359,Sheldon,16," Oh, dear. (Faints)",5
24360,Amy,16," Yeah, you‰Ûªre a biologist.",5
24361,Scene,16, The bar at the Cheesecake Factory.,5
24362,Howard,16, What are you doing here?,5
24363,Sheldon,16, I‰Ûªm on vacation. Social convention dictates that I let my hair down at a local watering hole. Social convention is stupid.,5
24364,Howard,16, What happened to your thumb?,5
24365,Sheldon,16," You know, I have ten fingers and ten toes. If I tell you a story about each one of them, we‰Ûªll be here all day, let‰Ûªs just move on.",5
24366,Barman,16, What can I get you?,5
24367,Sheldon,16," Ah, seeing as I‰Ûªm on vacation, a pina colada seems appropriate. Extra pineapple slices, extra whipped cream, extra cherries, extra umbrellas, and, uh, hold the rum. Don‰Ûªt let me have too many of those.",5
24368,Penny,16," Hey, what are you guys doing here?",5
24369,Howard,16," We‰Ûªre grown men, we drink at bars.",5
24370,Penny,16, No and no. Everything okay with you and Bernadette?,5
24371,Howard,16," Oh, yeah, sure.",5
24372,Penny,16, You and Amy? Good?,5
24373,Sheldon,16," Oh, better than good.",5
24374,Penny,16, You know those girls text me every detail of their lives as it happens.,5
24375,Howard,16, I‰Ûªm not signing a pre-nup.,5
24376,Penny,16," All right, Howard Wolowitz, listen up. You sign anything she puts in front of you, because you are the luckiest man alive. If you let her go, there is no way you can find anyone else. Speaking on behalf of all women, it is not gonna happen, we had a meeting. And you, a grown man fainting at the sight of a little blood.",5
24377,Sheldon,16," Excuse me, this is a fairly substantial wound. (Removes plaster. Faints again)",5
24378,Scene,16, Amy‰Ûªs laboratory.,5
24379,Sheldon,16," (Knock, knock, knock) Amy? (Knock, knock, knock) Amy? (Knock, knock, knock) Amy?",5
24380,Amy,16, What do you want?,5
24381,Sheldon,16," I was kind of hoping I could continue vacationing in your laboratory. After all, I did book the whole week.",5
24382,Amy,16, Do you honestly think you can just waltz back in here after the way you behaved yesterday?,5
24383,Sheldon,16, I was not myself. I had lost a lot of thumb blood.,5
24384,Amy,16, That‰Ûªs not an apology.,5
24385,Sheldon,16, That is your opinion.,5
24386,Amy,16, I want a real apology.,5
24387,Sheldon,16, I‰Ûªm sorry that you weren‰Ûªt able to‰Û_,5
24388,Amy,16, No.,5
24389,Sheldon,16, That my genius‰Û_,5
24390,Amy,16, No.,5
24391,Sheldon,16, That the soap was‰Û_,5
24392,Amy,16, Sheldon.,5
24393,Sheldon,16, Fine. Sorry.,5
24394,Amy,16," You‰Ûªre forgiven. Now, if you want to stay, get started on those beakers. They‰Ûªre still dirty from yesterday.",5
24395,Sheldon,16, Next year I‰Ûªm going to Epcot.,5
24396,Scene,16, Bernadette‰Ûªs car.,5
24397,Bernadette,16, Are you mad at me?,5
24398,Howard,16," No. I‰Ûªm not mad at you. I just wish you would have come to me, so I didn‰Ûªt have to hear it through the nerd-vine.",5
24399,Bernadette,16," So, what are we gonna do?",5
24400,Howard,16, You really want me to sign a pre-nup?,5
24401,Bernadette,16," I don‰Ûªt know. My dad‰Ûªs pretty insistent on it, though.",5
24402,Howard,16," Why don‰Ûªt I talk to your dad, man-to-man?",5
24403,Bernadette,16," Really? Oh, that‰Ûªd be so great.",5
24404,Howard,16, Done.,5
24405,Bernadette,16," I should probably give you a heads-up about a couple of things. Even though he‰Ûªs retired from the police force, he still carries his gun. But don‰Ûªt worry, he won‰Ûªt shoot it. It‰Ûªs more of a fashion statement.",5
24406,Howard,16, Okay.,5
24407,Bernadette,16," And just to be safe, when you talk to him, don‰Ûªt bring up Jimmy Carter, gardeners, foreign people, homosexuals, Sean Penn, Vatican II, gun control, organic food, the designated hitter rule, recycling or the fact that you‰Ûªre Jewish.",5
24408,Howard,16," Got it, got it. Will you e-mail me that list?",5
24409,Bernadette,16," So the thing to watch for, if he‰Ûªs shouting at you, you‰Ûªre okay, but if he starts to get real quiet, leave as quickly as you can without making eye contact. Not in a straight line, throw some zigs and zigs in there.",5
24410,Howard,16," You know, this isn‰Ûªt that pressing. Why don‰Ûªt I talk to him about it in May.",5
24411,Bernadette,16, In May you‰Ûªre gonna be on the International Space Station.,5
24412,Howard,16, They‰Ûªve got a phone.,5
24413,Scene,17, A corridor at the university,5
24414,Raj,17, It was a nice retirement party.,5
24415,Howard,17," I guess. Still, it‰Ûªs a shame Professor Rothman was forced to step down.",5
24416,Leonard,17, What choice did the university have? He snapped. It happens to theoretical physicists all the time.,5
24417,Howard,17, I wonder how long Sheldon‰Ûªs got.,5
24418,Sheldon,17, These shrimp are all the same size. There‰Ûªs no the logical order to eat them in.,5
24419,Leonard,17, Can‰Ûªt be very long.,5
24420,Raj,17," Hey, look, there‰Ûªs Rothman‰Ûªs empty office. Sad.",5
24421,Leonard,17, Yeah.,5
24422,Sheldon,17," Mm, indeed.",5
24423,Howard,17, So sad.,5
24424,Sheldon,17, Dibs.,5
24425,Kripke,17," What‰Ûªs up, fewwas?",5
24426,Sheldon,17," What are you doing here, Kripke?",5
24427,Kripke,17," Ah, measuwing my new office for dwapes.",5
24428,Sheldon,17, This is not your office. It hasn‰Ûªt been assigned yet.,5
24429,Kripke,17," Well, I called dibs at the Chwistmas party when Pwofessor Wothman twied to have intercourse with the toys for tots cowwection box.",5
24430,Sheldon,17," Dibs? This is a university, not a playground. Offices are not assigned because someone called dibs.",5
24431,Leonard,17, You just called dibs.,5
24432,Sheldon,17, Shut it. Offices are assigned by seniority. I arrived at the university first.,5
24433,Kripke,17, I awwived at the office first. I‰Ûªm the pwoverbial earwy bird.,5
24434,"Rothman (entering, naked)",17, Gentlemen.,5
24435,All,17, Professor Rothman.,5
24436,Rothman,17, Good evening.,5
24437,All,17, Good evening.,5
24438,Raj,17, I‰Ûªm glad that men are wearing hats again. They‰Ûªre so distinguished.,5
24439,Scene,17, Penny‰Ûªs apartment.,5
24440,Amy,17, I got you a little something.,5
24441,Penny,17," A little something? Oh, it‰Û_ what, this is huge.",5
24442,Amy,17, What‰Ûªs huge is what you‰Ûªve done for me.,5
24443,Penny,17," Oh, no, Amy, I haven‰Ûªt done anything.",5
24444,Amy,17," No, no, before I met you, I was a mousy wallflower. But look at me now. I‰Ûªm like some kind of downtown hipster party girl. With a posse, a boyfriend and a new lace bra that hooks in the front, of all things. Open it. Open it.",5
24445,Penny,17, Okay. (Opens parcel to find a huge and not at all flattering painting of Penny and Amy),5
24446,Amy,17, I wanted to get you something you didn‰Ûªt have.,5
24447,Penny,17, Wow. I-I don‰Ûªt know what to s‰Û_ Wow.,5
24448,Amy,17, Do you like it?,5
24449,Penny,17, Do I like it? Wow.,5
24450,Amy,17," So, uh, where are you gonna hang it?",5
24451,Penny,17," Oh, my God. Hang it. Wow. Um, you know, I‰Ûªd have to go get a hook and nails and a hammer and‰Û_",5
24452,Amy,17, No problem.,5
24453,Penny,17," Oh, look. You, huh, you just, you got it all right there. Wow.",5
24454,Scene,17, A bathroom at the university.,5
24455,Sheldon,17, I found him. He‰Ûªs in the bathroom. President Siebert?,5
24456,Siebert,17, Can‰Ûªt this wait?,5
24457,Sheldon,17, I‰Ûªm sorry. We just need a word.,5
24458,Siebert,17," Now? You realize I‰Ûªm your boss, and I am holding my penis?",5
24459,Kripke,17," Sheldon, give the man some pwivacy. I‰Ûªm sowwy. This guy‰Ûªs got no wespect for boundawies.",5
24460,Siebert,17, What do you want?,5
24461,Kripke,17, Will you tell this wunatic that Pwofessor Wothman‰Ûªs office is wightfully mine?,5
24462,Siebert,17, Can‰Ûªt you take this up with your department chairman?,5
24463,Sheldon,17, We tried. His assistant said he was on sabbatical. Although we distinctly heard his office window open and shut.,5
24464,Siebert,17," Gentlemen, there‰Ûªs a task I‰Ûªm trying to accomplish here, and I‰Ûªm having trouble doing it.",5
24465,Sheldon,17," Oh, my. President Siebert, I don‰Ûªt mean to be an alarmist, but difficulty initiating a urine stream could be a symptom of benign prostatic hyperplasia. If you‰Ûªre interested, I can send you a link to a YouTube video that‰Ûªll show you how to perform your own rectal exam. Yeah, uh, helpful hint, trim your nails first.",5
24466,Kripke,17," Ignore him, Pwesident Siebert. I‰Ûªm sure a young man such as yourself has a perfectwy healthy pwostate.",5
24467,Sheldon,17," Oh, he‰Ûªs just trying to butter you up. And for the record, butter is an excellent lubricant for your rectal exam.",5
24468,Siebert,17," Gentlemen, I‰Ûªm going to allow the two of you to work this out because A, you‰Ûªre both brilliant scientists, and B, as far as who gets Rothman‰Ûªs office, I couldn‰Ûªt give the furry crack of a rat‰Ûªs behind.",5
24469,Kripke,17," Well, as wong as we‰Ûªre here, I might as well take a weak.",5
24470,Sheldon,17, Kripke?,5
24471,Kripke,17, Yes?,5
24472,Sheldon,17, You‰Ûªre in my spot.,5
24473,Scene,17, Penny‰Ûªs apartment.,5
24474,Bernadette,17, That is big.,5
24475,Penny,17, So big.,5
24476,Bernadette,17, And ugly.,5
24477,Penny,17, So ugly. What am I gonna do?,5
24478,Bernadette,17," I don‰Ûªt know. You can‰Ûªt take it down. You‰Ûªll break her heart. Look at that face. That enormous, unsettling, crazy face.",5
24479,Penny,17, Is there any chance I‰Ûªll learn to love it?,5
24480,Bernadette,17, That depends. Do you like pictures of yourself where you look like a man?,5
24481,Penny,17," All right, it‰Ûªs got to go.",5
24482,Bernadette,17, What will you tell Amy?,5
24483,Penny,17, How about I tell her the painting makes you feel jealous because you‰Ûªre not in it?,5
24484,Bernadette,17, Nuh-uh. What if she gets me one? I already have a picture of me and Howard‰Ûªs mom getting our hair cornrowed in Venice Beach. I‰Ûªve suffered enough.,5
24485,Penny,17," Well, I guess I could take it down and put it up when she comes over, but it‰Ûªs kind of heavy.",5
24486,Bernadette,17," Mmm, too bad you‰Ûªre not as strong as the dude in the painting.",5
24487,Scene,17, The apartment.,5
24488,Raj,17," Would you look at this? I paid twenty five dollars to some kid on eBay for a handcrafted Harry Potter wand. He sent me a stick. He went into his backyard, he picked up a stick.",5
24489,Howard,17, It‰Ûªs numbered.,5
24490,Raj,17," Ooh, limited edition. Nice.",5
24491,Sheldon (knock on door),17," Oh, that‰Ûªll be Kripke.",5
24492,Leonard,17, What‰Ûªs he doing here?,5
24493,Sheldon,17," We‰Ûªre going to work this office situation out like gentlemen. And if that doesn‰Ûªt work, I‰Ûªm going to poison his tea.",5
24494,Kripke,17, Cooper.,5
24495,Sheldon,17, Kripke. Come in. I‰Ûªm making tea. Would you like a cup?,5
24496,Kripke,17," Am I weawing a summer fwock? No, I don‰Ûªt want tea. Wet‰Ûªs get down to bwass tacks.",5
24497,Sheldon,17, Fine. In the interest of preserving our friendship‰Û_,5
24498,Kripke,17, We‰Ûªre not fwiends.,5
24499,Sheldon,17," Well, that‰Ûªs a little hard to hear, but all right. As you know, the essence of diplomacy is compromise. With that in mind, I propose the following. I will take Rothman‰Ûªs office, and you will find a way to be okay with that.",5
24500,Kripke,17," How about I take Wothman‰Ûªs office, and you go suck a wemon?",5
24501,Sheldon,17, You sure I can‰Ûªt get you that cup of tea?,5
24502,Raj,17, How about you decide this with Rock-Paper-Scissors-Lizard-Spock?,5
24503,Kripke,17, What the fwig is that?,5
24504,Sheldon,17, Rock-Paper-Scissors-Lizard-Spock was created by Internet pioneer Sam Kass as an improvement on the classic game Rock-Paper-Scissors. All hail Sam Kass.,5
24505,All,17, Hail.,5
24506,Kripke,17, How does it work?,5
24507,Sheldon,17," Oh, it‰Ûªs very simple. Scissors cuts paper, paper covers rock, rock crushes lizard, lizard poisons Spock, Spock smashes scissors, scissors decapitates lizard, lizard eats paper, paper disproves Spock, Spock vaporizes rock, and as it always has, rock crushes scissors.",5
24508,Kripke,17, I‰Ûªm sowwy. Can you wepeat that?,5
24509,Sheldon,17," Well, of course. Scissors cuts paper, paper covers rock, rock crushes lizard, lizard poisons Spock, Spock smashes scissors, scissors decapitates lizard, lizard eats paper, paper disproves Spock, Spock vaporizes rock, and as it always has, rock crushes scissors.",5
24510,Kripke,17, Almost got it. One more time.,5
24511,Sheldon,17," Surely. Scissors cuts paper, paper covers rock, rock‰Û_",5
24512,Howard,17," Sheldon, stop. He‰Ûªs screwing with you.",5
24513,Sheldon,17," Is he? Well, then, it seems we have reached an impasse. I see no other option than to challenge you to a duel. I‰Ûªd smack you with a glove, but just last week I packed away my winter things.",5
24514,Howard,17, It‰Ûªs the 21st century. You can‰Ûªt have a duel.,5
24515,Leonard,17," H-h-h-hang on, Howard. Barry, how good of a shot are you?",5
24516,Kripke,17," You have a compwete advantage in twivia. You have an eidetic memowy. Pwus, I haven‰Ûªt watched Star Twek since I discovered the stwip cwub near my apartment has a fwee buffet.",5
24517,Leonard,17, It‰Ûªs gonna be hard to find something you‰Ûªre both equally good at.,5
24518,Raj,17, Is there anything you‰Ûªre both equally bad at?,5
24519,Both,17, Sports.,5
24520,Scene,17, A basketball court.,5
24521,Leonard,17," All right, this is one-on-one. First person to five wins the office. Any questions? Yes, Sheldon?",5
24522,Sheldon,17, Five what?,5
24523,Leonard,17, Balls in the basket. (Throws ball to Sheldon),5
24524,Sheldon (dodging out of the way),17, Ew!,5
24525,Kripke,17," It‰Ûªs out, wight?",5
24526,Kripke,17, Time. Wan out of woom.,5
24527,Leonard,17, You know all those terrible things bullies used to do to us?,5
24528,Raj,17, Yeah.,5
24529,Leonard,17, I get it.,5
24530,Sheldon,17," Hey! He did that on purpose,",5
24531,Leonard,17," No, he didn‰Ûªt. Nothing that‰Ûªs happening here is being done on purpose. Okay, uh, forget one-on-one. Let‰Ûªs try a free throw contest. First person who makes a basket wins the office.",5
24532,Kripke,17," Making it too easy there, Hofstadter.",5
24533,Leonard,17," No. No, I‰Ûªm not.",5
24534,Sheldon,17," Use the force, Sheldon. Use the force. (Throws ball. It goes about two feet in front of him.) I‰Ûªm gonna need more force.",5
24535,Kripke,17," Aw wight, Cooper, pwepare to have your heart bwoken. (Throws ball up. It hits the ceiling and doesn‰Ûªt come down.) Do I get points for that?",5
24536,Leonard,17," All right, we gave it 45 minutes. It‰Ûªs no longer funny. Let‰Ûªs try something else.",5
24537,Sheldon,17, What do you propose?,5
24538,Leonard,17," Uh, on the count of three, both of you bounce the balls as hard as you can. The highest bounce wins the office.",5
24539,Kripke,17," Oh, you are going down, Cooper.",5
24540,Sheldon,17," I don‰Ûªt think so, Kripke. I‰Ûªve bounced many a rubber ball in my day.",5
24541,Leonard,17," All right, that‰Ûªs enough trash talk. One, two, three.",5
24542,Howard,17, Sheldon was higher.,5
24543,Leonard,17," Congratulations, Sheldon. You win office.",5
24544,Sheldon,17, Who‰Ûªs unsatisfactory in P.E. now?,5
24545,Scene,17, Penny‰Ûªs apartment.,5
24546,Amy,17," Oh, what a great movie.",5
24547,Penny,17, I cannot believe you‰Ûªve never seen Grease.,5
24548,Amy,17, My mother didn‰Ûªt allow me to watch it. She was afraid it might encourage me to join a gang.,5
24549,Bernadette,17," I‰Ûªve got to go. I‰Ûªve got to get up early. My company‰Ûªs testing a new steroid that supposedly doesn‰Ûªt shrink testicles, and the last one there has to do the measuring.",5
24550,Amy,17," I guess I should get going, too. Good night, painting Penny. Good night, real Penny.",5
24551,Penny,17," Good night, real Amy.",5
24552,Amy,17," You don‰Ûªt have to say good night to painting Amy, ‰Ûªcause she‰Ûªs never leaving.",5
24553,Bernadette,17," Good night, real Penny.",5
24554,Penny,17, Bye.,5
24555,Bernadette,17," Good night, transvestite Penny.",5
24556,Penny,17," Ah, okay. Let us take you off the wall. Out of sight, out of mind. I wish.",5
24557,Amy (entering),17," You know, can I borrow that movie? Those singing hooligans really got my motor running.",5
24558,Penny,17," Sure, sure. Enjoy. I mean, get it back to me when you can, or, you know what, actually, you keep it. It‰Ûªs just going to be my gift to you. Bye.",5
24559,Amy,17, Thank you. Wait. Where‰Ûªd the painting go?,5
24560,Penny,17, It‰Ûªs right over there.,5
24561,Amy,17, Why?,5
24562,Penny,17, I have no idea. That is weird.,5
24563,Amy,17, You hate it.,5
24564,Penny,17," No. No, no. It‰Ûªs just, it‰Ûªs a little big.",5
24565,Amy,17, I feel like an idiot.,5
24566,Penny,17," No, come on, you‰Ûªre not an idiot. Look, just help me put it back up.",5
24567,Amy,17, Why? So you can just take it down when I leave? I don‰Ûªt need your pity.,5
24568,Penny,17," Oh, Amy, come on.",5
24569,Amy,17, I‰Ûªm just glad I didn‰Ûªt go for the sculpture.,5
24570,Scene,17, Rothman‰Ûªs office.,5
24571,Sheldon,17," Ah, the spoils. I see why victors love them.",5
24572,Raj,17," I‰Ûªm happy for you, Sheldon. But I have to admit I‰Ûªm going to miss sharing an office with you.",5
24573,Sheldon,17," Oh, of course you are. Feel free to drop by any time.",5
24574,Raj,17, Thank you.,5
24575,Sheldon,17, Yeah. Call first. (Pushes him out. Closes door. Rothman is standing naked behind it.),5
24576,Rothman,17, Oh. Hello.,5
24577,Sheldon,17, Professor Rothman. This isn‰Ûªt your office any more. You‰Ûªre retired.,5
24578,Rothman,17, I think the word you‰Ûªre looking for is invisible.,5
24579,Scene,17, Amy‰Ûªs apartment.,5
24580,Penny,17, I came to say I‰Ûªm sorry.,5
24581,Amy,17, Don‰Ûªt bother.,5
24582,Penny,17," Oh, Amy, please.",5
24583,Amy,17," I‰Ûªm so humiliated. I sat there the whole time that we were watching Grease, thinking you liked the painting.",5
24584,Penny,17, I know.,5
24585,Amy,17, I was a fool from Summer Lovin‰Ûª to the very last rama lama lama ke ding a de dinga a dong.,5
24586,Penny,17, You‰Ûªre right. You‰Ûªre absolutely right. I should have been honest with you and told you the gift was too much.,5
24587,Amy,17," Yes, too much. Because our friendship is fundamentally asymmetrical. I clearly like you more than you like me.",5
24588,Penny,17, I don‰Ûªt think you can put a number on how much one person likes another.,5
24589,Amy,17, I bought you a painting that‰Ûªs 12 square feet in area. There‰Ûªs a number.,5
24590,Penny,17," Amy, come on‰Û_",5
24591,Amy,17," If you don‰Ûªt like feet, you can try dollars. The painting set me back three grand.",5
24592,Penny,17," Three gr‰Û_ Oh, my God! Look, look, Amy, all you need to know is, you are my friend and I don‰Ûªt want to lose you out of my life.",5
24593,Amy,17," I‰Ûªm sorry, I‰Ûªm just having trouble believing you right now.",5
24594,Penny,17, Grab your hammer.,5
24595,Amy,17, No. Damage is done.,5
24596,Penny,17," Okay, look, I didn‰Ûªt want to say this, but the real reason I took the painting down was because it made Bernadette very jealous.",5
24597,Amy,17," Oh, my goodness, how could I have not seen that? The painting is a constant reminder that of the three of us, she is the least cool.",5
24598,Penny,17," Yeah, th-th-th-that‰Ûªs what it is, so‰Û_",5
24599,Amy,17, You have such a good heart.,5
24600,Penny,17," Huh, I try.",5
24601,Amy,17, Come on.,5
24602,Penny,17, Well where are we going?,5
24603,Amy,17, We‰Ûªre going to go put this painting back up in your apartment.,5
24604,Penny,17," Well, what about Bernadette?",5
24605,Amy,17," Oh, screw her. She‰Ûªs just lucky we let her hang out with us.",5
24606,Scene,17, Rothman‰Ûªs office. Sheldon is trying to affix paper over a fiercely blowing air vent.,5
24607,Leonard,17, What are you doing?,5
24608,Sheldon,17, I‰Ûªm trying to raise the temperature in here before my nipples tear through my shirt.,5
24609,Howard,17, Why don‰Ûªt you just turn up the thermostat?,5
24610,Sheldon,17," Aha! Good question. It turns out the thermostat for my new office isn‰Ûªt in my new office. No. It‰Ûªs next door, in Professor Davenport‰Ûªs office, who is currently enjoying the hot flashes associated with menopause.",5
24611,Leonard,17, Why is there a hole here?,5
24612,Raj,17," Well, at least you finally got a window that opens. That‰Ûªs nice.",5
24613,Sheldon,17, Is it? Listen.,5
24614,Raj,17," What, you don‰Ûªt like wind chimes?",5
24615,Sheldon,17," No, I hate them, but it gets worse. There it is.",5
24616,Howard,17, The bird?,5
24617,Sheldon,17," Yeah, It‰Ûªs completely out of tune with the wind chimes.",5
24618,Raj,17, So?,5
24619,Sheldon,17," You don‰Ûªt get it, do you? That‰Ûªs a mockingbird. Mockingbirds can change their song, which means he‰Ûªs out of tune on purpose. He‰Ûªs mocking me. Oh dear. There it is again. Do you feel it?",5
24620,Howard,17, The growing realization that you are one wacky bastard? Yep.,5
24621,Sheldon,17," No. The vibration. We are directly underneath the geology lab, and they‰Ûªre running their confounded sieve shakers again. Hey, gravel monkeys, if you need to shake rocks, try jiggling your heads around!",5
24622,Leonard,17," Sheldon, relax.",5
24623,Sheldon,17, How can I relax? My nervous system is being stretched out like the strings of a harp and plucked by holes and birds and wind and the low-hanging scrotum of the difficult-to-evict Professor Rothman.,5
24624,Leonard,17," If you‰Ûªre not happy, why don‰Ûªt you just let Kripke have the office?",5
24625,Sheldon,17," What, and let him win? Do I look crazy to you? We‰Ûªre trying to think down here, you geode-loving feldspar jockeys! (To the bird) And you, the notes are C, D, E, G and A. You pick one or I am chopping down that tree!",5
24626,Scene,17, Penny‰Ûªs apartment.,5
24627,Penny,17, How‰Ûªs that?,5
24628,Amy,17, Little higher on the right.,5
24629,Penny,17, Now?,5
24630,Amy,17, Little more. No. That‰Ûªs got it.,5
24631,Penny,17," Yeah, okay. That‰Ûªs, uh, that‰Ûªs good.",5
24632,Amy,17, I‰Ûªll let you in on a little secret.,5
24633,Penny,17, Mm.,5
24634,Amy,17," Originally we were painted nude. But I had him add clothes, ‰Ûªcause I thought it was an unnecessary challenge to our heterosexuality.",5
24635,Penny,17," Yeah, good call.",5
24636,Amy,17," But if you ever change your mind, all it would take is some warm, soapy water and a couple of sponges.",5
24637,Penny,17," You‰Ûªre talking about the painting, right?",5
24638,Amy,17, Sure.,5
24639,Scene,17, Rothman‰Ûªs office. Sheldon has his head stuck in the hole in the wall.,5
24640,Sheldon,17, Help! Somebody help!,5
24641,Leonard,17, What happened?,5
24642,Sheldon,17, I was trying to see what was in here and my head got stuck.,5
24643,Leonard,17, Why would you do that?,5
24644,Sheldon,17, It‰Ûªs called scientific curiosity. Now go get butter.,5
24645,Leonard,17, Hang in there. I‰Ûªll be right back. (Takes out phone and takes a photo. Sits down and starts posting it online.),5
24646,Scene,18, A barber‰Ûªs shop.,5
24647,Leonard,18, I‰Ûªm just gonna run to the store and get a few things. I‰Ûªll pick you up when you‰Ûªre done.,5
24648,Sheldon,18," Okay. I like it a little better when you stay, but all right.",5
24649,Barber,18," Hey, Sheldon.",5
24650,Sheldon,18, Hello. I‰Ûªm here for my haircut with Mr. D‰ÛªOnofrio.,5
24651,Barber,18," I‰Ûªm sorry, Uncle Tony‰Ûªs in the hospital. He‰Ûªs pretty sick.",5
24652,Sheldon,18," Oh, dear, Mr. D‰ÛªOnofrio‰Ûªs in the hospital. Why do these things always happen to me?",5
24653,Barber,18, I can cut it for you.,5
24654,Sheldon,18, You‰Ûªre not Mr. D‰ÛªOnofrio. I get my hair cut by Mr. D‰ÛªOnofrio. You believe this guy?,5
24655,Leonard,18," Excuse us for a second. Sheldon, it‰Ûªs okay, he can do it. He‰Ûªs a barber.",5
24656,Sheldon,18," He‰Ûªs not a barber, he‰Ûªs the nephew. He‰Ûªs an example of the kind of nepotism that runs rampant in the barbering industry. Besides, Mr. D‰ÛªOnofrio knows exactly how I like my hair done because he has all my haircut records from my barber in Texas.",5
24657,Leonard,18, What are you talking about?,5
24658,Sheldon,18," When I first moved here I was nervous about finding a new barber, so my mother had all my haircut records sent here to Mr. D‰ÛªOnofrio.",5
24659,Leonard,18, There‰Ûªs no such thing as haircut records.,5
24660,Sheldon,18," Yes, there are.",5
24661,Leonard,18, Have you ever seen them?,5
24662,Sheldon,18," No, but my mother assured me they were sent here, and I‰Ûªll bet you dollars to doughnuts that this one doesn‰Ûªt have them. Uh, excuse me. Do you have access to my haircut records?",5
24663,Barber,18, Your what?,5
24664,Sheldon,18," To paraphrase T.S. Eliot, this is the way the world ends, not with a bang but with a nephew.",5
24665,Leonard,18," Sheldon, you‰Ûªre a grown man, he‰Ûªs a professional, and your haircut is number three on that poster from 1946. Just sit down and let him do it.",5
24666,Sheldon,18," Fine, but if I come out of this looking like a dork, it‰Ûªs on you. (Sits)",5
24667,Barber,18, So my kid said the funniest thing today.,5
24668,Sheldon,18, Nope. (Runs out),5
24669,Leonard,18," When you tell this story later, the word we usually use is quirky.",5
24670,Scene,18, The apartment.,5
24671,Sheldon,18, Can you pass the Parmesan cheese?,5
24672,Leonard,18, Sure. What are you doing?,5
24673,Sheldon,18, I‰Ûªm trying to get the hair out of my eyes.,5
24674,Leonard,18," Sheldon, you are one day late for your haircut.",5
24675,Sheldon,18, Thank you for captioning my nightmare.,5
24676,Howard,18," Lookie here, I got my travel orders.",5
24677,Raj,18," Payload Specialist Howard Wolowitz is requested to report to the NASA Johnson Space Center, Houston, Texas, for astronaut training Monday eight a.m.",5
24678,Howard,18," Yeah, but it‰Ûªs from NASA, so it‰Ûªs oh eight hundred.",5
24679,Raj,18, But it says eight a.m.,5
24680,Howard,18, You read it as oh eight hundred.,5
24681,Raj,18, It doesn‰Ûªt have an oh in front of it.,5
24682,Howard,18," You know what does have an oh in front of it? Oh, my God, I‰Ûªm an astronaut, and you‰Ûªre dying of jealousy.",5
24683,Leonard,18," So, what kind of things are they‰Û_ (to Sheldon) will you stop that?",5
24684,Sheldon,18," I can‰Ûªt help it, I feel like a teen heartthrob.",5
24685,Penny,18," You know, Sheldon, I used to cut my brother‰Ûªs hair. I could do it for you.",5
24686,Sheldon,18," Penny, I know you mean well, offering the skills of the hill folk, but, um, here in town we don‰Ûªt churn our own butter, we don‰Ûªt, uh, make dresses out of gunny sacks, and, uh, we sure as shootin‰Ûª don‰Ûªt get our hair cut by bottle-blonde‰Û_",5
24687,Leonard,18," Sheldon, be nice.",5
24688,Sheldon,18," I‰Ûªm sorry, it‰Ûªs the bad boy attitude that comes with this hair.",5
24689,Raj,18," You could go to my guy. He‰Ûªs at Juan-Juan in Beverly Hills. They bring you a cup of tea, they‰Ûªll massage your scalp. It‰Ûªs about two hundred dollars, but sometimes you look in the next chair and you see a superstar like Tony Danza.",5
24690,Howard,18," Quick question here, have we actually changed the conversation from I‰Ûªm going",5
24691,Raj,18," Now who‰Ûªs dying of jealousy? Oh, it‰Ûªs you.",5
24692,Scene,18, Amy‰Ûªs apartment. Amy is playing her harp.,5
24693,Amy,18," I‰Ûªm a cowboy, on a steel horse I ride. I‰Ûªm wanted‰Û_ I‰Ûªm wanted‰Û_ wanted, dead or alive. Sheldon, you‰Ûªre ruining girlfriend-boyfriend sing-along night.",5
24694,Sheldon,18," I‰Ûªm sorry. I‰Ûªm looking for a barber and I‰Ûªm running out of time. My hair is growing at the rate of 4.6 yoctometers per femtosecond. I mean, if you‰Ûªre quiet, you can hear it.",5
24695,Amy,18, What about Supercuts?,5
24696,Sheldon,18, I tried once. They do men‰Ûªs and women‰Ûªs hair in the same room at the same time. It‰Ûªs like Sodom and Gomorrah with mousse.,5
24697,Amy,18," Well, this isn‰Ûªt a crisis. Why don‰Ûªt you just let your hair grow out a little?",5
24698,Sheldon,18," Why don‰Ûªt I let my hair grow out? Um, why don‰Ûªt I start wearing Birkenstocks and, uh, uh, seeking validation of my opinions by asking can you dig it?",5
24699,Amy,18," Well, I don‰Ûªt know. I think you might look sexy with long hair. The kind that flows down to your shoulders and blows back while riding on a horse, bareback and bare-chested. I‰Ûªm gonna go brush my teeth, it might take a while.",5
24700,Scene,18, Bernadette‰Ûªs bedroom.,5
24701,Howard (on Skype),18, Hi.,5
24702,Bernadette,18," Hi, sweetie.",5
24703,Howard,18, I miss you.,5
24704,Bernadette,18," I miss you, too. So tell me all about your first day.",5
24705,Howard,18," Oh, wow, where do I even start? I got to experience zero gravity.",5
24706,Bernadette,18, Cool. How do they do that?,5
24707,Howard,18," It‰Ûªs pretty neat. You get in this plane that goes almost straight up for, like, 20 seconds, and then straight back down like it‰Ûªs going to crash, and they do it over and over again, you know, no matter how many times you throw up.",5
24708,Bernadette,18, You threw up?,5
24709,Howard,18," Yeah, and the craziest part is, because there‰Ûªs no gravity, the throw-up kind of floats there, in a little ball, and if your mouth is open because you‰Ûªre screaming, sometimes it just floats right back in. Boy, does everyone laugh at you when that happens.",5
24710,Bernadette,18, That sounds mean.,5
24711,Howard,18," No. Yeah, I would have laughed, too, but I didn‰Ûªt want the vomit to come back out. Anyway, oh, could you do me a favour and overnight me some more underwear?",5
24712,Bernadette,18," Sure, why?",5
24713,Howard,18," I got a look at the centrifuge they‰Ûªre going to spin me around in tomorrow, and I have a hunch I packed a little light.",5
24714,Scene,18, A hospital ward.,5
24715,Sheldon,18," Mr. D‰ÛªOnofrio? It‰Ûªs Sheldon. They didn‰Ûªt have anything barber-themed in the gift shop, so I got you this. I don‰Ûªt know if you can read his little T-shirt. It says, um, get well bear-y soon. Trust me, if you were even a little conscious right now, you‰Ûªd be laughing. Anyway, there‰Ûªs new studies that show, people in comas are aware of everything going on around them. With that in mind, if you can hear me, move away from the light and toward the sound of these scissors.",5
24716,Nurse,18, Can I help you?,5
24717,Sheldon,18, Yes. Do you have something I could use as a cape?,5
24718,Nurse,18," Oh, dear, did we spit out our pills, slip out of the ninth floor, and go on a little adventure?",5
24719,Sheldon,18," Oh, no, no, I‰Ûªm just here to get my hair cut.",5
24720,Nurse,18, I-I see. J-Jus-Just wait here one moment. Security!,5
24721,Sheldon,18," I got to run. But not with scissors, that would be unsafe.",5
24722,Scene,18, The apartment.,5
24723,Penny,18," So, if I move my horsey here, isn‰Ûªt that checkmate and I win?",5
24724,Leonard,18, Hmm.,5
24725,Penny,18," Well, is it or isn‰Ûªt it?",5
24726,Leonard,18," You know, I think this is a good stopping point. Uh, it‰Ûªs your first real game. I threw a lot of information at you.",5
24727,Penny,18," Well, no, I mean, your king is trapped. He can‰Ûªt go here because of my lighthouse, and he can‰Ûªt go here because of my pointy-head guy.",5
24728,Leonard,18," Like I said, complicated game.",5
24729,Penny,18, So did I win or not?,5
24730,Leonard,18," Did you have fun? Because if you had fun, then you are, you are a winner. Now that‰Ûªs, that-that‰Ûªs what chess is all about.",5
24731,Sheldon,18, Hello.,5
24732,Leonard,18, Hey.,5
24733,Penny,18," Oh, hey. Sorry, Sheldon, I‰Ûªll move.",5
24734,Sheldon,18," Eh, why? My spot, your spot, what difference does it make?",5
24735,Penny,18," Okay, what just happened?",5
24736,Leonard,18," I don‰Ûªt know. Between you playing chess like Bobby Fischer and Sheldon being okay with you in his spot, I‰Ûªm guessing someone went back in time, stepped on a bug, and changed the course of human events.",5
24737,Penny,18," Uh, sweetie, are you all right?",5
24738,Sheldon,18," No, I‰Ûªm not all right. It‰Ûªs been six days since I was supposed to get a haircut and nothing horrible has happened.",5
24739,Penny,18," Okay, I‰Ûªm sorry, I don‰Ûªt understand.",5
24740,Sheldon,18," Leonard, explain it to her.",5
24741,Leonard,18," Oh, uh, he‰Ûªs crazy.",5
24742,Sheldon,18," I have spent my whole life trying to bring order to the universe by carefully planning every moment of every day. But all my efforts, our dinner schedule, my pyjama rotation, my bowel movement spreadsheet, it‰Ûªs clear now, I‰Ûªve been wasting my time.",5
24743,Leonard,18, Good. I‰Ûªm taking that disgusting chart off the fridge.,5
24744,Penny,18," You know, Sh-Sheldon, sometimes it‰Ûªs nice not knowing what‰Ûªs coming. I mean, look at me and Leonard. We went out, we broke up, now we‰Ûªre trying again. We don‰Ûªt know what‰Ûªs gonna happen.",5
24745,Sheldon,18," Oh, please, everyone knows what‰Ûªs going to happen. But I see your point.",5
24746,Leonard,18, I think this could be good for you. Maybe it‰Ûªs time for you to shake things up a bit.,5
24747,Sheldon,18, You‰Ûªre right. I should embrace the chaos.,5
24748,Leonard,18, Great. What are you going to do first?,5
24749,Sheldon,18, I don‰Ûªt know. I could do anything. All bets are off. The world is my oyster. I got it. I‰Ûªm going to put on my Tuesday pyjamas tonight.,5
24750,Leonard,18," I got to tell you, I‰Ûªm a little worried about him.",5
24751,Penny,18," If I were you, I‰Ûªd be worried that a girl who‰Ûªs never played chess in her life just kicked your ass.",5
24752,Scene,18, Bernadette‰Ûªs bedroom.,5
24753,Howard (on Skype),18, Hi.,5
24754,Bernadette,18," Howie, what happened to you?",5
24755,Howard,18," We did overnight survival training in the wilderness. Big fun. Big, big fun. I was gonna freshen up for you but I blacked out a little on the way to the bathroom.",5
24756,Bernadette,18, Survival training? Is that like camping?,5
24757,Howard,18," Uh-huh. Except you don‰Ûªt have food or water, and they don‰Ûªt have a sunset Sabbath service like they do at Camp Hess-Kramer.",5
24758,Bernadette,18, Do you sleep in tents?,5
24759,Howard,18," No. I slept in a hole I dug in the ground with my bare hands. And at some point during the night, an armadillo crawled in and spooned me.",5
24760,Bernadette,18, Poor baby.,5
24761,Howard,18," But I did it. I survived. I wasn‰Ûªt sure I was going to when the sandstorm hit. I just pulled my turtleneck up over my head and waited for death. But somehow as I sat there, wrapped in a cocoon of my own neck-sweat, I found that primal part of the human spirit that just wants to keep on living, no matter what the cost.",5
24762,Bernadette,18, You‰Ûªre so brave. I‰Ûªm proud of you.,5
24763,Howard,18," I ate a butterfly. It was so small and beautiful, but I was so hungry.",5
24764,Bernadette,18, Are you crying?,5
24765,Howard,18," No, I don‰Ûªt think it‰Ûªs possible. I‰Ûªm severely dehydrated. My pee is like toothpaste.",5
24766,Bernadette,18," Howie, if you‰Ûªre not able to do this, come home. It won‰Ûªt change how I feel about you.",5
24767,Howard,18," Thanks, honey, but I can‰Ûªt quit. If I do, I‰Ûªll just be a guy who had a chance to be an astronaut and gave it up.",5
24768,Bernadette,18," Well, is there anything I could do to help?",5
24769,Howard,18, No. Wait. Send more underwear.,5
24770,Scene,18, Leonard‰Ûªs bedroom. Leonard wakes to the sound of bongos.,5
24771,Leonard (going to living room),18, Don‰Ûªt let this be Sheldon playing bongos. Please don‰Ûªt let this be Sheldon playing bongos.,5
24772,Sheldon,18," Hello, Leonard, do you like my bongos? Bet you didn‰Ûªt know that I had bongos.",5
24773,Leonard,18," Sheldon, it‰Ûªs three o‰Ûªclock in the morning.",5
24774,Sheldon,18, Three in the morning is a good time for bongos.,5
24775,Leonard,18, I was sleeping.,5
24776,Sheldon,18, Leonard sleeps while I play bongos.,5
24777,Leonard,18," No, he doesn‰Ûªt.",5
24778,Sheldon,18, Leonard no sleep while I play bongos. Bongo solo.,5
24779,Leonard,18, Stop! Stop it! Stop! Stop! Stop it!,5
24780,Penny (entering),18, What the hell?!,5
24781,Leonard,18," Oh, hi, Penny, guess what? Sheldon got bongos.",5
24782,Penny,18, Why did you get bongos?,5
24783,Sheldon,18, Richard Feynman played the bongos. I thought I‰Ûªd give that a try.,5
24784,Leonard,18, Richard Feynman was a famous physicist.,5
24785,Penny,18," Oh, Leonard, it‰Ûªs three o‰Ûªclock in the morning. I don‰Ûªt care if Richard Feynman was a purple leprechaun who lived in my butt.",5
24786,Sheldon,18, Penny meant if he were a purple leprechaun. Penny forgot to use the subjunctive.,5
24787,Leonard,18," Sheldon, go to bed. You have work in the morning.",5
24788,Sheldon,18," Maybe, maybe not. Maybe tomorrow I start a bongo band and tour the world.",5
24789,Leonard,18," W-w-wuh, no, no, hang on,uh, uh, roommate agreement. No hootenannies, sing-a-longs, or barbershop quartets after ten p.m.",5
24790,Sheldon,18, Roommate agreement? Are you kidding? We are living in a world of chaos. Roommate agreement.,5
24791,Penny,18, Where are you going?,5
24792,Sheldon,18," Wherever the music takes me, kitten. I play bongos walking down the stairs. (Sound of falling) Oh! Oh! Never play bongos walking down the stairs.",5
24793,Scene,18, Howard‰Ûªs hotel room. There is a knock on the door.,5
24794,Bernadette,18, Surprise.,5
24795,Howard,18, What are you doing here?,5
24796,Bernadette,18," I‰Ûªm here to help you get through this. You can‰Ûªt do it on your own, you need someone to take care of you.",5
24797,Howard,18," Oh, I love you so much.",5
24798,Bernadette,18," Oh, I love you.",5
24799,Mrs Wolowitz (off),18," Howard, your bath is getting cold!",5
24800,Howard,18," Don‰Ûªt worry, once she falls asleep, I‰Ûªll spoon you like an armadillo.",5
24801,Scene,18, Amy‰Ûªs apartment.,5
24802,Amy,18, He showed up in the middle of the night with his bongos. I foolishly thought it was some sort of musical booty call.,5
24803,Leonard,18, Poor guy. He must have been exhausted. Sheldon like to sleep while Leonard play the bongo!,5
24804,Amy,18, That was kind of uncalled for.,5
24805,Leonard,18," No, it was called for.",5
24806,Sheldon,18, What‰Ûªs going on?,5
24807,Penny,18," All right, Sheldon, this craziness has gone on long enough. Please come home so I can cut your hair.",5
24808,Sheldon,18," Penny, you‰Ûªre not trained. You‰Ûªre not licensed. Most importantly, you don‰Ûªt have access to my haircut records.",5
24809,Penny,18," All right, honey, look, we‰Ûªve known each other for a long time now, right? I‰Ûªve taken you to Disneyland, I kicked a bully in the nuts for you, I sing you Soft Kitty when you‰Ûªre sick, you‰Ûªve even saw me naked once.",5
24810,Leonard,18," I‰Ûªm sorry, duh, what?",5
24811,Penny,18," It was a long story. Anyway, Sheldon, I promise I know what I‰Ûªm doing. Please let me cut your hair.",5
24812,Sheldon,18," Amy, what do you think?",5
24813,Amy,18, There‰Ûªs not a hair on my body I wouldn‰Ûªt let this woman trim.,5
24814,Sheldon,18," Fine, let‰Ûªs go. Thank you for letting me sleep on your couch.",5
24815,Amy,18, There‰Ûªs only so many times a woman can say how about the bed?,5
24816,Leonard,18, What‰Ûªs this about Sheldon seeing you naked?,5
24817,Sheldon,18," Oh, relax. It was just her bottom and her breasts.",5
24818,Scene,18, Penny‰Ûªs apartment. Penny is cutting Sheldon‰Ûªs hair.,5
24819,Penny,18, Almost done.,5
24820,Sheldon,18," At the end of the haircut, Mr. D‰ÛªOnofrio would tell me a dirty joke.",5
24821,Penny,18," Well, sorry, I don‰Ûªt know any dirty jokes.",5
24822,Sheldon,18," That‰Ûªs okay, I never understood them anyway.",5
24823,Penny,18," Okay, what do you think?",5
24824,Sheldon,18," Hmm, well, it‰Ûªs a little Hollywood. But I think I can pull it off. Well done, Penny.",5
24825,Penny,18," Ha, told you. Okay, I‰Ûªm just gonna clean up your neck a little and then you are good to go.",5
24826,Sheldon,18," Fun time. Hah. Sorry, sometimes the clippers tickle me.",5
24827,Penny,18," Okay. (Sheldon laughs and jerks, Penny accidentally shaves a strip up the back of his head) Okay, yep, we‰Ûªre all done now. It‰Ûªs just, it‰Ûªs good. Let me just take that away from you. Okay.",5
24828,Sgeldon,18, Thank you very much.,5
24829,Penny,18," You are welcome. Yeah, I‰Ûªm gonna have to move.",5
24830,Scene,19, The stairwell,5
24831,Raj,19," Hey, want to spend some time playing the new Star Wars game this weekend?",5
24832,Leonard,19," Oh, I don‰Ûªt know. I kind of promised myself I‰Ûªd get off the computer, be more physically active. Get some exercise.",5
24833,Howard,19, You‰Ûªre about to walk up three flights of stairs.,5
24834,Leonard,19," Good point, I‰Ûªm in.",5
24835,Raj,19, You know what would be great? Let‰Ûªs do it like the old days.,5
24836,Leonard,19," You mean, are you talking gaming marathon?",5
24837,Raj,19," Yeah. Start Saturday morning, go 48 hours, sleeping bags, junk food.",5
24838,Howard,19, Turn off our phones so our moms can‰Ûªt call.,5
24839,Leonard,19, It would be like our World Of Warcraft a few years ago when the neighbours called the cops on us.,5
24840,Howard,19, They called the cops because of the smell. They thought we were dead.,5
24841,Raj,19, We were badass back in the day.,5
24842,Leonard,19," All right, let‰Ûªs do it.",5
24843,Howard,19, 48 hours of Star Wars gaming.,5
24844,Raj,19, It‰Ûªs on like Alderaan.,5
24845,Leonard,19," Hey, Sheldon, clear your weekend. Starting Saturday morning, Star Wars< marathon",5
24846,Raj,19, Woo-hoo!,5
24847,Sheldon,19, Movies or video games? Or board game? Or trading card games? Or Lego‰Ûªs? Or dress up? Or comic books? Or dramatic readings of novelizations? Yes to all!,5
24848,Leonard,19, We are going to play the online game.,5
24849,Sheldon,19, The online game? Bully!,5
24850,Amy,19," Gentlemen, as much as I‰Ûªm sure Sheldon would enjoy playing intergalactic make-believe, he and I have other plans. We are attending my Aunt Flora‰Ûªs 93rd birthday party.",5
24851,Sheldon,19, Just tell her I can‰Ûªt come.,5
24852,Amy,19, She‰Ûªll be disappointed if we don‰Ûªt show up.,5
24853,Sheldon,19, She‰Ûªs 93. She won‰Ûªt be disappointed for very long.,5
24854,Amy,19," No, hang on. I followed all the protocols set forth by you in the relationship agreement. I made a written record request 72 hours in advance. I checked the tyre pressure on the car. I even contacted the Centres For Disease Control to find out what shots they recommend for travel to Orange County. FYI, it‰Ûªs none.",5
24855,Sheldon,19," Amy, the relationship agreement was not designed for either one of us to get our way.",5
24856,Amy,19, You use it to get your way.,5
24857,Sheldon,19, I use it to get the right way. The fact that the right way is also my way is a happy coincidence.,5
24858,Amy,19, You gave me your word. You‰Ûªre coming with me.,5
24859,Leonard,19," We‰Ûªll miss you, Sheldon.",5
24860,Sheldon,19," Yeah, well, who wants to spend the whole weekend, running around a bunch of pretend planets battling made up monsters. That‰Ûªs for babies.",5
24861,Howard,19," Yeah, but it‰Ûªs got lightsabres.",5
24862,Sheldon,19," Yeah, please, Amy! It‰Ûªs got lightsabres!",5
24863,Scene,19, The comic book store.,5
24864,Sheldon,19, Hello Stuart.,5
24865,Stuart,19, Hey Sheldon. Help you with anything?,5
24866,Sheldon,19," Yes. I‰Ûªm attending a party this weekend, for a 93-year-old woman. Can you recommend a gift?",5
24867,Stuart,19," Uh, I don‰Ûªt know. Could put a tennis ball on the end of Excalibur. Make a pretty badass cane.",5
24868,Sheldon,19, Do you supply the the tennis ball?,5
24869,Stuart,19, No.,5
24870,Sheldon,19, Then no. What else?,5
24871,Stuart,19," Hmm. Oh, have this collectors edition Batman utility belt. Maybe she can use it as a wearable pill caddy.",5
24872,Sheldon,19," Well, she‰Ûªd just look silly wearing that without the rest of the costume.",5
24873,Stuart,19," I‰Ûªm sorry Sheldon, that‰Ûªs it. That‰Ûªs all I got.",5
24874,Sheldon,19," Oh, it‰Ûªs not your fault. I‰Ûªve been to the model train store. I‰Ûªve been to Radio Shack. This woman is impossible to shop for.",5
24875,Leonard,19, I‰Ûªd make fun of Sheldon for having girl problems if I wasn‰Ûªt in shock that Sheldon has girl problems.,5
24876,Sheldon,19," No, Leonard, go ahead and mock. Like my daddy always said, Shelly, women aren‰Ûªt anything but flippin‰Ûª pains in the bottom.",5
24877,Leonard,19, That‰Ûªs what your father used to say?,5
24878,Sheldon,19," Well, I took out the bad words and the yeehaw, but you get the gist.",5
24879,Howard,19," Look, if you don‰Ûªt want to go to the party, just don‰Ûªt go. You‰Ûªre a grown man. Act like one. Tell Amy you want to spend the weekend having a sleepover and playing video games with your friends. Maybe she‰Ûªll dig it. Women like a firm hand on the tiller.",5
24880,Raj,19, I can never find the tiller. I got a book; it didn‰Ûªt help.,5
24881,Sheldon,19," Yeah, I always thought if I were ever enslaved, it would be by an advanced species from another planet, not some hotsy-totsy from Glendale.",5
24882,Howard,19," Now, I downloaded an app that might be helpful in this situation. (Phone makes whip sound)",5
24883,Sheldon,19, You‰Ûªre right. I‰Ûªm smart as a whip. I should be able to figure this out.,5
24884,Scene,19, Penny‰Ûªs apartment.,5
24885,Leonard,19," Hey, listen, I kind of made plans with the guys this weekend, but then I wondered, because we‰Ûªre in this relationship-beta-test, if I should have asked you first. Then I thought if I did check with you first, you‰Ûªd think that I was taking things to seriously. And then, then I got a nosebleed.",5
24886,Penny,19, You don‰Ûªt have to check with me. Do whatever you want.,5
24887,Leonard,19," Oh. I guess I was hoping for a different reaction, but okay.",5
24888,Penny,19," Really, what were you hoping for?",5
24889,Leonard,19," I don‰Ûªt know, maybe that you‰Ûªd be a little upset, and then you‰Ûªd realize that I‰Ûªm a stallion that has to run free. And that would turn you on a little.",5
24890,Penny,19," Okay, I‰Ûªm an actress. Ask me again.",5
24891,Leonard,19, Do you mind if I spend the weekend playing video games with the guys?,5
24892,Penny,19," Whu‰Û_ the entire weekend? You mean I wouldn‰Ûªt see you at all? But I ju‰Û_ No, no, I knew what I was getting into. You can‰Ûªt put a saddle on Leonard Hofstadter. Oh, my, is it getting hot in here? Ay, papi.",5
24893,Leonard,19, Ay papi? What is that?,5
24894,Penny,19, An acting choice.,5
24895,Leonard,19," Oh. So you chose that when you become turned on, you turn into Speedy Gonzalez?",5
24896,Penny,19," Choo got a problem with that, papi?",5
24897,Leonard,19, Uh-uh.,5
24898,Sheldon,19," (Knock, knock, knock) Penny! (Knock, knock, knock) Penny! (Knock, knock, knock) Penny!",5
24899,Penny,19," Sorry, Stallion. Your weird friend Giraffe is here.",5
24900,Sheldon,19," Hello, Penny. I just stopped by to bring you this gift.",5
24901,Penny,19, Gummy bears? Thank you.,5
24902,Sheldon,19," Now that you‰Ûªre in my debt, please manipulate Amy into releasing me from my commitment to attend her aunt‰Ûªs tedious birthday party.",5
24903,Penny,19, Not a chance.,5
24904,Sheldon,19," All right. I thought the candy might not be enough so let me up the ante. These are Cooper Coupons. These are for various things I can do for you. Um, oh, this one is for one free grammar check. Uh, you could use it for emails, letters, tattoos, what have you. Um, oh, this is fun one. This is an afternoon with me at the California Science Center, where I point out their mistakes.",5
24905,Leonard,19," Keep an eye on those expiration dates, I‰Ûªve been burned more than once.",5
24906,Penny,19," All right, sweetie, I‰Ûªm not going to get involved in your relationship.",5
24907,Sheldon,19," Oh, come on. It‰Ûªs just a simple favour. Now, when‰Ûªs the last time I asked you to do something for me?",5
24908,Penny,19, Yesterday. You made me look in your ear to see if there was a ladybug in it.,5
24909,Sheldon,19, When is the last time I asked you to do something that wasn‰Ûªt a medical emergency?,5
24910,Penny,19, Yesterday. You made me look in your ear to see if there was a ladybug in it.,5
24911,Sheldon,19," All right, then, I have no choice but to go on to plan B.",5
24912,Penny,19, What‰Ûªs that?,5
24913,Sheldon,19, I‰Ûªm going to run around outside with a wet head and try to catch a cold.,5
24914,Scene,19, Amy‰Ûªs car.,5
24915,Amy,19, Good morning.,5
24916,Sheldon,19, Hello.,5
24917,Amy,19," I think you‰Ûªre really going to enjoy yourself today. Not only do you get to meet my relatives, but since my aunt‰Ûªs nursing home is catering the party, all of the food is incredibly soft. It‰Ûªs like a vacation for your teeth.",5
24918,Sheldon,19, All right.,5
24919,Amy,19, You sure you‰Ûªre okay with this?,5
24920,Sheldon,19, Yes. I decided to find a way that I could have this experience and enjoy it.,5
24921,Amy,19, Thank you. That means a lot to me.,5
24922,Sheldon,19," Oh, don‰Ûªt thank me. Thank wireless technology. I realized, I can go to your aunt‰Ûªs awful party and still spend the whole day gaming with my friends.",5
24923,Amy,19," Sheldon, my relatives are going to want to talk to you, and you‰Ûªre going to be sitting there playing a game? Isn‰Ûªt that a little rude?",5
24924,Sheldon,19," Oh, I got that covered. Headset. I won‰Ûªt hear a word the old geezers are saying.",5
24925,Amy,19," You know, if playing that game is more important to you than honouring your commitment to me, and you don‰Ûªt mind me showing up at a party all by myself after I‰Ûªve already told everybody I‰Ûªll be bringing somebody, then, fine. Go home and play your game.",5
24926,Sheldon,19," Thanks. Ooh, listen, I wouldn‰Ûªt mind a piece of birthday cake, provided the old gal‰Ûªs candle blow is clean and dry.",5
24927,Scene,19, The apartment.,5
24928,Raj,19," Here you go. I‰Ûªve got everything we‰Ûªll need for the big game. Low fat turkey jerky, low-carb beer, 100-calorie snack packs.",5
24929,Leonard,19, You pick up a Y chromosome while you were there? You might be short one.,5
24930,Raj,19," Hey, I plan on levelling up in the game, not my swimsuit size, thank you very much.",5
24931,Sheldon,19," Gentlemen, the game offers us a choice between playing for the Republic and the light side, or the Sith Empire and the dark side.",5
24932,Leonard,19," Well, we‰Ûªre always the good guys. In D&D, we‰Ûªre lawful good, in City Of Heroes, we‰Ûªre the heroes, in Grand Theft Auto, we pay the prostitutes promptly and never hit them with a bat.",5
24933,Sheldon,19, Those women are prostitutes? You said they were raising money for stem cell research.,5
24934,Howard,19," Hey, guys, I got a surprise.",5
24935,Leonard,19," Uh, if it‰Ûªs yoghurt that helps ladies poop, I think Raj beat you to it.",5
24936,Howard,19," No. Bernadette‰Ûªs going to be playing with us. So, that‰Ûªs pretty cool, huh? Right? Sure it is, yeah.",5
24937,Raj,19," What, you invited your girlfriend? This is supposed to be our weekend.",5
24938,Howard,19," I had no choice. Last night, she said, why don‰Ûªt we go out for brunch tomorrow and then maybe the Arboretum. And I said, well, no, I promised the guys I was going to play a video game with them all weekend. And she said, that sounds like fun, can I come, too? And then I didn‰Ûªt answer for a second, and then she said, well, do you not want me to come? And then I bought her a new laptop and the game, and she‰Ûªs parking the car right now.",5
24939,Sheldon,19, Is the whip sound app contextually appropriate here?,5
24940,Leonard,19," Uh, it is, but I think you might‰Ûªve waited too long for it to be funny. (Whip sound) I was wrong, it‰Ûªs still funny.",5
24941,Sheldon,19," Oh, good. Hah-hah!",5
24942,Scene,19, Penny‰Ûªs apartment.,5
24943,Penny,19," Amy, what‰Ûªs wrong?",5
24944,Amy,19, My boyfriend‰Ûªs a jerk.,5
24945,Penny,19," Well, I know he didn‰Ûªt cheat on you, so what happened?",5
24946,Amy,19," I had to go to my aunt‰Ûªs party all by myself, and everybody was like, where‰Ûªs this boyfriend you‰Ûªre always talking about? Is he real, or did you make him up like Armin the miniature horse breeder?",5
24947,Penny,19, Who‰Ûªs Armin the miniature horse breeder?,5
24948,Amy,19, The pretend boyfriend I invented to get my family off my back. It unravelled quickly when I couldn‰Ûªt answer the question how‰Ûªd you two meet?,5
24949,Penny,19, I would have thought at a miniature horse show.,5
24950,Amy,19," Oh, that‰Ûªs good.",5
24951,Penny,19, Mm.,5
24952,Amy,19, I panicked and said Woodstock. I just wanted to show Sheldon off to my family.,5
24953,Penny,19," Sure, I get that. I mean, he‰Ûªs your first boyfriend and all.",5
24954,Amy,19," Not just my first boyfriend, he‰Ûªs the best boyfriend. I mean, think about it. I‰Ûªm dating Sheldon Cooper.",5
24955,Penny,19, Yes. On purpose.,5
24956,Amy,19," He‰Ûªs handsome, he‰Ûªs lanky, he‰Ûªs brilliant, and his skin has that pale, waxy quality.",5
24957,Penny,19," Well, sickly is the new sexy.",5
24958,Amy,19, Yeah.,5
24959,Penny,19," Mm. You know, Amy, sometimes when you‰Ûªre in a relationship with someone you really care about, the sucky part is, it leaves you open to getting hurt.",5
24960,Amy,19, Do you ever worry about Leonard doing that to you?,5
24961,Penny,19, That‰Ûªs hilarious. No.,5
24962,Scene,19, The apartment.,5
24963,Bernadette,19, Get that guy! Get that guy! Pew! Pew! Pew! Pew!,5
24964,Sheldon,19," Dr. Rostenkowski, it may interest you to know that saying pew, pew, pew isn‰Ûªt as effective as pressing your blaster key. In the same way that saying whee doesn‰Ûªt make the land speeder go.",5
24965,Bernadette,19, Pew!,5
24966,Leonard,19," Raj, Imperial Troopers on your tail.",5
24967,Raj,19," Got him. When Gandhi advocated his philosophy of non-violence, I bet he didn‰Ûªt know how much fun it was killing stuff.",5
24968,Leonard,19," All right, I think we got them all. Let‰Ûªs divide up the loot.",5
24969,Bernadette,19," Ooh, look at this pretty purple robe I just got. You should put on yours and then we‰Ûªll match.",5
24970,Howard,19, But I worked hard to get this armour.,5
24971,Bernadette,19," Sorry, I just thought it‰Ûªd be nice if people knew we were a couple.",5
24972,Howard,19," Fine, I‰Ûªll change. (Whip sound) ",5
24973,Sheldon,19, Hah-hah!,5
24974,Scene,19, Penny‰Ûªs apartment.,5
24975,Amy,19, I don‰Ûªt think I want to play a game.,5
24976,Penny,19," Oh, come on. They‰Ûªre playing one across the hall, we should, too. Okay, we are gonna take turns bouncing a quarter off the table, and if it goes into this cup, the other person has to drink. Then you get to go again‰Û_",5
24977,Amy,19, Like that?,5
24978,Penny,19," Wow. Yeah, b-beginner‰Ûªs luck. So, now I will drink this entire cup of beer, and you will go again and we can‰Û_ uh‰Û_ all right. So, yeah, okay, now I‰Ûªm gonna drink this entire cup and then I‰Ûªm going to drink another one‰Û_ Okay, seriously, stop. What the hell?",5
24979,Amy,19," Spent a lot of my childhood throwing coins into wishing wells hoping for friends. At a certain point, you start doing trick shots just to keep things interesting.",5
24980,Penny,19," Whoa, whoa, give me a second to catch up here. Hold on. (Sound of cheering)",5
24981,Amy,19, That‰Ûªd be my boyfriend. Happier playing his dopey Star Trek game with his friends than hanging out with me.,5
24982,Penny,19, Wars.,5
24983,Amy,19, What?,5
24984,Penny,19, Star Wars. They get all cranky when you mix the two up.,5
24985,Amy,19, What‰Ûªs the difference?,5
24986,Penny,19, There‰Ûªs absolutely no difference.,5
24987,Amy,19, How do I get him to treat me better?,5
24988,Penny,19," All right. Let me give you a little girlfriend 101. Usually the first move out of the gate is you withhold sex, but that will work better after Sheldon hits puberty. So, I‰Ûªd say give him the silent treatment.",5
24989,Amy,19," No, he loves that.",5
24990,Penny,19, Hmm.,5
24991,Amy,19, Our record for sitting in a room together and not speaking to each other is six-and-a half hours. He said it was a magical evening.,5
24992,Penny,19," All right, then we‰Ûªre gonna have to go with an oldie but goodie, making a scene.",5
24993,Amy,19, I don‰Ûªt think I‰Ûªd be good at that.,5
24994,Penny,19," That‰Ûªs why you‰Ûªre lucky to have me. Back in Omaha, there are two different restaurants I‰Ûªm not allowed into. Both Chili‰Ûªs.",5
24995,Scene,19, The apartment.,5
24996,Raj,19," Bernadette, remember, your character‰Ûªs the healer in our group. You‰Ûªre in charge of healing all of us, not just Howard.",5
24997,Bernadette,19, I can‰Ûªt help it. My Howie Wowie has an owie.,5
24998,Sheldon,19, That is the most sickeningly sweet thing I have ever experienced. And I am sipping Kool-Aid through a Red Vine.,5
24999,Amy (bursting in),19," Sheldon Cooper, I‰Ûªve got a bone to pick with you, and I‰Ûªm about to do it in front of all your friends.",5
25000,Penny,19," Yeah, you pick that bone. You pick that bone clean!",5
25001,Amy,19," I‰Ûªm gonna publicly shame you, and then sit back as societal pressure compels you to modify your behaviour.",5
25002,Penny,19," Ooh, burn!",5
25003,Amy,19," And if you don‰Ûªt start treating me better, I‰Ûªm leaving you for a miniature horse breeder named Armin.",5
25004,Sheldon,19, Armin who?,5
25005,Amy,19, Armin‰Û_ damn it.,5
25006,Penny,19," Sheldon, she wanted to show you off to her family, and you stood her up, okay? Look at this adorable, smushy face. Smush, smush, smush, smush.",5
25007,Amy,19, You‰Ûªre hurting me.,5
25008,Penny,19," No, Sheldon hurt you.",5
25009,Amy,19, Before; now it‰Ûªs you.,5
25010,Penny,19, Oh.,5
25011,Sheldon,19," I think I understand. You‰Ûªre the one person who can say Sheldon Cooper is your boyfriend, but that rings hollow if you can‰Ûªt lord him over others in the flesh. I forget what I bring to the party and what I take away when I leave. Please accept these valuable Cooper Coupons as restitution.",5
25012,Penny,19," Sheldon, she doesn‰Ûªt want your stupid‰Û_",5
25013,Amy,19," Ooh, Science Center. Redeeming. Let‰Ûªs go.",5
25014,Sheldon,19," Well played, Amy Farrah Fowler. Let me get my coat. (Whip sound) Oh, grow up, Leonard.",5
25015,Raj,19," But e-excuse me, I have something to say. None of you may realize it, but I was very much looking forward to this weekend. It was gonna be like the old days, the four of us hanging out playing video games before you guys all got girlfriends. Do you have any idea what it‰Ûªs like to be the only one without a girlfriend? Even if I get one someday, I‰Ûªll still be the guy who got a girl after Sheldon Cooper!",5
25016,Penny,19," And that‰Ûªs how a girl makes a scene. I‰Ûªm sorry, sweetie. You‰Ûªre right. You deserve your weekend. Come on, Amy, let‰Ûªs go.",5
25017,Amy,19, What about the Science Center?,5
25018,Penny,19, I‰Ûªll let you hold my hair while I throw up.,5
25019,Amy,19, Rain check.,5
25020,Bernadette,19," I‰Ûªm gonna go, too.",5
25021,Howard,19, I‰Ûªll miss you.,5
25022,Bernadette,19, I‰Ûªll miss you.,5
25023,Howard,19, I‰Ûªll miss you more.,5
25024,Bernadette,19," No, I‰Ûªll‰Û_",5
25025,Raj,19," Just leave! Okay, now. This is the way it‰Ûªs supposed to be. Men together, fighting the forces of evil.",5
25026,All,19, Hear! Hear!,5
25027,Raj,19, I can‰Ûªt believe this is only 64 calories.,5
25028,Scene,19, Some time later. The guys are asleep.,5
25029,Mrs Wolowitz (off),19," Howard Joel Wolowitz! I‰Ûªve been worried sick for two days, and I know you turned off your phone! You open up this door right now because I‰Ûªve had it up to here! I have been to the morgue and the hospital, and I spent the last half hour walking up these ferkakta stairs!",5
25030,Howard,19," That‰Ûªs my ride, got to go. (Whip sound)",5
25031,Scene,20, The apartment.,5
25032,Penny,20," Oh my God, I love this chicken.",5
25033,Sheldon,20," Oh, you know what they say, the best things in life are free.",5
25034,Penny,20," Okay, you‰Ûªre right, I eat your food a lot. How about this, you can raid my fridge any time you want.",5
25035,Sheldon,20," Oh, that‰Ûªs very kind of you. Next time I have a hankering to wash down a D cell battery with a jar of old pickle juice, I‰Ûªll come a-knocking.",5
25036,Howard,20," Hey, Raj, you didn‰Ûªt send your RSVP in. I‰Ûªm supposed to ask you if you‰Ûªre bringing someone to the wedding.",5
25037,Raj,20, I‰Ûªll let you know.,5
25038,Howard,20," Well, can you make it soon. There‰Ûªs a battle royale going on over the seating charts. In one corner, Bernadette‰Ûªs mom, and the other three, mine.",5
25039,Sheldon,20," Yeah, I hate wedding receptions. I wish the bride and groom would take a cue from Bilbo Baggins, slip on the ring, disappear and everyone goes home.",5
25040,Leonard,20," Mmm, you liked Professor Guyster‰Ûªs wedding.",5
25041,Sheldon,20," They had a make your own sundae bar. Ooh, that was a night to remember. Do you know, on the one trip, I just had a bowl of nuts.",5
25042,Howard,20," Anyway, you gotta let me know if you have a plus one, because if not my mom‰Ûªs trying to sneak in the doctor who sucked the fat out of her neck.",5
25043,Raj,20," Alright, uh, fine, I‰Ûªm coming and I‰Ûªm bringing somebody. Uh, Koothrappali plus one.",5
25044,Leonard,20, Who you bringing?,5
25045,Raj,20, Who are you bringing?,5
25046,Penny,20, He‰Ûªs bringing me. Who are you bringing?,5
25047,Raj,20," Wow, what a bunch of Nosey O‰ÛªDonnells.",5
25048,Howard,20," Come on, who is it?",5
25049,Raj,20, I‰Ûªm not telling. I‰Ûªm from Asia. I‰Ûªm mysterious. Deal with it.,5
25050,Sheldon,20," Howard, are you having a make your own sundae bar?",5
25051,Howard,20," No, uh, I don‰Ûªt think so.",5
25052,Sheldon,20," Well you should. 50% of marriages end in divorce, but 100% of make your own sundae bars end in happiness.",5
25053,Scene,20, Raj‰Ûªs apartment.,5
25054,Raj (on skype),20," Hello Mummy, Daddy, how are you?",5
25055,Mrs Koothrappali,20," Pretty good, can‰Ûªt complain.",5
25056,Dr Koothrappali,20, Oh I‰Ûªm sure you can. Just give it a minute.,5
25057,Raj,20," Listen, uh, there‰Ûªs something I want to talk to you about. I, I wasn‰Ûªt ready until now, but I think it‰Ûªs time.",5
25058,Dr Koothrappali,20," It‰Ûªs finally happening. You‰Ûªre coming out of the closet, aren‰Ûªt you?",5
25059,Mrs Koothrappali,20," We love you, and we accept your alternate lifestyle. Just keep it to yourself.",5
25060,Raj,20," No, I‰Ûªm not gay. If anything, I‰Ûªm metrosexual.",5
25061,Dr Koothrappali,20, What‰Ûªs that?,5
25062,Raj,20, It means I like women as well as their skincare products.,5
25063,Dr Koothrappali,20," Well, if you‰Ûªre not coming out, why did you call us during the cricket semi-finals?",5
25064,Raj,20," ‰Û÷Cause I, I‰Ûªm tired of trying to meet someone and, I think I‰Ûªd like you to help me find uh, a wife.",5
25065,Mrs Koothrappali,20," And just to clarify, a female wife?",5
25066,Raj,20, Yes.,5
25067,Dr Koothrappali,20," Matchmaking, very smart move son. Much better than marrying for love.",5
25068,Mrs Koothrappali,20, We married for love.,5
25069,Dr Koothrappali,20, And it‰Ûªs been wonderful.,5
25070,Scene,20, The apartment.,5
25071,Sheldon,20, Quantum physics makes me so happy.,5
25072,Leonard,20," Yeah, I‰Ûªm glad.",5
25073,Sheldon,20, It‰Ûªs like looking at the universe naked. (Shivers) ,5
25074,Penny,20," Hi, you guys got a minute?",5
25075,Leonard,20," Sure, what‰Ûªs up?",5
25076,Penny,20," Well, I was thinking about Sheldon‰Ûªs little joke the other night about me eating all your food.",5
25077,Sheldon,20," Oh, that was no joke. But I understand your confusion as I am our group‰Ûªs resident cut-up.",5
25078,Leonard,20," I‰Ûªm sorry, you are our resident cut-up?",5
25079,Sheldon,20, Yes.,5
25080,Leonard,20, Prove it.,5
25081,Sheldon,20," Knock, knock.",5
25082,Leonard,20, Who‰Ûªs there?,5
25083,Sheldon,20, Interrupting physicist.,5
25084,Leonard,20, Interrupting physi‰Û_,5
25085,Sheldon,20, MUON!,5
25086,Penny,20," Anyway, I got a little residual cheque from my commercial and I thought, hey, how about I get the guys a little thankyou to pay them back. So, Sheldon, ta-da!",5
25087,Sheldon,20," Ah! A vintage, mint in box, 1975 Mego Star Trek transporter with real transporter action. Hot-darn!",5
25088,Leonard,20, Where did you get that?,5
25089,Penny,20," Uh, from Stuart at the comic-book store.",5
25090,Leonard,20, You went to the comic-book store by yourself?,5
25091,Penny,20," Yeah, it was fun, I walked in and two different guys got asthma attacks. Felt pretty good.",5
25092,Sheldon,20, Well this calls for an expression of gratitude.,5
25093,Penny,20," Ooh, am I about to get a rare Sheldon Cooper hug?",5
25094,Sheldon,20, Not this time. Then they wouldn‰Ûªt be special. Thanks Penny.,5
25095,Penny,20," You‰Ûªre welcome. Don‰Ûªt worry, I didn‰Ûªt forget about you. Leonard, I got you a label maker.",5
25096,Leonard,20," Wow. No, it‰Ûªs great. Also, uh, mint in box.",5
25097,Penny,20," Mmm. And, I got you a transporter too!",5
25098,Leonard,20, Awesome!,5
25099,Sheldon,20," Look, it was actually designed for my vintage Mr Spock action figure.",5
25100,Penny,20," Oh, that‰Ûªs great. Let‰Ûªs open it up and put him in there.",5
25101,Leonard,20, Ah!,5
25102,Sheldon,20, Oh dear Lord. No!,5
25103,Penny,20," Why, they‰Ûªre just toys?",5
25104,Sheldon,20, They‰Ûªre mint in box.,5
25105,Leonard,20, They‰Ûªre Collectables.,5
25106,Penny,20, C‰Ûªmon can‰Ûªt we just open one up and take a‰Û_,5
25107,Together,20, No!,5
25108,Leonard,20, Once you open the box it loses its value.,5
25109,Penny,20," Yeah, yeah, my mom gave me the same lecture about my virginity. Gotta tell you, it was a lot more fun taking it out and playing with it.",5
25110,Scene,20, A restaurant.,5
25111,Bernadette,20, Are you sure you want us here when you meet this woman?,5
25112,Raj,20," Oh yes. In my culture it‰Ûªs expected to have a chaparone to oversee a first date. Plus I want to make a good impression and, no offence, but with you guys here I look like six two.",5
25113,Bernadette,20, The nuns always chaparoned the dances at my high school. They used to make us leave room between us for the holy spirit.,5
25114,Howard,20, Hindus do the same thing. Except they leave room for a cow.,5
25115,Raj,20," Listen, I love your charming racist humour, but any chance you could not knock my religion while she‰Ûªs here.",5
25116,Howard,20, Yesterday you made fun of me for eating lox.,5
25117,Raj,20, It‰Ûªs different. You‰Ûªre people don‰Ûªt worship lox.,5
25118,Howard,20, Well clearly you‰Ûªve never been to brunch with my cousins.,5
25119,Bernadette,20," So, arranged marriages. The parents just decide, and then you have to get married?",5
25120,Raj,20," Oh, no, no, I get a say in it. But I‰Ûªm sure whoever shows up will be better company than a threesome I‰Ûªve been having with Aunt Jemima and Mrs Butterworth.",5
25121,Girl,20," Excuse me, are you Rajesh?",5
25122,Raj,20," Oh, yes. You must be Lakshmi. Uh, nice to meet you.",5
25123,Lakshmi,20, Nice to meet you too.,5
25124,Raj,20," Oh, uh, these are my, my friends. This is Bernadette.",5
25125,Bernadette,20, Hello.,5
25126,Raj,20, And this is Howard.,5
25127,Howard,20, Nice to meet you.,5
25128,Lakshmi,20, You too.,5
25129,Raj,20, Please have a seat. (To Bernadette) I‰Ûªm thinking double wedding!,5
25130,Scene,20, The apartment.,5
25131,Voice of Spock,20, Dr Cooper. Dr Cooper?,5
25132,Sheldon,20, Is someone there?,5
25133,Spock,20," Down here, on your desk.",5
25134,Sheldon,20, Spock?,5
25135,Spock,20, I need to speak with you.,5
25136,Sheldon,20, Fascinating. The only logical explanation is that this is a dream.,5
25137,Spock,20," It is not the only logical explanation. For example, you could be hallucinating after being hit on the head by, say, a coconut.",5
25138,Sheldon,20, Was I hit on the head by a coconut.,5
25139,Spock,20," I‰Ûªm not going to dignify that with a response. Now, to the matter at hand. You need to play with the transporter toy.",5
25140,Sheldon,20, But it‰Ûªs mint in box.,5
25141,Spock,20," Yes, and to open it would destroy it‰Ûªs value. But remember, like me, you also have a human half.",5
25142,Sheldon,20," Well, I‰Ûªm not going to dignify that with a response.",5
25143,Spock,20, Consider this. What is the purpose of a toy?,5
25144,Sheldon,20, To be played with.,5
25145,Spock,20, Therefore? To not play with it would be?,5
25146,Sheldon,20," Illogical. Oh, damn it Spock, you‰Ûªre right. I‰Ûªll do it.",5
25147,Spock,20," Sheldon, wait. You have to wake up first.",5
25148,Sheldon,20," Oh, of course. Set phasers to dumb, right? (Wakes up in bed) Goody, goody, goody. This is wrong. This is wrong. I‰Ûªm so excited, but this is wrong. I‰Ûªm gonna do it. I‰Ûªm doing it. I did it. Oh, that‰Ûªs what I always thought 1975 smelled like. One to beam down Mr Scott. Aye, aye, Mr Spock. Energise. (Spins toy). Energise. (Tries to spin toy. It sticks. Tries to get Spock out and toy falls apart.) Don‰Ûªt be broken. Please don‰Ûªt be broken. (To Spock toy) What did you make me do? Okay, okay, think. (Sees Leonard‰Ûªs toy) It‰Ûªs only logical.",5
25149,Scene,20, Raj‰Ûªs apartment.,5
25150,Lakshmi,20," My goodness, that was delicious.",5
25151,Raj,20," Well, I hope you saved room for chocolate lava cake.",5
25152,Lakshmi,20, Impressive. What goes into making something like that.,5
25153,Raj,20," Well, you start off by trying to make chocolate souffle, and when it falls you panic, quickly change the name, and voila! Lava cake.",5
25154,Lakshmi,20, I bet our parents are dying to know how things are going here.,5
25155,Raj,20," Well, let‰Ûªs see. Yup, three missed calls.",5
25156,Lakshmi,20," Four missed calls, two text messages, and a failed video chat. I win. So, what are we going to tell them.",5
25157,Raj,20, I‰Ûªd like to tell them things are going well.,5
25158,Lakshmi,20, Me too. But before we get their hopes up we should probably make sure we‰Ûªre on the same page.,5
25159,Raj,20," Okay, what page are you on?",5
25160,Lakshmi,20," I‰Ûªm on the one where I‰Ûªm on a lot of pressure from my parents to get married and settle down, and have a family, and I‰Ûªm going to do it so they don‰Ûªt find out I‰Ûªm gay.",5
25161,Raj,20, Say again.,5
25162,Lakshmi,20, I‰Ûªm gay.,5
25163,Raj,20," Like, dude on dude, but with women?",5
25164,Lakshmi,20," I know a fake marriage isn‰Ûªt an honest way to live, but you of all people must know how difficult it is to come out in our culture.",5
25165,Raj,20," Why me, of all people?",5
25166,Lakshmi,20," Well, there is a rumour back in New Delhi that you‰Ûªre, how shall we say, comfortable in a sari.",5
25167,Raj,20, I‰Ûªm not gay.,5
25168,Lakshmi,20," Really? The chocolate lava cake? The little soaps in the bathroom? And I‰Ûªm sorry, but you‰Ûªre wearing more perfume than I am.",5
25169,Raj,20," That‰Ûªs Unbreakable by Khloe and Lamar. And for your information, it‰Ûªs unisex.",5
25170,Lakshmi,20, Fill in the blank. I love the nightlife?,5
25171,Raj,20, I like to boogie.,5
25172,Lakshmi,20, Got you.,5
25173,Raj,20, W-w-with women. I like to boogie with women.,5
25174,Lakshmi,20, That‰Ûªs disappointing. You were exactly the kind of phoney-baloney husband I was looking for.,5
25175,Raj,20," Thankyou. And once again, my baloney likes girls. Wait-wait. You don‰Ûªt want to put a bit of that in your mouth without trying my homemade chantilly cream. Yeah, okay, that time I heard it.",5
25176,Scene,20," Sheldon‰Ûªs bedroom. Sheldon writhes in bed, then wakes up on an alien planet. ",5
25177,Sheldon,20, Oh dear. Two suns and no sunscreen.,5
25178,Spock,20," Hello again, Sheldon.",5
25179,Sheldon,20," What is it now, tiny Spock?",5
25180,Spock,20, I am very disappointed in you. You broke your toy and switched it with Leonard‰Ûªs. You should be ashamed of yourself.,5
25181,Sheldon,20, You‰Ûªre the one who told me to play with it.,5
25182,Spock,20," If I told you to jump off the bridge of the Enterprise, would you do it?",5
25183,Sheldon,20," No. If I got on the bridge of the Enterprise, I would never, ever leave.",5
25184,Spock,20," Trust me, it gets old after a while. You must right your wrong, Sheldon.",5
25185,Sheldon,20," Why? I got away with it. Leonard has his toy, and he‰Ûªs never going to open it, so he won‰Ûªt know it‰Ûªs broken. And I have a toy that isn‰Ûªt broken. Everybody‰Ûªs happy.",5
25186,Spock,20, Well I am unhappy.,5
25187,Sheldon,20, I thought where you come from they don‰Ûªt have emotions.,5
25188,Spock,20, I come from a factory in Taiwan. Now do the right thing.,5
25189,Sheldon,20," You know what you are? Well, you‰Ûªre a green blooded buzzkill. Perhaps it‰Ûªs time you beam on out of here.",5
25190,Spock,20," Fine. I will just use the transporter. Oh, right. You broke it.",5
25191,Sheldon,20," Very well. Cooper to Enterprise, one to beam up. Energise. (Throws Spock away. Get‰Ûªs attacked by a Gorn. Wakes up.) Ah. Tiny Spock. Help.",5
25192,Scene,20, Howard‰Ûªs laboratory. Howard is soldering something.,5
25193,Raj,20, Ready for lunch?,5
25194,Howard,20," Yep, one sec. (Puts thing in mouth.) Ah, good. Ma would have killed me if she‰Ûªd found out I‰Ûªd broke my retainer.",5
25195,Raj,20," Hey, uh, can I run something by you? It‰Ûªs about Lakshmi.",5
25196,Howard,20, Yeah. Sure. How are things going?,5
25197,Raj,20," We hit a couple of bumps. She lives over on Manhattan Beach, so it takes over an hour to get there. And she‰Ûªs a lesbian.",5
25198,Howard,20," What do you mean, she‰Ûªs a lesbian?",5
25199,Raj,20," Well, you know whenever you and I would try to hit on women in bars, and they‰Ûªd blow us off, and then we‰Ûªd tell each other they were probably gay. It‰Ûªs like that. Except this time it‰Ûªs true.",5
25200,Howard,20, Then why did she even go out with you?,5
25201,Raj,20," She was looking for a husband so she can appear to be straight. And you know, it sounded crazy to me at first, but I‰Ûªm actually thinking about doing it.",5
25202,Howard,20," Okay, well, so the reason that might sound crazy, is ‰Ûªcause it‰Ûªs crazy.",5
25203,Raj,20," Look, Howard, you‰Ûªre in a relationship. You know you have to make compromises.",5
25204,Howard,20," Well, yes. But my compromises are about which bedspread to buy, or whose turn it is to do the laundry, Bernadette‰Ûªs or my mom‰Ûªs.",5
25205,Raj,20," It‰Ûªs a great deal. We both get our parents off our backs. I don‰Ûªt have to come home to an empty apartment every night, plus, once I‰Ûªm married, I can finally eat carbs again and let myself go.",5
25206,Howard,20," Why don‰Ûªt you tell your parents you want to try and find someone else, you know, maybe one who hasn‰Ûªt slept with more women than you.",5
25207,Raj,20, Because this one wants to marry me. I might never find another one who does.,5
25208,Howard,20, So you‰Ûªre seriously thinking about marrying someone you‰Ûªre never going to have sex with.,5
25209,Raj,20, I can‰Ûªt believe your attitude. I thought you were in favour of gay people getting married.,5
25210,Howard,20," Yes, to other gay people.",5
25211,Raj,20, Do you hear how homophobic you sound?,5
25212,Scene,20, The apartment. Sheldon is working on his laptop. Spock is looking at him judgementally. He switches the two toys.,5
25213,Sheldon,20," Oh, I don‰Ûªt want a broken toy. (Switches them back again. Penny and Leonard enter.) Nothing!",5
25214,Leonard,20, What?,5
25215,Sheldon,20, Nothing. I said nothing.,5
25216,Penny,20, That was weird.,5
25217,Leonard,20, Really? I don‰Ûªt even notice any more.,5
25218,Penny,20, I cannot believe you guys aren‰Ûªt going to play with these.,5
25219,Leonard,20," Well I told you, you don‰Ûªt, it‰Ûªs mint in box.",5
25220,Penny,20, I dunno. I just think it‰Ûªs a waste. (Picks up box. Sheldon screams.) Relax. I‰Ûªm just looking at the box.,5
25221,Sheldon,20," Perhaps you should look with your eyes, and not your muscular Nebraska man-hands.",5
25222,Penny,20, What is your problem?,5
25223,Sheldon,20," My problem is that I don‰Ûªt want you to break Leonard‰Ûªs toy, which you probably did by shaking it. She shook it. We all saw her.",5
25224,Penny,20," Leonard, I bought you this because I wanted you to have fun with it. I don‰Ûªt want it to just sit in this box.",5
25225,Leonard,20," You know, you‰Ûªre right. I mean, it‰Ûªs from you, I‰Ûªm never going to sell it. I‰Ûªm opening it.",5
25226,Penny,20, Yes.,5
25227,Sheldon,20, Mmmmm!,5
25228,Leonard,20, It‰Ûªs broken.,5
25229,Penny,20, What?,5
25230,Sheldon,20," Oh, nice job, man-hands.",5
25231,Penny,20," I didn‰Ûªt break it. I, I guess Stuart sold it to me like this.",5
25232,Sheldon,20," Yes. Yes, he did, that is a perfectly satisfying and plausible explanation. Yeah, let‰Ûªs all be mad at Stuart.",5
25233,Penny,20," You know, I paid a lot for this. Let‰Ûªs take it over there and show him.",5
25234,Leonard,20, Absolutely.,5
25235,Sheldon,20," Wait. It was me. I opened your toy, discovered it was broken and didn‰Ûªt tell you.",5
25236,Leonard,20, Why would you open mine?,5
25237,Sheldon,20, I didn‰Ûªt. That was a lie. I opened my own toy. And it was already broken so I switched them.,5
25238,Leonard,20," Well, you should talk to Stuart.",5
25239,Sheldon,20, I can‰Ûªt because that was a lie. Yours was broken in an earthquake. And that‰Ûªs a lie.,5
25240,Penny,20, What is the truth?,5
25241,Sheldon,20, My Mr Spock doll came to me in a dream and forced me to open it. And when the toy broke I switched it for yours. Later he encouraged me to do the right thing and I defied him. And then I was attacked by a Gorn.,5
25242,Leonard,20," Okay, that I believe.",5
25243,Penny,20, Mmm.,5
25244,Sheldon,20," Leonard, Penny, I just, I want you both to know that I regret my actions toward the two of you. That‰Ûªs a lie.",5
25245,Leonard,20," So, is that one mine.",5
25246,Sheldon,20, Yes.,5
25247,Leonard,20," Well, hand it over so I can open it.",5
25248,Sheldon,20," Okay. Leonard, even though I don‰Ûªt have one any more, I hope you have fun playing with it.",5
25249,Leonard,20," And that‰Ûªs a lie, right?",5
25250,Sheldon,20, Big fat whopper. I hope it breaks.,5
25251,Scene,20, Raj‰Ûªs apartment.,5
25252,Raj,20," This is a treat, what brings you guys by?",5
25253,Bernadette,20," Raj, Howie told me what‰Ûªs going on with you and Lakshmi.",5
25254,Raj,20," What, you told her?",5
25255,Howard,20, I told everybody.,5
25256,Bernadette,20, We believe there‰Ûªs someone out there who‰Ûªll love you for you.,5
25257,Howard,20," Well, actually we kind of agreed to disagree on that one, but we both think you shouldn‰Ûªt marry this woman.",5
25258,Raj,20," So, while I‰Ûªm waiting for this mysterious perfect match, who may or may not exist, I‰Ûªm supposed to just be alone.",5
25259,Bernadette,20, Not necessarily. I think we‰Ûªve found someone for you to cuddle with. (Pulls a puppy out of her bag.),5
25260,Raj,20," Oh, my goodness. Aren‰Ûªt you the cutest little Yorkie ever? You got him for me?",5
25261,Howard,20, Her. We thought you two would hit it off.,5
25262,Raj,20, I think we already have. Thank you guys so much. Let‰Ûªs see if you fit in my man purse.,5
25263,Bernadette,20, Metrosexual my ass.,5
25264,Scene,21, The cafeteria.,5
25265,Howard,21," So, I got the craziest e-mail this morning.",5
25266,Raj,21," I don‰Ûªt mean to burst your bubble, dude, but those penile enlargement pills do not work.",5
25267,Howard,21," Believe me, I know. The e-mail I got was from the office of Stephen Hawking.",5
25268,Leonard,21, You‰Ûªre kidding.,5
25269,Raj,21, Why?,5
25270,Howard,21," He‰Ûªs coming to the university for a couple weeks to lecture, and he‰Ûªs looking for an engineer to help maintain the equipment on his wheelchair.",5
25271,Leonard,21," That‰Ûªs amazing. You‰Ûªll be like his pit crew. A word of caution, I would not do your Stephen Hawking impression in front of him.",5
25272,Howard (in Stephen Hawking voice),21, You‰Ûªre right. I suppose that could be considered offensive.,5
25273,Raj,21," Oh, boy, Sheldon‰Ûªs going to freak out.",5
25274,Leonard,21," Yeah, he worships Hawking.",5
25275,Howard,21, I was actually thinking about bringing him along when I go over there so he can meet the great man.,5
25276,Raj,21," That‰Ûªs really nice of you, Howard.",5
25277,Howard,21," Hm, it‰Ûªs no big deal.",5
25278,Leonard,21," Boy, a restraining order from Stephen Hawking. It‰Ûªll look so nice next to the ones he‰Ûªs already got from Leonard Nimoy, Carl Sagan and Stan Lee.",5
25279,Sheldon,21," Leonard, do you recall when I said that I was going to revolutionize humanity‰Ûªs understanding of the Higgs boson particle, and you said, Sheldon, it‰Ûªs two a.m., get out of my bedroom?",5
25280,Leonard,21, Like it was ten hours ago. What about it?,5
25281,Sheldon,21," Well, I believe I‰Ûªve done it. And I‰Ûªm only saying believe to sound modest, because, sweet Sam Houston, I did it.",5
25282,Leonard,21, Really?,5
25283,Raj,21," That‰Ûªs incredible. Oh, here, break out the math.",5
25284,Sheldon,21," Oh, okay, let me see this. All right, so this particle here is the boson moving forward in time. Now, I was thinking‰Û_ Howard, you go ahead and eat. This isn‰Ûªt going to make any sense to you.",5
25285,Howard,21," Sheldon, I have a working understanding of physics.",5
25286,Sheldon,21," Yeah, good for you, and don‰Ûªt stop working on it.",5
25287,Raj,21, Are you still going to tell him about you-know-who?,5
25288,Howard,21, Yep.,5
25289,Leonard,21, Still going to introduce him?,5
25290,Howard,21, Not on your life.,5
25291,Scene,21, A corridor.,5
25292,Sheldon,21," Please, please, please let me meet Hawking.",5
25293,Howard,21," I told you, no.",5
25294,Sheldon,21, But I said I‰Ûªm sorry.,5
25295,Howard,21," No, you said, would it help if I said I‰Ûªm sorry?",5
25296,Sheldon,21, And you never answered me. So who owes whom an apology now?,5
25297,Howard,21," Sheldon, you‰Ûªre a condescending jerk. Why on earth would I want to do something nice for you?",5
25298,Sheldon,21," Um, to go to Jewish heaven?",5
25299,Howard,21, Jews don‰Ûªt have heaven.,5
25300,Sheldon,21, Then to avoid Jewish hell?,5
25301,Howard,21, Have you met my mother? I live in Jewish hell.,5
25302,Sheldon,21," Howard, please. This is Stephen Hawking. Perhaps my only intellectual equal.",5
25303,Howard,21," Oh, you can‰Ûªt be serious.",5
25304,Sheldon,21, Try to put yourself in my place. Imagine you‰Ûªre the sole human being living on a planet populated with nothing but dogs. And then it turns out there‰Ûªs another human being.,5
25305,Howard,21, Hang on. Are you saying the rest of us are dogs?,5
25306,Sheldon,21," Yeah, okay, I can see you‰Ûªre going to take this the wrong way. Let me try again. Imagine you‰Ûªre the sole human being living on a planet populated with nothing but chimps.",5
25307,Howard,21, Get out of my lab.,5
25308,Sheldon,21," Oh, now they‰Ûªre so much smarter than dogs. Have you seen them on those little bicycles?",5
25309,Howard,21, Get out.,5
25310,Sheldon,21, How about dolphins?,5
25311,Howard,21, Out!,5
25312,Scene,21, The apartment.,5
25313,Leonard,21," So, come on, how was the first day with Hawking?",5
25314,Howard,21, It was great. We talked about movies.,5
25315,Sheldon,21, Oh!,5
25316,Howard,21, I showed him some card tricks.,5
25317,Sheldon,21, Oh!,5
25318,Howard,21, He even let me read a couple pages from his new book.,5
25319,Sheldon,21, Oh!,5
25320,Howard,21," Something got you down there, bunky?",5
25321,Sheldon,21," Howard, please, I‰Ûªm begging you.",5
25322,Leonard,21," Raj, you‰Ûªre our group historian. Has Sheldon ever begged before?",5
25323,Raj,21," Three times. He begged the Fox network not to cancel Firefly. He begged the TNT network to cancel Babylon 5. And when he got food poisoning at the Rose Bowl Parade, he begged a deity he doesn‰Ûªt believe in to end his life quickly.",5
25324,Sheldon,21," Do you understand how important Hawking is to me? When I was six years old, I dressed up as him for Halloween.",5
25325,Howard,21, You‰Ûªre kidding.,5
25326,Sheldon,21," No, sir, no, I took my dad‰Ûªs desk chair, attached a Speak & Spell to it and made my sister push me up and down the block to trick or treat. Granted most people thought I was R2-D2, but still, I got a lot of candy.",5
25327,Howard,21," You don‰Ûªt seem to be understanding the English word no. Maybe a different language will help. Russian, nyet. Chinese, bu. Japanese, iie. Klingon, qo. Binary coded Ascii, 0110111001101111.",5
25328,Sheldon,21, It‰Ûªs actually 01100111.,5
25329,Howard,21, No!,5
25330,Sheldon,21," I‰Ûªm not asking for me, I‰Ûªm asking for Hawking.",5
25331,Howard,21," Let me try gansta, hells no.",5
25332,Sheldon,21," Okay, look, how about this? Just give him my paper on the Higgs boson. If he sees the incredible breakthrough I‰Ûªve made, he‰Ûªll reach out to me.",5
25333,Leonard,21, What if he doesn‰Ûªt?,5
25334,Sheldon,21," He will, he‰Ûªs really smart.",5
25335,Howard,21, That‰Ûªs an interesting idea. Why don‰Ûªt you give me a minute to talk it over with my friends?,5
25336,Sheldon,21, How do I do that?,5
25337,Howard,21, You walk away.,5
25338,Sheldon,21, Walking away.,5
25339,Leonard,21, You do realize you own his ass right now.,5
25340,Howard,21, I do.,5
25341,Raj,21, You can make him do anything you want.,5
25342,Howard,21," Yeah, I know, I‰Ûªm just trying to figure out how much I want to punish him.",5
25343,Raj,21," Well, don‰Ûªt be too mean.",5
25344,Sheldon,21," Hey, fellas, I‰Ûªm thinking about making some freshly brewed iced tea if anyone would like some.",5
25345,Raj,21, I wouldn‰Ûªt mind a glass.,5
25346,Sheldon,21, I wasn‰Ûªt talking to you.,5
25347,Raj,21, Bring him to his bony knees.,5
25348,Howard,21," Sheldon, come on back.",5
25349,Sheldon,21," Yes, yes. What did you decide?",5
25350,Howard,21, I‰Ûªll give your paper to Professor Hawking.,5
25351,Sheldon,21," Great, thank you. Oh, that‰Ûªs terrific.",5
25352,Howard,21," But in exchange, I‰Ûªd like you to do a few things for me.",5
25353,Sheldon,21, What kinds of things?,5
25354,Howard,21, Are you familiar with the 12 labours of Hercules?,5
25355,Sheldon,21, Of course.,5
25356,Howard,21, You should be so lucky.,5
25357,Scene,21, Howard‰Ûªs bedroom.,5
25358,Sheldon,21, All right. What would you like me to do first?,5
25359,Howard,21," Well, I thought I‰Ûªd start you off by polishing my belt buckles.",5
25360,Sheldon,21," Oh. By all means. When I was a boy, I would polish my Mee-Maw‰Ûªs silver. And she would entertain me with stories about growing up in Oklahoma. Interesting woman. You know, she once killed a prairie dog with a gravy boat.",5
25361,Howard,21, That‰Ûªs nice.,5
25362,Sheldon,21, That‰Ûªs a lot of belt buckles.,5
25363,Howard,21," Funny thing is, I only have one belt. Anyway, I‰Ûªll let you get started. Oh, by the way, the little marks, uh, that look like water spots, I tend to stand too close to the urinal, so what you‰Ûªre seeing there is splash back.",5
25364,Sheldon,21, You make sissy on your belt buckles? Mee-Maw‰Ûªs forks never had that.,5
25365,Howard,21," Here is a black light to check them. And for your own peace of mind, you might not want to shine that around the rest of the room.",5
25366,Howard,21," Sheldon, these look great. They‰Ûªre like magnificent little crowns to hang over my magnificent little jewels. How‰Ûªd you get them so shiny?",5
25367,Sheldon,21," Oh, I-I buffed them with Turtle Wax. The man down at Pep Boys says from now on, the urine should just bead up and roll right off.",5
25368,Howard,21, Way to go the extra mile. Your Mee-Maw would be proud.,5
25369,Sheldon,21, My Mee-Maw must never know of this. Now will you give Professor Hawking my paper?,5
25370,Howard,21," Oh, my dear boy, no. Okay. Next, this is a sexy French maid costume I bought for Bernadette. I thought it might spice things up and get her to dust my room at the same time, but I was wrong and really wrong.",5
25371,Sheldon,21, And you want me to return it for you?,5
25372,Howard,21," No, no, no, mon petit cherie.",5
25373,Scene,21, The cafeteria. Sheldon enters in the French maid costume.,5
25374,Sheldon,21, What are you all staring at? Didn‰Ûªt you ever see a man try to get a meeting with Stephen Hawking before?,5
25375,Scene,21, The laundry room.,5
25376,Penny,21, Hey.,5
25377,Sheldon,21, Hello.,5
25378,Penny,21, It‰Ûªs not Saturday night. Why are you doing your laundry?,5
25379,Sheldon,21, This is not my laundry.,5
25380,Penny,21," Wow, are these Amy‰Ûªs? Kind of trashy, good for her.",5
25381,Sheldon,21, Those are Howard‰Ûªs.,5
25382,Penny,21, Ugh. Why are you washing Howard‰Ûªs man panties?,5
25383,Sheldon,21," Because if I don‰Ûªt, he won‰Ûªt give my paper to Stephen Hawking. He‰Ûªs a famous physicist.",5
25384,Penny,21," Yeah, yeah, I know, he‰Ûªs the wheelchair dude who invented time.",5
25385,Sheldon,21, That‰Ûªs close enough.,5
25386,Penny,21," I don‰Ûªt understand, why doesn‰Ûªt Howard just introduce you to the guy?",5
25387,Sheldon,21," Because he‰Ûªs punishing me for being a, quote, condescending jerk. You don‰Ûªt think I‰Ûªm condescending, do you?",5
25388,Penny,21, Well‰Û_,5
25389,Sheldon,21," Oh, I‰Ûªm sorry, condescending means‰Û_",5
25390,Penny,21," I know what it means. And yes, you love correcting people and putting them down.",5
25391,Sheldon,21," Au contraire. When I correct people I am raising them up. You should know, I do it for you more than anyone.",5
25392,Penny,21," Come on, you do it to feel superior. I see that twinkle in your eye when someone says who instead of whom or thinks the moon is a planet.",5
25393,Sheldon,21, Or Don Quixote is a book about a donkey named Hotay.,5
25394,Penny,21," See, there it is, there‰Ûªs that twinkle.",5
25395,Sheldon,21," Well, I can‰Ûªt help it. That‰Ûªs an involuntary twinkle.",5
25396,Penny,21," What do you want me to tell you, Sheldon?",5
25397,Sheldon,21, I want you to tell me that Howard is being mean to me for no reason.,5
25398,Penny,21," Fine, Howard is being mean to you for no reason.",5
25399,Sheldon,21, I knew it.,5
25400,Scene,21, Howard‰Ûªs bedroom.,5
25401,Howard,21, What‰Ûªs the matter?,5
25402,Bernadette,21," Every time I spend the night, your mom slaps me on the behind and says, go get ‰Û÷im.",5
25403,Howard,21," It‰Ûªs not her fault. She‰Ûªs getting hormone replacement therapy. Makes her crazy horny. Check this out, I got Sheldon to wear the French maid‰Ûªs costume.",5
25404,Bernadette,21," Oh, my God, that‰Ûªs terrible.",5
25405,Howard,21," Hey, I gave you first crack at it.",5
25406,Bernadette,21, Why are you doing that? You‰Ûªre being mean to him.,5
25407,Howard,21, He‰Ûªs mean to me all the time. You‰Ûªve heard him tease me about not having a doctorate.,5
25408,Bernadette,21," If you don‰Ûªt want to get teased about that, get a doctorate. I have one, they‰Ûªre great.",5
25409,Howard,21," Oh, come on, the man torments me. I‰Ûªm just letting him have a little taste of his own medicine.",5
25410,Bernadette,21, It‰Ûªs not the same thing. Sheldon doesn‰Ûªt know when he‰Ûªs being mean because the part of his brain that should know is getting a wedgie from the rest of his brain.,5
25411,Howard,21," Fine, I‰Ûªll just make him do a couple more things, then I‰Ûªll stop.",5
25412,Bernadette,21," No, you have to stop now.",5
25413,Mrs Wolowitz (off),21," Bernadette, I want to remind you, you promised to take me dress shopping tomorrow!",5
25414,Bernadette,21," Oh, damn. I‰Ûªm sorry, I can‰Ûªt make it, but Sheldon‰Ûªs going to go with you! And that‰Ûªs the last thing you do to him.",5
25415,Scene,21, A shop changing rooms.,5
25416,Mrs Wolowitz (off),21, Sheldon! I need your help!,5
25417,Sheldon,21," What is it now, Mrs. Wolowitz?",5
25418,Mrs Wolowitz (off),21," It‰Ûªs this dress. When I put my front in, my back pops out. When I put my back in, my front pops out. It‰Ûªs like trying to keep two dogs in a bathtub!",5
25419,Sheldon,21, What do you want me to do?,5
25420,Mrs Wolowitz (off),21," We‰Ûªre gonna have to work as a team. Get in here, grab a handful, and start stuffing.",5
25421,Sheldon (off),21, I‰Ûªm not sure how to do this.,5
25422,Mrs Wolowitz (off),21," It‰Ûªs easy, just pretend you‰Ûªre putting away a sleeping bag.",5
25423,Sheldon (off),21," Sleeping bags don‰Ûªt usually sweat this much, but okay.",5
25424,Mrs Wolowitz (off),21, Now zip me up.,5
25425,Sheldon (off),21," Oh, if we squeeze you any tighter, you may turn into a diamond.",5
25426,Mrs Wolowitz (off),21," You‰Ûªre right, who am I kidding? You should have seen me when I was young, Sheldon. The fellas used to line up and bring me boxes of candy. Why did I eat it all? Would you hold me?",5
25427,Sheldon,21," Oh, no, you know, I‰Ûªm not really the holding kind of‰Û_ Oh!",5
25428,Scene,21, The apartment.,5
25429,Howard,21," Oh, guys, I just remembered. I got you some Hawking souvenirs.",5
25430,Leonard,21, What are these?,5
25431,Howard,21," Gears and springs from his wheelchair. Pretty cool, huh?",5
25432,Raj,21," Wow, that‰Ûªs amazing.",5
25433,Howard,21," Yeah, I made an adjustment on the motor drive and when I was putting it back together I could not for the life of me figure out where they went.",5
25434,Sheldon,21," I did it. Had to go to three clothing stores, but we finally found a dress that could envelop your mother.",5
25435,Howard,21, I should have sent you to the custom car cover place in Altadena. They have her pattern on file.,5
25436,Sheldon,21, Humorous. Now will you please present my paper to Professor Hawking?,5
25437,Howard,21, I don‰Ûªt know.,5
25438,Sheldon,21," Oh, for heaven‰Ûªs sake. I did your laundry, I pee-pee-proofed your belt buckles, I, I even sprained my wrist helping your mother lift her bosom.",5
25439,Howard,21," All right, Sheldon, there‰Ûªs only one thing left I want you to do. Don‰Ûªt worry, it‰Ûªs an easy one.",5
25440,Sheldon,21, Okay.,5
25441,Howard,21, Give me a compliment.,5
25442,Sheldon,21, Fine. You have very tiny hands.,5
25443,Howard,21," No, about my job. I want you to tell me I‰Ûªm good at what I do.",5
25444,Sheldon,21, You‰Ûªre obviously good at what you do.,5
25445,Howard,21," Well, then why are you always ripping on me?",5
25446,Sheldon,21," Oh, I understand the confusion. I have never said that you are not good at what you do. It‰Ûªs just that what you do is not worth doing.",5
25447,Leonard,21, It‰Ûªs nicer than anything he‰Ûªs ever said to me. I‰Ûªd take it and run.,5
25448,Howard,21," Thank you, Sheldon.",5
25449,Sheldon,21, Now will you give my paper to Hawking?,5
25450,Howard,21," Sorry, I can‰Ûªt.",5
25451,Sheldon,21," What, why not?",5
25452,Howard,21, I gave it to him three days ago. He was really impressed. He wants to meet you.,5
25453,Sheldon,21," All right, then. Thank you, Howard. Please let Professor Hawking know that I‰Ûªm available at his earliest convenience.",5
25454,Raj,21, I thought he might be a little more excited.,5
25455,Leonard,21, Give it a second. (Sound of Sheldon shrieking in joy in his bedroom),5
25456,Scene,21, Stephen Hawking‰Ûªs office.,5
25457,Sheldon,21," Professor Hawking, it‰Ûªs an honour and a privilege to meet you, sir.",5
25458,Hawking,21, I know.,5
25459,Sheldon,21, I want to thank you for taking time to see me.,5
25460,Hawking,21, My pleasure. I enjoyed reading your paper very much. You clearly have a brilliant mind.,5
25461,Sheldon,21, I know.,5
25462,Hawking,21, Your thesis that the Higgs boson is a black hole accelerating backwards through time is fascinating.,5
25463,Sheldon,21," Thank you. It just, it came to me one morning in the shower.",5
25464,Hawking,21, That‰Ûªs nice. Too bad it‰Ûªs wrong.,5
25465,Sheldon,21, What do you mean wrong?,5
25466,Hawking,21, You made an arithmetic mistake on page two. It was quite the boner.,5
25467,Sheldon,21," No, no, th-th-th-that can‰Ûªt be right. I-I don‰Ûªt make arithmetic mistakes.",5
25468,Hawking,21, Are you saying I do?,5
25469,Sheldon,21," Oh, no, no, no, of course not. It‰Ûªs just, I was thinking‰Û_ Oh, gosh, golly, I made a boo-boo, and I gave it to Stephen Hawking.",5
25470,Hawking,21," Great, another fainter.",5
25471,Scene,22, The cafeteria. Sheldon laughs to himself.,5
25472,Sheldon,22," I wish you could all be inside my head. The conversation is sparkling. (Pause) Fine, I‰Ûªll tell you. A lichen is an organism made up of two separate species, fungi and algae. If you could merge with another species, what species would you pick and why? Hint, there is a right answer. None of you will get it.",5
25473,Raj,22," Okay, uh, I‰Ûªd pick swan because, uh, the resulting hybrid would have the advanced industrial civilization of a human and the long graceful neck I‰Ûªve always dreamed of having.",5
25474,Sheldon,22, Wrong. Leonard?,5
25475,Leonard,22," Horse, but mostly just for the height. A little bit for the genital girth.",5
25476,Sheldon,22," Wrong, and let‰Ûªs keep it clean, shall we?",5
25477,Howard,22," Kangaroo, uh, I‰Ûªd be a Kanga-Jew. The first of my people to dunk a basketball.",5
25478,Leonard,22," Also instead of just living in your mother‰Ûªs house, you could actually live inside her body.",5
25479,Sheldon,22," Clever, but also wrong. No, the best organism for human beings to merge with is the lichen itself. That way, you‰Ûªd be human, fungus, and algae. Triple threat. Like three-bean salad.",5
25480,Leonard,22, Give me one circumstance in which that would be useful.,5
25481,Sheldon,22," All right, picture this, a beautiful outdoor concert. Now, as a human, I appreciate Beethoven. As a fungus, I have a terrific view, growing out of a towering maple tree. And no thank you, expensive concessions. Because as an algae, I‰Ûªll just snack on this sunlight.",5
25482,Raj,22, He got us again.,5
25483,Leonard,22," No, he didn‰Ûªt.",5
25484,Raj,22," Anyway, if it‰Ûªs okay with you, we should talk about Howard‰Ûªs bachelor party.",5
25485,Sheldon,22," Well, seems like a bit of a let down after our lichen conversation, but, what do you know, you‰Ûªre half swan.",5
25486,Raj,22," I‰Ûªve been doing some research on strippers. One agency I spoke to, said I could get us a great price if we‰Ûªre flexible on age range and number of limbs.",5
25487,Howard,22," Sounds like loads of fun, but I promised Bernadette no strippers.",5
25488,Raj,22, You don‰Ûªt want strippers? You‰Ûªre the king of strippers. The one club in North Hollywood named a pole after you.,5
25489,Howard,22," What can I tell ya, I‰Ûªm not into that stuff any more.",5
25490,Leonard,22," Good for you, Howard. I‰Ûªm proud of you. And still, you‰Ûªre the first one of us to get married. We have to do something special.",5
25491,Sheldon,22, You know Germans have an interesting pre-wedding custom.,5
25492,Howard,22," Well, it‰Ûªs probably not for me.",5
25493,Raj,22, Maybe we can go up to Napa Valley. They‰Ûªve got that wine train.,5
25494,Sheldon,22," Boo, wine! But yay, trains. I‰Ûªm in.",5
25495,Raj,22," Anyway, it‰Ûªs a beautiful time of year. Uh, you travel through the vineyards. There‰Ûªs a tasting on board. And all the wild flowers are in bloom. It‰Ûªs magic.",5
25496,Leonard,22," Look at that, in 30 seconds, we went from hiring women to being them.",5
25497,Scene,22, The stairwell.,5
25498,Penny,22," So, I hear you and the lost boys are having a bachelor party tonight.",5
25499,Leonard,22," Yeah, just going to a restaurant, get some steaks and scotch. Nothing to worry about.",5
25500,Penny,22, Why should I worry?,5
25501,Leonard,22," Well, I don‰Ûªt know. It‰Ûªs a bachelor party. There could be strippers. Wouldn‰Ûªt that make you a little jealous?",5
25502,Penny,22," Oh, come on Leonard, it‰Ûªs you. What‰Ûªs going to happen? I mean, even if there was a stripper, all you‰Ûªd do is avoid eye-contact and maybe offer to help her kid with his homework.",5
25503,Leonard,22," Hey, I am a young man in his sexual prime. Under the right conditions, I-I-I am capable of just, really crazy stuff.",5
25504,Penny,22, Really? What is the craziest thing you‰Ûªve ever done with a woman? And the time you and I had sex in the ocean does not count.,5
25505,Leonard,22," Oh, come on, that‰Ûªs got to count. There was a really strong undertow, we could have died.",5
25506,Penny,22," Well, have fun tonight.",5
25507,Leonard,22," Oh, I will. There is no telling what might happen.",5
25508,Penny,22," Yeah, there is.",5
25509,Leonard,22," You know, there‰Ûªs nothing wrong helping some woman‰Ûªs kid get through their S.A.T.‰Ûªs.",5
25510,Scene,22, A restaurant.,5
25511,Leonard,22," Hey, I got to hand it to Raj, he found a really nice spot to have a bachelor party.",5
25512,Sheldon,22, It‰Ûªs not bad. Unless you compare it to a train; then it stinks.,5
25513,Leonard,22, Are you drinking whisky?,5
25514,Sheldon,22," Indeed. If I‰Ûªm to participate in the social convention that is the stag night, then I must embrace all its components, including tobacco, swear words, and yes, alcohol. Jeepers! That‰Ûªs yucky.",5
25515,Leonard,22," Whoa, it‰Ûªs a little early to start dropping J-bombs, don‰Ûªt you think?",5
25516,Wil Wheaton,22," Hey, you guys.",5
25517,Leonard,22," Oh, hey, Wil. Nice of you to make it out tonight for Howard.",5
25518,Wil,22," Well, it was either this or another hot tub party at George Takei‰Ûªs house.",5
25519,Sheldon,22," I‰Ûªm confused. I thought since our reconciliation, I was your friend in this group.",5
25520,Wil,22," Oh, I‰Ûªm friends with Howard too.",5
25521,Sheldon,22, Oh. I guess you‰Ûªre just friends with anybody. (Drinks) Aagh!,5
25522,Stuart,22," Hey, uh, Leonard, things are a little tight at the comic book store. I might need some help covering my share of the check.",5
25523,Leonard,22," Oh, yeah, no worries.",5
25524,Stuart,22, And maybe a few bucks for the valet.,5
25525,Leonard,22," Oh, all right.",5
25526,Stuart,22, And gas money to get home.,5
25527,Leonard,22," Yeah, sure.",5
25528,Stuart,22, Great. You know what? This is my grandfather‰Ûªs watch.,5
25529,Leonard,22, Oh.,5
25530,Stuart,22," 18-carat gold, got it in Europe during the war.",5
25531,Leonard,22," Wow, that‰Ûªs very nice.",5
25532,Stuart,22, Mm-hmm. A hundred bucks and it‰Ûªs yours.,5
25533,Raj,22," Hey, everybody! The bachelor boy has arrived! For he‰Ûªs a jolly good fellow‰Û_",5
25534,All (joining in),22," For he‰Ûªs a jolly good fellow, for he‰Ûªs a jolly good fellow, which nobody can deny.",5
25535,Kripke,22," Yes, yes, yes. He‰Ûªs a jowwy good fewwow. What time do the stwippers awwive?",5
25536,Howard,22," Actually, Barry, we‰Ûªre not going to have strippers tonight.",5
25537,Kripke,22," Ah, then what the fwig did I get two hundwed dowwaws in singles out for?",5
25538,Stuart,22, You want to buy a watch?,5
25539,Scene,22, Penny‰Ûªs apartment.,5
25540,Amy (into a mini-cam),22," This is Maid of Honour Amy Farrah Fowler, bringing you the wedding activities just weeks out from the big day. Let‰Ûªs check in with a beautiful, radiant young woman, and her friend who‰Ûªs about to get married. Ladies, can you tell us what you‰Ûªre doing?",5
25541,Bernadette,22," Um, these are gift bags we‰Ûªre going to put in the hotel rooms of our out-of-town guests. This is a map of Pasadena. This is a list of local restaurants. And then, for Howie‰Ûªs relatives, we have antihistamines, antacids, and medicine for diarrhoea and constipation.",5
25542,Penny,22," Yeah, we labeled them stop and go.",5
25543,Amy,22," All right, pivoting to the big question. Bernadette, on your wedding night you‰Ûªll be consummating your marriage. What do you think your first sexual position will be as husband and wife?",5
25544,Bernadette,22," Amy, please.",5
25545,Amy,22, Keeping in mind that whoever‰Ûªs on top may set the tone for the marriage.,5
25546,Penny,22," Okay, show‰Ûªs over.",5
25547,Amy,22," Hey, they may conceive a child on their wedding night. Don‰Ûªt you think the kid might get a kick out of knowing how it happened?",5
25548,Penny,22, I don‰Ûªt care. Ask her things like are you going to take Howard‰Ûªs name? Not who‰Ûªs going to sit on who?,5
25549,Penny,22," Nice. You know, you should totally get BernadetteMaryAnnRostenkowskiWolowitz.com before someone snaps it up.",5
25550,Bernadette,22," Howard already took care of it. Plus, he set up our beautiful wedding website with cute little facts about our family histories. Do you know, for a while in Poland, my family and his family were neighbours.",5
25551,Penny,22," Oh, that‰Ûªs cool.",5
25552,Amy,22," No, it‰Ûªs not. I‰Ûªll explain it to you later.",5
25553,Scene,22, The restaurant.,5
25554,Raj,22," May I have your attention, please? We are hear tonight to celebrate the upcoming nuptials of my best friend Howard Wolowitz.",5
25555,All,22, Hear! Hear!,5
25556,Sheldon,22," And, apparently, Wil Wheaton‰Ûªs best friend.",5
25557,Wil,22, Sheldon‰Û_,5
25558,Sheldon,22, Talk to the hand.,5
25559,Raj,22, Does anyone have any words they‰Ûªd like to say about our man of the evening?,5
25560,Sheldon,22," Yeah, I do. (All groan). As is the tradition, I have prepared a series of disrespectful jokes which generate humour at Howard‰Ûªs expense. Prepare to have your ribs tickled. Howard, I always thought you‰Ûªd be the last one of us to ever get married, because you are so short and unappealing. Am I right? Let‰Ûªs see here. Oh, seriously though, Howard, you‰Ûªre actually one of the most intelligent people I know. And that‰Ûªs a zinger, because you‰Ûªre not. I‰Ûªve always thought that you‰Ûªd make someone a fine husband someday. Assuming you‰Ûªd be able to get the parts, and develop the engineering skills to assemble them, which I don‰Ûªt see as likely. Hacha! Okay, let me see here. Okay, kidding aside, Howard, you are a good friend. And I wish you nothing but happiness. Bazinga, I don‰Ûªt!",5
25561,Leonard,22, Sheldon‰Û_,5
25562,Sheldon,22, Doubleazinga! I do! Good luck following that.,5
25563,Leonard,22," So, Howard Wolowitz tying the knot. Leaving his crazy bachelor days behind. He was a wild one. Well, I guess we all kind of were. I remember this one time, I was with this girl at the beach. We were in the ocean and we started making out. I know, it was crazy. I wasn‰Ûªt even wearing my Aquasocks. Then‰Û_",5
25564,Kripke,22," Nobody cares, Hofstadter. Wwap it up.",5
25565,Leonard,22, Right. To Howard.,5
25566,All,22, To Howard.,5
25567,Leonard,22, I totally had sex in the ocean.,5
25568,Stuart,22," Okay, I‰Ûªll go. Howard, when I think about you and Bernadette starting this wonderful life together, I can‰Ûªt help but get a little choked up. I mean, look at you. You have everything. Look at me. I‰Ûªm 37. I sleep in the back of a comic book store, and I have the bone density of an 80-year-old man. To Howard.",5
25569,Raj,22," Yeah, to Howard. Um, uh, who‰Ûªs next?",5
25570,Kripke,22," I‰Ûªll go. Howard, I‰Ûªm gonna say something to you that evewybody‰Ûªs thinking but no one has the couwage to say out woud. When you invite a man to a bachewor pawty, the impwication is, there will be stwippews. Maybe not compwetewy nude, but at weast pasties and G-stwings. That‰Ûªs not unweasonable.",5
25571,Raj,22," Hear, hear.",5
25572,All,22," Hear, hear.",5
25573,Raj,22," Okay, uh, anybody else? Huh? No? Okay, it all comes down to me, the best man. Ooh! This grasshopper is kicking my ass-hopper. Okay, when I first came to this country, I-I didn‰Ûªt know how to behave or how to dress, or what was cool, I was pretty lonely. But then I met Howard, and suddenly, my life changed, because we could be lonely together. This man became my whole world.",5
25574,Kripke,22," Yeah, nice speech, Fwancine. (Tucks a dollar in Raj‰Ûªs pants.) ",5
25575,Raj,22," I‰Ûªm not done, but thank you. (Raj puts the dollar on the table. Stuart steals it.) I think back to all the good times we had, like, uh, when we went camping and spent that night telling each other all our secrets. I told him I‰Ûªm addicted to pedicures and he told me he lost his virginity to his cousin.",5
25576,Howard,22, She was my second cousin.,5
25577,Sheldon,22, And the first woman you ever disappointed sexually. Ba-da-bazinga!,5
25578,Raj,22," Oh, oh, yeah, and then there was the time when Leonard and I took Howard to Las Vegas and paid a hooker to pretend she was Jewish and that she wanted his little kosher pickle. Of all the Howard humping hookers stories, that one‰Ûªs my favourite!",5
25579,Howard,22," Okay, buddy, that‰Ûªs it. Sit down.",5
25580,Raj,22," Oh, oh, what about that tubby girl in the Sailor Moon costume at Comic-con?",5
25581,Howard,22, Don‰Ûªt remember. Please sit down.,5
25582,Raj,22," The only threesome I‰Ûªve ever had in my life, and I‰Ûªm proud to say it was with this man right here.",5
25583,Howard,22," Oh, please shut up.",5
25584,Raj,22," Oh, oh, don‰Ûªt get me wrong, nothing happened with me and Howard. There was about 200 pounds of Sailor Moon between us.",5
25585,Wil (filming on his phone),22," Oh, Internet, this is so going all over you.",5
25586,Sheldon,22," Jeepers, I‰Ûªm drunk.",5
25587,Scene,22, Bernadette‰Ûªs car.,5
25588,Howard,22," Thank you for picking us up. There‰Ûªs a warning, right there, on the scotch bottle. You cannot be operatin‰Ûª heavy machinery after you had a snootful of this, laddie!",5
25589,Bernadette,22, Funny. You boys have a nice time?,5
25590,Howard,22," Yeah, it was great. And low-key, like I promised. No hanky-panky, no strippers. Just the guys telling jokes.",5
25591,Bernadette,22, That‰Ûªs nice.,5
25592,Howard,22," How about you? Did you have a fun night? Yeah, we, uh, made gift bags, had wine, and then went online and saw this.",5
25593,Raj‰Ûªs Voice,22," Of all the Howard humping hookers stories, that one‰Ûªs my favourite.",5
25594,Raj,22," You know, we‰Ûªre not that far from my apartment. If you stop the car, I can walk from here.",5
25595,Bernadette,22," You ain‰Ûªt goin‰Ûª anywhere, Threeway.",5
25596,Howard,22," Bernadette, listen‰Û_",5
25597,Bernadette,22," You lied to me. You said you told me about all the girls you‰Ûªve been with, but you never mentioned your cousin, the prostitute or Raj!",5
25598,Raj,22," Seriously, you don‰Ûªt even have to stop the car. Anything under ten miles an hour and I can combat-roll into the street.",5
25599,Howard,22," Okay, just to set the record straight, I didn‰Ûªt hire the prostitute, she was a gift from him. Shame on you, Raj. That is not how we treat women in this country.",5
25600,Bernadette,22, Don‰Ûªt you try and blame this on him.,5
25601,Raj,22," Thank you, Bernadette.",5
25602,Bernadette,22," Zip it, pervert!",5
25603,Scene,22, Bernadette‰Ûªs apartment.,5
25604,Bernadette,22, I don‰Ûªt know what I‰Ûªm going to do. I‰Ûªm supposed to marry Howard in a couple of weeks and I‰Ûªm not sure I even know who the man is any more.,5
25605,Amy,22," I‰Ûªm curious what‰Ûªs bothering you most, the borderline incest, the prostitute or group sex with the girl dressed as the children‰Ûªs cartoon?",5
25606,Penny,22," Amy, remember when we went over things that would be helpful and things that wouldn‰Ûªt?",5
25607,Amy,22, Right. And that was‰Û_,5
25608,Penny,22, Not.,5
25609,Bernadette,22," When I first met Howard, he seemed so innocent to me, just a sweet little guy who lives with his mother.",5
25610,Penny,22," Well, if that‰Ûªs what you like, I‰Ûªll take you to the comic book store, the place is full of ‰Ûªem.",5
25611,Bernadette,22, Wait a minute. You set me up with Howard. Did you know about all the creepy stuff he was into?,5
25612,Penny,22," Well, a little. You hear stuff.",5
25613,Bernadette,22, Why didn‰Ûªt you tell me,5
25614,Penny,22," Well, I was gonna, but I didn‰Ûªt think it would go past the first date. Then, when it did, I thought for sure it wouldn‰Ûªt go past you meeting his mother. Definitely not past the two of you sleeping together. I mean, the warning signs were there, this is really on you.",5
25615,Bernadette,22, My God! I thought you were my friend. (Runs to bedroom),5
25616,Amy,22, I don‰Ûªt think that was helpful.,5
25617,Scene,22, The apartment. Howard is on the phone.,5
25618,Howard,22," Hi, Bernie, it‰Ûªs me again. Please call me back.",5
25619,Raj,22," Dude, I am so sorry.",5
25620,Howard,22," It‰Ûªs not your fault, it‰Ûªs mine. I did all that stuff, not you.",5
25621,Leonard,22," Actually, you did do one of them together.",5
25622,Sheldon,22, Here.,5
25623,Howard,22, What is this?,5
25624,Sheldon,22, You‰Ûªre upset. The convention is to bring an upset person a hot beverage.,5
25625,Howard,22," No, but what is it?",5
25626,Sheldon,22," Chicken broth. It seemed culturally appropriate. Also, there was a single cube of chicken bouillon in the cupboard when I moved in and it‰Ûªs been bothering me for the last eight years. So, as they say, two birds.",5
25627,Howard,22, I don‰Ûªt know what my next move is.,5
25628,Leonard,22," Well, Howard, I don‰Ûªt know much about women.",5
25629,Howard,22, Yeah?,5
25630,Leonard,22," No, uh, that, that‰Ûªs it. I don‰Ûªt know much about women. Raj, you got anything?",5
25631,Raj,22, I‰Ûªve got the phone number of the tubby girl from Comic-Con.,5
25632,Howard,22, I‰Ûªm not calling the girl from Comic-con.,5
25633,Raj,22, All right. More Sailor Moon for me.,5
25634,Sheldon,22, I just threw up the bachelor party.,5
25635,Scene,22, Bernadette‰Ûªs apartment.,5
25636,Penny,22," Please come out, Bernadette. Let‰Ûªs talk through this.",5
25637,Bernadette,22," No, leave me alone.",5
25638,Amy,22, Perhaps you should give him a taste of his own medicine. Do you have a cousin who you find attractive?,5
25639,Penny,22, Amy.,5
25640,Amy,22," Hey, you introduced him to the sleazebag. I‰Ûªm just trying to clean up your mess.",5
25641,Howard (at the door),22," Oh, hi.",5
25642,Penny,22, Hey.,5
25643,Howard,22, I need to talk to Bernadette.,5
25644,Penny,22," Well, I don‰Ûªt think she wants to talk to anyone right now.",5
25645,Howard,22," All right, well, could you at least give her a message?",5
25646,Penny,22," Yeah, sure, I guess.",5
25647,Howard,22," Tell her I‰Ûªm really sorry, and if she doesn‰Ûªt want to marry me, I get it. But what I really want her to know is the guy that she‰Ûªs disgusted by, is the guy that I‰Ûªm disgusted by, too. But that guy doesn‰Ûªt exist any more, he‰Ûªs gone, and the reason is because of her. So, if this relationship is over, let her know that she made me a better man, and tell her thank you.",5
25648,Penny,22," Oh, my God, Howard. That‰Ûªs the most beautiful thing I‰Ûªve ever heard. And it came out of you.",5
25649,Bernadette,22, Howie?,5
25650,Howard,22, Penny has a message for you.,5
25651,Bernadette,22," I heard. Your voice, not unlike your mother‰Ûªs, travels through walls.",5
25652,Howard,22, Do you want me to go?,5
25653,Bernadette,22, No. Come here. I‰Ûªm still really mad at you.,5
25654,Howard,22, I get that.,5
25655,Bernadette,22, Is there anything else about your past I should know?,5
25656,Howard,22," Couple things, but, you know, most of them happened overseas. I‰Ûªll tell you later.",5
25657,Bernadette,22, Okay.,5
25658,Howard,22," So, is the wedding still on?",5
25659,Bernadette,22," Yeah, the wedding‰Ûªs still on. (They hug)",5
25660,Amy,22," Oh, thank God. I‰Ûªm still a maid of honour. (Joins in the hug)",5
25661,Penny,22," Oh, what the hell. (Joins in too)",5
25662,Amy,22, This is kind of hot.,5
25663,Scene,22, The laundry room. Leonard enters in his dressing gown.,5
25664,Leonard,22, Hello.,5
25665,Penny,22, What‰Ûªs with the robe?,5
25666,Leonard (taking it off),22," I‰Ûªm gonna have sex with you right here, right now, on that washing machine.",5
25667,Penny,22," No, you‰Ûªre not.",5
25668,Leonard,22," Come on, please.",5
25669,Penny,22," If you want to do something, you can help me fold this sheet.",5
25670,Leonard,22," Folding a sheet in my underwear, still pretty crazy.",5
25671,Scene,23, Howard‰Ûªs laboratory. The phone rings. Howard puts it on speaker.,5
25672,Howard,23, Howard Wolowitz.,5
25673,Voice,23," Hey, Howard. Dave Roeger here at NASA. We need to talk about your upcoming mission.",5
25674,Howard,23," Yes, yes, I‰Ûªve been doing my push-ups. I‰Ûªm still stuck at nine, but that‰Ûªs going all the way down with no one holding me.",5
25675,Roeger,23," That‰Ûªs great, uh, but that‰Ûªs not why I called. We‰Ûªve run into a bit of a snafu. Your Soyuz capsule failed the pressurization test, so bottom line, mission‰Ûªs been scrubbed.",5
25676,Howard (Picks up receiver),23," You‰Ûªre kidding. So what does that mean? Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Boy, I got to tell you, I‰Ûªm really disappointed. This was my dream ever since I was a little kid. Okay, well, uh, thanks for the call. Yep, you, too. (Puts down phone.) Yes! Thank you! Oh! Oh! I‰Ûªm not gonna die in space! I‰Ûªm gonna die the way God intended, in my late 50s, with a heart full of pastrami.",5
25677,Scene,23, A suit shop.,5
25678,Sheldon (off),23, I‰Ûªm going to need a larger shirt. This one‰Ûªs a little tight under the arms.,5
25679,Assistant,23, Okay.,5
25680,Leonard,23, Do you think maybe it‰Ûªs tight because you‰Ûªre wearing long underwear?,5
25681,Sheldon,23," Yes, of course that‰Ûªs why it‰Ûªs tight.",5
25682,Leonard,23," All right, let me rephrase the question. Why are you wearing long underwear?",5
25683,Sheldon,23, You‰Ûªre kidding. Shouldn‰Ûªt the question be why aren‰Ûªt you?,5
25684,Sheldon,23," Leonard, these rental tuxedos have been worn by hundreds of sweaty strangers. I don‰Ûªt like my own sweat touching my skin, how do you think I feel about theirs?",5
25685,Assistant,23, Why don‰Ûªt you slip this on?,5
25686,Sheldon,23, Said the hangman offering a noose.,5
25687,Raj,23," Well, that wasn‰Ûªt as entertaining as when he rents bowling shoes, but it was right up there.",5
25688,Howard,23," Well, that‰Ûªs it. My orders have been rescinded. I am officially no go to space.",5
25689,Leonard,23," I‰Ûªm sorry, Howard, but I got to tell you, I‰Ûªm a little relieved you‰Ûªre not going.",5
25690,Howard,23, Why?,5
25691,Leonard,23," Come on, you were gonna go up in a rocket designed in the 1960s by the Russians.",5
25692,Howard,23," Yeah, so?",5
25693,Leonard,23," When was the last time you were at Best Buy and you heard someone say, ooh, check out this Blu-ray player, it must be good, it was built in Russia‰Û?",5
25694,Howard,23," Well, their technology isn‰Ûªt that bad.",5
25695,Raj,23," When you come back to Earth in a Soyuz capsule, you free-fall from space at 500 miles per hour, and the only thing that slows you down is a little parachute that pops out right before you crash into the ground. And the whole thing was designed by the same brilliant minds who were unable to capture Rocky and Bullwinkle.",5
25696,Howard,23," All right, well, whatever. I wasn‰Ûªt worried.",5
25697,Raj,23, You weren‰Ûªt?,5
25698,Howard,23, Let me explain the difference between you and me. You watch Star Trek. I live it.,5
25699,Raj,23," Oh, please. I don‰Ûªt remember the episode of Star Trek where the guy never goes to space and brags about it in a tuxedo store.",5
25700,Howard,23," Make all the jokes you want, but there‰Ûªs only one of us here brave enough to almost do what I almost did.",5
25701,Sheldon,23," Ah, much better.",5
25702,Leonard,23, You must be burning up.,5
25703,Sheldon,23," A little. But not more than your urethras will be after whatever‰Ûªs in those pants swims up them. Well, I cut quite the dashing, yet hygienic figure, don‰Ûªt I? I look like the Flash about to get married. Oh! A tissue! A tissue! Oh, good Lord!",5
25704,Assistant,23," Uh, where‰Ûªs he going?",5
25705,Leonard,23, He keeps emergency Purell in the car.,5
25706,Sheldon,23, Keys! Keys! Keys!,5
25707,Scene,23, Penny‰Ûªs door.,5
25708,Penny,23," Hey, you.",5
25709,Leonard,23," Before I come in, you should know, I have gas. (Holds up gas canister) ",5
25710,Penny,23," For the record, not your worst opening line.",5
25711,Leonard,23, Check it out. It‰Ûªs the gas I use in my free-electron laser to support high voltages. But it also has an interesting secondary use. Here. Breathe this in.,5
25712,Penny,23," B-Before I do it, if you‰Ûªre a cop you have tell me, right?",5
25713,Leonard,23, Just try it.,5
25714,Penny,23," Okay. (In weirdly low voice) What‰Ûªs it supposed to‰Û_ Oh, my God, this is so freaky!",5
25715,Leonard (in low voice),23, You‰Ûªre a mean one Mr. Grinch.,5
25716,Penny,23," Okay. Me, me, me. Ready? (Low voice) Leonard, I am your father.",5
25717,Leonard,23, I have never been more attracted to a woman who sounds like a man in my life.,5
25718,Penny,23," Oh, Mm. Hey, you know how we‰Ûªve been taking things slow?",5
25719,Leonard,23, Mm-hmm.,5
25720,Penny,23," Well, I‰Ûªve been thinking, and maybe I‰Ûªm ready to take things a little faster.",5
25721,Leonard,23," Oh, great.",5
25722,Penny,23, Mm-hmm.,5
25723,Leonard,23," And I promise, after waiting four months, fast is what you‰Ûªre gonna get.",5
25724,Penny,23," You know, just-just one thing. Look, we‰Ûªre in a really great place right now, and I don‰Ûªt want to do anything that will make stuff all weird again.",5
25725,Leonard,23, So we won‰Ûªt let it get weird.,5
25726,Penny,23," Okay. Oh, and just a heads-up, mm, since the last time you saw me naked, I got a Cookie Monster tattoo. The acceptable responses when you see it are awesome or nothing.",5
25727,Leonard,23," What about (inhales gas, in low voice) Cookies!",5
25728,Scene,23, Amy‰Ûªs apartment.,5
25729,Sheldon,23," (Knock, knock, knock) Amy? (Knock, knock, knock) Amy? (Knock, knock, knock) Amy?",5
25730,Amy,23," Seven o‰Ûªclock, right on time.",5
25731,Sheldon,23, It‰Ûªs not an accident. I waited outside your door for twenty minutes.,5
25732,Amy,23," Well, dinner‰Ûªs almost ready.",5
25733,Sheldon,23," I must say, I was surprised you chose to spend our date night in your apartment. As I mentioned, the Pasadena City Council is debating longer crosswalk times, and later, the LEGO store is having a midnight madness sale. You ask anyone, that‰Ûªs a hot date.",5
25734,Amy,23," Tempting choices, but I have something special planned for tonight.",5
25735,Sheldon,23, What can be more special than having an adequate amount of time to cross the street on your way to buy a tiny LEGO Indiana Jones?,5
25736,Amy,23," With our friends moving forward in their relationships, I‰Ûªve decided that we should make progress in ours as well.",5
25737,Sheldon,23," Oh, dear Lord. Two years ago, we didn‰Ûªt even know each other, and now I‰Ûªm in your apartment after dark. How much faster can this thing go?",5
25738,Amy,23," I had a feeling you‰Ûªd be reluctant, which is why I‰Ûªm going to dip into my neurobiological bag of tricks.",5
25739,Sheldon,23," Oh, you brain monkeys kill me. Dip away.",5
25740,Amy,23, I have devised an experiment that I believe will increase your feelings for me in an accelerated time frame.,5
25741,Sheldon,23," And how do you propose to do that? Uh, hope you‰Ûªre not thinking about some sort of LSD thought control. Because there‰Ûªs only one mind-expanding drug that this man enjoys, and that‰Ûªs called school.",5
25742,Amy,23," Human beings form emotional attachments as they grow up. In your case, to your mother, superheroes, et cetera. I‰Ûªm going to attempt an experiment that will get you to transfer those feelings to me.",5
25743,Sheldon,23," Well, seems what‰Ûªs on the menu tonight is malarkey with a big side of poppycock.",5
25744,Amy,23," We‰Ûªll see. Let‰Ûªs start with a little romantic dinner music, shall we?",5
25745,Sheldon,23, Super Mario Bros. theme?,5
25746,Amy,23, Yes.,5
25747,Sheldon,23," I see what you‰Ûªre doing. You‰Ûªre attempting to build on the work of Ebbinghaus by triggering an involuntary memory of me playing that game, admittedly the happiest 600 hours of my childhood, but it won‰Ûªt work.",5
25748,Amy,23, Fine. There‰Ûªs no reason we still can‰Ûªt have a lovely dinner. Why don‰Ûªt you have a seat.,5
25749,Sheldon,23," Da-da-da da-da dum, boink, boink.",5
25750,Amy,23, May I offer you something to drink?,5
25751,Sheldon,23, You know I don‰Ûªt drink.,5
25752,Amy,23, Not even strawberry Quik?,5
25753,Sheldon,23," I love strawberry Quik. It‰Ûªs my favourite pink fluid, narrowly beating out Pepto-Bismol.",5
25754,Amy,23," Oh, I know. I think it will go nicely with what I have prepared for dinner.",5
25755,Sheldon,23, Spaghetti with little pieces of hot dog cut up in it!,5
25756,Amy,23, Just like your mommy used to make.,5
25757,Sheldon,23," Oh yummy, yummy! We should do this more often. Uh-oh.",5
25758,Scene,23, Penny‰Ûªs apartment.,5
25759,Leonard,23," I‰Ûªm sorry. I did, I crossed a line. I didn‰Ûªt mean to!",5
25760,Penny,23, Who says something like that right in the middle of sex?,5
25761,Leonard,23," I don‰Ûªt know, it just came out. People say weird things during sex all the time.",5
25762,Penny,23," Okay, well, they sure as hell don‰Ûªt say that.",5
25763,Leonard,23, It was the heat of the moment.,5
25764,Penny,23," No, the heat of the moment is, ooh, yeah, just like that, not will you marry me?",5
25765,Leonard,23," I‰Ûªm sorry. Just, just give me another chance.",5
25766,Penny,23," Why, so you can crawl under the covers and go, hey, baby, want to go look for houses in neighbourhoods with good schools?",5
25767,Leonard,23," Again, I‰Ûªm sorry. You know, with Howard and Bernadette getting married, I got caught up in a little wedding fever. I take it back.",5
25768,Penny,23," You can‰Ûªt take something like that back. I mean, what are we even supposed to do now?",5
25769,Leonard,23," Okay, at some point, we‰Ûªll look back and this is going to be a funny story. Why don‰Ûªt we just start doing that now?",5
25770,Penny,23, You‰Ûªre kidding.,5
25771,Leonard,23," No. Hey, do you remember that time when I proposed to you in bed? And you were all, like, what are you doing? That was so funny. So funny.",5
25772,Penny,23, It‰Ûªs not funny.,5
25773,Leonard,23, Give it a minute. Is that a little smile I see there? I should go.,5
25774,Scene,23, Howard‰Ûªs bedroom.,5
25775,Howard,23," Hey, I was thinking. For our first dance at the wedding, what if we learn the final number from Dirty Dancing?",5
25776,Bernadette,23, You‰Ûªre kidding.,5
25777,Howard,23," No, come on. How cool would that be? Me running into your arms, you lifting me up into the air.",5
25778,Bernadette,23," Oh, you‰Ûªre in a good mood.",5
25779,Howard,23," Yeah, well, why wouldn‰Ûªt I be? You know, I‰Ûªm marrying the girl of my dreams, and I finally got my mother to agree not to come on our honeymoon. (Phone rings) Oh, hang on. Oh, it‰Ûªs NASA. Wolowitz. Oh! Hi, Dave. What‰Ûªs up? No kidding. Really? Well, that‰Ûªs great news. Great, great news. All right, I‰Ûªll watch my e-mail for the details. Okay, talk soon.",5
25780,Bernadette,23, What‰Ûªs so great?,5
25781,Howard,23, It looks like I‰Ûªm going into space after all.,5
25782,Bernadette,23," Oh, Howie, that‰Ûªs wonderful!",5
25783,Howard,23," Uh-huh, wonderful. Yay.",5
25784,Bernadette,23, What happened? I thought they cancelled your mission.,5
25785,Howard,23," Th-They did. But NASA really wants my telescope up on the space station, so they‰Ûªre putting me on an earlier launch.",5
25786,Bernadette,23, When?,5
25787,Howard,23, A week from Friday.,5
25788,Bernadette,23, What? We‰Ûªre getting married that Sunday.,5
25789,Howard,23," You‰Ûªre right. I, I can‰Ûªt go to space. I have to get married, and no one can say that‰Ûªs not a good reason. I‰Ûªll call him back.",5
25790,Bernadette,23, Wait. I don‰Ûªt want to be the one who stands in your way.,5
25791,Howard,23," Well, too bad, you already did. It‰Ûªs a done deal. Oh, well. But I forgive you.",5
25792,Bernadette,23," No. That‰Ûªs not how I want to start our marriage, killing your dream. We‰Ûªll have the wedding when you get back.",5
25793,Howard,23, But what about all the plans and the guests?,5
25794,Bernadette,23, We‰Ûªll call them. Although my dad‰Ûªs gonna go a little nutso over losing his deposits.,5
25795,Howard,23," You‰Ûªre right, he is! Your dad‰Ûªs gonna be furious. There‰Ûªs no way he‰Ûªs gonna let us postpone this wedding. Well, we tried.",5
25796,Bernadette,23, I‰Ûªll talk to him. He won‰Ûªt say no to his little girl.,5
25797,Howard,23," No. I, uh, I should talk to him, man to man.",5
25798,Bernadette,23," But, Howie, my dad can be a bully. He‰Ûªs gonna make you cancel your space flight.",5
25799,Howard,23, We can only hope‰Û_ that he doesn‰Ûªt.,5
25800,Scene,23, The apartment. Sheldon and Leonard are playing three dimensional chess.,5
25801,Sheldon,23," Bishop to queen four, level two. Check.",5
25802,Leonard,23," Sheldon, knight takes bishop. You all right?",5
25803,Sheldon,23, I‰Ûªm fine.,5
25804,Leonard,23," Are you? You left your queen exposed from above, you trapped your knight in the corner, and you keep sighing and saying, why me?",5
25805,Sheldon,23, Very well. Can I ask you a question about women?,5
25806,Leonard,23, We got you that book last year. Wasn‰Ûªt everything in there?,5
25807,Sheldon,23," No, I‰Ûªm having a relationship problem with Amy. And by the way, that book gave me nightmares.",5
25808,Leonard,23," Well, if it makes you feel any better, I screwed things up pretty good with Penny.",5
25809,Sheldon,23," Look at us, Leonard, engaging in the social convention of men bellyaching about their ol‰Ûª ladies.",5
25810,Leonard,23," I guess we are. So, what‰Ûªs going on?",5
25811,Sheldon,23," Believe it or not, Amy has embarked on a campaign to increase my feelings for her by making me happy.",5
25812,Leonard,23," I‰Ûªm sorry, that must be very difficult for you.",5
25813,Sheldon,23," It‰Ûªs awful. This morning, she arranged for me to be an Amtrak junior conductor for the day. It, it‰Ûªs usually only open to children. She got them to make an exception.",5
25814,Leonard,23, Shame on her.,5
25815,Sheldon,23," They let me blow the whistle, Leonard.",5
25816,Leonard,23, She‰Ûªs good.,5
25817,Sheldon,23, I know. And it gets worse. Her efforts are causing me to have affectionate feelings for her at inappropriate times.,5
25818,Leonard,23," You mean, like in bed or in the shower?",5
25819,Sheldon,23," No! Would you please stop referencing that infernal book? For example, this morning, I was calculating the random motion of virtual particles in a vacuum, when suddenly the particles morphed into an image of Amy‰Ûªs dandruff gently cascading down onto her pale, slightly hunched shoulders. Oh, what has that vixen done to me, Leonard? And how do I make it stop?",5
25820,Leonard,23," Well, if you had a physical relationship, I‰Ûªd say propose during sex. Turns out that‰Ûªs a real mood killer.",5
25821,Sheldon,23, I assume we‰Ûªre talking about you now?,5
25822,Leonard,23, Yeah.,5
25823,Sheldon,23," So, that‰Ûªs how this works? I complain, and then you complain, and no one offers any solutions?",5
25824,Leonard,23, Pretty much.,5
25825,Sheldon,23," Well, no wonder the women are winning.",5
25826,Scene,23, Bernadette‰Ûªs father‰Ûªs house.,5
25827,Howard,23," Mr. Rostenkowski, are you busy?",5
25828,Mr. Rostenkowski,23, I‰Ûªm just looking at some old pictures. Come on in.,5
25829,Howard,23," Family pictures, or‰Û_ holy crap, that‰Ûªs a dead person.",5
25830,Mr. Rostenkowski,23," Last murder case before I retired. How many bodies do you see there? Careful, it‰Ûªs a trick question.",5
25831,Howard,23, I‰Ûªm not sure.,5
25832,Mr. Rostenkowski,23," Nah, you‰Ûªll never get it. It‰Ûªs a fraction.",5
25833,Howard,23," How about that. Anyway, sir, I need to talk to you about something.",5
25834,Mr. Rostenkowski,23, Walnut?,5
25835,Howard,23," No, thank you. I‰Ûªm allergic.",5
25836,Mr. Rostenkowski,23," Oh, sure. My partner used to have that. He‰Ûªs dead now.",5
25837,Howard,23, From nuts?,5
25838,Mr. Rostenkowski,23," Nah, his wife shot him. But she was nuts, so in a way.",5
25839,Howard,23," Nice story. Anyway, the reason I wanted to talk to you is NASA has moved up my launch to the International Space Station.",5
25840,Mr. Rostenkowski,23," Yeah, so?",5
25841,Howard,23," So, the date is going to conflict with me marrying your daughter. Now, I know what you‰Ûªre going to say, I made a commitment to Bernadette and to your family and I‰Ûªve got a hell of a lot of nerve coming in here and demanding that we postpone this thing. Well, message heard and understood. Mission cancelled. Thank you.",5
25842,Mr. Rostenkowski,23, Where are you going?,5
25843,Howard,23, I‰Ûªm sorry. May I be excused?,5
25844,Mr. Rostenkowski,23," No, you may not. Let me tell you something. When I first met you‰Û_ You just gonna stand there?",5
25845,Howard,23," I‰Ûªm sorry, I didn‰Ûªt know, is this going to‰Û_ Well, I should sit‰Û_ May I be seat‰Û_ Well, I‰Ûªll just sit.",5
25846,Mr. Rostenkowski,23," When I first met you, I didn‰Ûªt like you.",5
25847,Howard,23," I‰Ûªm aware of that, sir.",5
25848,Mr. Rostenkowski,23, But then you and I had some time together.,5
25849,Howard,23, Uh-huh.,5
25850,Mr. Rostenkowski,23, It did not get better.,5
25851,Howard,23," Right, right.",5
25852,Mr. Rostenkowski,23," That silly Beatle haircut and you riding around on a red Vespa, and you still living at home with your mother. To be honest, I thought Bernadette chose you to punish me. But then I heard about your astronaut thing, and I realized I judged you too fast. Maybe you are the right guy for my little girl.",5
25853,Howard,23," Oh, I am. And just so you know, I‰Ûªd still be an astronaut, even if I didn‰Ûªt go to space. I‰Ûªve got an I.D. Card and a NASA golf shirt.",5
25854,Mr. Rostenkowski,23," No, no, you got to go. You can‰Ûªt turn down an opportunity like this.",5
25855,Howard,23, But what about the wedding and all the money you put down for the reception?,5
25856,Mr. Rostenkowski,23," You let me worry about that. You go up to that space station, and you make me proud.",5
25857,Howard,23," Um, okay.",5
25858,Mr. Rostenkowski,23, You got a problem with that?,5
25859,Howard,23," All right, look, I‰Ûªm gonna level with you. I‰Ûªm terrified about going into space. What if I don‰Ûªt make it back?",5
25860,Mr. Rostenkowski,23," It‰Ûªs gonna be okay, son.",5
25861,Howard,23, You really think so?,5
25862,Mr. Rostenkowski,23," Of course. A pretty girl like Bernadette, she‰Ûªll find a new guy.",5
25863,Scene,23, The stairwell.,5
25864,Penny,23, Hey.,5
25865,Leonard,23, Hey. Off to work?,5
25866,Penny,23, Yeah.,5
25867,Leonard,23, Have a nice night.,5
25868,Penny,23," Okay, you, too.",5
25869,Leonard,23," Penny, just, wait. I‰Ûªve been thinking about what I said when we were in bed the other night.",5
25870,Penny,23," Yeah, I‰Ûªve been thinking about it, too.",5
25871,Leonard,23, I noticed you never answered me.,5
25872,Penny,23, You‰Ûªre right. (Kisses him) No.,5
25873,Leonard,23," Uh, follow-up. Are we still dating?",5
25874,Penny,23, Yep.,5
25875,Leonard,23, Is it still weird ‰Ûªcause I proposed?,5
25876,Penny,23, Yep.,5
25877,Leonard,23, I have a couple more quick questions. Do you want to call me from the car?,5
25878,Penny,23, No!,5
25879,Leonard,23," I played that pretty well. (Enters apartment. Amy, dressed as a Vulcan starfleet officer, is examining Sheldon.)",5
25880,Amy,23," Hello, Leonard.",5
25881,Leonard,23, What are you doing?,5
25882,Amy,23, We‰Ûªre playing doctor. Star Trek style.,5

25888,Cosmonaut (in Russian),24, Launch step twelve acknowledged.,5
25889,Howard,24, Hey Mike?,5
25890,Mike Massimino,24, Yeah.,5
25891,Howard,24, I changed my mind. I don‰Ûªt want to do this.,5
25892,Mike,24, Good one.,5
25893,Howard,24," Yeah, I‰Ûªm a funny guy. I also have a hysterical bit planned for later where I pretend to cry through the whole launch.",5
25894,Scene,24, The apartment.,5
25895,Leonard,24," Sheldon, what channel is NASA TV?",5
25896,Sheldon,24," 289, right between the Game Show Network at 288 and the East coast feed of the Disney Channel on 290.",5
25897,Amy,24," I love his eidetic memory, it‰Ûªs so sexy. Sheldon, what are the ingredients in Pringles?",5
25898,Sheldon,24," Dried potatoes, vegetable oil, corn flower, wheat starch, maltodextrin, salt, and my favourite ingredient of all, uniformity.",5
25899,Amy,24," The uterus quivers, does it not?",5
25900,Leonard,24," There‰Ûªs Howard‰Ûªs rocket, live from Kazakhstan.",5
25901,Bernadette,24," Oh, God, I‰Ûªm so nervous. I don‰Ûªt think I can watch.",5
25902,Raj,24, You‰Ûªre nervous? I‰Ûªve been stress-eating for four days. Look at me. I‰Ûªm wearing my fat pants.,5
25903,Sheldon,24," Remarkable. In just under a half hour, 200 metric tons of fuel will ignite in a controlled explosion right beneath Howard‰Ûªs keister. And all from a country whose entire contribution to the global economy, has been Tetris and mail-order brides.",5
25904,Bernadette,24, Give me those damn Pringles.,5
25905,Scene,24, Soyuz capsule.,5
25906,Cosmonaut (in Russian),24, Are all of the systems of the ship ready?,5
25907,Mission Control,24, Da.,5
25908,Mike,24," Okay, we‰Ûªre in the final countdown. How you doing over there?",5
25909,Howard,24," Good! Good! Oh, quick question, I missed it in the briefing. How much urine do these suits hold?",5
25910,Scene,24, Soyuz capsule.,5
25911,Mike,24," Hey, Froot Loops, want to hit your fan switch?",5
25912,Howard,24, Check.,5
25913,Cosmonaut,24, He calls you Froot Loops because of your very gay haircut?,5
25914,Howard,24," No, it‰Ûªs ‰Ûªcause I live with my mom and she makes me Froot Loops.",5
25915,Cosmonaut,24," Go with gay story, people are more accepting of that.",5
25916,Mike,24," Actually, Froot Loops just got married to a girl.",5
25917,Cosmonaut,24, Congratulations.,5
25918,Howard,24," Thanks, we decided to do it before the launch.",5
25919,Cosmonaut,24, You and Mrs. Loops have a big wedding?,5
25920,Howard,24," Not exactly. Listen, if you don‰Ûªt mind, I‰Ûªm not really up for chatting. I‰Ûªm just going to sit here quietly and let my life flash before my eyes. That went really quick. Let me try it again.",5
25921,Scene,24, Howard‰Ûªs bedroom.,5
25922,Howard,24, Close your eyes. Put out your hand. I got you something special.,5
25923,Bernadette,24," Come on, Howard. I‰Ûªm not falling for that again.",5
25924,Howard,24," No, here.",5
25925,Bernadette,24," Oh, Howie. A little star, it‰Ûªs beautiful. Put it on me.",5
25926,Howard,24," Okay, but I‰Ûªm going to have to get it back from you so I can take it to the International Space Station. That way, when I come home, you will have a star that was actually in space.",5
25927,Bernadette,24," Oh, my God.",5
25928,Howard,24," Take that, every guy who‰Ûªs ever bought you anything.",5
25929,Bernadette,24, This is the most amazing gift I‰Ûªve ever gotten.,5
25930,Howard,24," Really? Well, if you like it that much, then close your eyes and put out your hand.",5
25931,Mrs Wolowitz (off),24, ‰Û÷m going to the supermarket to buy snacks for your trip. Do you want me to get those little boxes of Froot Loops you like?,5
25932,Howard,24," No! When I eat Froot Loops, the other astronauts make fun of me!",5
25933,Bernadette,24," Howard, I don‰Ûªt want to wait until you‰Ûªre back to get married.",5
25934,Howard,24, What?,5
25935,Bernadette,24, I want to be married to you before you get in that rocket.,5
25936,Howard,24, But I‰Ûªm leaving in two days.,5
25937,Mrs Wolowitz (off),24, What about Apple Jacks?,5
25938,Howard,24, I don‰Ûªt need to take cereal.,5
25939,Mrs Wolowitz (off),24, What kind of breakfast do you think they‰Ûªre going to give you in Russia?,5
25940,Howard,24, They invented blintzes. I‰Ûªll be fine.,5
25941,Mrs Wolowitz (off),24, They invented the lightbulb in New Jersey. It doesn‰Ûªt mean they hand them out to you when you go.,5
25942,Bernadette,24," We‰Ûªll have a quick little ceremony with just our friends, and we‰Ûªll still have the big reception with everyone when you get back.",5
25943,Howard,24, Wow. Okay. Let‰Ûªs get married.,5
25944,Mrs Wolowitz (off),24," You know what, I‰Ûªll buy you All-Bran in case you get stopped up in outer space.",5
25945,Scene,24, The apartment.,5
25946,Bernadette,24," So anyway, we decided to go down to City Hall this afternoon get married, and then have the reception when Howard gets back.",5
25947,Leonard,24, That‰Ûªs so great. (Others also make encouraging sounds),5
25948,Howard,24," I mean, we know it‰Ûªs short notice, but we‰Ûªd love you all to come with us.",5
25949,Amy,24," No, no, no, this is not the wedding I wanted! I want to wear my maid of honour dress and walk down the aisle with a hundred eyes on me, while a string quartet plays The Way You Look Tonight.",5
25950,Bernadette,24, That wasn‰Ûªt going to be our processional music.,5
25951,Amy,24," Well, it was going to be mine.",5
25952,Sheldon,24," Thank you for the invitation, but I have to decline because it doesn‰Ûªt sound like something I‰Ûªll enjoy.",5
25953,Leonard,24," Come on, Sheldon, it‰Ûªll be fun.",5
25954,Sheldon,24, That‰Ûªs what you said about The Green Lantern movie. You were 114 minutes of wrong.,5
25955,Bernadette,24," So, what do you say, Amy?",5
25956,Amy,24, Can I wear my maid of honour dress?,5
25957,Bernadette,24, Seriously? You‰Ûªre going to wear that thing to City Hall?,5
25958,Amy,24," It‰Ûªs all I have left. You‰Ûªre going to take that from me, too?",5
25959,Scene,24, City Hall.,5
25960,Penny,24," Amy, you look great.",5
25961,Amy,24, I know.,5
25962,Leonard,24, Where‰Ûªd you get a beer?,5
25963,Raj,24," From that happy young couple over there with all the tattoos. Beautiful story, they‰Ûªre in rival drug gangs, and they‰Ûªre getting married. Shh, no one can know.",5
25964,Amy,24," Look at all these people in love. It kind of gets you thinking, doesn‰Ûªt it?",5
25965,Sheldon,24," It does, indeed. Leonard, is it awkward being here with Penny given that you recently proposed to her?",5
25966,Howard,24, You proposed to Penny?,5
25967,Leonard,24, I don‰Ûªt want to talk about it.,5
25968,Raj,24, Where did he pop the question? What did you say?,5
25969,Leonard,24," She said no, can we drop it now?",5
25970,Penny,24, It wasn‰Ûªt a real proposal.,5
25971,Bernadette,24, Why wasn‰Ûªt it a real proposal?,5
25972,Sheldon,24, He asked her during coitus.,5
25973,Howard,24, Did you get down on one knee or were you already there?,5
25974,Bernadette,24," Howard, don‰Ûªt talk like that on your wedding day.",5
25975,Howard,24," I‰Ûªm sorry, Ma‰Û_ Bernadette. Ma‰Û_ Burna‰Û_ You‰Ûªre ma Bernadette.",5
25976,Penny,24, Good move telling Sheldon.,5
25977,Leonard,24," What, I can‰Ûªt propose? I can‰Ûªt talk to my friends? Is there anything else I‰Ûªm not allowed to do?",5
25978,Amy,24," All right, that‰Ûªs enough. Today is not about you two. Today is about Howard and Bernadette and me.",5
25979,Registrar,24," Folks, can I have your attention. It‰Ûªs five o‰Ûªclock, we‰Ûªre going to be able to take three more couples. The rest of you will have to come back on Monday.",5
25980,Bernadette,24," Oh, no.",5
25981,Howard,24," I got this. Excuse me, but is there any way you could squeeze us in? See, I‰Ûªm an astronaut and I‰Ûªm leaving for Russia on Sunday so I can take a Soyuz rocket to the International Space Station.",5
25982,Registrar,24," Yeah, me, too. I‰Ûªll see you there.",5
25983,Bernadette,24, I can‰Ûªt believe we‰Ûªre not going to get married.,5
25984,Amy,24," Excuse me, I‰Ûªm going to go see if the couple at the front of the line needs a maid of honour.",5
25985,Scene,24, Soyuz capsule.,5
25986,Cosmonaut,24," So, I tell my wife, get a dog, don‰Ûªt get a dog, I‰Ûªm not walking it, I‰Ûªm not feeding it, I‰Ûªm not picking up after it.",5
25987,Mike,24, You know you‰Ûªre going to wind up walking it.,5
25988,Cosmonaut,24, I know.,5
25989,Howard,24," Uh, shouldn‰Ûªt you guys be talking about space stuff instead of dogs?",5
25990,Mike,24," Dimitri, Froot Loops would be more comfortable if we talked about space stuff.",5
25991,Dimitri,24," Okay, I‰Ûªm going into space, and when I come back, I have to pick up a poodle crap.",5
25992,Mike,24, Is that better?,5
25993,Howard,24, Thanks.,5
25994,Scene,24, The Cheesecake Factory bar.,5
25995,Howard,24," You know, we could always drive to Vegas and get married.",5
25996,Bernadette,24," No, isn‰Ûªt that kind of tacky?",5
25997,Penny,24," Hey, I know tons of people who got married in Vegas.",5
25998,Bernadette,24, Are any of them still married?,5
25999,Penny,24," Yeah, I mean, not to the same people but‰Û_",5
26000,Bernadette,24, There‰Ûªs got to be some place special we could do it.,5
26001,Sheldon,24," Leonard, where did you envision marrying Penny?",5
26002,Leonard,24, Will you shut up?,5
26003,Raj,24," Well, I know how to make it special.",5
26004,Howard,24, I told you we are not recreating the wedding from The Sound of Music.,5
26005,Raj,24," Yes, you made that brutally clear to me. What I was going to suggest is if that you‰Ûªre willing to wait until Sunday morning, the Google satellite will be over Pasadena. You can have a wedding photograph from space.",5
26006,All,24, Oh!,5
26007,Leonard,24, That‰Ûªs so cool.,5
26008,Howard,24," Oh, wait to go, Raj.",5
26009,Raj,24," I keep telling you, if I wasn‰Ûªt an astrophysicist, I would have been a party planner. It was always a coin flip.",5
26010,Howard,24," Okay, so we know we‰Ûªre going to do it Sunday morning. Now we need to find a good place for the satellite to see us.",5
26011,Leonard,24, How about our roof?,5
26012,Bernadette,24," Oh, I like that.",5
26013,Howard,24, That‰Ûªs great.,5
26014,Amy,24," Oh, my gosh. I can‰Ûªt believe my maid of honour dress is going to be on Google Earth.",5
26015,Howard,24," So, we have the where and the when, but we still need to figure out who‰Ûªs going to do the ceremony.",5
26016,Penny,24," Well, that‰Ûªs easy. Anyone can go online and get ordained as a minister. I know a piercing parlour where, for a hundred bucks they‰Ûªll marry you and stick a wedding ring through any body part you want.",5
26017,Bernadette,24," Great, well, who‰Ûªs it going to be?",5
26018,Sheldon,24," I‰Ûªll do it, provided I can perform the ceremony in Klingon.",5
26019,Bernadette,24, No.,5
26020,Sheldon,24, What do you see in her?,5
26021,Scene,24, Soyuz capsule.,5
26022,Dimitri (in Russian),24," Mission Control, say again, how fast is it leaking?",5
26023,Howard,24, Leaking? What‰Ûªs leaking?,5
26024,Dimitri,24, Fuel. Shh.,5
26025,Mission Control (in Russian),24, Not bad. We feel okay to go.,5
26026,Dimitri (in Russian),24," Okay, thanks Mission Control.",5
26027,Howard,24, There‰Ûªs fuel leaking and we‰Ûªre still going to go?,5
26028,Mike,24," Don‰Ûªt lose your Froot Loops, Froot Loops.",5
26029,Dimitri,24," This happens a lot. Nine times out of ten, no problem.",5
26030,Howard,24, What happens on the tenth time?,5
26031,Dimitri,24, Problem.,5
26032,Scene,24, The apartment.,5
26033,Howard,24," Hey, guys, before I forget, I got you a little groomsman present.",5
26034,Raj,24," Oh, thanks, man.",5
26035,Sheldon,24, You didn‰Ûªt have to do that.,5
26036,Howard,24," Fantastic Four, annual number three from 1965, in mint condition. The one where Mr. Fantastic and the Invisible Girl get married.",5
26037,Leonard,24," Oh, wow.",5
26038,Sheldon,24," Oh, dear. I was afraid of this.",5
26039,Howard,24, What?,5
26040,Sheldon,24," While a thoughtful gift, this comic book in this condition is worth at least a hundred dollars.",5
26041,Howard,24," Yeah, so?",5
26042,Sheldon,24," I bought you and Bernadette a gravy boat worth eighty-eight dollars. Which places me in your debt and I can‰Ûªt be in your debt because someday you might ask me to help you move, or to kill a man.",5
26043,Leonard,24, I doubt he‰Ûªll ask you to kill a man.,5
26044,Sheldon,24," Well, what if it‰Ûªs his only way out? I can‰Ûªt risk it. Here is twelve dollars. Now, we‰Ûªre even. Wait, wait, wait, I bought a card. Give me two dollars. And for the record, this is why I hate gift-giving.",5
26045,Scene,24, Penny‰Ûªs door. Howard knocks.,5
26046,Amy,24, Who is it?,5
26047,Howard,24, It‰Ûªs the groom.,5
26048,Amy,24, Can‰Ûªt come in. Bad luck to see the bride.,5
26049,Howard,24," Okay, uh, fine. Bernie, I have to go pick up my mother. I‰Ûªll be right back.",5
26050,Bernadette (off),24, Why can‰Ûªt she drive herself?,5
26051,Howard,24, She doesn‰Ûªt want to sit in her dress and wrinkle it so I‰Ûªm going to lay her down in the back of my neighbour‰Ûªs van.,5
26052,Bernadette (off),24," All right, just hurry!",5
26053,Howard,24," Okay, I‰Ûªll see you later, Ma‰Û_ uh‰Û_ lovely bride-to-be. I really got to watch that.",5
26054,Scene,24, The roof.,5
26055,Leonard,24," Come on, Raj, we‰Ûªre ready to start.",5
26056,Raj,24," What, we‰Ûªre ready when I say we‰Ûªre ready. Uh-du-du-du, ooh, okay, now we‰Ûªre ready.",5
26057,Howard,24," Ma, you want to move your chair over here so you can see?",5
26058,Mrs Wolowitz (off),24, I‰Ûªm fine where I am. I don‰Ûªt want to fall off the roof.,5
26059,Howard,24, You‰Ûªll fall through the roof before you fall off it.,5
26060,Raj,24, Penny. (She starts music playing) ,5
26061,Mr Rostenkowski,24, Your new mother-in-law‰Ûªs a piece of work.,5
26062,Bernadette,24," Not now, Dad.",5
26063,Mr Rostenkowski,24, She‰Ûªs got a bigger mustache than me. Here you go.,5
26064,Bernadette,24," Here you go? What am I, a football?",5
26065,Mr Rostenkowski,24, Like that guy could catch a football.,5
26066,Raj,24," Howard and Bernadette, the five of us stand before you as your friends and newly ordained ministers.",5
26067,Mrs Wolowitz (off),24, Louder!,5
26068,Bernadette,24," They all got ordained, they‰Ûªre all marrying us, it‰Ûªs adorable, if you want to hear come closer.",5
26069,Raj,24," Guys, when I look at the two of you starting your lives together, it fills my heart, It fills my, heart, okay, I‰Ûªm going to need a minute.",5
26070,Penny,24," Okay, I‰Ûªll, I‰Ûªll go. Howard and Bernadette, I know you two planned on getting married in a big fancy wedding, but when you‰Ûªre in love, it doesn‰Ûªt matter where or how these things happen. It just matters that you have each other.",5
26071,Leonard,24, Hmm.,5
26072,Penny,24, Problem?,5
26073,Leonard,24, No.,5
26074,Sheldon,24, I think the Reverend Hofstadter is making an ironic connection between your statement about love and your rejection of his proposal in the bedroom.,5
26075,Penny,24," Oh, grow up.",5
26076,Leonard,24," Hey, I didn‰Ûªt say it.",5
26077,Amy,24," All right, that‰Ûªs enough from the both of you.",5
26078,Penny,24," Well, he started it.",5
26079,Amy,24," Well, I‰Ûªm ending it. Bernadette, I want to thank you for allowing me to be your maid of honour. I also want you to know, that I will be happy to do it again if this marriage craps out.",5
26080,Leonard,24," Thank you, Amy. Very touching. Howard and Bernadette, you are lucky enough to be best friends who love each other. And that‰Ûªs the strongest kind of love because at its core, it has kindness, patience, and respect. Qualities that are hard to find in people these days.",5
26081,Sheldon,24," Would you like some aloe vera? You just got burned. All right, my turn. Howard, Bernadette. Daq tu‰Ûª taH Daq yIn tlhej ghajtaH.",5
26082,Bernadette,24, Sheldon! I told you no Klingon.,5
26083,Sheldon,24," Fine, I‰Ûªll do it in English, but it loses something. The need to find another human being to share one‰Ûªs life with has always puzzled me. Maybe because I‰Ûªm so interesting all by myself. With that being said, may you find as much happiness with each other as I find on my own. The Klingon would have made you cry.",5
26084,Raj,24, I believe you two have prepared vows?,5
26085,Bernadette,24," Howard Joel Wolowitz, like you, this is going to be short and sweet. I love you with all my heart and soul and promise to be with you forever.",5
26086,Howard,24, Bernadette Maryann Rostenkowski.,5
26087,Mrs Wolowitz (off),24, Speak up!,5
26088,Howard,24," Hey, from now on, she‰Ûªs the only women who can yell at me! Until I met you, I couldn‰Ûªt imagine spending my life with just one person. And now I can‰Ûªt imagine spending one day of it without you.",5
26089,All,24," By the power vested in us, by the state of California‰Û_",5

26098,Penny,24, Did I miss it?,5
26099,Leonard,24," No, come on in. Hurry.",5
26100,Bernadette,24, I love that man.,5
26101,Raj,24," Me, too.",5
26102,Penny,24," I can‰Ûªt believe it. This whole time, a small part of me thought he was lying.",5
26103,Leonard,24, This is it.,5
26104,Sheldon,24," Boldly go, Howard Wolowitz.",5

26110,Leonard,1," Mm-hmm, International Space Station. 250 miles that way.",6
26111,Raj,1," Right now, Howard‰Ûªs staring down at our planet like a tiny Jewish Greek god. Zeusowitz.",6
26112,Sheldon,1," I must admit, I can‰Ûªt help but feel a twinge of envy. He can look out the window and see the majesty of the universe unfolding before his eyes. His dim, uncomprehending eyes. It‰Ûªs like a cat in an airport carrying case.",6
26113,Leonard,1," You know, it‰Ûªs not exactly glamorous up there. The water that the astronauts drink is made from each other‰Ûªs recycled urine.",6
26114,Stuart,1, Must be nice. Nobody wants anything that comes out of me.,6
26115,Raj,1, I wonder what he‰Ûªs doing right this very second.,6
26116,Leonard,1," Mm, conducting experiments in zero gravity.",6

26121,Howard,1," I can hear you without the phone,",6
26122,Mrs Wolowitz (off),1, Don‰Ûªt be snippy. I‰Ûªm just excited to talk to my baby.,6
26123,Howard,1," I‰Ûªm excited to talk to you, too.",6
26124,Mrs Wolowitz (off),1," So, what‰Ûªs this mishegas about you moving out to go live with the little Polish girl?",6
26125,Howard,1, How about calling her my wife?,6
26126,Mrs Wolowitz (off),1, Wives don‰Ûªt take boys from their mothers.,6
26127,Howard,1, They do. That‰Ûªs why we marry them.,6
26128,Mrs Wolowitz (off),1, I just hope I‰Ûªm not dead from a broken heart before you get back.,6
26129,Howard,1," Ma, please. Everyone from NASA is listening to this phone call.",6
26130,Mrs Wolowitz (off),1, Good. They should know what a horrible son you are.,6
26131,Howard,1," Okay, Ma, great talking to you. Gotta go. Well, space is ruined.",6

26134,Penny,1," Hey, this is my natural hair colour. Now. So, does Sheldon have anything special planned for you tomorrow night?",6
26135,Amy,1," Oh, yes. According to the Relationship Agreement, on the anniversary of our first date, he must take me to a nice dinner, ask about my day and engage in casual physical contact that a disinterested onlooker might mistake for intimacy.",6
26136,Penny,1, That‰Ûªs hot. You kids better use protection.,6
26137,Amy,1, How long does this stay on?,6
26138,Penny,1, Just a couple of minutes. You‰Ûªve really never done this before?,6
26139,Amy,1," Once in high school, but I dozed off and woke up with second-degree chemical burns on my face.",6
26140,Penny,1," Oh, my gosh, that‰Ûªs awful. The other kids make fun of you?",6
26141,Amy,1," No, I had a cover story, I told everyone it was herpes. So, how‰Ûªs everything going with you and Leonard?",6
26142,Penny,1," Uh, I don‰Ûªt know, it‰Ûªs still kind of weird. We haven‰Ûªt really recovered since he proposed to me in the middle of sex.",6
26143,Amy,1," Oh, boo-hoo. If Sheldon proposed to me during sex, my ovaries would grab on to him and never let go.",6
26144,Scene,1, The university cafeteria.,6
26145,Sheldon,1," Leonard, where do you stand on the anthropic principle?",6
26146,Leonard,1," Interesting question. On the one hand, I always thought‰Û_",6
26147,Sheldon,1," You don‰Ûªt even know what it is, do you? The anthropic principle states that if we wish to explain why our universe exists the way it does, the answer is that it must have qualities that allow intelligent creatures to arise who are capable of asking the question. As I am doing so eloquently right now.",6
26148,Leonard,1, I know what the anthropic principle is.,6
26149,Sheldon,1," Of course. I just explained it to you. Now, where do you stand on it?",6
26150,Leonard,1, Where do you stand on it? ,6
26151,Sheldon,1, Strongly pro.,6
26152,Leonard,1," Then I believe that God created the world in six days, and on the seventh he made you to annoy me.",6
26153,Raj,1," Hey, guys.",6
26154,Leonard,1, Hey.,6
26155,Sheldon,1," Yeah, wait, Raj, where do you stand on the anthropic principle?",6
26156,Raj,1, I‰Ûªm all for it.,6
26157,Sheldon,1, Attaboy!,6
26158,Leonard,1," Well, hang on. Why do you believe that he knows what it is and I don‰Ûªt?",6
26159,Sheldon,1," Oh, Leonard. Let‰Ûªs not take a saw to the branch we‰Ûªre sitting on, shall we?",6
26160,Raj,1," Hey, uh, if you guys are free tonight, I heard about a spa where you soak your feet n a pool full of little fish that eat all the dead skin right off them. I don‰Ûªt need to tell you in Los Angeles, sandal season is year round.",6
26161,Leonard,1," Actually, I‰Ûªm hanging out with Penny. ",6
26162,Raj,1," Oh, okay. Sounds like it‰Ûªs me and you, Sheldon. How about we sic some guppies on those puppies?",6
26163,Sheldon,1," As I‰Ûªve stated before on numerous occasions, the only sea creature I would even consider being eaten by is the Kraken, because the last words I would hear are ‰ÛÏRelease the Kraken.‰Û That never gets old. ‰ÛÏRelease the Kraken!‰Û Oh, chills. Besides, I‰Ûªm having dinner with Amy.",6
26164,Raj,1," Oh, okay. I‰Ûªll just go home and be alone. Which is cool. I eat alone, I sleep alone, I cry alone, so, cool.",6
26165,Sheldon,1," Darn. If you weren‰Ûªt busy, I‰Ûªd ask you to join us.",6
26166,Raj,1, Really? I can come? Thanks.,6
26167,Leonard,1," Sheldon, are you sure you want to be bringing Raj on your date night with Amy?",6
26168,Sheldon,1," Oh, absolutely. I have a contractual obligation to provide Amy with conversation and casual physical contact, but nowhere is it specified that I can‰Ûªt outsource that to an Indian.",6
26169,Scene,1, The International Space Station,6
26170,Bernadette (on webcam),1, Howie? Howie?,6
26171,Howard,1," Hey, there‰Ûªs my beautiful bride. Can you see me?",6
26172,Bernadette,1, I can. How are you?,6
26173,Howard,1," I‰Ûªm amazing. I mean, this is even better than I dreamed. I look out the window, and it‰Ûªs all so unbelievable.",6
26174,Bernadette,1, Good for you. I just had a seemingly endless dinner with your mom.,6
26175,Howard,1," Oh, yeah? That‰Ûªs nice.",6
26176,Bernadette,1, It was. Until I found out you never told her we‰Ûªre not gonna live with her. Let‰Ûªs talk about that for a minute.,6
26177,Howard,1," Hey, look, this pen is floating. How crazy is that?",6
26178,Bernadette,1," You said you told her, but you never did!",6
26179,Howard,1," Okay, okay, I know you‰Ûªre upset, but let me share something I‰Ûªve learned since I got here. You realize how small your problems are when you‰Ûªre looking down on them from space. Now, come on, that‰Ûªs got to make you feel better.",6
26180,Bernadette,1, How clear is the image of me on that screen?,6
26181,Howard,1, Pretty clear.,6
26182,Bernadette,1, Do I look like I feel better?,6
26183,Howard,1," I mean, it‰Ûªs not, like, HD quality.",6
26184,Bernadette,1," Listen, mister, you‰Ûªre gonna talk to your mother and you‰Ûªre gonna fix this, or that thing I said I was gonna do to you the minute you got home, you can do to yourself.",6
26185,Dimitri,1, Like he‰Ûªs been doing since he got here.,6
26186,Scene,1, A restaurant.,6
26187,Amy,1," Sheldon, this place is so romantic. ",6

26189,Amy,1," Well, when you see him, tell him I say thank you.",6
26190,Sheldon,1, Tell him yourself.,6
26191,Raj,1, Yoo-hoo! Over here!,6
26192,Amy,1, I don‰Ûªt understand. What‰Ûªs he doing here?,6
26193,Sheldon,1, I invited him.,6
26194,Amy,1," On our date? Sheldon, that‰Ûªs not okay.",6
26195,Sheldon,1," Yes, it is. There‰Ûªs a loophole in the Relationship Agreement.",6
26196,Amy,1, You found a loophole?,6
26197,Raj,1, Sorry I started without you. I‰Ûªm a little nervous. It‰Ûªs been a long time since I‰Ûªve been on a date.,6
26198,Amy,1, I can‰Ûªt believe I bleached my moustache for this.,6
26199,Raj,1, You should go to my girl. She‰Ûªll knock out those sideburns for free.,6
26200,Raj,1," You know, Amy, I don‰Ûªt even think you and I have had a real conversation. Let‰Ûªs use tonight to get to know each other a little better. You start.",6
26201,Amy,1, Go home.,6
26202,Raj,1, I don‰Ûªt understand.,6
26203,Amy,1," Sheldon, how could you do this? It‰Ûªs our second anniversary.",6
26204,Raj,1," It‰Ûªs your anniversary? Oh, my God, I had no idea. Amy, please, let me make this right. ",6
26205,Amy,1, Thank you.,6
26206,Raj,1," My pleasure. Waiter? A bottle of champagne and three glasses. Oh, boy, isn‰Ûªt this romantic?",6
26207,Sheldon,1," Oh, I hope that‰Ûªs a rhetorical question, because I have no clue.",6
26208,Scene,1, The apartment. ,6
26209,Penny,1, This is great. What‰Ûªs the occasion?,6
26210,Leonard,1," No occasion. You know, things have been a little weird between us, so I wanted to throw together a fun night just for you.",6
26211,Penny,1, That is so sweet.,6
26212,Leonard,1," I got all your favourites. Beer, wings, sliders. We can watch the football game. I even painted my stomach.",6
26213,Penny,1, Go Sports?,6
26214,Leonard,1," Well, in case you were in the mood for baseball, I didn‰Ûªt want to look ridiculous.",6
26215,Penny,1, This is awesome. I love it!,6
26216,Leonard,1," Good, I‰Ûªm glad. ",6
26217,Penny,1," Gosh, I worked my ass off today. This is exactly what I needed.",6
26218,Leonard,1, Great. Just relax and enjoy. Tonight is all about you.,6
26219,Penny,1," Ah, thank you!",6
26220,Leonard,1," So, where exactly are we in this relationship?",6
26221,Penny,1," Oh, come on. I just told you I had a hard day.",6
26222,Leonard,1," You‰Ûªre right, I‰Ûªm sorry. Let‰Ûªs watch the game. ",6
26223,Penny,1, Great.,6
26224,Leonard,1," I just know the longer we wait to talk about it, the weirder it gets.",6
26225,Penny,1," Sweetie, can I just be the girl tonight?",6
26226,Leonard,1," Absolutely. You‰Ûªre the girl, I‰Ûªm the guy. Now, you watch your football game while I make you a little plate here.",6
26227,Penny,1, Thank you. (Knock on door),6
26228,Leonard,1," Oh, I‰Ûªll get it. Go sports.",6
26229,Raj,1, Hello-lo-lo.,6
26230,Leonard,1, What are you doing here? I thought you were out with Sheldon and Amy.,6
26231,Raj,1," I was, but it‰Ûªs their anniversary and I didn‰Ûªt want to be a third wheel, so I figured I‰Ûªd come over here and hang out with you and Penny on your date.",6
26232,Leonard,1," Well, it‰Ûªs not really a great time. Penny and I have some things we need to talk about.",6
26233,Penny,1," No, we don‰Ûªt! Come on in!",6
26234,Raj,1, Sweet!,6
26235,Leonard,1, I can‰Ûªt believe I shaved my stomach for this.,6
26236,Scene,1, The International Space Station,6
26237,Dimitri,1," Hey, Froot Loops. You got a phone call.",6
26238,Howard,1, Who is it?,6
26239,Dimitri,1, A woman who says she‰Ûªs your mother but sounds like your father.,6
26240,Howard,1," Hey, Ma. You know, we could see each other if you turn on the computer.",6
26241,Mrs Wolowitz (off),1, I‰Ûªm not going near that fakakta thing. I‰Ûªll catch a computer virus.,6
26242,Howard,1, You can‰Ûªt catch a computer virus.,6
26243,Mrs Wolowitz (off),1," Oh, so now you‰Ûªre an astronaut and a doctor?",6
26244,Howard,1," What do you want, Ma?",6
26245,Mrs Wolowitz (off),1, Your wife says you have something important to tell me.,6
26246,Howard,1," Okay, here it is. Bernadette and I are starting a life together and‰Û_",6
26247,Mrs Wolowitz (off),1," Oh, God! You are gonna leave me.",6
26248,Howard,1, Ma‰Û_,6
26249,Mrs Wolowitz (off),1," It‰Ûªs okay. Your father left me, you left me, I guess I‰Ûªm just the kind of person people like to leave.",6
26250,Howard,1, It‰Ûªs not definite. I‰Ûªll talk to Bernadette.,6
26251,Mrs Wolowitz (off),1, Don‰Ûªt bother. I‰Ûªll just go sit in a hole in the ground so I‰Ûªm no trouble when I die.,6
26252,Howard,1," Stop it, Ma. I‰Ûªm sure I can get Bernie to come around.",6
26253,Mrs Wolowitz (off),1," I knew it. I knew she was behind this. You listen to me, if you want to be a man you can‰Ûªt let a woman tell you what to do.",6
26254,Howard,1," Okay, okay.",6
26255,Dimitri,1, Oy. I can‰Ûªt believe these people won the Cold War.,6
26256,Howard,1," Now, can we please change the subject?",6
26257,Mrs Wolowitz (off),1, Fine. Explain why you‰Ûªve been gone so long and I haven‰Ûªt gotten a single letter. Not even a lousy postcard.,6
26258,Scene,1, The apartment.,6
26259,Raj,1," You know, I‰Ûªm growing to like American football. ",6
26260,Penny,1," Yeah, it‰Ûªs fun, isn‰Ûªt it?",6
26261,Raj,1," Well, it‰Ûªs not the balls-to-the-wall action of badminton or cricket, but hey, what is?",6
26262,Penny,1," All right, who‰Ûªs ready for another beer?",6
26263,Leonard,1, I‰Ûªm good.,6
26264,Raj,1," No, thank you.",6
26265,Penny,1, Girls.,6
26266,Raj,1," Oh, I‰Ûªm having the nicest time. You guys are like family to me. You know that, right?",6
26267,Leonard,1, That‰Ûªs great. Get out.,6
26268,Raj,1, What? Why?,6
26269,Leonard,1, Penny and I have some issues we need to talk about.,6
26270,Raj,1," Oh pish on your issues. You guys are fine. Yes, you hit some bumps along the way. I mean, Penny, you‰Ûªve always known how this man has felt about you, but you made him grovel for affection.",6
26271,Penny,1," Okay, hold on‰Û_",6
26272,Raj,1," Now, don‰Ûªt blame yourself. He was a groveller from way back. But the point is, the two of you got past it. And, Leonard, you go and propose to this poor girl in the middle of sex? That was some weak tea, dude.",6
26273,Leonard,1, Some people might say it was romantic.,6
26274,Raj,1," Yeah, no. But yet, here you two are, still together. And that‰Ûªs even after you and I had our crazy naked night.",6
26275,Leonard,1, Okay.,6
26276,Penny,1, That‰Ûªs enough.,6
26277,Raj,1," I‰Ûªm just saying that after everything you‰Ûªve been through, you get to look into each other‰Ûªs eyes and say ‰ÛÏI love you.‰Û And that‰Ûªs beautiful.",6
26278,Leonard,1," Actually, to this day, she‰Ûªs never really said it.",6
26279,Raj,1," Oh, Penny. That‰Ûªs ridiculous. You know you love him. You, you look him in the eyes and you say it. ",6
26280,Penny,1, Raj.,6
26281,Raj,1," Oh come on, you know you want to say it. Say it. Say you love him. Say it!",6
26282,Scene,1, The hallway. Raj is ejected from the apartment.,6
26283,Raj,1, I really thought she would say it.,6
26284,Scene,1, The restaurant.,6
26285,Amy,1, Have I ever told you you‰Ûªre like a sexy praying mantis? ,6
26286,Sheldon,1, Every time you drink alcohol.,6
26287,Amy,1, You know what‰Ûªs wonderful about the praying mantis? They devour their mate.,6
26288,Sheldon,1, Your point being?,6
26289,Amy,1, Dessert is served.,6
26290,Sheldon,1, I just had cobbler.,6
26291,Amy,1, You know what? I‰Ûªm done with this.,6
26292,Sheldon,1, W-Where are you going?,6
26293,Amy,1, I‰Ûªm leaving.,6
26294,Sheldon,1, You can‰Ûªt leave. I need you.,6
26295,Amy,1, You do?,6
26296,Sheldon,1, Yes. You‰Ûªre my ride.,6
26297,Amy,1," Sheldon, you either say something meaningful and from the heart, or you and I are done.",6
26298,Sheldon,1," All right. Please. Amy, when I look in your eyes and you‰Ûªre looking back in mine, everything feels not quite normal, because I feel stronger and weaker at the same time. I feel excited and, at the same time, terrified. The truth is, I don‰Ûªt know what I feel, except I know what kind of man I want to be.",6
26299,Amy,1," Sheldon, that was beautiful.",6
26300,Sheldon,1, I should hope so. That‰Ûªs from the first Spider-Man movie.,6
26301,Amy,1, I‰Ûªll take it.,6
26302,Sheldon,1," Good. Now, I assume we‰Ûªre splitting the cheque?",6
26303,Scene,1, The Comic Book Store.,6
26304,Raj,1," Hey, Stuart.",6
26305,Stuart,1," Oh, hey. I was actually just about to close up.",6
26306,Raj,1," Oh, I‰Ûªm sorry. I‰Ûªll leave.",6
26307,Stuart,1," No, no. It‰Ûªs okay. Hang out. ",6
26308,Raj,1, You sure?,6
26309,Stuart,1," Yeah, you‰Ûªre my first customer today.",6
26310,Raj,1, All right. Great.,6
26311,Stuart,1," I‰Ûªm, uh, having a nightcap. You want to join me?",6
26312,Raj,1, What are you drinking?,6
26313,Stuart,1, Coffee liqueur in a Chewbacca mug. I call it a sad-tini.,6
26314,Raj,1, Perfect for the night I‰Ûªm having. Thank you.,6
26315,Stuart,1, Hmm. Nice not to drink alone.,6
26316,Raj,1, Amen to that. Sometimes I pour a little chardonnay into my dog‰Ûªs water bowl.,6
26317,Stuart,1, You‰Ûªre kidding.,6
26318,Raj,1," She‰Ûªs kind of a mean drunk, but what are you gonna do?",6
26319,Stuart,1, Cheers.,6
26320,Raj,1, Cheers.,6
26321,Stuart,1, A little music?,6
26322,Raj,1, Sure. Mmm. Bossa nova. You listen to that with your hips as well as your ears.,6
26323,Stuart,1, Mmm.,6
26324,Raj,1, Oh. Something about latin music just makes me feel like I‰Ûªm on a white sand beach in Rio.,6
26325,Stuart,1," Yeah. The sun, the waves, the beautiful bodies, tanned and glistening with sweat.",6
26326,Raj,1, I should go.,6
26327,Stuart,1, Yeah.,6
26328,Raj,1," Uh, thank you for the drink.",6
26329,Stuart,1, No problem.,6
26330,Raj,1," Hey, Stuart.",6
26331,Stuart,1, Yeah?,6
26332,Raj,1," Do you want to hang out tomorrow night, maybe grab a bite to eat or catch a late movie?",6
26333,Stuart,1," Yeah, I-I‰Ûªd like to, but I‰Ûªm a little tight on funds.",6
26334,Raj,1, No problem. My treat. I‰Ûªll swing by after work.,6
26335,Stuart,1, Okay.,6
26336,Raj,1, Okay.,6
26337,Stuart,1, I could do worse.,6
26338,Scene,1, The International Space Station,6
26339,Bernadette,1," Aw, that‰Ûªs such good news, Howie. Thank you for telling her.",6
26340,Howard,1," Hey, I‰Ûªm a grown man. I‰Ûªm gonna live with my wife. My mother‰Ûªs just gonna have to learn to make do on her own.",6
26341,Bernadette,1, Was she upset?,6
26342,Howard,1, Who can tell? She yells everything. She might have been upset. She might have been hungry.,6
26343,Bernadette,1, Thanks for fixing it. I love you.,6
26344,Howard,1," I love you, too. Sweet dreams. I‰Ûªll talk to you tomorrow?",6
26345,Bernadette,1," Good night, Rocket Man.",6
26346,Howard,1," To infinity and beyond, baby.",6
26347,Dimitri,1, Loops. You realize you just lied your ass off to your wife and your mother.,6
26348,Howard,1, I know.,6
26349,Dimitri,1, What are you gonna do when you get back to Earth?,6
26350,Howard,1," Oh, I‰Ûªm never going back.",6
26351,Scene,2, Bernadette‰Ûªs apartment.,6
26352,Bernadette,2, And the next wedding gift is a gravy boat.,6
26353,Penny,2," Ooh, one gravy boat.",6
26354,Amy,2, That‰Ûªs from Sheldon. He told me he had it engraved.,6
26355,Bernadette,2," In the event of a divorce, please return to Sheldon Cooper.",6
26356,Penny,2," One inappropriate, yet I wish I thought of that gravy boat.",6
26357,Amy,2, When I get married I‰Ûªm going to register at the UCLA Cadaver Lab.,6
26358,Penny,2," Ew, why?",6
26359,Amy,2, ‰Û÷Cause I‰Ûªve always wanted a whole human skeleton and they are really spendy.,6
26360,Bernadette,2," So, you actually see you and Sheldon getting married someday?",6
26361,Amy,2, Not just someday. In exactly four years. But don‰Ûªt tell Sheldon. He‰Ûªs still a flight risk.,6
26362,Bernadette,2," What about you, Penny?",6
26363,Penny,2, What about me what?,6
26364,Bernadette,2, Do you think you and Leonard might ever get married?,6
26365,Penny,2," Oh, well, you know, Leonard is great.",6
26366,Bernadette,2, But do you think you‰Ûªll ever get married?,6
26367,Penny,2, He‰Ûªs a sweetie.,6
26368,Amy,2, You‰Ûªre not answering the question. Do you love him?,6
26369,Penny,2," Yeah, sure, of course I love him.",6
26370,Bernadette,2, It doesn‰Ûªt sound like it.,6
26371,Penny,2," Well, I do.",6
26372,Bernadette,2, Do you tell him that?,6
26373,Penny,2," No, he‰Ûªd just take it the wrong way.",6
26374,Amy,2, What does that mean?,6
26375,Penny,2, It means he is special and smart and nice and‰Û_,6
26376,Bernadette,2, Are you gonna break up with him?,6
26377,Penny,2, No. Maybe. I don‰Ûªt know.,6
26378,Bernadette,2, I had no idea you were unhappy.,6
26379,Penny,2," That‰Ûªs the thing, I‰Ûªm not. I‰Ûªm not unhappy at all. It‰Ûªs just, I don‰Ûªt know, I, I‰Ûªve been in love before, but it felt different. But maybe this is a new, better, boring kind of love. Do you ever feel that way about Howard?",6
26380,Bernadette,2," Oh, that‰Ûªs not really a fair comparison. I‰Ûªm basically married to a sexy Buzz Lightyear.",6
26381,Penny,2," Amy, you?",6
26382,Amy,2," Can‰Ûªt help ya, kid. Whenever I‰Ûªm around Sheldon, I feel like my loins are on fire. In the good way. Not the urinary tract infection way.",6
26383,Scene,2, Cutting between the International Space Station and the apartment (the guys are on webcam).,6
26384,Raj (voice off),2," Hey, buddy, how‰Ûªs it going up there?",6
26385,Howard,2," You don‰Ûªt have to shout, Raj. It‰Ûªs not like I‰Ûªm an astronaut floating around in outer space. Oh, wait, I am.",6
26386,Leonard,2," So, is it everything you hoped it would be?",6
26387,Howard,2, It‰Ûªs better. I wake up every morning and I just can‰Ûªt believe I‰Ûªm on this incredible adventure.,6
26388,Dimitri,2," Hey, Froot Loops, did you clean the space toilet?",6
26389,Howard,2, Excuse me. I‰Ûªm talking to my friends.,6
26390,Mike,2," You know the rules, new guy scrubs the toilet.",6
26391,Dimitri,2," If you do good job, next time we give you brush.",6
26392,Howard,2," Funny. We‰Ûªre always giving each other a hard time up here. It‰Ûªs kind of like being in a frat. You know, joking, kidding around, hurting feelings.",6
26393,Sheldon,2," Okay, my turn. Let me talk to him.",6
26394,Leonard,2, Go ahead.,6
26395,Sheldon,2," 2311 North Los Robles Avenue, Pasadena, California to International Space Station. Can you read me? Over. (Makes static noise)",6
26396,Howard,2," Yes, I read you, Sheldon.",6
26397,Sheldon,2, Copy that. Over. (Static noise),6
26398,Leonard,2, What are you doing?,6
26399,Sheldon,2, I am talking to a man in space. If you don‰Ûªt have the (static noise) then he might as well be at the Coffee Bean over on Lake Street.,6
26400,Howard,2," You‰Ûªre out of your mind,Sheldon.",6
26401,Sheldon,2, That‰Ûªs a negative. My mother had me tested. Over. (Static noise),6
26402,Mike,2," Come on, scrub it up, Loops.",6
26403,Howard,2," All right, all right. I gotta go. There‰Ûªs a meteor shower.",6
26404,Mike,2, You want to see a meteor shower? Take a look at what Dimitri just left you in the toilet.,6
26405,Howard,2, Bye.,6
26406,Sheldon,2, Over and out. (Static noise),6
26407,Raj,2," Bye, buddy!",6
26408,Stuart (knocking and entering),2, Hello.,6
26409,Raj,2," Hey, Stuart, come on in.",6
26410,Sheldon,2, What are you doing here?,6
26411,Stuart,2," Um, Raj invited me to go to the movies with you guys.",6
26412,Sheldon,2, Excuse me. I didn‰Ûªt authorize this.,6
26413,Leonard,2," Sheldon, you are not in charge.",6
26414,Sheldon,2, That‰Ûªs mighty sassy for a man with a roommate performance review around the corner.,6
26415,Raj,2, What‰Ûªs the big deal? You guys are bringing your girlfriends. I didn‰Ûªt want to sit by myself.,6
26416,Sheldon,2," The big deal is I was expecting us to be an intimate group of five. Now, we‰Ûªre going to be a faceless mass of six.",6
26417,Leonard,2," It‰Ûªll be fine. Just, uh, pretend he‰Ûªs Wolowitz.",6
26418,Sheldon,2, Hmm. Do you like Raisinets?,6
26419,Stuart,2, I can take them or leave them.,6
26420,Sheldon,2," At the movies, Wolowitz always eats Raisinets.",6
26421,Stuart,2, Would you feel more comfortable if I ate Raisinets?,6
26422,Sheldon,2," Well, it‰Ûªs hardly my business what you eat, as long as it doesn‰Ûªt crunch during the film and it‰Ûªs Raisinets.",6
26423,Stuart,2, Okay. Should we go?,6
26424,Sheldon,2," Yuh-uh, one more question, if you‰Ûªre going to replace Wolowitz, I need to know a little more about you.",6
26425,Stuart,2, All right.,6
26426,Sheldon,2, Wolowitz went to MIT. What‰Ûªs your educational background?,6
26427,Stuart,2, I went to art school.,6
26428,Sheldon,2, Equally ridiculous. Let‰Ûªs go.,6
26429,Scene,2, The cinema.,6
26430,Sheldon,2, This insistence on hand-holding is preposterous.,6
26431,Amy,2," Well, I like it.",6
26432,Sheldon,2," Yeah, of course you do. You‰Ûªre a girl. You like all kinds of hippy-dippy things.",6
26433,Amy,2, Just watch the movie.,6
26434,Sheldon,2, It‰Ûªs not fair. Penny isn‰Ûªt making Leonard hold hands.,6
26435,Amy,2, There might be a reason for that.,6
26436,Sheldon,2, Sweaty? Unhygienic? Looks dumb? Take your pick.,6
26437,Amy,2, Penny said she‰Ûªs not sure she wants to be Leonard‰Ûªs girlfriend anymore.,6
26438,Sheldon,2, Wrong. She just took a sip from his Diet Dr. Pepper.,6
26439,Amy,2, So?,6
26440,Sheldon,2," So, if she wants to end her pair-bond with Leonard, why on earth would she guzzle a witches‰Ûª brew of his soda and spit?",6
26441,Amy,2, It‰Ûªs complicated.,6
26442,Sheldon,2," String theory is complicated. That‰Ûªs just yucky. Don‰Ûªt get any ideas. All right, for the sake of argument, let‰Ûªs say that‰Ûªs true. Why doesn‰Ûªt Penny just end the relationship?",6
26443,Amy,2, She‰Ûªs not sure how she feels.,6
26444,Sheldon,2," How can she not be sure how she feels? You know, when I have a feeling, I know it. Trains? Love them. Swordfish? I love them, too. They‰Ûªre fish with a sword for a nose.",6
26445,Amy,2," Regardless, don‰Ûªt say anything to Leonard.",6
26446,Sheldon,2," Now you‰Ûªre asking me to keep a secret from my best friend, colleague, and roommate?",6
26447,Amy,2," Yes, please, Penny will kill me.",6
26448,Sheldon,2," Uh, fine. FYI, secret-keeping? Hate it. Hand-holding? Not a fan. Hammerhead shark? I love that thing. Yeah, it‰Ûªs another fish with a tool on its head.",6
26449,Stuart,2, Raisinet?,6
26450,Sheldon,2," Shh, we‰Ûªre trying to watch the movie. This is not working out with him.",6
26451,Scene,2, The apartment. Sheldon is making a sucking noise with his teeth.,6
26452,Leonard,2, What are you doing?,6
26453,Sheldon,2, I think I might have tartar buildup. My tongue won‰Ûªt go as far forward as it used to.,6
26454,Leonard,2, Maybe your tongue is shrinking.,6
26455,Sheldon (measures),2," Nope. Oh, you have no idea how annoying this is.",6
26456,Leonard,2, I‰Ûªm starting to get a sense of it. Don‰Ûªt worry. I‰Ûªll take you to the dentist tomorrow.,6
26457,Sheldon,2," Thank you. I appreciate that. You‰Ûªre good people, Leonard. There‰Ûªs something I need to tell you.",6
26458,Leonard,2, Okay.,6
26459,Sheldon,2, I can‰Ûªt tell you.,6
26460,Leonard,2, Why?,6
26461,Sheldon,2, I can‰Ûªt tell you why I can‰Ûªt tell you. So I guess there‰Ûªs two things I can‰Ûªt tell you.,6
26462,Leonard,2, I wish there were more.,6
26463,Sheldon,2, Good night. I‰Ûªm sorry. This is really important.,6
26464,Leonard,2, What is it?,6
26465,Sheldon,2, I like The Transformers. Do you like The Transformers?,6
26466,Leonard,2, Where exactly did your mother have you tested?,6
26467,Sheldon,2," Leonard, the Transformers teach us that things are not always what they appear to be. You know, like, uh, a semi truck might be an alien robot, or, uh, someone in a romantic relationship, uh, might feel differently than they appear to. Or a conversation about The Transformers might actually be about someone in this room. I‰Ûªm going to pause to let that sink in.",6
26468,Leonard,2," Okay, I think I understand.",6
26469,Sheldon,2, You do?,6
26470,Leonard,2," The guy who seems like an emotionless robot is you, but your relationship with Amy is causing you to transform into a red-blooded man with sexual desires.",6
26471,Sheldon,2, That is literally the stupidest thing I‰Ûªve ever heard.,6
26472,Scene,2, Leonard‰Ûªs room.,6
26473,Sheldon,2," (Knock, knock, knock) Leonard? (Knock, knock, knock) Leonard? (Knock, knock, knock) Leonard?",6
26474,Leonard,2, What?,6
26475,Sheldon,2, Are you sleeping?,6
26476,Leonard,2, I was. Now I‰Ûªm having a nightmare. What do you want?,6
26477,Sheldon,2, Never mind. I still can‰Ûªt tell you.,6
26478,Scene,2," Penny‰Ûªs bedroom. Sheldon is standing over Penny‰Ûªs bed, knocking on the wall.",6
26479,Sheldon,2," (Knock, knock, knock) Penny? (Knock, knock, knock) Penny? (Knock, knock, knock) Penny? (Penny wakes up and screams. Sheldon also screams)",6
26480,Penny,2," Oh, my God. Sheldon?",6
26481,Sheldon,2, You frightened me.,6
26482,Penny,2, What are you doing in my bedroom?,6
26483,Sheldon,2," Yeah, well, I knocked on the front door, but you didn‰Ûªt hear it.",6
26484,Penny,2," How did you even get in, you weirdo?",6
26485,Sheldon,2," Yeah, really? I‰Ûªve seen strange men traipsing in and out of here for years, but when I do it, it‰Ûªs weird?",6
26486,Penny,2," What do you want, Sheldon?",6
26487,Sheldon,2," Oh, I was having a little trouble sleeping and I just thought, uh, seeing as you‰Ûªre up, we could talk.",6
26488,Penny,2, Talk about what?,6
26489,Sheldon,2," Oh, I don‰Ûªt know, uh, weather, uh, fish you could do carpentry with, why Leonard is such an attractive and desirable boyfriend. Yeah, pick one, your choice.",6
26490,Penny,2, Sheldon.,6
26491,Sheldon,2, Did you know that Leonard has a perfect driving record and enjoys the insurance discounts that go along with that? Hubba-hubba.,6
26492,Penny,2," Okay, go home, crazy man.",6
26493,Sheldon,2," Yeah. Did you know that while Leonard is not considered a tall fellow in our country, in today‰Ûªs North Korea, he‰Ûªs downright average. Hey, talk about a keeper.",6
26494,Penny,2," Okay, what did Amy tell you?",6
26495,Sheldon,2," Oh, very well. I can‰Ûªt keep up this clever charade any longer. She told me that you were thinking of ending it with Leonard.",6
26496,Penny,2," Okay, you listen to me. I think it‰Ûªs really sweet you‰Ûªre trying to protect your friend, but this is none of your business. Got it?",6
26497,Sheldon,2, Excuse me. This is not about protecting my friend. I‰Ûªm a big fan of homeostasis. Do you know what that is?,6
26498,Penny,2, Of course not.,6
26499,Sheldon,2, Homeostasis refers to a system‰Ûªs ability to regulate its internal environment and maintain a constant condition of properties like temperature or pH.,6
26500,Penny,2, Worst bedtime story ever.,6
26501,Sheldon,2," My point is I don‰Ûªt like when things change. So, regardless of your feelings, I would like you to continue dating Leonard. And also, while we‰Ûªre on the subject, you recently changed your shampoo. I‰Ûªm not comfortable with the new scent. Please stop this madness and go back to green apple.",6
26502,Penny,2," Okay, honey, I have a lot to figure out, and until I do, you are not to say a word to Leonard. Do you understand?",6
26503,Sheldon,2, I do. You clear on the shampoo issue?,6
26504,Penny,2, Get out.,6
26505,Sheldon,2, Penny?,6
26506,Penny,2, What?,6
26507,Sheldon,2, Please don‰Ûªt hurt my friend.,6
26508,Penny,2, That is the last thing I want to do.,6
26509,Sheldon,2, Thank you. Coconut? What were you thinking? Are you a hula girl?,6
26510,Penny,2, Get out.,6
26511,Scene,2, Amy‰Ûªs bedroom. Phone rings.,6
26512,Amy,2, Hello?,6
26513,Penny,2, What the hell is wrong with you? You told Sheldon? Do you know what a terrible position this puts me in? (Phone beeps),6
26514,Amy,2," Hang on, please. Hello?",6
26515,Amy,2, I know. She‰Ûªs yelling at me right now.,6
26516,Sheldon,2," All right then, so we‰Ûªre all on the same page. Yes.",6
26517,Scene,2, Cutting between the International Space Station and the Bernadette‰Ûªs apartment.,6
26518,Howard,2," Hey, Bernie.",6
26519,Bernadette,2, There‰Ûªs my hubby. How‰Ûªs everything going up there?,6
26520,Howard,2," Oh, it‰Ûªs okay. Space is beautiful. Earth is beautiful. Same old, same old.",6
26521,Bernadette,2, What‰Ûªs wrong?,6
26522,Howard,2, Nothing. Everything‰Ûªs fine.,6
26523,Bernadette,2, Howard.,6
26524,Howard,2, The other astronauts are being mean to me.,6
26525,Bernadette,2," No, what are they doing?",6
26526,Howard,2," Well, like for instance, the other day when I was asleep, one of the guys went on a space walk and glued a big-eyed rubber alien mask to the outside of my window. When I woke up, I screamed for like nine minutes.",6
26527,Bernadette,2," Oh, Howie.",6
26528,Howard,2, You can see it if you want. It‰Ûªs on YouTube. Google astronaut screams for nine minutes.,6
26529,Bernadette,2, Why don‰Ûªt you stand up to them?,6
26530,Howard,2, What am I supposed to say?,6
26531,Bernadette,2," I don‰Ûªt know. Say, being mean is lame, what‰Ûªs cool is being nice.",6
26532,Howard,2," Great, I‰Ûªll do that when I want to be the first guy in space to get a wedgie.",6
26533,Bernadette,2, Do you want me to call somebody at NASA?,6
26534,Howard,2, No. My mom already tried that. It only made things worse.,6
26535,Scene,2, The apartment. The guys are playing a card game.,6
26536,Leonard,2, Gelatinous Sphere.,6
26537,Raj,2, Focused Locust.,6
26538,Stuart,2, Temple of Yip.,6
26539,Sheldon,2, I‰Ûªm sorry. Wolowitz would never play that card.,6
26540,Stuart,2," All right, Lesser Demon Turtle.",6
26541,Sheldon,2," Fairy God Monster, I win. Your desperate need for friendship makes you weak.",6
26542,Raj,2," So, what are you guys doing later? Stuart and I were thinking of going out for a drink.",6
26543,Stuart,2, We‰Ûªre gonna try to meet some girls.,6
26544,Raj,2, ‰Û÷Cause that‰Ûªs what we do.,6
26545,Stuart,2," Watch out, ladies, a little coffee and cream coming your way.",6
26546,Raj,2," In case you didn‰Ûªt follow that, I‰Ûªm the coffee.",6
26547,Sheldon,2, Leonard? Maybe you‰Ûªd like to go with them to meet girls.,6
26548,Leonard,2, Why would I be interested? I have Penny.,6
26549,Sheldon,2," Yeah, for now. But that woman has a death wish, Leonard. She talks to strangers, she pets unfamiliar dogs, and it is ridiculously easy to break into her apartment. If I were you, I‰Ûªd get a back-up.",6
26550,Leonard,2, You can‰Ûªt just replace someone you care about with some other random person.,6
26551,Stuart,2," No, please don‰Ûªt ruin this for me.",6
26552,Sheldon,2, Do you remember how upset I was when they replaced Edward Norton as the Hulk?,6
26553,Leonard,2," Yes, you walked around for a week saying, Sheldon unhappy with casting choice.",6
26554,Sheldon,2," But, then Mark Ruffalo was the Hulk in The Avengers, and he was even better.",6
26555,Leonard,2, What‰Ûªs your point?,6
26556,Sheldon,2, Call me a romantic. I like to think that your Mark Ruffalo is still out there somewhere.,6
26557,Leonard,2, This is ridiculous. Are we gonna play cards or not?,6
26558,Stuart,2," I like Mark Ruffalo, too.",6
26559,Sheldon,2," Yeah, settle down there, fake Wolowitz. No one likes a kiss-up.",6
26560,Scene,2, Penny‰Ûªs apartment.,6
26561,Leonard,2," So, I had to take Sheldon to the dentist this morning.",6
26562,Penny,2, Really?,6
26563,Leonard,2," Yup. I told him if he didn‰Ûªt bite the hygienist, I‰Ûªd take him for ice cream.",6
26564,Penny,2, Mmm.,6
26565,Leonard,2, I didn‰Ûªt have to take him for ice cream.,6
26566,Penny,2, Uh-huh.,6
26567,Leonard,2, You okay? You seem a little distracted.,6
26568,Penny,2," Look, there‰Ûªs something I need to tell you.",6
26569,Leonard,2," Oh. Yeah, okay.",6
26570,Penny,2, I don‰Ûªt really know how to say this.,6
26571,Leonard,2, Just say it.,6
26572,Penny,2, Okay. Here goes.,6
26573,Leonard,2, Mm-hmm.,6
26574,Scene,2, Bernadette‰Ûªs apartment.,6
26575,Amy,2, You slept with him?,6
26576,Penny,2," I didn‰Ûªt know what else to do. He had those big, sad eyes.",6
26577,Bernadette,2," Oh, sure, you had no choice.",6
26578,Penny,2, He looked at me like this.,6
26579,Amy,2," Well, if that‰Ûªs all it takes, it‰Ûªs a good thing you don‰Ûªt have a dog.",6
26580,Bernadette,2," Don‰Ûªt worry. You‰Ûªll have plenty of chances to break up with him. Your wedding day, your honeymoon, your 50th anniversary.",6
26581,Penny,2," Look, it‰Ûªs fine. We‰Ûªre not getting married, okay? We‰Ûªre keeping things, you know, homeostasis.",6
26582,Amy,2, It‰Ûªs so cute when she tries.,6
26583,Penny (phone text tone),2," It‰Ûªs from Leonard. Last night was amazing. You‰Ûªre amazing. I‰Ûªm so lucky to have you in my life. (They give him a hangdog look) Okay, stop it.",6
26584,Scene,2, Cutting between the International Space Station and the Bernadette‰Ûªs apartment.,6
26585,Howard,2," Hey, Bernie, guess what? I stood up to the other astronauts like you said and I got to tell you, last night was the first time in a week I got a good night‰Ûªs sleep. (On screen, Howard has a mouse face drawn on his face, and the words F.LOOPS on his forehead.)",6
26586,Bernadette,2," Oh, Howie.",6
26587,Howard,2, What‰Ûªs wrong? You look upset.,6
26588,Bernadette,2," Nope, this is my proud face.",6
26589,Scene,3, Webcam conversation between Bernadette‰Ûªs Office and the International Space Station,6
26590,Howard,3," Hey, Bernie.",6
26591,Bernadette,3," Hey, how‰Ûªs my little astronautie hottie?",6
26592,Howard,3," Okay, I guess. It‰Ûªs just, being cooped up in this tin can for weeks on end is starting to get to me.",6
26593,Bernadette,3," Well, hang in there. You just have a couple more days to go, and then you‰Ûªll be home.",6
26594,Howard,3, I know.,6
26595,Bernadette,3, I got to get back to work. I love you.,6
26596,Howard,3," Love you too. Hey, Bernie? Before you go, can you do something for me?",6
26597,Bernadette,3, What do you want me to do?,6
26598,Howard,3," Okay, here it is. I really miss gravity. Can you drop something so I can watch it fall?",6
26599,Bernadette,3," Really, you‰Ûªre serious? Okay. (Drops a pencil)",6
26600,Howard,3," Oh, baby, you‰Ûªre killing me.",6
26601,Scene,3," The apartment. Penny enters, carrying a box.",6
26602,Penny,3," Ugh. Hey, Sheldon? Hi. This came for you today. It‰Ûªs from your mom.",6
26603,Sheldon,3," Oh, thank you, Penny.",6
26604,Penny,3, M-hmm.,6
26605,Sheldon,3," Yeah, wait, here. For your troubles.",6
26606,Penny,3," Oh, boy, a whole dollar. Now, I can quit my paper route. So, what‰Ûªs in it?",6
26607,Leonard,3," Mmm, doesn‰Ûªt matter. Half the time, he just ends up playing with the box.",6
26608,Sheldon,3," Yeah, it‰Ûªs journals and research papers I wrote as a child.",6
26609,Penny,3," Aw, how cute. Is this like a diary?",6
26610,Sheldon,3," No, that‰Ûªs my potty training journal.",6
26611,Penny,3," Really, your potty training journal?",6
26612,Sheldon,3, Yeah. And forgive my crude penmanship. I didn‰Ûªt start typing until I was six.,6
26613,Sheldon,3," There are some charts in the back where I kept track of shape, colour and consistency.",6
26614,Penny,3," Oh, disgusting.",6
26615,Leonard,3," No, what‰Ûªs disgusting is he‰Ûªs still keeping track.",6
26616,Penny,3, Why do you need all this stuff?,6
26617,Leonard,3," No, no, no, no.",6
26618,Penny,3, Sorry!,6
26619,Sheldon,3, I am glad you asked. Are you familiar with the Higgs boson?,6
26620,Penny,3," Of course, it is, it‰Ûªs been in the news. And it‰Ûªs a very famous boson.",6
26621,Sheldon,3," Nice try. Now, in 1964, Dr. Peter Higgs, accomplished self-promoter and physicist, he wrote a paper postulating the existence of a subatomic particle called the Higgs boson. Now, initially the paper was rejected, but recently, he was proven right, and now he‰Ûªs on the fast track to win a Nobel prize.",6
26622,Penny,3," Yeah, that‰Ûªs basically what I said.",6
26623,Sheldon,3," Yeah, the point is Higgs is being celebrated for work he did 50 years ago, so that got me thinking, perhaps I‰Ûªve already hit upon the idea that will win me my Nobel prize.",6
26624,Leonard,3, I didn‰Ûªt know they gave Nobel prizes for making boom-boom in the potty.,6
26625,Penny,3, You really think there‰Ûªs some kind of scientific discovery in here?,6
26626,Sheldon,3," Well, this box only covers my work through nursery school. There‰Ûªs a good deal more to come. I didn‰Ûªt really hit my academic stride until I cut out that time-suck known as playing outdoors.",6
26627,Leonard,3," So, you‰Ûªre going to spend hours and hours combing through all this stuff?",6
26628,Sheldon,3," That‰Ûªs a good point. My time is much too valuable. You know, perhaps I should find someone to do it for me. You know, someone with a rudimentary understanding of science, but whose real talents lie in menial labour.",6
26629,Leonard,3, Not gonna happen.,6
26630,Sheldon,3," Well, if I didn‰Ûªt think you could handle it, I wouldn‰Ûªt be asking.",6
26631,Leonard,3," If you want help, just hire a grad student.",6
26632,Penny,3, Maybe I could do it.,6
26633,Sheldon,3," You, really? You can assess the quality of my work? Okay, um, here. I wrote this when I was five years old.",6
26634,Penny,3," A proof that algebraic topology can never have a non self-contradictory set of abelion groups. I‰Ûªm just a blonde monkey to you, aren‰Ûªt I?",6
26635,Sheldon,3," You said it, not me.",6
26636,Scene,3, Sheldon‰Ûªs office.,6
26637,Sheldon,3," All right, Ms. Jenson. Uh, before we begin, may I offer you a refreshment? Water, coffee, tea, a marijuana cigarette?",6
26638,Ms Jenson,3," No, thanks. I‰Ûªm fine.",6
26639,Sheldon,3," Now, are you sure? Everyone‰Ûªs smoking them. I think they‰Ûªre the best.",6
26640,Ms Jenson,3, I don‰Ûªt do drugs.,6
26641,Sheldon,3," Excellent, yeah. That was a ruse. They‰Ûªre not the best. Physics is the best. And by the way, coffee was also an unacceptable choice. All right, so I see here you‰Ûªre from Des Moines, Iowa. Uh, you‰Ûªre summa cum laude in theoretical physics from Stanford University. Oh, and two years ago, you had a persistent ear infection. I hope that didn‰Ûªt cause any hearing loss.",6
26642,Ms Jenson,3," No, of course not. How did you know about that?",6
26643,Sheldon,3," I did a comprehensive background check. Medical records, credit reports, criminal history. (Hiding mouth behind book)  I trust you paid off those parking tickets.",6
26644,Ms Jenson,3," Yes, I did.",6
26645,Sheldon,3," Hearing unimpaired, good.",6
26646,Ms Jenson,3," Look, Dr. Cooper, I really want this position. It would be an incredible honour to work for a man of your brilliance.",6
26647,Sheldon,3," Flattery will not get you this job, Ms. Jenson.",6
26648,Ms Jenson,3, It‰Ûªs not flattery if it‰Ûªs the truth.,6
26649,Sheldon,3," Oh, well, thank you. Welcome aboard.",6
26650,Scene,3, A University corridor.,6
26651,Leonard,3, You talk to Howard lately?,6
26652,Raj,3," Uh, yeah, last night. He kept making me drop pencils for him. I got uncomfortable. (Entering Sheldon‰Ûªs office)  Hey, Sheldon, hope you‰Ûªre hungry, they‰Ûªre serving macaroni and‰Û_ (spots Ms Jenson)  che-ee-ee-ese.",6
26653,Leonard,3, Smooth. Hi.,6
26654,Ms Jenson,3, Hello.,6
26655,Leonard,3," Sheldon, aren‰Ûªt you going to introduce us?",6
26656,Sheldon,3, No. I have people for that now. You‰Ûªre up.,6
26657,Ms Jenson,3," I‰Ûªm Alex, Dr. Cooper‰Ûªs new assistant.",6
26658,Leonard,3," Ah, congratulations and may God have mercy on your soul. I‰Ûªm Leonard. This is Raj.",6
26659,Alex,3, It‰Ûªs nice to meet you. I‰Ûªm so excited to be working with Dr‰Û_,6
26660,Sheldon,3," Yeah, please reserve chitchat for your breaks, Ms. Jenson. FYI, there will be no breaks.",6
26661,Alex,3, I should probably get to work.,6
26662,Leonard,3, She seems nice.,6
26663,Raj,3," Hey, you already got a girlfriend. I call dibs.",6
26664,Leonard,3, All I said was she seems nice.,6
26665,Raj,3," Yeah, well, I love her.",6
26666,Scene,3, Webcam conversation between Bernadette‰Ûªs Office and the International Space Station,6
26667,Bernadette,3," Hey, I wasn‰Ûªt expecting to hear from you today. Everything okay?",6
26668,Howard,3," Uh, no, not really.",6
26669,Bernadette,3, What‰Ûªs wrong?,6
26670,Howard,3," Well, remember the Soyuz capsule they were sending to bring us home?",6
26671,Bernadette,3, Uh-huh.,6
26672,Howard,3," It‰Ûªs delayed. We‰Ûªre gonna be here at least another week. Maybe ten days. It‰Ûªs the Russians, so you don‰Ûªt know. They left dogs up here in the sixties.",6
26673,Bernadette,3," Come on, Howard. No one‰Ûªs leaving you up there.",6
26674,Howard,3," I don‰Ûªt know how much longer I can take this. I can‰Ûªt sleep, and zero gravity is giving me crazy acid reflux. I‰Ûªm down to my last three Tums.",6
26675,Bernadette,3, You‰Ûªre going to be fine. You survived that Weight Watchers cruise with your mom. And they ran out of low-fat ice cream on day two. Just calm down and take a few deep breaths.,6
26676,Howard,3," Okay, okay. What am I doing? I‰Ûªm using up all the oxygen. If I die, promise you‰Ûªll never have sex with another man.",6
26677,Scene,3, Penny‰Ûªs apartment. Amy is applying very red lip gloss.,6
26678,Amy,3," Oh, yeah. I‰Ûªm a man-eater now.",6
26679,Penny,3," Okay, for the final touch, this is an eyelash curler. You just place it on your lashes and squeeze it closed.",6
26680,Amy,3," Oh, I don‰Ûªt know. Looks like something used by Tinkerbell‰Ûªs gynecologist.",6
26681,Penny,3," Who I hope for her sake is not Captain Hook, so‰Û_ who are you calling?",6
26682,Amy,3," I‰Ûªm going to video-chat Sheldon. If my new look leads to phone sex, I‰Ûªm going to have to ask you to leave the room.",6
26683,Alex,3, Dr. Cooper‰Ûªs office.,6
26684,Amy,3," Oh, hello. Who are you?",6
26685,Alex,3," I‰Ûªm Alex, Dr. Cooper‰Ûªs assistant. Can I help you?",6
26686,Amy,3, I‰Ûªd like to speak to Sheldon.,6
26687,Alex,3," I‰Ûªm sorry. He‰Ûªs asked me to hold all calls unless you‰Ûªre Stephen Hawking, his mother or himself from the future.",6
26688,Amy,3," All right. Well, tell him Amy called.",6
26689,Alex,3, Last name?,6
26690,Amy,3, He knows my last name. I‰Ûªm his girlfriend. We have a contract and everything. I‰Ûªll send you a PDF.,6
26691,Alex,3," All right, I will tell him you called.",6
26692,Amy,3," Hmm, that‰Ûªs weird.",6
26693,Penny,3, What?,6
26694,Amy,3, Sheldon told me he had a new assistant named Alex. He didn‰Ûªt mention that Alex was a girl.,6
26695,Penny,3, Maybe he didn‰Ûªt notice.,6
26696,Amy,3, You‰Ûªre right. I don‰Ûªt have to worry about Sheldon.,6
26697,Penny,3," No, you do not.",6
26698,Amy,3, It‰Ûªs her I have to worry about.,6
26699,Penny,3," Oh, Amy, really? She is not going to come on to Sheldon.",6
26700,Amy,3," Oh, really? Look at this face (Sheldon‰Ûªs picture on phone) How can any woman spend eight hours a day alone with this face and not fall in love with it?",6
26701,Penny,3," Well, for starters, at some point, that face starts talking.",6
26702,Scene,3, University corridor.,6
26703,Penny,3," Amy, this is crazy. You have nothing to be suspicious about.",6
26704,Amy,3," I‰Ûªm not suspicious. I just want to stop in, say hi to my boyfriend and meet his new assistant. (Throwing open Sheldon‰Ûªs office door) Aha!",6
26705,Penny,3, Can we go now?,6
26706,Amy,3, Hang on. (Rubs Sheldon‰Ûªs telephone receiver under her armpit),6
26707,Penny,3, What are you doing?,6
26708,Amy,3, Isn‰Ûªt it obvious? I‰Ûªm spreading my scent to mark my territory.,6
26709,Penny,3," Come on, Amy. That is not gonna work.",6
26710,Amy,3," Really? Because just before you became my best friend, I did this all over your apartment.",6
26711,Scene,3, The cafeteria.,6
26712,Raj,3," Has your, uh, assistant said anything about me?",6
26713,Sheldon,3," Oh, in fact, she has. Uh, her exact words were, what is that guy‰Ûªs problem?",6
26714,Raj,3, I‰Ûªm in her head. Let the dance begin.,6
26715,Alex,3," Here‰Ûªs your frozen yoghurt, Dr. Cooper.",6
26716,Leonard,3, This should be fun.,6
26717,Sheldon,3," Half chocolate, half vanilla, side by side, not swirled?",6
26718,Alex,3, Yes.,6
26719,Sheldon,3, Half a teaspoon of sprinkles?,6
26720,Alex,3," Rainbow, not chocolate.",6
26721,Sheldon,3, Two cherries?,6
26722,Alex,3," One on top, one on the bottom.",6
26723,Sheldon,3, Stems removed?,6
26724,Alex,3," Um, top one, yes. I didn‰Ûªt check the one on the bottom.",6
26725,Leonard,3, Oh!,6
26726,Alex,3," I‰Ûªm so sorry, Dr. Cooper.",6
26727,Sheldon,3," It‰Ûªs all right, Alex. I‰Ûªm not mad at you, I‰Ûªm just disappointed.",6
26728,Leonard,3," Wait, Alex. Do you want to join us?",6
26729,Alex,3, Um‰Û_,6
26730,Sheldon,3," Uh, Alex, a moment. I need a word with Dr. Hofstadter. Do you think it‰Ûªs appropriate for her to sit with us, given her station?",6
26731,Leonard,3, Given her what?,6
26732,Sheldon,3," If I‰Ûªve learned anything from British television shows on PBS, it‰Ûªs that servants dine downstairs with their own kind.",6
26733,Leonard,3, What?,6
26734,Sheldon,3," It‰Ûªs a kindness, Leonard. Otherwise, you‰Ûªre cruelly tempting them with a glimpse of a world that‰Ûªs just beyond their soot-stained fingertips.",6
26735,Leonard,3," Oh, sure. Please join us.",6
26736,Alex,3," Oh, okay. Thank you.",6
26737,Leonard,3," So, Alex, what‰Ûªs the topic of your dissertation?",6
26738,Alex,3, I‰Ûªm looking for Trojan asteroids at Earth‰Ûªs L-Five Lagrange point.,6
26739,Leonard,3," Oh, that happens to be Dr. Koothrappali‰Ûªs field of expertise. You two have a lot to talk about.",6
26740,Alex,3, Is that true? Is he all right?,6
26741,Leonard,3," No. But compared to your boss, he‰Ûªs the poster boy for sanity.",6
26742,Alex,3," It‰Ûªs okay, I‰Ûªve been around scientists all my life. My dad‰Ûªs an astronomer at SETI.",6
26743,Leonard,3," Oh, SETI, the Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence. You should introduce him to Sheldon. The search is over.",6
26744,Alex,3," So, what kind of research are you doing?",6
26745,Leonard,3, High-energy lasers.,6
26746,Alex,3, Ooh. Military?,6
26747,Leonard,3," Not yet, but I can remove unwanted hair from two miles away.",6
26748,"Amy (to Penny, on other side of room)",3," You were right. I had nothing to worry about. That skank‰Ûªs your problem, not mine.",6
26749,Alex,3," You‰Ûªre very funny, Dr. Hofstadter.",6
26750,Leonard,3, Thank you.,6
26751,Sheldon (choking),3, Cherry stem! Cherry stem!,6
26752,Scene,3, Webcam conversation between Bernadette‰Ûªs Office and the International Space Station,6
26753,Bernadette,3," How you doing, Howie? You feeling a little better?",6
26754,Howard,3," Oh, a lot better, thanks. One sec. Listen close, I don‰Ûªt have a lot of time. I need you to go to my house. In my bedroom, you‰Ûªll find a model rocket. I want you to take it and bring it back to your place.",6
26755,Bernadette,3, Okay.,6
26756,Howard,3," Step two, build a version roughly fourteen stories high. Fill it full of rocket fuel and come get me. I‰Ûªll leave the door unlocked.",6
26757,Bernadette,3," Howie, honey, maybe you should talk to someone, let them know you‰Ûªre having a little anxiety.",6
26758,Howard,3," No, no, I‰Ûªm fine. No anxiety. We should probably talk in code. From now on, frog is me, sandwich means you and lemon means rocket. So, come on, sandwich, build me a lemon ‰Ûªcause froggy wants to come home.",6
26759,Scene,3, Penny‰Ûªs car.,6
26760,Amy,3," Look at you, putting on a brave face.",6
26761,Penny,3, There‰Ûªs nothing to be brave about. Everything‰Ûªs fine.,6
26762,Amy,3," Really? I don‰Ûªt know how much you know about primate behaviour, but Sheldon‰Ûªs assistant was clearly courting Leonard. Were she a mandrill, she would have bent over and displayed her brightly coloured hindquarters like a big red welcome mat. By the way, you try that at the junior prom, you get kicked out.",6
26763,Penny,3," Okay, maybe she was flirting with him, but who cares? Look, I don‰Ûªt even know where my relationship is with Leonard is right now.",6
26764,Amy,3," So says your prefrontal cortex. But meanwhile, the limbic system of your brain is calculating that if another woman is attracted to Leonard, it must be because he‰Ûªs desirable.",6
26765,Penny,3," Well, of course he‰Ûªs desirable. I mean, he‰Ûªs great. He‰Ûªs smart, he‰Ûªs sweet, and, ooh, in the bedroom, whew, let me tell you, he really tries.",6
26766,Amy,3, So it does bother you.,6
26767,Penny,3," Fine, it bothers me a little. No. You know what? This is stupid. It doesn‰Ûªt bother me. Okay, it bothers me. But only because she wouldn‰Ûªt stop laughing. Leonard is not that funny.",6
26768,Amy,3," And there you have it, prefrontal cortex reasoning versus limbic lust. If this were a boxing match, they might call it the thrilla adjacent to the amygdala. If you were a brain scientist, you would be busting a gut right now.",6
26769,Scene,3, The apartment.,6
26770,Penny,3," So, how was work today?",6
26771,Leonard,3," Ah, it was all right, I guess. Got to Heimlich a cherry stem out of Sheldon. Caught Raj right in the eye.",6
26772,Penny,3, Oh! You‰Ûªre kidding.,6
26773,Leonard,3," No, Raj had to go to the nurse.",6
26774,Penny,3, Wow. Anything else?,6
26775,Leonard,3," Mmm, the nurse is a woman, so he couldn‰Ûªt talk to her. She had to bring him a Grover puppet so he could point at what hurt.",6
26776,Penny,3," Oh, is that it?",6
26777,Leonard,3, Isn‰Ûªt that enough? It had the weaponised fruit and a puppet. What more do you want?,6
26778,Sheldon (arriving with Alex),3," Oh, good, Leonard, you‰Ûªre here. Science news. This will interest you. And, Penny, feel free to paint your nails.",6
26779,Leonard,3, What do you got?,6
26780,Sheldon,3, I believe Alex may have unearthed the grade school science project that could be my ticket to the Nobel Prize. Behold.,6
26781,Sheldon,3, The original title was ‰ÛÏA Rederivation of Maxwell‰Ûªs Equations Regarding Electromagnetism‰Û‰Û I dumbed it down because some of the more religious people in town were starting to say I was a witch.,6
26782,Alex,3, Sheldon thinks the approach in this paper might change the way we calculate ferromagnetic hysteresis.,6
26783,Penny,3," Oh, it‰Ûªs about time. I hated the old way. Hi. I‰Ûªm Penny.",6
26784,Alex,3," Alex. Uh, do you work with Dr. Hofstadter?",6
26785,Penny,3, In a way. We‰Ûªve kind of been involved in a five-year experiment.,6
26786,Alex,3," Oh. Well, you‰Ûªre lucky. He seems very talented. And I‰Ûªm sure a lot of people want to work with him.",6
26787,Penny,3," Well, a lot of people can‰Ûªt. Uh, hey.",6
26788,Leonard,3, Where are we going?,6
26789,Penny,3, My limbic system wants to take your pants off.,6
26790,Alex,3, She seems nice.,6
26791,Sheldon,3, Notice people on your own time. We‰Ûªre working.,6
26792,Scene,3, Webcam conversation between Bernadette‰Ûªs Office and the International Space Station,6
26793,Bernadette,3," Hey, Howie, how you feeling?",6
26794,Howard,3," Better. Much better. The other astronauts held me down, gave me a shot. Oooh. Attention, people of Earth. Tonight, there will be two moons in the sky.",6
26795,Bernadette,3," Howie, stop that. NASA‰Ûªs watching this! Put your pants back on!",6
26796,Howard,3, Whee! Whee!,6
26797,Scene,4, The Apartment.,6
26798,Raj,4, Howard‰Ûªs capsule should be re-entering the atmosphere any minute.,6
26799,Leonard,4, It‰Ûªll be good to have him back.,6
26800,Raj,4, The Fantastic Four reunited.,6
26801,Sheldon,4," Yeah, you had a good run, Fake Wolowitz. We‰Ûªll remember you with nostalgic fondness, the way we do the dial-up modem, the VHS tape, or, or Leonard‰Ûªs gym membership.",6
26802,Raj,4, We‰Ûªre not kicking him out. Stuart and I have become good friends.,6
26803,Sheldon,4," Okay, one vote for, one vote against. Leonard, you‰Ûªre the tiebreaker.",6
26804,Leonard,4," I don‰Ûªt have a problem with Stuart. Besides, he gives us a twenty percent discount at his comic book store.",6
26805,Sheldon,4," Well, I don‰Ûªt sell my friendship that cheaply.",6
26806,Stuart,4, I can go thirty.,6
26807,Sheldon,4," Welcome aboard, old chum.",6
26808,Raj,4," Okay, the NASA Web site says Howard‰Ûªs final descent has begun.",6
26809,Sheldon,4," He left a boy, he returns a boy-sized hero.",6
26810,Scene,4, The Soyuz Capsule. Howard is screaming.,6
26811,Dimitri,4," Loops, calm down!",6
26812,Howard (singing),4," Baruch atah, Adonai, Eloheinu. Melech haolam, hamotzi. Lechem min haaretz",6
26813,Mike,4, What‰Ûªs that?,6
26814,Howard,4, The Jewish prayer for eating bread! We don‰Ûªt have one for falling out of space! We did it! We‰Ûªre on the ground! We survived!,6
26815,Mike,4, That was just the parachute. We still have another six miles to go. (Howard screams again),6
26816,Scene,4, The Airport Arrivals Hall.,6
26817,Bernadette,4, Waiting for my husband.,6
26818,Man in Suit,4, That‰Ûªs nice.,6
26819,Bernadette,4, He‰Ûªs coming back from outer space.,6
26820,Man in Suit,4, I think this flight‰Ûªs coming from Houston.,6
26821,Bernadette,4," No, I mean, he‰Û_ Never mind. There he is! Howie!",6
26822,Various others (all at once),4, Howie! Howie!,6
26823,Howard,4," Whoa, thank you. Great to be back on Earth.",6
26824,Howie Mandel,4," Uh, I think they‰Ûªre here for me, Ringo.",6
26825,Man in Suit,4," Mr. Mandel, I‰Ûªm your driver.",6
26826,Howie Mandel,4," Oh, thanks. That nut job was telling everybody on the plane he‰Ûªs an astronaut.",6
26827,Bernadette,4, I missed you so much.,6
26828,Howard,4," I missed you, too. Where are the guys?",6
26829,Bernadette,4," Oh, it‰Ûªs just me.",6
26830,Howard,4," Oh, I get it. They‰Ûªre waiting back home with a big surprise party. Don‰Ûªt worry, I can act surprised. (Does)",6
26831,Bernadette,4," No, I told them they could have you tomorrow night. Tonight, you belong to me. (Sneezes) ",6
26832,Howard,4, Gesundheit. You okay?,6
26833,Bernadette,4," I am now that you‰Ûªre back. Come on, let‰Ûªs go home so I can tear off those little pants.",6
26834,Howard,4," Great. Just keep in mind astronauts lose a lot of muscle tone in space, so you might have to do most of the heavy lifting.",6
26835,Scene,4, The apartment. ,6
26836,Sheldon,4," You know, I am very disappointed that I won‰Ûªt be able to celebrate Howard‰Ûªs accomplishment tonight.",6
26837,Amy,4," Me, too. But we‰Ûªll see him tomorrow.",6
26838,Sheldon,4," Yes, it‰Ûªs just that in all the years I‰Ûªve known him, he‰Ûªs never had the opportunity to receive my admiration. I was excited to see the look on his face when it finally happened.",6
26839,Penny,4, You‰Ûªre unbelievable.,6
26840,Sheldon,4, I know.,6
26841,Leonard,4," All right, Pictionary. What are the teams?",6
26842,Penny,4, How about boys versus girls?,6
26843,Sheldon,4," Oh, that hardly seems fair. But I guess any team that I‰Ûªm not on has a decided disadvantage.",6
26844,Penny,4," Once again, unbelievable.",6
26845,Sheldon,4," Yeah, once again, I know.",6
26846,Penny,4," All right, round one. Here.",6
26847,Sheldon,4, Got it.,6
26848,Penny,4," Okay. Ready, set, go.",6
26849,Amy,4," Uh, box? Uh, window?",6
26850,Leonard,4," Batman. Batman and Robin. Uh, Wonder Twins plus the monkey. Wonder Twins plus the monkey and Batman.",6
26851,Amy,4," Uh, gift? Uh, Present!",6
26852,Penny,4, Present! Yeah!,6
26853,Sheldon,4," Oh, Leonard. Now, how can you not get that?",6
26854,Leonard,4, In what universe is that a present?,6
26855,Sheldon,4," It‰Ûªs not a present, it‰Ûªs the present. Look. There‰Ûªs you and me. There‰Ûªs Penny and Amy. We‰Ûªre playing Pictionary. In the present.",6
26856,Penny,4," Oh, my God, we‰Ûªre gonna kill them.",6
26857,Sheldon,4, It‰Ûªs a quark-gluon plasma.,6
26858,Leonard,4, No.,6
26859,Sheldon,4, It‰Ûªs asymptotically free partons inside a quark-gluon plasma.,6
26860,Leonard,4, Nothing with quarks.,6
26861,Sheldon,4, It‰Ûªs an observational rebuttal of the Lambda-CDM model of the universe.,6
26862,Leonard,4, No.,6
26863,Penny,4, It‰Ûªs a chocolate chip cookie.,6
26864,Amy,4, Yes.,6
26865,Leonard,4, How could you miss that?,6
26866,Sheldon,4," Hey, if you want someone to guess chocolate chip cookie, you draw a glass of milk next to it.",6
26867,Leonard,4, Penny got it.,6
26868,Sheldon,4," Yeah, only after I eliminated all the obvious answers. You‰Ûªre welcome.",6
26869,Leonard,4," Oh, uh, uh, uh, sausage. Uh, uh, uh, uh, bratwurst? Oh, oh, a hot dog.",6
26870,Amy,4," Penny, aren‰Ûªt you gonna draw something?",6
26871,Penny,4," Relax, we got time, this is so fun.",6
26872,Sheldon,4, There.,6
26873,Leonard,4," A solar system. Uh, uh, uh, uh, um, unidentified flying liverwurst? I don‰Ûªt‰Û_",6
26874,Amy,4, Now?,6
26875,Penny,4, Soon.,6
26876,Sheldon,4," Come on, Leonard, I am spoon-feeding this to you.",6
26877,Leonard,4," I don‰Ûªt know, uh, Casper the alcoholic ghost?",6
26878,Penny,4," All right, that‰Ûªs enough. (Draws)",6
26879,Amy,4," Uh, hand. Uh, nail, polish?",6
26880,Penny,4, Yep!,6
26881,Sheldon,4," Wait, no, no. No. The word is Polish. See, look. Polish sausage. And the, the model of the solar system developed by Nicolaus Copernicus, a Polish astronomer. And then, finally, if that wasn‰Ûªt enough, which it should have been, this is Madame Curie killing herself by discovering radium, who, although she was a naturalized French citizen, was Polish by birth.",6
26882,Penny,4," Excuse me, the word is polish. See? Small P.",6
26883,Sheldon,4, Ah. So it is. I guess we both share blame on this one.,6
26884,Scene,4, Howard and Bernadette‰Ûªs Bedroom.,6
26885,Howard,4," Bernie, you okay?",6
26886,Bernadette (off),4," Yeah, I‰Ûªll be right there. (Hacking and coughing noises)",6
26887,Howard,4, Did you get a sea lion while I was gone?,6
26888,Bernadette,4, It‰Ûªs just allergies.,6
26889,Howard,4, Okay.,6
26890,Bernadette,4," Took some Benadryl. I‰Ûªll be fine. So, did you miss me?",6
26891,Howard,4, Oh. Are you kidding? Every minute of every‰Û_,6
26892,Bernadette (has a coughing fit),4, Ew. Excuse me.,6
26893,Howard,4," Sweetie, we don‰Ûªt have to do this now.",6
26894,Bernadette,4," Yes, we do. You left right after we got married. This is like our honeymoon. Now, hold on to your hat. Oh. Uh-oh.",6
26895,Howard,4, You okay?,6
26896,Bernadette,4, A little dizzy. Must be the Benadryl. Switch places with me.,6
26897,Howard,4, Okay.,6
26898,Bernadette,4," Now, kiss me. (He does. She starts snoring)",6
26899,Howard,4, Bernadette? Bernie? Bernie?,6
26900,Bernadette (waking suddenly),4, That was amazing. You made me feel things I never‰Û_ (starts snoring again),6
26901,Howard,4," Well, that was quick, and a little gross. Now, I know how she feels.",6
26902,Scene,4, The apartment. ,6
26903,Penny,4," Hey, Sheldon, you‰Ûªre always full of fun little facts. Where did the expression got your ass handed to you come from?",6
26904,Sheldon,4, Don‰Ûªt know.,6
26905,Penny,4," I wonder if it‰Ûªs from, like, ancient Rome where they‰Ûªd actually chop somebody‰Ûªs ass off and then go, here. You know, to appease Loseroneous, the god of losers.",6
26906,Sheldon,4, I am not a loser. Pictionary is not a true test of any real intelligence or skill.,6
26907,Leonard,4," Mmm, in all fairness, Pictionary has verbal skills, visual skills. It‰Ûªs a pretty well-rounded game.",6
26908,Sheldon,4, Lot of big talk from a man who can‰Ûªt draw a chocolate chip cookie.,6
26909,Penny,4," All right, fine, pick another game. Amy and I will beat you at anything.",6
26910,Sheldon,4, All right. Let‰Ûªs play Physics Fiesta.,6
26911,Penny,4," Oh, come on, what is that?",6
26912,Sheldon,4," It‰Ûªs a game that I just invented, in which the participants answer physics questions in remedial Spanish. Um, åÀDÌ_nde estÌÁ el boson de Higgs?",6
26913,Leonard,4, En el acelerador de particulares.,6
26914,Sheldon,4," Bueno, mi amigo.",6
26915,Penny,4," No, no, we‰Ûªre not playing some dumb made-up game.",6
26916,Sheldon,4," All games are made up. They‰Ûªre not found in nature. You don‰Ûªt just dig in the ground, come across a rich vein of Rock‰Ûªem Sock‰Ûªem Robots.",6
26917,Leonard,4, Just pick another game.,6
26918,Amy,4, Why don‰Ûªt we do something athletic like go over to the university pool and play water polo?,6
26919,Leonard,4," No good, Sheldon doesn‰Ûªt float.",6
26920,Sheldon,4," That is true. I have a higher than normal body density. If I run too deep a bath, I drown.",6
26921,Amy,4," All right, let‰Ûªs keep it simple. How about darts?",6
26922,Sheldon,4," No, that‰Ûªs not fair either.",6
26923,Penny,4, Why not?,6
26924,Sheldon,4, Darts is a bar game. You‰Ûªve been frequenting drinking establishments since you were of legal age.,6
26925,Leonard,4," Yeah, that‰Ûªs when it started.",6
26926,Sheldon,4," Well, regardless, she has a distinct advantage in all tavern-based competitions. Pool, beer pong, wet T-shirt contests, they‰Ûªre all out.",6
26927,Penny,4," Okay. Just for the record, I have never entered a wet T-shirt contest. I‰Ûªve won a few, but that‰Ûªs just because I spill when I‰Ûªm drunk, so‰Û_",6
26928,Amy,4, We could go to the cadaver lab at UCLA and play real-life Operation.,6
26929,Sheldon,4, No.,6
26930,Leonard,4, Uh-uh.,6
26931,Penny,4, I don‰Ûªt think so.,6
26932,Amy,4," Are you sure? I mean, the nose doesn‰Ûªt light up, but if the corpse is fresh enough, sometimes you can get the leg to jerk.",6
26933,Scene,4, Mrs Wolowitz‰Ûªs House.,6
26934,Howard,4," Hey, Ma, twinkle, twinkle, your little star is home. Ma, the chain‰Ûªs on the door.",6
26935,Mrs Wolowitz (off),4, Howard? I thought I wasn‰Ûªt going to see you till tomorrow.,6
26936,Howard,4," Yeah, well, Bernie‰Ûªs not feeling well, so I thought I‰Ûªd stop by, tell you about the greatest adventure of my life, see if you can make me feel bad about it.",6
26937,Mrs Wolowitz (off),4," Uh, uh, okay, hold on, I‰Ûªm not decent.",6
26938,Howard,4, All right. Woman hasn‰Ûªt tied her robe in 20 years. Suddenly she‰Ûªs not decent?,6
26939,Man‰Ûªs Voice (off),4, You want me to hide in the closet or go out the back?,6
26940,Mrs Wolowitz (off),4," Shh, you need to whisper.",6
26941,Howard,4," Ma, who is in there?",6
26942,Mrs Wolowitz (off),4," Uh, nobody. The TV is on.",6
26943,Man‰Ûªs Voice (off),4, I only got one sock. Where‰Ûªs my other sock?,6
26944,Howard,4, Who is that?,6
26945,Mrs Wolowitz (off),4," I told you, it‰Ûªs the TV. Jay Leno lost a sock, it‰Ûªs hilarious.",6
26946,Howard,4," If you‰Ûªre busy, I can come back.",6
26947,Mrs Wolowitz (off),4," Just give me a second. Go, go, go, go.",6
26948,Howard (to man climbing out window),4, Dr. Schneider?,6
26949,Dr Schneider,4," Oh, hello, Howard.",6
26950,Howard,4, What are you doing here?,6
26951,Dr Schneider,4," Um, house call.",6
26952,Howard,4, You‰Ûªre a dentist.,6
26953,Dr Schneider,4," Yes, yes, I am. I think he‰Ûªs on to us.",6
26954,Scene,4, The apartment.,6
26955,Penny,4," Okay, glasses off. Find Waldo.",6
26956,Sheldon,4," Hurry up, find him, find him.",6
26957,Leonard,4, I‰Ûªm trying. Don‰Ûªt yell at me.,6
26958,Sheldon,4," For goodness‰Ûª sake, he‰Ûªs wearing a hat, glasses, and a red striped shirt.",6
26959,Leonard,4, I know what he looks like.,6
26960,Amy,4," Oh, there he is, I got him.",6
26961,Penny,4," Yes, we win again.",6
26962,Sheldon,4, How could you not find him?,6
26963,Leonard,4," Because he‰Ûªs hard to find. If he was easy to find, the books would be called There‰Ûªs Waldo.",6
26964,Leonard,4," 57, 58, 59, that‰Ûªs one minute.",6
26965,Amy,4," Long division, long division. Go, go, go.",6
26966,Leonard,4," Remember, show your work.",6
26967,Sheldon,4, I‰Ûªm okay. I‰Ûªm okay. I‰Ûªm not okay.,6
26968,Leonard,4," Get up, we can‰Ûªt lose at math.",6
26969,Penny,4,37,6
26970,Amy,4, Yes.,6
26971,Amy,4," Ready, set, wrestle. (Penny pins Sheldon straight away) One, two, three, pin.",6
26972,Penny,4, Mwah!,6
26973,Sheldon,4, Stop that.,6
26974,Penny,4, Mwah!,6
26975,Sheldon,4," Amy, do something. Amy, help. Amy, stop that. Amy, Penny, both of you, stop it.",6
26976,Scene,4, Raj‰Ûªs apartment.,6
26977,Howard,4, One to beam aboard?,6
26978,Raj,4," Oh, my God, you‰Ûªre back. Oh, look at you. You, you look like you grew.",6
26979,Howard,4," Yeah. The lack of gravity did decompress my spine, so I‰Ûªm like an inch and a half taller. I‰Ûªm going to the DMV tomorrow to get my license changed before I shrink back.",6
26980,Raj,4," Oh, uh, come in, come in. Oh, I, uh, I didn‰Ûªt think I was going to get to see you until tomorrow.",6
26981,Howard,4," Yeah, well, Bernadette‰Ûªs a little under the weather and my mom‰Ûªs kind of under my dentist.",6
26982,Raj,4," Wait, your, your mother is sleeping with your dentist?",6
26983,Howard,4, Former dentist. I need a new one now that I know where his hands have been.,6
26984,Raj,4, So you‰Ûªre wandering all around by yourself? That‰Ûªs not the kind of hero‰Ûªs welcome an astronaut should come home to.,6
26985,Howard,4," It‰Ûªs okay, you know, we space cowboys don‰Ûªt do what we do for glory and fame. We leave that to your rock stars and your athletes and your Howie Mandels.",6
26986,Stuart,4," Oh, hey, man, welcome back.",6
26987,Howard,4," Oh, Stuart, thanks. What are you doing here?",6
26988,Stuart,4," I, I kind of live here now.",6
26989,Raj,4," Just until he gets back on his feet, which are looking pretty good in the boots I bought him for his birthday.",6
26990,Stuart,4," Ah, he‰Ûªs spoiling me and I love it.",6
26991,Howard,4," Wow, so you guys are like buds now?",6
26992,Raj,4," Oh, yeah, we hang out all the time.",6
26993,Stuart,4," Plus, he doesn‰Ûªt have a girlfriend, I don‰Ûªt have a girlfriend.",6
26994,Raj,4," It‰Ûªs like we both had these holes in our lives, but now we fill each other‰Ûªs holes.",6
26995,Stuart,4," Uh, that sounds a little funny to an American ear.",6
26996,Raj,4, Which part?,6
26997,Stuart,4, Just all of it.,6
26998,Howard,4," Okay, so what do you guys got going on tonight?",6
26999,Stuart,4, Raj is taking me to the Sound of Music sing-along.,6
27000,Howard,4," Sound of Music sing-along? That used to be our thing, but that‰Ûªs cool.",6
27001,Raj,4," Oh, Howard, it‰Ûªs still our thing. Come with us, we‰Ûªll, we‰Ûªll get you a scalped ticket.",6
27002,Howard,4, So I‰Ûªd be sitting by myself?,6
27003,Raj,4, We‰Ûªll switch. You‰Ûªll come sit with me after intermission.,6
27004,Stuart,4," So I, I, I‰Ûªd be sitting by myself during Edelweiss?",6
27005,Howard,4," No, no, you guys go. Have fun.",6
27006,Raj,4," Okay, uh, will I get to see you tomorrow?",6
27007,Howard,4," Absolutely. See you, Stuart.",6
27008,Stuart,4," Yeah, yeah. Is he taller?",6
27009,Howard,4, At least my mother made her boyfriend climb out the window.,6
27010,Scene,4, The apartment. ,6
27011,Penny,4," All right, standard state fair pie-eating contest rules are, no hands, first one to clean the pan wins.",6
27012,Amy,4," On the count of three. One, two‰Û_",6
27013,Sheldon,4, Wait. I‰Ûªm a little concerned. Blueberries are rich in antioxidants.,6
27014,Leonard,4, So?,6
27015,Sheldon,4," So, with all those antioxidants, what if I run out of oxidants?",6
27016,Leonard,4," Sheldon, we haven‰Ûªt won a game all night. Now, you either stick your face in that pie or I‰Ûªm gonna stick that pie in your face.",6
27017,Sheldon,4, That‰Ûªs rude.,6
27018,Amy,4," One, two, three, eat.",6
27019,Howard,4," Hey, guys, guess who‰Ûªs back from space.",6
27020,All,4, Not now!,6
27021,Sheldon,4," Oh, ow, blueberry in my nose, blueberry in my nose!",6
27022,Leonard,4, Snort it down and keep eating!,6
27023,Scene,4, A diner.,6
27024,Waitress,4, You look familiar.,6
27025,Howard,4, I don‰Ûªt think so.,6
27026,Waitress,4," Yeah, I just saw you on the news. You‰Ûªre an astronaut.",6
27027,Howard,4," Yes. Yes, I am.",6
27028,Waitress,4, Good for you. How about a piece of cheesecake on the house?,6
27029,Howard,4," Oh, thank you so much. I‰Ûªve been having the worst night. I just got back, and my friends don‰Ûªt care, my wife‰Ûªs sick, I went to my mom‰Û_",6
27030,Waitress,4, You want the cheesecake or not?,6
27031,Howard,4," Yes, please. (Sings) And I think it‰Ûªs gonna be long, long time till touchdown brings me ‰Ûªround again to find I‰Ûªm not the man they think I am at home, oh, no, oh, no, I‰Ûªm a rocket man. (Sneezes) Perfect.",6
27032,Scene,5, The Comic Book Store,6
27033,Howard,5," Oh, hey, Stuart, I got you a little souvenir from my trip to space.",6
27034,Stuart,5," Well, Howard, that‰Ûªs very nice of you.",6
27035,Leonard,5," Yeah, maybe. Open it first.",6
27036,Howard,5, It‰Ûªs my official NASA portrait.,6
27037,Stuart,5," To Stuart, your comic book store is out of this world. Just like the guy in this picture was.‰Û",6
27038,Sheldon,5," For the record, he also thinks the Walgreens and the dry cleaners are out of this world.",6
27039,Howard,5, That‰Ûªs not true. At the Walgreens I was over the moon for their store-brand antacids.,6
27040,Raj,5," Hey, Stuart, I see you‰Ûªre getting ready for your Halloween party.",6
27041,Stuart,5," Yeah, it‰Ûªs my annual attempt to meet women. Ninth time‰Ûªs the charm.",6
27042,Raj,5, Would you like me to help? I do have a certain je ne sais quois when it comes to soirees.,6
27043,Stuart,5," Thanks, but I can‰Ûªt afford je ne sais quois. How much for just quois?",6
27044,Raj,5," You know, you don‰Ûªt worry about money. I‰Ûªll take care of everything.",6
27045,Stuart,5, Really?,6
27046,Raj,5," Yeah, you‰Ûªll love it. Ain‰Ûªt no party like a Koothra-party.",6
27047,Howard,5," But you know what wasn‰Ûªt a party? That hotel in Kazakhstan they put you up in before the launch. I mean, it‰Ûªs your last night on Earth. You‰Ûªd think you‰Ûªd get one porn channel.",6
27048,Leonard,5, Have you noticed that Howard can take any topic and use it to remind you that he went to space?,6
27049,Sheldon,5," Interesting hypothesis. Let‰Ûªs apply the scientific method, perform an experiment.",6
27050,Leonard,5," Okay. Hey, Howard, any thoughts on where we should get dinner?",6
27051,Howard,5," Anywhere but the Space Station. On a good day, dinner was a bag full of meat loaf. But, hey, you don‰Ûªt go there for the food, you go there for the view.",6
27052,Sheldon,5," It‰Ûªs fascinating. Let me see if I can duplicate the result. Howard, I‰Ûªve always thought the lemon was an underrated fruit. Care to weigh in?",6
27053,Howard,5, Not really.,6
27054,Sheldon,5," Oh, well.",6
27055,Howard,5," You know, people say the Soyuz capsule was a lemon. But, hey, that baby got me to space and back.",6
27056,Scene,5, The Cheesecake Factory Bar,6
27057,Amy,5, Ladies night at the Cheesecake Factory. Does it get any better than this?,6
27058,Penny,5, I hope so.,6
27059,Amy,5, Question. Do you think your husband‰Ûªs fondness for turtlenecks is an expression of longing for his missing foreskin?,6
27060,Penny,5, It‰Ûªs not getting any better. (Text tone) Ugh. It‰Ûªs Leonard. He wants to go costume shopping later.,6
27061,Bernadette,5, I thought you liked Halloween.,6
27062,Penny,5," I do, it‰Ûªs just he wants to go to that party at the comic book store. A lot of the guys that hang out there are kind of creepy.",6
27063,Bernadette,5, Like my husband?,6
27064,Amy,5, And my boyfriend?,6
27065,Penny,5," I‰Ûªm, I‰Ûªm sorry, Amy. You were saying something about Howard‰Ûªs foreskin?",6
27066,Bernadette,5," Nice try, but you have to go to that party because we‰Ûªre going.",6
27067,Penny,5," Yeah, I‰Ûªm gonna go. It‰Ûªs just not my idea of a good time.",6
27068,Bernadette,5, Leonard does thing he doesn‰Ûªt like to make you happy.,6
27069,Penny,5," Well, yeah, he‰Ûªs my boyfriend. Isn‰Ûªt that, like, his job?",6
27070,Amy,5, Then what‰Ûªs your job?,6
27071,Penny,5, Letting him make me happy.,6
27072,Bernadette,5, I just think in relationships you get back what you put into them.,6
27073,Amy,5," That‰Ûªs not always true. Last night I gave Sheldon my best come-hither look, and he responded by explaining how wheat came to be cultivated.",6
27074,Penny,5, I guess I could probably try a little harder.,6
27075,Bernadette,5, You could start by taking an interest in his work.,6
27076,Penny,5," Yeah, that‰Ûªs kind of a problem.",6
27077,Amy,5, Why?,6
27078,Penny,5, Not really clear on what he does.,6
27079,Bernadette,5, He‰Ûªs an experimental physicist.,6
27080,Penny,5," Yeah, I‰Ûªm not really clear on what that means.",6
27081,Amy,5, He takes hypotheses and designs protocols to determine their accuracy.,6
27082,Penny,5," Yeah, you‰Ûªre really just making it worse.",6
27083,Scene,5, The apartment.,6
27084,Sheldon,5, What kind of tea would you like?,6
27085,Amy,5, I think I‰Ûªm gonna try green tea mixed with lemon zinger.,6
27086,Sheldon,5, Two tea bags in one cup? You‰Ûªre not at a rave.,6
27087,Amy,5," So, listen, Sheldon, I was thinking, since this is gonna be our first Halloween party as boyfriend and girlfriend, I thought it might be fun for us to go in a couples costume.",6
27088,Sheldon,5, I couldn‰Ûªt agree more.,6
27089,Amy,5, Really? I find that inconsistent with everything I know about you.,6
27090,Sheldon,5," Oh, oh, on the contrary. Couples costumes are one of the few benefits of being in a relationship. Now imagine this, you and I entering Stuart‰Ûªs party and all eyes turn to see America‰Ûªs most beloved and glamorous couple.",6
27091,Amy,5, Yeah?,6
27092,Sheldon,5, R2-D2 and C-3PO. Dibs on Threepio.,6
27093,Amy,5," Sheldon, when I said couples costume, I meant like Romeo and Juliet or Cinderella and Prince Charming, not two robots from some silly movie I don‰Ûªt even like.",6
27094,Sheldon,5," Okay, I‰Ûªm gonna let that slide because I know you‰Ûªre hopped up on tea bags.",6
27095,Amy,5," I make compromises for you all the time. Just this once, can‰Ûªt we find something that we‰Ûªre both happy with?",6
27096,Sheldon,5, Fine. How about one of the most beguiling and influential couples of the 20th century? Hewlett and Packard. Dibs on Hewlett. What? You want to be Hewlett?,6
27097,Scene,5, Leonard‰Ûªs laboratory.,6
27098,Penny,5, Anybody home?,6
27099,Leonard,5," Hey, what are you doing here?",6
27100,Penny,5, I just thought I‰Ûªd stop by and say hello.,6
27101,Leonard,5," Oh, what a nice surprise. I don‰Ûªt think you‰Ûªve ever seen my lab before.",6
27102,Penny,5," No, I know. It‰Ûªs long overdue. So, what ya doing? Better not be building a robot girlfriend.",6
27103,Leonard,5, No. Although Howard was making some real strides in that area until he met Bernadette.,6
27104,Penny,5, You‰Ûªre kidding.,6
27105,Leonard,5, Nope. Now the Lisatronic 3000 just sits in a box waiting for the phone to ring.,6
27106,Penny,5, Ooh! What‰Ûªs going on in here?,6
27107,Leonard,5," Oh, no, no, no, don‰Ûªt look in there.",6
27108,Penny,5," What, is it secret?",6
27109,Leonard,5," No, it‰Ûªs a nitrogen laser. It‰Ûªll cook your eyeball like a soft-boiled egg.",6
27110,Penny,5, Oh. You might want to put a sign on it.,6
27111,Leonard,5, Sign right there.,6
27112,Penny,5," Ah. Danger. Sure, sure. Yeah. What‰Ûªs, what‰Ûªs that?",6
27113,Leonard,5," Uh, that is an integrated ion trap and time-of-flight mass spectrometer.",6
27114,Penny,5, Wow. High-techie-techie. What‰Ûªs this little box?,6
27115,Leonard,5, That is a pencil sharpener.,6
27116,Penny,5," Ooh, low-techie-techie. So, what are you working on right now?",6
27117,Leonard,5, It‰Ûªs actually pretty neat.,6
27118,Penny,5, Yeah?,6
27119,Leonard,5," Yeah. It‰Ûªs a front-projected holographic display combined with laser-based finger tracking. Here, I‰Ûªll show you. We‰Ûªll just put this pencil over here.",6
27120,Penny,5, Sharp. Thanks to the machine we saw earlier.,6
27121,Leonard,5," Very good. And then a laser will map the reflective surface, and voila. (A floating 3D image of the pencil appears. Leonard moves it around with his finger)",6
27122,Penny,5, Wow. That is amazing.,6
27123,Leonard,5," You know, there‰Ûªs a foundational idea in string theory that the whole universe may be a hologram.",6
27124,Penny,5, What do you mean? (Leonard flicks a switch. The hologram changes to a view of the planet Earth). Oh! Wow!,6
27125,Leonard,5," Uh-huh. Well, the holographic principle suggests that what we all experience every day in three dimensions may really (changes view to solar system) just be information (changes view to the galaxy) on a surface located at the farthest reaches of our cosmos. (Starts the galaxy spinning) So it‰Ûªs possible that our lives are really just acting out a painting on the largest canvas in the universe.",6
27126,Penny,5, Hmm.,6
27127,Leonard,5, What?,6
27128,Penny,5, Sometimes I forget how smart you are.,6
27129,Leonard,5, You should visit more often. What are you doing?,6
27130,Penny,5, Take off your clothes.,6
27131,Leonard,5, What? Here? Now?,6
27132,Penny,5, Yeah. You got a problem with that?,6
27133,Leonard,5," No, no. It‰Ûªs kind of crazy. I‰Ûªve never fooled around in the lab before.",6
27134,Penny,5, Really? Never?,6
27135,Leonard,5," No. I did have a shot with the Lisatronic, but the extension cord wasn‰Ûªt long enough.",6
27136,Scene,5, The cafeteria.,6
27137,Raj,5," Before I forget, I‰Ûªd like your opinion on the menus I‰Ûªve prepared for the Halloween party. The theme is food that goes bump in the night.",6
27138,Howard,5, Creature from the Black Forest Ham Lagoon.,6
27139,Raj,5, On Sesame seed Bunzillas.,6
27140,Sheldon,5, Night of the Living Garlic Bread?,6
27141,Raj,5, It‰Ûªs funny because bread sounds like dead.,6
27142,Sheldon,5," I‰Ûªm sorry, but these are just ordinary foods with the names bent into tortured puns. The dishes themselves are in no way Halloweenie.",6
27143,Raj,5," Ooh, Hallow-weenies! That‰Ûªs a good one. They‰Ûªll pair nicely with my Draculoni and Cheese. How do I do it?",6
27144,Howard,5," That reminds me, I was thinking about wearing my NASA jumpsuit as a costume. But then I realized everyone would be, like, where‰Ûªs your costume? Why are you wearing your work clothes, you nut?",6
27145,Leonard,5," Hello, boys.",6
27146,Sheldon,5, What are you smiling at?,6
27147,Leonard,5, Nothing.,6
27148,Howard,5, You know where‰Ûªs there‰Ûªs a lot of nothing.,6
27149,All,5, Space.,6
27150,Scene,5, Howard and Bernadette‰Ûªs bedroom.,6
27151,Howard,5," Boy, it‰Ûªs nice to sleep in a bed with gravity again. Did I tell you about the night my retainer floated out of my mouth and into the air lock?",6
27152,Bernadette,5," Yeah, you mentioned it once or twice.",6
27153,Howard,5," So, here we are, just a couple of young newlyweds. What to do? What to do to you? Astronaut Wolowitz, reporting for booty. Preparing thrusters. We have liftoff. Are we clear to jettison that nightgown?",6
27154,Bernadette,5," Okay, we need to talk.",6
27155,Howard,5, What?,6
27156,Bernadette,5," Howie, I know you went to space. I‰Ûªm incredibly proud of you. But you might want to try and not bring it up every minute.",6
27157,Howard,5, I don‰Ûªt talk about it every minute.,6
27158,Bernadette,5, Tonight at dinner you went on bout it for an hour straight.,6
27159,Howard,5, What was I supposed to talk about? We were eating at Johnny Rockets.,6
27160,Bernadette,5," I‰Ûªm just saying, people are getting a little tired of it.",6
27161,Howard,5," So, I did this amazing thing and I‰Ûªm never allowed to mention it?",6
27162,Bernadette,5, Of course you can. But maybe a good rule would be to wait for people to bring it up.,6
27163,Howard,5," Okay, no problem. It won‰Ûªt happen again.",6
27164,Bernadette,5, I love you.,6
27165,Howard,5," I love you, too. I can‰Ûªt tell you how many times I dreamed I was in bed here with you when I was‰Û_ you know. What, I can‰Ûªt even point?",6
27166,Scene,5, Leonard‰Ûªs lab.,6
27167,Leonard,5," So, basically, this is what‰Ûªs called mag-lev technology. It uses very powerful electromagnets to create a force strong enough to overcome gravity. Here, you hold this.",6
27168,Penny,5, Whoa! That‰Ûªs heavy.,6
27169,Leonard,5," Yeah. Oh, uh, you don‰Ûªt have on any jewellery, do you?",6
27170,Penny,5, No. Why?,6
27171,Leonard,5, A grad student forgot to take out one of his piercings. Now he‰Ûªs on a transplant list waiting for a nipple his size. Now watch this.,6
27172,Penny,5, Whoa! That is very cool.,6
27173,Leonard,5, Sometimes I like to turn this on and pretend I‰Ûªm the super villain Magneto.,6
27174,Penny,5," Getting a little less cool, Leonard.",6
27175,Leonard,5, But what I really am is a very smart scientist who understands the mechanics of the universe and is wearing the sexy black underwear you bought him.,6
27176,Penny,5, There we go.,6
27177,Scene,5, The cafeteria.,6
27178,Raj,5," So, I thought the photo booth for the party could either be creepy like a mummy‰Ûªs tomb, or they also have the Tardis from Doctor Who.",6
27179,Sheldon,5," A Tardis makes no sense. It‰Ûªs a time machine from a science-fiction show. It has nothing to do with Halloween. That being said, if you don‰Ûªt get a Tardis, you stink and your party stinks.",6
27180,Raj,5, Do you have a preference?,6
27181,Howard,5, I don‰Ûªt care. Get the Tardis.,6
27182,Sheldon,5, Yes! This party just became a major rager.,6
27183,Raj,5," Oh, by the way, can I borrow your bullwhip and fedora?",6
27184,Howard,5," Yeah, sure, whatever.",6
27185,Raj,5, I was thinking of dressing up as Indiana Jones‰Ûª mocha-skinned love child. Indian Jones.,6
27186,Howard,5, Clever.,6
27187,Raj,5, What‰Ûªs wrong with you?,6
27188,Howard,5, Nothing.,6
27189,Raj,5," Oh, Howard, I‰Ûªve got a party to plan. Don‰Ûªt make me pull it out of you.",6
27190,Howard,5," Okay, here it is. Bernadette said you guys are all sick of me talking about my trip to space. Is that true?",6
27191,Sheldon,5, Yes.,6
27192,Raj,5, No.,6
27193,Sheldon,5, We seem to have different approaches here. I was going for helpful honesty. I have no idea what you‰Ûªre doing.,6
27194,Raj,5, It‰Ûªs called being nice.,6
27195,Sheldon,5," Okay. If you think being nice will get him to shut up, I‰Ûªll try it.",6
27196,Howard,5," You know what, guys? Never mind. I just won‰Ûªt talk about the greatest achievement of my life ever again.",6
27197,Sheldon,5," Look at that, the problem solved itself.",6
27198,Leonard,5," Hello, boys.",6
27199,Scene,5, The apartment.,6
27200,Sheldon,5, What if we were to go as dinner table favourites salt and pepper?,6
27201,Amy,5, You know salt makes me retain water and my cousin William was ground to death in a pepper factory accident. How about Raggedy Ann and Andy? I loved them growing up.,6
27202,Sheldon,5," No, I don‰Ûªt think so. Those dolls represent three things I do not care for, clowns, children and raggediness. I think it‰Ûªs a lost cause.",6
27203,Amy,5," No. There are certain things that say to the world, I have a boyfriend, and he‰Ûªs not made up. Matching costumes, hickeys and sex tapes. Pick one.",6
27204,Sheldon,5, What‰Ûªs a hickey?,6
27205,Scene,5, Howard and Bernadette‰Ûªs bedroom. Howard and Bernadette are dressed as smurfs.,6
27206,Bernadette,5, How do I look?,6
27207,Howard,5, Fine.,6
27208,Bernadette,5," Uh-oh, is someone a little blue? Come on, Howie, that‰Ûªs like the funniest thing I‰Ûªve ever said in my life. What do you say? You ready to go?",6
27209,Howard,5," To tell you the truth, I‰Ûªm not really in the mood.",6
27210,Bernadette,5, What are you talking about? It‰Ûªll be fun. All your friends‰Ûªll be there.,6
27211,Howard,5," Yeah, some friends. They all think I‰Ûªm boring. Maybe you should go without me.",6
27212,Bernadette,5," No, if I‰Ûªm there alone, people might think I‰Ûªm just a really short person from Avatar.",6
27213,Howard,5, I‰Ûªm sorry. I just don‰Ûªt want to go.,6
27214,Bernadette,5," Hey, I just spent the last three hours colouring myself blue. I‰Ûªm gonna be washing paint out of my Smurf for a month.",6
27215,Howard,5, Fine. Two weeks ago I was an astronaut.,6
27216,Bernadette,5," Yeah, well, now you‰Ûªre a Smurf. Keep walking.",6
27217,Scene,5, The comic book store.,6
27218,Penny,5," Oh, my God, you guys look adorable.",6
27219,Bernadette,5," Thanks, so do you. Slutty cop?",6
27220,Penny,5," No, sexy cop. Slutty cop only came with a skirt and two badges.",6
27221,Bernadette,5, And Albert Einstein?,6
27222,Leonard,5," Ja, und later she‰Ûªs going to arrest me for goink fashter zen da shpeed of light.",6
27223,Penny,5," I thought we said in the car, no accents?",6
27224,Leonard,5," Sorry, Officer.",6
27225,Girl dressed as a Witch,5, Hello. It‰Ûªs a great party.,6
27226,Stuart,5, Thank you.,6
27227,Witch,5," The monster foods, they‰Ûªre really fun.",6
27228,Stuart,5," Oh, yes, thank you. I like to think of fun things like that because I‰Ûªm fun. I‰Ûªm not clinically depressed at all.",6
27229,Amy,5," Sheldon, get in here.",6
27230,Sheldon,5, I should‰Ûªve picked hickey.,6
27231,Stuart,5," Hey, hey, look at you guys!",6
27232,Amy,5," I‰Ûªm Raggedy Ann, and he‰Ûªs Raggedy C-3PO.",6
27233,Sheldon,5, It was a compromise. I lost.,6
27234,Raj,5, Can you believe Stuart‰Ûªs walking around taking credit for this party?,6
27235,Howard,5, Who cares?,6
27236,Raj,5," What do you mean who cares? Look at what I pulled off here. The DJ‰Ûªs on fire, there‰Ûªs a Tardis photo booth in the back room, and, oh, my God, the food. Stuart wanted Kraft Draculoni and cheese.",6
27237,Howard,5," You‰Ûªre right, the party‰Ûªs fantastic. Please, tell me more. I haven‰Ûªt heard enough about it all week because hearing about that never gets old.",6
27238,Raj,5, Is this about the space thing again?,6
27239,Howard,5," Well, I‰Ûªm not allowed to talk about it, but since you brought it up, I went to space! Space, space! Space! Space, space! Space!",6
27240,Bernadette,5," Whoa, Drinky Smurf. Can I talk to you for a second?",6
27241,Howard,5," Great, now I‰Ûªm in trouble. You happy?",6
27242,Bernadette,5," You, out! You are being very rude.",6
27243,Howard,5," No, I‰Ûªm not. They‰Ûªre all being rude. And you‰Ûªre being rude.",6
27244,Bernadette,5, Me? What did I do?,6
27245,Howard (in a squeaky voice),5," Oh, Howie, stop talking about space so much. Nobody likes it.",6
27246,Bernadette (in a gruff voice),5, I don‰Ûªt sound like that.,6
27247,Howard,5, You‰Ûªre my wife. You‰Ûªre supposed to be on my side.,6
27248,Bernadette,5, I‰Ûªm always on your side.,6
27249,Howard,5," Then why are you trying to take this away from me? Being an astronaut is the coolest thing I‰Ûªm ever gonna do. If I stop talking about it, then I‰Ûªm just‰Û_",6
27250,Bernadette,5, Just what?,6
27251,Howard,5, Just plain old Howard Wolowitz again.,6
27252,Bernadette,5, Plain old Howard Wolowitz is the best guy I know.,6
27253,Howard,5, You‰Ûªre just saying that.,6
27254,Bernadette,5," No, I‰Ûªm not. I married him. On purpose. Come here.",6
27255,Howard,5, I love you.,6
27256,Bernadette,5," I love you, too.",6
27257,Penny (emerging from Tardis),5, Nothing to see here. Just sexy police business.,6
27258,Leonard,5, Just explaining the theory of relativity. Twice.,6
27259,Scene,5, Howard and Bernadette‰Ûªs bedroom.,6
27260,Bernadette,5," Hey, what you watching?",6
27261,Howard,5, I don‰Ûªt know. Raj sent me some video of Buzz Aldrin.,6
27262,"Buzz (on video, handing Halloween candy to children)",5, Here you go. It‰Ûªs a Milky Way. The Milky Way‰Ûªs a galaxy in space. I‰Ûªve been in space. Here‰Ûªs a Mars bar. I‰Ûªm an astronaut. And this one‰Ûªs a Moon Pie. I walked on the Moon. What have you done?,6
27263,Howard,5," Okay, I get it.",6
27264,Scene,6, A dance video game where the characters are imperial stormtroopers from Star Wars and Bobba Fett. Opens onto the apartment where Howard and Raj are dancing to the game.,6
27265,Raj,6," Try to keep up, Howard, I‰Ûªm killing it.",6
27266,Howard,6," Yeah, I wish we looked as cool dancing in clubs as we do right now.",6
27267,Leonard,6," Don‰Ûªt worry, this is exactly how you look when you‰Ûªre dancing in clubs.",6
27268,Raj,6," You‰Ûªre welcome, ladies.",6
27269,Sheldon,6," Paradigm-shifting news, gentlemen. (Switches game off)",6
27270,Raj,6, Dude! I was about to Bollywood this bitch.,6
27271,Sheldon,6," Earlier today, I invited Professor Stephen Hawking to join me in the popular online game Words with Friends. Moments ago, he accepted my request. Do you understand what that means?",6
27272,Howard,6," That somewhere right now Stephen Hawking is saying, damn it, I meant to click no.‰Û",6
27273,Sheldon,6," I‰Ûªll walk you through it. The game is not called Words with Strangers. No, it‰Ûªs not even called Words with Acquaintances. It is called Words with‰Û_",6
27274,Raj,6, I‰Ûªm not finishing your sentence. You pulled the plug on my funk.,6
27275,Sheldon,6," Friends! It‰Ûªs Words with Friends! Which Stephen Hawking and I officially are. Now all I need is a bunk bed with a slide, I‰Ûªll have everything I‰Ûªve ever wanted since I was six years old.",6
27276,Leonard,6," That‰Ûªs really nice, Sheldon, I‰Ûªm happy for you.",6
27277,Sheldon,6," And I‰Ûªm happy for you, too. You are now friends with someone who is officially friends with Stephen Hawking. Enjoy it, boys. You may have peaked.",6
27278,Howard,6," Sheldon, I know Stephen Hawking. I worked with him.",6
27279,Sheldon,6," And if they ever come out with a game called Words with People You Once Worked With, you‰Ûªll be off to the races.",6
27280,Leonard,6," Sheldon, I don‰Ûªt think this actually means‰Û_",6
27281,Sheldon,6," Hold that thought! Professor Hawking has made a move. Boy, oh, boy. Oh, it‰Ûªs only a matter of time before we‰Ûªre coming up with fun nicknames for each other. I‰Ûªll be Coop. He‰Ûªll be Wheels. If he‰Ûªs okay with that. (Leaves)",6
27282,Raj (putting game back on and removing shirt),6," All right. Crank up the AC, boys, it‰Ûªs gonna get hot in here!",6
27283,Scene,6, Penny‰Ûªs apartment.,6
27284,Bernadette,6," So, I was taking a shower this morning, and when I got out, I started to dry off with what I thought was a towel but turned out to be Howard‰Ûªs mom‰Ûªs underwear. I had to take another shower. It wasn‰Ûªt enough. Nothing will ever be enough.",6
27285,Amy,6, I once looked in Sheldon‰Ûªs underwear drawer. He yelled at me. But now I know what it looks like and he can never take that away.,6
27286,Bernadette,6, There‰Ûªs a book under here.,6
27287,Penny,6," Oh, I‰Ûªll get that.",6
27288,Bernadette,6, I got it.,6
27289,Penny,6," No, no, it‰Ûªs‰Û_",6
27290,Bernadette,6, I got it. Why do you have a history textbook?,6
27291,Penny,6," No, it‰Ûªs not a big deal. Just taking a class at the Pasadena Community College.",6
27292,Bernadette,6, That‰Ûªs great. I didn‰Ûªt know you wanted to go back to school.,6
27293,Penny,6," It‰Ûªs just one history class. Look, I didn‰Ûªt finish college, so I thought I would give it a try.",6
27294,Amy,6," Not to mention, your acting career is going south like Sherman. Read about it in your book.",6
27295,Bernadette,6, Why would you be embarrassed to tell us?,6
27296,Penny,6," No, I‰Ûªm not embarrassed. I just didn‰Ûªt want anyone to know because I haven‰Ûªt told Leonard yet.",6
27297,Amy,6, Why wouldn‰Ûªt you tell Leonard?,6
27298,Penny,6," Because it‰Ûªs me going back to school, and he‰Ûªs gonna be all ‰ÛÏyou can do it,‰Û and ‰ÛÏhow can I help?‰Û and ‰ÛÏI‰Ûªm so proud of you.‰Û Ugh!",6
27299,Bernadette,6, I just can‰Ûªt believe you could keep something like that from him.,6
27300,Amy,6, You guys have got to be the weirdest couple I know.,6
27301,Penny,6, Really? You can‰Ûªt think of anyone weirder?,6
27302,Amy,6," I can, but she‰Ûªs sitting right there.",6
27303,Scene,6, Amy‰Ûªs laboratory.,6
27304,Sheldon,6," Yes. I play the word quiver with a triple letter and a double word score for 72 points. That ought to let the air out of your tyres, Hawking.",6
27305,Amy,6," Wow, my boyfriend is friends with Stephen Hawking and my new dandruff shampoo doesn‰Ûªt smell like tar. Everything really is coming up Amy.",6
27306,Sheldon,6, It is glorious. One of the greatest intellects of our time has agreed to engage with me in a gentlemanly battle of wits. And I‰Ûªm spanking him so hard his grad students won‰Ûªt be able to sit down.,6
27307,Amy,6," You know, when one male dominates another, his testosterone level rises.",6
27308,Sheldon,6, What‰Ûªs your point?,6
27309,Amy,6, It‰Ûªs exciting to think you might be getting a testosterone level.,6
27310,Sheldon,6," Ooh, my friend Stephen just played the word act for 18 points. That‰Ûªs right, I call him Stephen now, because I checked, and he was not okay with Wheels.",6
27311,Amy,6," Oh, you could turn his act into extract (pronounced with emphasis on act), and it would be for double points.",6
27312,Sheldon,6," Amy. Why would you give me a word? Now, if I play extract it would be cheating.",6
27313,Amy,6, Sorry.,6
27314,Sheldon,6," Although, I could play the completely unrelated and better word extract (pronounced with emphasis on ex). Ethical conundrum avoided. Thanks, brain.",6
27315,Scene,6, Penny‰Ûªs apartment.,6
27316,Penny,6, Spaghetti okay?,6
27317,Leonard,6, It‰Ûªs crunchy. Just the way I like it.,6
27318,Penny,6," Yeah, I don‰Ûªt think the water was really boiling.",6
27319,Leonard,6, It‰Ûªs great. I love it.,6
27320,Penny,6," Okay, listen, there‰Ûªs something I need to tell you. I‰Ûªve been thinking about going back to school for a while now. So a couple months ago, I started taking a history class at the community college.",6
27321,Leonard,6," Oh. That‰Ûªs great. Great, great, great. Why wait so long to tell me?",6
27322,Penny,6, I don‰Ûªt want you to make a big deal out of it.,6
27323,Leonard,6," Why do you think I‰Ûªd be like that? I get it, you‰Ûªre taking one class. It‰Ûªs nice. Maybe if it goes well, you take another, you enrol full-time. Ooh, be sure to keep an eye on which credits transfer to a four-year college.",6
27324,Penny,6, You‰Ûªre making it a big deal.,6
27325,Leonard,6, Sorry. Whatever. It‰Ûªs all good.,6
27326,Penny,6," Anyway, that‰Ûªs it. I just thought you should know.",6
27327,Leonard,6, Am I allowed to ask how the class is going?,6
27328,Penny,6, It‰Ûªs really good. We‰Ûªve been talking about the origins of slavery. Turn in my first paper tomorrow.,6
27329,Leonard,6," Great topic. I can help with that. There are lots of different perspectives you can take, economic, sociological, political.",6
27330,Penny,6," Hey hey hey, this is my paper. And my perspective is that slavery is bad. Oh, and my professor‰Ûªs black, so I‰Ûªm pretty sure that‰Ûªs the right answer.",6
27331,Leonard,6, Can I take a look?,6
27332,Penny,6," No, Leonard, this is my thing.",6
27333,Leonard,6," Okay, I get it.",6
27334,Penny,6, Thank you.,6
27335,Leonard,6," It‰Ûªs like when I started doing chin-ups, I didn‰Ûªt want you to see until I could do one. FYI, really close.",6
27336,Penny,6," Thank you. Now behave yourself and eat your dinner. Maybe later, if you‰Ûªre lucky, you get to sleep with a college girl.",6
27337,Leonard,6," Really? ‰Û÷Cause I went to four years of college and five years of grad school, that never happened once.",6
27338,Scene,6, The apartment.,6
27339,Raj,6," I think the next time I have to speak to a call centre in India, I‰Ûªm going to try using an American accent.",6
27340,Howard,6, Why?,6
27341,Raj,6," Because when I use my regular voice, I feel like I‰Ûªm making fun of them.",6
27342,Howard,6," That‰Ûªs ridiculous. Not to mention, your American accent is terrible.",6
27343,Raj,6," Dude, my accent is brilliant. (In American accent) Hey, my snow-white American friends, let‰Ûªs put some cow meat on the barbecue and eat it until we‰Ûªre all obese.",6
27344,Howard,6," This is what you sound like. I think I‰Ûªm talking in an American accent, but it really sounds like I‰Ûªm wearing a set of giant dentures.",6
27345,Raj,6," Sheldon, do I really sound like that?",6
27346,Howard,6, Tell him he sounds like that.,6
27347,Raj,6," Sheldon, you okay?",6
27348,Sheldon,6, It‰Ûªs been three days. Why hasn‰Ûªt Stephen Hawking played a word?,6
27349,Raj,6, The guy‰Ûªs a genius. Maybe you weren‰Ûªt challenging enough for him.,6
27350,Sheldon,6, Not challenging? I was humiliating the man. I was thinking of writing a book called A Brief History of the Time I Made Stephen Hawking Cry Like a Little Girl.,6
27351,Howard,6," There‰Ûªs the problem. You can‰Ûªt beat Hawking like that. He hates to lose. Everyone knows the guy‰Ûªs a big baby. I mean, forget the wheelchair, he should be in a stroller.",6
27352,Sheldon,6, Really?,6
27353,Howard,6," One time when I was working with him, he said that Johnny Depp was in The Matrix. I told him he was wrong, but he kept insisting. So I looked it up online and showed him. Well, the next day, he had a pizza party, and everyone got invited but me. And then he was all, your invitation must have gotten lost in the matrix.",6
27354,Sheldon,6," Good Lord, what have I done?",6
27355,Raj (in American accent),6," Good Lord, what have I done?",6
27356,Howard,6, Terrible.,6
27357,Raj,6," All right, hotshot, let‰Ûªs hear your Indian.",6
27358,Howard,6," I can‰Ûªt sit on that elephant, my ass is on fire from eating all this curry.",6
27359,Raj,6," Okay, yeah, that‰Ûªs pretty good.",6
27360,Scene,6, Penny‰Ûªs bedroom. Leonard sneaks from the bed and opens Penny‰Ûªs computer. ,6
27361,Leonard,6, Please be good. Please be good. Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Okay. She writes like she cooks.,6
27362,Scene,6, The apartment.,6
27363,Sheldon,6, Play. Play. Play. Play. Play.,6
27364,Leonard,6, What are you doing?,6
27365,Sheldon,6, Trying to use a Jedi mind trick to control Stephen Hawking. Play. Play. Ugh! He must be wearing a tinfoil hat or something.,6
27366,Leonard,6, I did a bad thing.,6
27367,Sheldon,6, Does it affect me?,6
27368,Leonard,6, No.,6
27369,Sheldon,6, Then suffer in silence. Play. Play. Play. (Knock knock knock) Stephen Hawking. (Knock knock knock) Stephen Hawking. (Knock knock knock) Stephen Hawking.,6
27370,Leonard,6," Penny started taking a class. She wrote a paper, she didn‰Ûªt want me to read it, I went behind her back and I read it anyway.",6
27371,Sheldon,6, Stephen Hawking hates me.,6
27372,Leonard,6," I don‰Ûªt know what to do. I mean, the paper‰Ûªs terrible. But if I tell her, she‰Ûªll know that I read it and she‰Ûªll get really mad.",6
27373,Sheldon,6," I was beating him so bad, he doesn‰Ûªt want to be friends anymore. Why does everyone love me except Stephen Hawking?",6
27374,Leonard,6, Is it possible we‰Ûªre having two different conversations?,6
27375,Sheldon,6, How would I know? I‰Ûªm not listening to you.,6
27376,Leonard,6," Hang on. Okay, here‰Ûªs what we‰Ûªre gonna do. Chess clock. We each get five minutes to talk about our problems. We‰Ûªll take turns. Each turn will consist of a statement and a helpful response from the friend. Begin.",6
27377,Sheldon,6," I humiliated Stephen Hawking in a game of Words with Friends. He stopped playing, and now we‰Ûªre not friends anymore.",6
27378,Leonard,6," He‰Ûªs probably busy. You‰Ûªre worried about nothing. Give it a couple more days. I‰Ûªm sure he‰Ûªll play, and you‰Ûªll see that everything‰Ûªs fine. My turn. I can‰Ûªt let Penny hand in a bad paper, but how do I tell her it‰Ûªs bad without letting her know that I read it?",6
27379,Sheldon,6," Hmm. Beats me. Now, I know Hawking‰Ûªs not busy because I can see he‰Ûªs playing other people right now.",6
27380,Leonard,6," Maybe since you‰Ûªre so good, he‰Ûªs taking his time to meet the challenge. I want Penny to enjoy school‰Û_",6
27381,Sheldon,6," Wolowitz told me he‰Ûªs a big baby. But I didn‰Ûªt know that, and I played extract for 82 points. It‰Ûªs all Amy‰Ûªs fault. She told me to play it. I have got to cut her loose.",6
27382,Leonard,6," Sheldon, I wasn‰Ûªt done talking. She hands in the paper tomorrow. I know I could help her. And she‰Ûªs my girlfriend. I, I should be allowed to help her. Why aren‰Ûªt I allowed to help her?",6
27383,Sheldon,6," Yeah, I hear you, brother.",6
27384,Leonard,6, No. You need to give me some advice.,6
27385,Sheldon,6," Fine. Women, huh?",6
27386,Leonard,6," No, specific to my situation.",6
27387,Sheldon,6," Blonde women, huh?",6
27388,Leonard,6, Empathetic.,6
27389,Sheldon,6, It sucks to be you.,6
27390,Leonard,6, I quit.,6
27391,Sheldon,6," Leonard, wait. No. I listened to your dumb thing. Leonard, come back. Leonard, come back. Leonard, come back.",6
27392,Leonard,6, What?,6
27393,Sheldon,6," Oh, of course, it only works on the weak-minded.",6
27394,Scene,6, Penny‰Ûªs bedroom.,6
27395,Leonard,6," Good morning, sunshine.",6
27396,Penny,6, Leonard. It‰Ûªs eight a.m. It‰Ûªs like the middle of the night.,6
27397,Leonard,6," I know, but I have to go to work, and I made you breakfast.",6
27398,Penny,6," Oh, wow, that‰Ûªs so sweet. Hey, what‰Ûªs this?",6
27399,Leonard,6," Uh, before you open that, um, are you familiar with the story of The Shoemaker and the Elves?",6
27400,Penny,6," Elves? Come on, Leonard. It‰Ûªs too early for Lord of the Rings.",6
27401,Leonard,6," No, no. Listen, um, once upon a time, there was this shoemaker and when he went to bed at night, elves would sneak in and they would make all these amazing shoes for him. And when the shoemaker woke up in the morning, he, he would be super happy, not mad at the elves at all. Open it.",6
27402,Penny,6," Okay. An examination of the economic, cultural, and political roots of slavery in the Old South, 1619 to 1865. What the hell is this?",6
27403,Leonard,6, Don‰Ûªt ask me. A little elf did it.,6
27404,Penny,6, So let me get this straight. You just assumed my paper would be bad so you wrote one for me?,6
27405,Leonard,6," No, I assumed it would be good. Then I read it.",6
27406,Penny,6, What?,6
27407,Leonard,6," No, I, I mean, it was good. There were just a few things that needed a little polishing.",6
27408,Penny,6, You changed every word.,6
27409,Leonard,6," That‰Ûªs not true. Uh, slavery. 1619. Your name at the top. That‰Ûªs all you.",6
27410,Penny,6, You are such an ass. This is exactly why I didn‰Ûªt want to tell you I was taking a class in the first place.,6
27411,Leonard,6," Please don‰Ûªt be upset. I just, I didn‰Ûªt want you ending up with a bad grade and get discouraged and give up on the idea of going back to school.",6
27412,Penny,6," Right, because me being in school is so important to you. That way, you wouldn‰Ûªt have to be dating someone who‰Ûªs only a waitress.",6
27413,Leonard,6," Oh, come on, you know that‰Ûªs not true.",6
27414,Penny,6," Do I? Listen to me. I need to do this on my own. If I fail, I fail. If I pass, I pass. Do you get it?",6
27415,Leonard,6, I‰Ûªm sorry. I was just trying to help.,6
27416,Penny,6," Yeah, well, next time don‰Ûªt. Oh, and since you like stories so much, this is not The Shoemaker",6
27417,Scene,6, The cafeteria.,6
27418,Howard,6, You ever hear back from Hawking?,6
27419,Sheldon,6, No. It would appear as if I‰Ûªve lost him. Stupid brain.,6
27420,Raj,6, It‰Ûªll be okay.,6
27421,Sheldon,6, How can it be okay? Stephen Hawking‰Ûªs a genius and he talks like a robot. It‰Ûªs everything I‰Ûªve ever wanted in a friend.,6
27422,Raj,6," Yeah, but if he‰Ûªs a sore loser, maybe you‰Ûªre better off without him.",6
27423,Sheldon,6, You‰Ûªre right. I guess I just have to make lemonade out of the two of you. He played! He played! Coop and Rolling Thunder are together again. He was okay with that nickname.,6
27424,Howard,6," So, now all you have to do is let him win.",6
27425,Sheldon,6," Yeah, way ahead of you. I will play the word at for two measly points, throwing the game and thus securing my friendship with the smartest man in the world.",6
27426,Howard,6, What are you waiting for? Hit send.,6
27427,Sheldon,6, I can‰Ûªt. Losing on purpose is intellectually dishonest.,6
27428,Raj,6, So don‰Ûªt do it.,6
27429,Sheldon,6," Oh, but I want to be Hawking‰Ûªs friend.",6
27430,Howard,6, So do it.,6
27431,Sheldon,6," Oh, but if I do, I‰Ûªll be a phony, a sellout, a Hollywood poser.",6
27432,Raj,6, Then don‰Ûªt do it.,6
27433,Sheldon,6," I won‰Ûªt. This feels right. My mother always said, to thine own self be true.",6
27434,Howard,6, Good for you.,6
27435,Sheldon,6," ‰Û÷Course she also told me that every animal in the world got on one boat, so what does she know? And send.",6
27436,Scene,6, The apartment.,6
27437,Leonard,6," Oh, hey. Haven‰Ûªt heard from you in a couple days. You still mad at me?",6
27438,Penny,6, Nope. I have no reason to‰Û_ ‰ÛÏB‰Û mad at you. Minus.,6
27439,Leonard,6, Wow.,6
27440,Penny,6," That‰Ûªs right. On my paper. Not yours, mine, you punk-ass elf.",6
27441,Leonard,6, I don‰Ûªt know what to say.,6
27442,Penny,6," Hmm, how about, gee, Penny, you‰Ûªre smarter than I thought. You may be the one in school, but I‰Ûªm the one who learned a lesson. I‰Ûªm so stupid, Penny. Duh.",6
27443,Sheldon,6, She sounds exactly like you.,6
27444,Scene,6, Penny‰Ûªs apartment.,6
27445,Amy,6, How‰Ûªd it go with Leonard?,6
27446,Penny,6, I don‰Ûªt think he‰Ûªll be making that mistake again.,6
27447,Bernadette,6, Good.,6
27448,Penny,6," So, I know this goes without saying, but if either of you tell Leonard you helped me rewrite this paper, I will beat you both with a bag of oranges.",6
27449,Amy,6, Understood.,6
27450,Bernadette,6, Got it.,6
27451,Penny,6," Now, ladies, we got a B-minus on this paper. I think if we put our heads together, on the next one we could get an A.",6
27452,Bernadette,6," Uh, but we got you a B-minus on purpose to make it believable.",6
27453,Penny,6, Believable? You saying I‰Ûªm not smart?,6
27454,Bernadette,6," No, no!",6
27455,Amy,6, You‰Ûªre smart.,6
27456,Penny,6, That‰Ûªs better.,6
27457,Amy,6, I feel like I‰Ûªm in high school again.,6
27458,Bernadette,6," Yeah, doing the prom queen‰Ûªs homework so she‰Ûªll like us.",6
27459,Amy,6, I know. It‰Ûªs finally working.,6
27460,Scene,6, The apartment. Sheldon‰Ûªs phone rings.,6
27461,Sheldon,6, It‰Ûªs Stephen Hawking.,6
27462,Leonard,6, Well answer it. I want to hear.,6
27463,Sheldon,6," Professor Hawking, how nice of you to call.",6
27464,Stephen Hawking,6," Hello. I really enjoyed our game, Dr. Cooper.",6
27465,Sheldon,6," Oh, me, too.",6
27466,Stephen Hawking,6," Or should I say Dr. Loser? Ha, ha, ha.",6
27467,Sheldon,6," Yes, congratulations. You won fair and square. Uh, very impressive, sir.",6
27468,Stephen Hawking,6, Do you like brain teasers?,6
27469,Sheldon,6," Oh, I love brain teasers.",6
27470,Stephen Hawking,6, What does Sheldon Cooper and a black hole have in common? They both suck. Neener neener.,6
27471,Scene,7, The apartment.,6
27472,Wil,7," Hi, Sheldon. Thanks for having me. I‰Ûªm happy to be here.",6
27473,Amy,7, Cut.,6
27474,Sheldon,7, What‰Ûªs wrong?,6
27475,Amy,7," Sorry, Sheldon, you were brilliant as always. Wil, that was a little wooden.",6
27476,Wil,7, Wooden?,6
27477,Amy,7," Don‰Ûªt worry, it wasn‰Ûªt terrible. Just, this time, try to say it the way people sound. And action.",6
27478,Sheldon,7," My friend, Wil Wheaton.",6
27479,Wil,7," Hi, Sheldon. Thanks for having me. I‰Ûªm excited to be here.",6
27480,Sheldon,7," So, Wil, what do you have for us first?",6
27481,Wil,7," Well, this is an exciting one. This is the flag of the United Federation of Planets. Now what‰Ûªs interesting about this flag‰Û_",6
27482,Amy,7, Cut.,6
27483,Wil,7, What was wrong with that?,6
27484,Amy,7," It‰Ûªs called Fun with Flags. They‰Ûªre not at half-mast, nobody died. Let‰Ûªs try and keep it upbeat.",6
27485,Wil,7," Um, no offence, but I‰Ûªve been acting since I was a kid. I think I can handle a Web show without a lot of direction.",6
27486,Sheldon,7," It‰Ûªs true. In 1982, Wil played the voice of Martin the mouse in The Secret of NIMH. You moved me.",6
27487,Amy,7," You‰Ûªll have to forgive me. This is my first time directing, I just want it to be good.",6
27488,Wil,7, So do I.,6
27489,Amy,7," Great. So, this time let‰Ûªs try more real boy, less Pinocchio. And action.",6
27490,Wil,7," And cut. You realize that I‰Ûªm doing this for free, right?",6
27491,Amy,7," Yes. And so far, we‰Ûªre still not getting our money‰Ûªs worth. Let‰Ûªs try it again. Everybody‰Ûªs having fun. And action.",6
27492,Sheldon,7," So, Wil, what do you have for us first?",6
27493,Wil,7," Well, this is an exciting one. This is the flag of the United Federation of Planets.",6
27494,Amy,7, Cut.,6
27495,Wil,7," Problem, first-time director?",6
27496,Sheldon,7," Oh, none that I could see. I saw a man who loved flags almost as much as I do. I got goose bumps.",6
27497,Amy,7, He was overacting on purpose.,6
27498,Sheldon,7, Really? He reminded me of a young William Shatner.,6
27499,Wil,7," Listen, Sheldon, I‰Ûªm really happy to do this for you, but not if she‰Ûªs gonna be a huge pain in the ass the whole time.",6
27500,Amy,7, You gonna let him speak to me like that?,6
27501,Sheldon,7," Well, you‰Ûªre my girlfriend and I don‰Ûªt want you to be upset. Then again, Wil Wheaton‰Ûªs my friend and I don‰Ûªt want him to be upset. Hmm, this is a sticky wicket. (To Wil) What do you think?",6
27502,Amy,7, Can I speak to you for a second?,6
27503,Sheldon,7, I‰Ûªll be right back. Feel free to play with yourself.,6
27504,Amy,7," I don‰Ûªt care for your friend, he‰Ûªs being rude to me. You need to ask him to leave.",6
27505,Sheldon,7," Amy, I can‰Ûªt just ask Wil Wheaton to leave. He‰Ûªs a minor celebrity. Once you explain who he is, many people recognize him.",6
27506,Amy,7, Fine. Then maybe I should go.,6
27507,Sheldon,7, Could you? That would solve everything. You are the best. I‰Ûªll see you at dinner tonight?,6
27508,Amy,7, You sure you wouldn‰Ûªt rather have dinner with your friend Wil Wheaton?,6
27509,Sheldon,7," Come to think of it, I would! You, little lady, are on fire.",6
27510,Scene,7, Howard‰Ûªs bedroom.,6
27511,Bernadette,7," Every time we eat dinner here, your mother refuses to let me help with the dishes.",6
27512,Howard,7, Don‰Ûªt take it personally. She likes doing them by herself so she can lick the plates with no one looking.,6
27513,Bernadette,7, You ready to go?,6
27514,Howard,7," Yeah, let me just grab a couple of fresh turtlenecks.",6
27515,Bernadette,7, I don‰Ûªt understand why you keep your stuff here when there‰Ûªs plenty of room at home.,6
27516,Howard,7," What are you talking about? All I have here is a few sweaters, books, bank stuff, computers, mail, collectibles, medicine and my electric body groomer. Ooh, there‰Ûªs my plaid dickie. Oh, got this at the Goodwill store for 50 cents. Can you believe it?",6
27517,Bernadette,7, 50 cents sounds right. Let‰Ûªs go.,6
27518,Howard,7," You know, it‰Ûªs kinda late. Why don‰Ûªt we just spend the night here?",6
27519,Bernadette,7, Because we don‰Ûªt live here.,6
27520,Howard,7, I know.,6
27521,Bernadette,7," Do you? You said when you got back from space you were gonna move into my apartment, but half the time we stay here.",6
27522,Howard,7, That‰Ûªs not true.,6
27523,Mrs Wolowitz (off),7," Howard, I‰Ûªm doing laundry. You want me to put anything in for you?",6
27524,Howard,7, There‰Ûªs some underwear in the hamper.,6
27525,Mrs Wolowitz (off),7," Oh, good, I got that new stain stick to try out.",6
27526,Howard,7," Thank you, I only put it on the list two weeks ago. Okay, I see what you‰Ûªre getting at. How about this weekend I‰Ûªll box up all my things and move them to our place.",6
27527,Bernadette,7, Thank you.,6
27528,Howard,7, The lightsabres are gonna look great in the living room.,6
27529,Bernadette,7, Or in the closet. We can decide later.,6
27530,Mrs Wolowitz (off),7," Howard, help, my hand‰Ûªs stuck in the garbage disposal.",6
27531,Howard,7, Let go of whatever piece of food you‰Ûªre holding.,6
27532,Mrs Wolowitz (off),7, Are you kidding? It‰Ûªs a perfectly good chicken leg.,6
27533,Scene,7, The apartment.,6
27534,Leonard,7," Hey, look who‰Ûªs out after dark, like a big boy.",6
27535,Sheldon,7, I was out raising heck with Mr. Wil Wheaton. Four hours more and we would have closed down the HomeTown Buffet.,6
27536,Leonard,7, I thought you had plans with Amy.,6
27537,Sheldon,7," Yeah, I did, but then Wil called Amy a pain in the A-S-S. She got huffy and left, then Wil and I headed out to dinner. That place really did remind me of my hometown. Because there we also have a HomeTown Buffet.",6
27538,Leonard,7, Hold on. Wil and Amy had an argument?,6
27539,Sheldon,7," Yes, quite the kerfuffle.",6
27540,Leonard,7, Then Amy got mad and left?,6
27541,Sheldon,7, Walked right out the door.,6
27542,Leonard,7, And you?,6
27543,Sheldon,7, Enjoyed a delightful dinner at a reasonable price. The manager recognized Wil and let us sit right next to the frozen yoghurt machine. Right next to it. I was closer to it than I am to you right now.,6
27544,Leonard,7," Buddy, I think Amy might be upset.",6
27545,Sheldon,7, Why‰Ûªs that?,6
27546,Leonard,7," Because your friend was rude to her, and then you went to dinner with him.",6
27547,Sheldon,7, You‰Ûªre just repeating what I said. It‰Ûªs like living with a lactose-intolerant parrot.,6
27548,Leonard,7," Trust me, call her.",6
27549,Sheldon,7," Fine. It‰Ûªs a shame you didn‰Ûªt go to dinner with us, because the buffet you‰Ûªre about to enjoy only serves humble pie, a dessert much less tasty than frozen yoghurt. I was this close.",6
27550,Amy (on skype),7, What?,6
27551,Sheldon,7," You‰Ûªll appreciate this. Leonard has some ridiculous notion that you‰Ûªre mad at me. Tell him you‰Ûªre not mad at me. Go ahead, set him straight.",6
27552,Amy,7," I‰Ûªm mad at you, Sheldon.",6
27553,Sheldon,7," Hmm. Eat one of your Luna bars. Very often when women think they‰Ûªre angry, they‰Ûªre really just hungry.",6
27554,Amy,7," I‰Ûªm not hungry. Your friend insulted me, and you didn‰Ûªt do anything.",6
27555,Sheldon,7," Precisely, I didn‰Ûªt do anything. Now does someone feel like checking her emotional math?",6
27556,Leonard,7," Keep going, buddy, you‰Ûªre doing great.",6
27557,Amy,7," Sheldon, I‰Ûªm your girlfriend, and you should have taken my side. That‰Ûªs it. End of story. Good night.",6
27558,Sheldon,7," Wow, Amy‰Ûªs mad and Leonard was right. What a weird day.",6
27559,Scene,7, The Cheesecake Factory.,6
27560,Penny,7," Hey. Sorry this took so long. But you used to work here, you know how it is.",6
27561,Bernadette,7, Kitchen slammed again?,6
27562,Penny,7," No, I‰Ûªm a terrible waitress, remember?",6
27563,Bernadette,7," So, is there anything I can do to help you with the move tomorrow?",6
27564,Howard,7," Now that you mention it, I was thinking tomorrow might not be great.",6
27565,Bernadette,7, What‰Ûªs your excuse this time?,6
27566,Howard,7," No excuse. It‰Ûªs just, you know, I‰Ûªm Jewish, and technically, we‰Ûªre not supposed to drive or carry anything on the Sabbath. So this one‰Ûªs on God.",6
27567,Bernadette,7, That might be a little more convincing if you didn‰Ûªt have a mouthful of bacon cheeseburger.,6
27568,Howard,7," My religion‰Ûªs kinda loosey-goosey. Basically, as long as you got your schmekel clipped and don‰Ûªt wear a cross, you‰Ûªre good.",6
27569,Bernadette,7," Howie, you promised you‰Ûªd move.",6
27570,Howard,7, And I will.,6
27571,Penny,7," Yeah, right.",6
27572,Howard,7, I will. I‰Ûªm obviously not going to live in my mother‰Ûªs house for the rest of my life. I‰Ûªm not a child.,6
27573,Penny,7, I‰Ûªve seen her burp you.,6
27574,Howard,7," She did not burp me. She was patting me on the back, and I happened to burp. Don‰Ûªt you have other tables you should be waiting on?",6
27575,Penny,7," Yeah, but I told you, I‰Ûªm not good at my job. Bernadette, listen to me. He is never gonna leave.",6
27576,Bernadette,7, I‰Ûªm starting to think you‰Ûªre right.,6
27577,Howard,7," All right, I‰Ûªve had enough of this. I‰Ûªm a grown man, I have a successful career, for the love of God, I‰Ûªve been to space. I will move out when I‰Ûªm ready, and I don‰Ûªt need anyone badgering me into it.",6
27578,Penny,7," Wow, excuse me.",6
27579,Howard,7, That was just for her benefit. I‰Ûªll move tomorrow. I love you. Don‰Ûªt leave me.,6
27580,Scene,7, Amy‰Ûªs apartment.,6
27581,Sheldon,7," (Knock, knock, knock) Amy. (Knock, knock, knock) Amy. (Knock, knock, knock) Angry Amy.",6
27582,Amy,7, What?,6
27583,Sheldon,7," I‰Ûªve been thinking about what happened, and I hope this gift will make things better.",6
27584,Amy,7, Star Trek DVDs? Why would I want this?,6
27585,Sheldon,7," First of all, you‰Ûªre welcome. And furthermore, not being familiar with Wil Wheaton‰Ûªs body of work, there was no way for you to know you were being rude to a national treasure. Get ready for 130 hours of I told you so. (She hands him back the DVDs and slams the door) Fine. I‰Ûªll just tell you what happens. Episode one, Encounter at Farpoint. Fade in. The new Enterprise heads out on its maiden voyage to contact the Bandi people of Deneb IV. Enter Wesley Crusher, played by my buddy‰Û_ (Amy opens door, grabs DVDs, slams door again) She‰Ûªs hooked.",6
27586,Scene,7, Howard‰Ûªs bedroom.,6
27587,Raj,7, Wow. An end of an era.,6
27588,Howard,7," Boy, if these walls could talk.",6
27589,Leonard,7," They‰Ûªd say, why does he touch himself so much?",6
27590,Howard,7, Yeah. I can‰Ûªt believe I‰Ûªm not going to live here anymore. This has always been my bedroom. Right here is where my mom used to mark my height.,6
27591,Leonard,7," Oh, yeah. Fifth grade. Sixth grade. Seventh grade. Eighth grade. Ninth grade.",6
27592,Howard,7," I remember when I was five, hiding under this desk with all my Halloween candy. Had some Peanut M&M‰ÛªS, went into my first anaphylactic shock and had to be rushed to the hospital. Came home, celebrated with a Snickers, went into my second anaphylactic shock.",6
27593,Raj,7, When did you figure out you were allergic to nuts?,6
27594,Howard,7, Sometime around the third Almond Joy.,6
27595,Leonard,7, Okay. You want to start loading this stuff into the truck?,6
27596,Howard,7," Yeah, I guess. Hey, would you do me a favour? Go on ahead. I just want one last moment alone in my old room.",6
27597,Leonard,7, We‰Ûªre not standing outside by the U-Haul while you fondle yourself.,6
27598,Howard,7," Fine, let‰Ûªs go.",6
27599,Scene,7, The Cheesecake Factory Bar.,6
27600,Penny,7, Hey. What brings you in?,6
27601,Sheldon,7," Penny, if you wouldn‰Ûªt mind, I‰Ûªd like to have a conversation about girls.",6
27602,Penny,7, I had a feeling we‰Ûªd have a talk like this sooner or later. Are you finally getting fuzz in weird places?,6
27603,Sheldon,7," Penny, please, I‰Ûªm on the horns of a relationship dilemma. And for the record, I had a full pubis of hair by the time I was 19.",6
27604,Penny,7," And for the record, bleugh. So what are you drinking?",6
27605,Sheldon,7," Well, it‰Ûªs been a rough day. I usually go chamomile tea, but I don‰Ûªt think that‰Ûªs going to cut it.",6
27606,Penny,7, You could have a Long Island Iced Tea.,6
27607,Sheldon,7, Will that calm my nerves?,6
27608,Penny,7, It‰Ûªs calmed the pants off me a couple of times.,6
27609,Sheldon,7, Sold.,6
27610,Penny,7," Oh. So, the heart you got from the wizard giving you trouble?",6
27611,Sheldon,7," The trouble isn‰Ûªt with me, Penny, it‰Ûªs with your gender. Someday, scientists will discover that second X chromosome contains nothing but nonsense and twaddle.",6
27612,Penny,7," Yeah, Amy told me what happened. Look, just apologize. It‰Ûªll warm her twaddle.",6
27613,Sheldon,7," It‰Ûªs a Band-Aid at best. See, the core problem is that Amy and Wil do not like each other. Which is baffling because they‰Ûªre both crazy about me. And I like them, which indicates they‰Ûªre bright and interesting and/or were on Star Trek.",6
27614,Penny,7," Honey, you can‰Ûªt make people like each other.",6
27615,Sheldon,7," Not true. Leonard made me like you. And let me tell you, that was a hard row to hoe. Cheers, pal. Ooh. Boy, that is a treat that‰Ûªs hard to beat. Get the Mad Hatter on the horn, I‰Ûªm having a tea party.",6
27616,Penny,7, You might want to pace yourself.,6
27617,Sheldon,7, I drink tea all the time. I think I know what I‰Ûªm doing.,6
27618,Penny,7," Far be it from me to criticize a man with a full pubis. Look, Sheldon, your problem is not Wil Wheaton, okay? Your problem is the way you treated Amy.",6
27619,Sheldon,7, My problem is I‰Ûªm out of tea.,6
27620,Penny,7," Come on, someone insulted your girlfriend and you just let him do it. I thought you Texas guys stood up for your womenfolk.",6
27621,Sheldon,7," Penny, please, I think I‰Ûªve evolved beyond my simple rustic upbringing.",6
27622,Penny,7, Sorry.,6
27623,Sheldon,7," On the other hand, that low-down polecat done wronged my woman.",6
27624,Penny,7," Welcome to Long Island, Tex.",6
27625,Sheldon,7," Amy deserves better. You know, when we buy the Planter‰Ûªs deluxe mix, she eats all the Brazil nuts so I don‰Ûªt have to look at them. She‰Ûªs a unique blend of saint and squirrel.",6
27626,Penny,7," Yeah, that she is. Here you go.",6
27627,Sheldon,7, I‰Ûªm a callous egomaniac. She‰Ûªs gonna leave me.,6
27628,Penny,7," No, she won‰Ûªt.",6
27629,Sheldon,7," No, she won‰Ûªt. I‰Ûªm great.",6
27630,Scene,7, Howard and Bernadette‰Ûªs apartment.,6
27631,Howard,7," Okay, I have now officially moved out of my mother‰Ûªs house. You are now the only woman in my life who I‰Ûªll see naked in the bathroom.",6
27632,Bernadette,7, I know this wasn‰Ûªt easy. You doing okay?,6
27633,Howard,7," Oh, I‰Ûªm fine. It‰Ûªs just her I‰Ûªm worried about.",6
27634,Bernadette,7," Aw, she‰Ûªll be okay. She‰Ûªs a grown woman.",6
27635,Howard,7," I know. It‰Ûªs just ever since my dad left, I‰Ûªve felt responsible for her.",6
27636,Bernadette,7, That‰Ûªs a lot for a kid to deal with.,6
27637,Howard,7," She was just so sad all the time. I was the only person who could cheer her up. Well, me and Ben and Jerry.",6
27638,Bernadette,7, She‰Ûªs lucky you were there.,6
27639,Howard,7," You know, she‰Ûªs why I first got into magic. I would do little shows for her, hang up a bedsheet like it was a curtain, put on a top hat and cape. And part way through the act, I would say I needed a volunteer from the audience to be my beautiful assistant and invite her up on stage. I can still remember the way she‰Ûªd smile. For a few minutes, she‰Ûªd forget how lonely she was.",6
27640,Bernadette,7," Aw, crap. Let‰Ûªs go.",6
27641,Howard,7, Where we going?,6
27642,Bernadette,7, Grab a box. We‰Ûªll sleep at your mother‰Ûªs place tonight.,6
27643,Howard,7," No, but I want to live here.",6
27644,Bernadette,7," Well, you should‰Ûªve thought of that before you told me the stupid magic trick story.",6
27645,Howard,7, Can‰Ûªt we talk about this?,6
27646,Bernadette,7, No husband of mine is gonna break his mother‰Ûªs heart!,6
27647,Scene,7, Wil Wheaton‰Ûªs house.,6
27648,Sheldon,7," (Knock, knock, knock) Wil Wheaton! (Knock, knock, knock) Wil Wheaton! Wait, how many was that?",6
27649,Wil,7," Hey, Sheldon, what‰Ûªs up?",6
27650,Sheldon,7, Wouldn‰Ûªt you like to know?,6
27651,Wil,7, Have you been drinking?,6
27652,Sheldon,7, Just tea. S‰Ûªthe best tea I‰Ûªve ever had.,6
27653,Wil,7, Why are you here?,6
27654,Sheldon,7, I‰Ûªll tell you. I‰Ûªm from Texas. Need I say more?,6
27655,Wil,7," Yeah, actually, a little more would be helpful.",6
27656,Sheldon,7," You insulted my woman. I‰Ûªm here to defend her honour. Two! It was two. (Knock, knock, knock) Wil Wheaton! Now prepare yourself for what may come.",6
27657,Wil,7," Oh, Sheldon, do you really think we‰Ûªre gonna fight?",6
27658,Sheldon,7, My fists are not up here because I‰Ûªm milking a giant invisible cow. They‰Ûªre up to beat an apology out of you.,6
27659,Wil,7," Okay, I‰Ûªm sorry.",6
27660,Sheldon,7," Well, that was a long bus ride for not very much.",6
27661,Wil,7, Are you okay?,6
27662,Sheldon,7," You‰Ûªre asking a lot of questions, Wil Wheaton. As a matter of idle curiosity, which of your shrubberies do you feel would benefit from a thorough vomiting? Never mind, I‰Ûªll choose. (Vomits) You were so good in Stand by Me.",6
27663,Scene,7, The apartment.,6
27664,Sheldon,7," Hello, I‰Ûªm Dr. Sheldon Cooper. Welcome to Sheldon Cooper Presents Fun with Flags. Get ready for a very special episode where we explore the flags of the popular entertainment franchise, Star Trek. And to help us, I‰Ûªm pleased to introduce a special guest, surprisingly, it only took gas money and the promise of free food to get him here, Mr. LeVar Burton.",6
27665,LeVar,7," Hey, Sheldon, it‰Ûªs a pleasure to be here. Well, we‰Ûªve got some interesting flags for‰Û_",6
27666,Amy,7," Cut. Yikes, this guy is worse than Wil Wheaton.",6
27667,Sheldon,7," I don‰Ûªt know what she‰Ûªs talking about, but I‰Ûªm obligated to agree with her. She‰Ûªs my girlfriend.",6
27668,LeVar,7," Ah, I hear you, brother. I still get lunch, right?",6
27669,Scene,8, The cafeteria. Sheldon is drawing on a napkin.,6
27670,Raj,8, What are you drawing over there?,6
27671,Sheldon,8, It‰Ûªs a hypothetical containment field for a Frisbee-sized wormhole that could serve as a portal to a parallel universe.,6
27672,Howard,8," Oh, you silly doodlebug.",6
27673,Leonard,8," You know, a lot of scientists believe that making contact with other life-forms would probably not end well for us.",6
27674,Sheldon,8," It‰Ûªs a Frisbee-sized wormhole, Leonard. You can block it with a Frisbee. Calm down. (Hands Howard the napkin)",6
27675,Howard,8, Do you expect me to build this?,6
27676,Sheldon,8, I expect you to wipe the pudding off your chin. Gentlemen.,6
27677,Howard,8, Have you guys ever noticed that Sheldon always disappears every day at two forty-five?,6
27678,Leonard,8, Really?,6
27679,Raj,8, He probably just goes to the bathroom.,6
27680,Leonard,8," Actually, no, he goes to the bathroom at eight a.m. with optional follow-ups at one forty-five and seven ten high-fibre Fridays.",6
27681,Raj,8, It‰Ûªs sad that you know that.,6
27682,Leonard,8," Oh, that‰Ûªs just the tip of the sadness iceberg.",6
27683,Howard,8," I‰Ûªm looking at his public calendar. Two forty-five to three-oh-five, nothing. Yesterday, two forty-five to three-oh-five, nothing, last week, nothing, last month, nothing. He never has anything booked during that time.",6
27684,Raj,8," Twenty minutes a day, completely unaccounted for.",6
27685,Howard,8, We should figure out where he goes.,6
27686,Raj,8," Ooh, this is exciting. Like one of my classic murder mystery dinner parties.",6
27687,Leonard,8," Right, the case of who murdered three Saturday nights of my life?",6
27688,Howard,8, Colonel Koothrapali in the kitchen with the olive spread.,6
27689,Raj,8, It was tapenade and you guys suck.,6
27690,Scene,8, Penny‰Ûªs apartment. Penny is texting.,6
27691,Penny,8," So, how was work today?",6
27692,Leonard,8," Well, I spent most of the afternoon growing isotopically pure crystals for neutrino detection.",6
27693,Penny,8, That sounds like fun.,6
27694,Leonard,8," Yeah, it was.",6
27695,Penny,8," Oh, good, I guessed right.",6
27696,Leonard,8, Who you talking to?,6
27697,Penny,8," Oh, just this guy I met at school.",6
27698,Leonard,8," Oh, great. We‰Ûªre still dating, right?",6
27699,Penny,8, Relax. He‰Ûªs just a friend. We‰Ûªre doing an oral report together. He‰Ûªs really nice.,6
27700,Leonard,8," I‰Ûªm sorry, what was that? I had a little stroke after oral.",6
27701,Penny,8," Would you stop? Look, he just moved here from London, okay? He doesn‰Ûªt really know anybody.",6
27702,Leonard,8," Oh, good, an English accent, the sexiest accent you can have.",6
27703,Penny,8," No. That‰Ûªs not true. There‰Ûªs French, there‰Ûªs Italian. No, you‰Ûªre right, it‰Ûªs the best.",6
27704,Leonard,8, Did you tell him you have a boyfriend?,6
27705,Penny,8, It didn‰Ûªt come up.,6
27706,Leonard,8," Well, maybe you should tell him.",6
27707,Penny,8, What am I supposed to say?,6
27708,Leonard,8," Say, can‰Ûªt talk right now, hanging with my boyfriend. England sucks, you suck, USA number one.",6
27709,Penny,8, Fine. Hanging with my boyfriend. Talk to you later. Happy?,6
27710,Leonard,8, Yes. Thank you.,6
27711,Penny,8, Mm-hmm. Hmm.,6
27712,Leonard,8, What did he say?,6
27713,Penny,8, Nothing.,6
27714,Leonard,8, What?,6
27715,Penny,8, Did your boyfriend make you type that?,6
27716,Leonard,8, I hate this guy.,6
27717,Penny,8, Don‰Ûªt be like that.,6
27718,Leonard,8," Come on, trust me, he‰Ûªs hitting on you.",6
27719,Penny,8," No, he‰Ûªs not. We‰Ûªre just friends. Look, is this gonna be a problem? Because he‰Ûªs supposed to come over tomorrow to work.",6
27720,Leonard,8, Really? Here?,6
27721,Penny,8," If it makes you uncomfortable, I‰Ûªll switch partners, even though the thing‰Ûªs due next week and everyone already has a partner and I‰Ûªll probably end up failing the class.",6
27722,Leonard,8, That‰Ûªd be great. Thank you.,6
27723,Scene,8, The corridor outside Sheldon‰Ûªs office.,6
27724,Howard,8," Two forty-four, Right on schedule. Hey, Sheldon.",6
27725,Sheldon,8," Oh, hello.",6
27726,Howard,8, Raj and I are heading over to the genetics lab to pet the glow-in-the-dark bunny. Want to come with us?,6
27727,Sheldon,8," No, thank you.",6
27728,Raj,8," Are you sure? They turn off the lights, and it‰Ûªs like a cute little laser show that poops all over the place.",6
27729,Sheldon,8, I‰Ûªm quite sure. Good day.,6
27730,Howard,8," Well, where are you going?",6
27731,Sheldon,8, Where are you going?,6
27732,Raj,8, We just told you.,6
27733,Sheldon,8, I just told you.,6
27734,Howard,8," No, you didn‰Ûªt.",6
27735,Sheldon,8," Well, it‰Ûªs your word against mine; see you in court.",6
27736,Howard,8, Should we follow him?,6
27737,Raj,8," I don‰Ûªt know, I‰Ûªm torn. I want to know where he‰Ûªs going, but now I kind of want to play with the bunny.",6
27738,Alex,8," Hi, guys.",6
27739,Howard,8," Hey, Alex, do you know where your boss just went?",6
27740,Alex,8, No.,6
27741,Howard,8, Don‰Ûªt you know his schedule?,6
27742,Alex,8, All I know is corduroy makes too much noise and I have to go find quieter pants.,6
27743,Howard,8, Come on.,6
27744,Raj,8," Boy, what I wouldn‰Ûªt give to get her out of those pants and into something a little more stylish.",6
27745,Scene,8," A corridor in the basement. Sheldon takes out a key, unlocks a door and enters.",6
27746,Howard,8, This is where he goes? What‰Ûªs in there?,6
27747,Raj,8, I think it‰Ûªs an old storage room.,6
27748,Howard,8, What could he be doing in there every day for twenty minutes?,6
27749,Raj,8," Well, he‰Ûªs not doing twenty-minute abs, because if he were, he would have way better abs. Can you hear anything?",6
27750,Howard,8, Not yet. What are you doing?,6
27751,Raj,8, I‰Ûªm listening.,6
27752,Howard,8, Can‰Ûªt you face the other way and listen?,6
27753,Raj,8," I can‰Ûªt do anything right for you, can I?",6
27754,Howard,8, What the hell is he up to?,6
27755,Raj,8, He is kind of a weirdo. Maybe he‰Ûªs got Leonard Nimoy chained up in there. Or Bill Gates. Or Stephen Hawking.,6
27756,Howard,8, Why would he chain up Stephen Hawking?,6
27757,Raj,8," Howard, please, you can‰Ûªt treat the man differently just because he‰Ûªs disabled. That‰Ûªs not okay.",6
27758,Scene,8, The apartment.,6
27759,Leonard,8," If you‰Ûªre wondering why I‰Ûªve been staring through the peephole, I‰Ûªm trying to get a look at this guy who‰Ûªs coming over to Penny‰Ûªs.",6
27760,Sheldon,8," To be honest, I didn‰Ûªt know you were here.",6
27761,Leonard,8," It‰Ûªs not a big deal. He‰Ûªs just in her history class. They‰Ûªre working on a project together. I don‰Ûªt even know why I care. You know what, I don‰Ûªt care.",6
27762,Sheldon,8, You think you don‰Ûªt care?,6
27763,Leonard,8, This is silly. I have nothing to worry about.,6
27764,Sheldon,8," Oh, I don‰Ûªt know. I mean, statistically speaking, I‰Ûªm sure you have something to worry about.",6
27765,Leonard,8, What do you mean?,6
27766,Sheldon,8," Well, if we assume your looks are average, yeah, right off the bat, fifty percent of men on Earth are more attractive than you. That‰Ûªs one point five billion handsome lads standing by, waiting to rain on your parade.",6
27767,Leonard,8," Well, yeah, but this isn‰Ûªt just about looks. I‰Ûªm, I‰Ûªm way above average in a lot of other things.",6
27768,Sheldon,8," Not height, vision, athleticism, or ability to digest dairy products.",6
27769,Leonard,8, I‰Ûªm talking about important things like emotional maturity.,6
27770,Sheldon,8, You were just spying on your girlfriend through a peephole.,6
27771,Leonard,8, I liked it better when you thought I wasn‰Ûªt here.,6
27772,Sheldon,8," I‰Ûªm not saying you don‰Ûªt have attractive qualities. Your choice of friends is impeccable, you‰Ûªre a good sleeper, and last but not least, you buy the grapes I like. You‰Ûªre a real catch compared to some snoring guy with a fridge full of lousy grapes.",6
27773,Leonard,8," None of this matters. I trust that Penny cares about me, and nothing‰Ûªs gonna happen with this guy.",6
27774,Sheldon,8," Well, unless of course he‰Ûªs a skilled hypnotist.",6
27775,Leonard,8, What?,6
27776,Sheldon,8," While unlikely, it‰Ûªs still a statistical possibility. She might be performing sexual acts with him and not even know it.",6
27777,Leonard,8, Now you‰Ûªre just being ridiculous.,6
27778,Sheldon,8," Am I? The mind‰Ûªs a mysterious thing, Leonard. He could be having the time of his life while she thinks she‰Ûªs a chicken pecking for corn.",6
27779,Scene,8, The university basement.,6
27780,Raj,8," Look at us, sneaking around in the middle of the night like a couple of cat burglars.",6
27781,Howard,8, I think we‰Ûªre more like ninjas.,6
27782,Raj,8," I don‰Ûªt want to be a ninja, I want to be a cat burglar.",6
27783,Howard,8," Fine, I‰Ûªll be a ninja, you be a cat burglar.",6
27784,Raj,8," No, we both have to be the same thing. Okay, we‰Ûªre ninjas.",6
27785,Howard,8, Thank you.,6
27786,Raj,8," But next time, we‰Ûªll be cat burglars.",6
27787,Howard,8, It‰Ûªs locked.,6
27788,Raj,8, Are you sure?,6
27789,Howard,8," Yes, I‰Ûªm sure. Now, you stand guard, I‰Ûªm going to‰Û_",6
27790,Raj (trying door),8, It‰Ûªs locked.,6
27791,Howard,8, Just keep an eye out. I‰Ûªll have this open in a minute.,6
27792,Raj,8, When did you learn how to pick locks?,6
27793,Howard,8," When I was starting to do magic in junior high, I thought I could be an escape artist like Harry Houdini.",6
27794,Raj,8, How did that work out?,6
27795,Howard,8," Pretty good. I managed to escape friends, popularity, and every party thrown in a twelve mile radius. There. Ready?",6
27796,Raj,8," Hold on, hold on.",6
27797,Howard,8, What?,6
27798,Raj,8," Sheldon is a very smart man, and he obviously wants to keep this a secret.",6
27799,Howard,8," Yeah, so?",6
27800,Raj,8, What if it‰Ûªs booby-trapped?,6
27801,Howard,8," Don‰Ûªt worry, I‰Ûªm one step ahead of him.",6
27802,Raj,8," Great, what‰Ûªs your pl‰Û_ (Howard pushes him inside)",6
27803,Howard,8, Are we good?,6
27804,Raj,8, Yeah. Huh. Forty-three? What the hell does that mean?,6
27805,Howard,8, I don‰Ûªt know. The solution to an equation?,6
27806,Raj,8, Maybe. It‰Ûªs a prime number. Encryption systems are built on prime numbers.,6
27807,Howard,8, What kind of secret does Sheldon have to encrypt?,6
27808,Raj,8, He‰Ûªs always been very cagey about what he puts in his egg salad to make it so tasty.,6
27809,Howard,8, It‰Ûªs paprika.,6
27810,Raj,8," Really? Well, oh, okay, one mystery solved.",6
27811,Scene,8, The apartment.,6
27812,Voice from Outside,8," Okay, good night.",6
27813,Penny (off),8," Thanks, Cole. See you at school.",6
27814,Cole (off),8, See you.,6
27815,Leonard,8, I‰Ûªll be right back.,6
27816,Sheldon,8, I thought you left a long time ago.,6
27817,Leonard (rushing to catch up with Cole),8, ‰Û÷sup?,6
27818,Cole,8, Hey.,6
27819,Leonard,8," You, uh, moving into the apartment on the fifth floor?",6
27820,Cole,8," No, I was just visiting a friend.",6
27821,Leonard,8," Oh, cool. That cute blonde on four?",6
27822,Cole,8, Yeah. You know her?,6
27823,Leonard,8," I, well, I see her around. I like to keep my distance because her boyfriend is a pretty scary dude.",6
27824,Cole,8, Really?,6
27825,Leonard,8, Yeah. He‰Ûªs ganged up.,6
27826,Cole,8, She told me he‰Ûªs a scientist.,6
27827,Leonard,8, That‰Ûªs the name of his gang. The Scientists. They are crazy.,6
27828,Cole,8," Well, thanks for the tip.",6
27829,Leonard,8," No problem, brother. Stay frosty. (Cole leaves. Leonard spots Penny watching.) We‰Ûªre still dating, right?",6
27830,Scene,8, The cafeteria.,6
27831,Alex,8," Oh, hello, Dr. Hofstadter.",6
27832,Leonard,8," Hey, Alex, and call me Leonard. Dr. Hofstadter is my father. And my mother. And my sister. And our cat. Although, I‰Ûªm pretty sure Dr. Boots Hofstadter‰Ûªs degree was honorary.",6
27833,Alex,8," May I join you, Leonard?",6
27834,Leonard,8, Sure.,6
27835,Alex,8, Thanks.,6
27836,Leonard,8," Hey, Alex, let me ask you something. My girlfriend knows this guy at school. He‰Ûªs got an English accent.",6
27837,Alex,8," Ooh, I love English accents.",6
27838,Leonard,8," Yeah, you all do. Anyway, I feel like he‰Ûªs hitting on her. She says he‰Ûªs just being nice and that I should trust her.",6
27839,Alex,8, It‰Ûªs probably harmless. You know how it is. I‰Ûªm sure you get hit on all the time.,6
27840,Leonard,8," Right. Because girls are always like, ooh, that guy owns two Star Trek uniforms and gets a lot of ear infections. I got to get me some of that.",6
27841,Alex,8," I don‰Ûªt know, I bet it happens more than you realize.",6
27842,Leonard,8," Trust me, it doesn‰Ûªt.",6
27843,Alex,8," You sure? You‰Ûªre cute, you‰Ûªre funny. Maybe you‰Ûªre getting hit on, and you don‰Ûªt even know it.",6
27844,Leonard,8, Really?,6
27845,Alex,8," Yep, pretty sure.",6
27846,Leonard (laughs),8," Okay, I got to get back to work. Thanks for listening.",6
27847,Alex,8, No problem.,6
27848,Leonard,8, Hope-hope no girls rip my clothes off on the way.,6
27849,Scene,8, Raj‰Ûªs office.,6
27850,Raj,8," Come on, we‰Ûªre smart guys. We can figure this out.",6
27851,Howard,8, Forty-three. What is forty-three? Besides my mom‰Ûªs neck size.,6
27852,Raj,8, It‰Ûªs the atomic number for technetium.,6
27853,Howard,8, That stuff‰Ûªs radioactive.,6
27854,Raj,8, Do you think he‰Ûªs building a bomb?,6
27855,Howard,8," Ah, it took him two years to put together that Lego Death Star, I‰Ûªm not worried.",6
27856,Raj,8," Ooh, this could be something. forty-three is the number of calories in half a cup of fat-free yoghurt.",6
27857,Howard,8, Why would you know that?,6
27858,Raj,8," I‰Ûªm sorry. We can‰Ûªt all eat whatever we want and still stay thin. Wait, in the Hitchhiker‰Ûªs Guide to the Galaxy, isn‰Ûªt forty-three the answer to the question of life, the universe,and everything?",6
27859,Howard,8," That‰Ûªs forty-two, dumb-ass.",6
27860,Raj,8," Hey, hey. Feelings.",6
27861,Howard,8, We should stop. I‰Ûªm exhausted.,6
27862,Raj,8," Yeah, me, too. We‰Ûªve got more important things to do. Who cares what stupid forty-three means?",6
27863,Howard,8, Not me.,6
27864,Raj,8, Let‰Ûªs go home. You want to get something to eat?,6
27865,Howard,8, Sounds good.,6
27866,Raj,8, What the balls is forty-three?,6
27867,Howard,8, I have to know!,6
27868,Scene,8, The stairwell.,6
27869,Leonard,8, Hi.,6
27870,Penny,8," Hey, shouldn‰Ûªt you be out with your gang, spray painting equations on the side of buildings?",6
27871,Leonard,8," Come on, I‰Ûªm sorry.",6
27872,Penny,8, I just can‰Ûªt believe you don‰Ûªt trust me.,6
27873,Leonard,8," I do, of course I do.",6
27874,Penny,8," Then why did you embarrass me in front of my friend, who, by the way, knew exactly who you were?",6
27875,Leonard,8, Really?,6
27876,Penny,8, Your picture‰Ûªs on my refrigerator.,6
27877,Leonard,8," Oh. You know, I‰Ûªm really starting to not like this guy.",6
27878,Penny,8, What is your problem? Do you use up all your thinking at work and then have none left over for when you get home?,6
27879,Leonard,8," I don‰Ûªt know. It-it-it‰Ûªs hard sometimes. Everywhere you go, guys hit on you, even if I‰Ûªm standing right there. And they‰Ûªre all taller than me. Why is everyone taller than me? You know what, this is all in my head. It‰Ûªs my problem, not yours.",6
27880,Penny,8," Leonard, why do you always do this? Listen to me, you‰Ûªre the one I‰Ûªm with. You know I love you, so will you please relax because you‰Ûªre driving me crazy.",6
27881,Leonard,8, You know that‰Ûªs the first time you ever said that you love me.,6
27882,Penny,8, Yeah.,6
27883,Leonard,8, We‰Ûªre just supposed to pretend it‰Ûªs not a big deal?,6
27884,Penny,8," That‰Ûªs exactly what we‰Ûªre gonna do because you‰Ûªre about to make me cry, and we both know if I start crying, you‰Ûªre gonna start crying.",6
27885,Leonard,8," You‰Ûªre right, you should go.",6
27886,Penny (crying),8, All right.,6
27887,Leonard (crying),8," She loves me. (Receives text) Hey, it‰Ûªs Alex. Nice having coffee with you. If you want to talk more, I‰Ûªm always available. Smiley face, smiley face. What a friendly girl.",6
27888,Scene,8, The cafeteria.,6
27889,Howard,8," Okay, picture‰Ûªs up. Looks like the camera‰Ûªs working.",6
27890,Raj,8, That‰Ûªs good quality video.,6
27891,Howard,8, It better be. It‰Ûªs the spare camera for the Mars rover.,6
27892,Raj,8, How did you get your hands on that?,6
27893,Howard,8," Million dollar camera, ten dollar lock.",6
27894,Raj,8," Oh, my God, here he comes. This is it.",6
27895,Howard,8, What the hell is that thing?,6
27896,Raj,8, I don‰Ûªt know.,6
27897,Sheldon (on screen),8, This is Dr. Sheldon Cooper. Experimental log. Wormhole generator test forty-four.,6
27898,Howard,8, Wormhole generator test? (On screen a wormhole appears),6
27899,Sheldon,8, The first forty-three parallel universes I‰Ûªve checked proved to be empty. I see no reason to suspect universe number forty-four will be any different. (Puts his head in the wormhole),6
27900,Howard,8," Oh, my God!",6
27901,Raj,8, Holy crap!,6
27902,Sheldon (with an alien creature stuck to his face),8, Oh! It‰Ûªs eating my face!,6
27903,Raj,8, Aah! It‰Ûªs eating his face!,6
27904,Sheldon (throwing alien onto the laptop),8, I found your webcam and replaced the video feed. You two should be ashamed of yourselves.,6
27905,Raj,8," Sheldon, we‰Ûªre really sorry.",6
27906,Howard,8," Yeah, really sorry.",6
27907,Sheldon,8," Sorry? You may not realize it, but I have difficulty navigating certain aspects of daily life. You know, understanding sarcasm, feigning interest in others, not talking about trains as much as I want to. It‰Ûªs exhausting. Which is why, for twenty minutes a day, I like to go down to that room, turn my mind off and do what I need to do to recharge.",6
27908,Howard,8, But what are you doing in there?,6
27909,Raj,8, And what does forty-three mean?,6
27910,Sheldon,8," You don‰Ûªt need to know, you don‰Ûªt deserve to know, and you will never know.",6
27911,Raj,8," Yeah, well, I know how to make your egg salad now.",6
27912,Scene,8," The room in the basement. Sheldon enters, takes out a box, takes a beanbag from the box, then starts playing keepie-uppie,",6
27913,Sheldon,8," One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight‰Û_ Drat. I‰Ûªm never going to get to forty-three again. One, two, three, four‰Û_ Rats.",6
27914,Scene,9, The cafeteria.,6
27915,Leonard,9, They are not.,6
27916,Raj,9," They are, too.",6
27917,Leonard,9, Your hypothesis is completely disconfirmed by all the data. You‰Ûªre just clinging to it out of intellectual stubbornness.,6
27918,Raj,9," No, you‰Ûªre displaying a shocking ignorance of the subject matter. Mummies and zombies are the exact same thing.",6
27919,Leonard,9," Oh, yeah? Mummies are wrapped in bandages.",6
27920,Raj,9, That‰Ûªs called a fashion choice.,6
27921,Leonard,9," All right, you brought this on yourself. Sheldon, get him.",6
27922,Sheldon,9," If a zombie bites you, you turn into a zombie. However, if a mummy bites you, all you turn into is some schmo with a mummy bite. So, like a zombie, that‰Ûªs been eaten from the waist down, you, sir, have no leg to stand on.",6
27923,Leonard,9, Good boy. Here‰Ûªs a cookie.,6
27924,Sheldon,9," Oh, thank you.",6
27925,Howard,9," Hey, fellas, what‰Ûªs going on?",6
27926,Leonard,9," Oh, mummies and zombies again.",6
27927,Howard,9," Oh, they‰Ûªre not the same thing.",6
27928,Leonard,9," You get a cookie, too.",6
27929,Howard,9, Thanks. Guess who picked up his new car this morning?,6
27930,Raj,9, Congratulations. Does it have that new car smell?,6
27931,Howard,9," Yep. For as long as I can keep my mother out of it. If you want to check it out later, it‰Ûªs parked right out front, space 294.",6
27932,Sheldon,9," I‰Ûªm sorry, 294?",6
27933,Howard,9, Yeah.,6
27934,Sheldon,9, That‰Ûªs my parking spot.,6
27935,Raj,9, Why do you have a parking spot? You don‰Ûªt have a car. You don‰Ûªt even drive.,6
27936,Sheldon,9, It doesn‰Ûªt matter. That‰Ûªs my spot.,6
27937,Leonard,9, Maybe they reassigned it because you never use it.,6
27938,Sheldon,9," Well, I‰Ûªm not using my nipples, either. Maybe they should reassign those.",6
27939,Howard,9," Sheldon, someday, if you get a car, I‰Ûªm sure they‰Ûªll give you another parking space.",6
27940,Sheldon,9," I don‰Ûªt want another parking space. I want my parking space. It‰Ûªs perfect. It‰Ûªs a corner spot, cutting the risk of door-dings in half. It‰Ûªs a mere 28 steps from the building entrance. The nearby tree provides shade on hot days and is also home to a delightful squirrel. Which is fortuitous because most squirrels are real jerks.",6
27941,Howard,9," Fun story. Meanwhile, you still don‰Ûªt have a car.",6
27942,Sheldon,9, Don‰Ûªt try to change the subject. This is about a parking space. It has nothing to do with cars.,6
27943,Howard,9, Are you listening to yourself?,6
27944,Sheldon,9," I always listen to myself. It‰Ûªs one of the great joys of my life. Now, get your car out of my spot.",6
27945,Howard,9, Nope.,6
27946,Sheldon,9, Very well. You leave me no choice.,6
27947,Scene,9, The parking spot. Sheldon is trying to push Howard‰Ûªs car out of the spot.,6
27948,Sheldon,9," What are you looking at, you stupid squirrel?",6
27949,Scene,9, The apartment.,6
27950,Sheldon (on phone),9," President Siebert, listen to reason. Yeah, I understand I don‰Ûªt use the parking spot, but that‰Ûªs not the point. I‰Û_ Yes, I‰Ûªm aware you told me not to call you at home, but you didn‰Ûªt answer the door. And I know you were there, because I saw you through the mail slot. Yeah, well, that‰Ûªs some salty language. May I remind you that you‰Ûªre the president of a major university, not the president of the Potty Mouth Club. There it is again. Do you kiss your mother with that mouth? Oh, well, I‰Ûªm sorry for your loss. Good night, sir. Unbelievable. He says Wolowitz deserves my spot because he‰Ûªs a high-profile asset to the university.",6
27951,Leonard,9," Well, he‰Ûªs not wrong. Howard did go to the International Space Station.",6
27952,Sheldon,9," Yeah, that was five weeks ago. How much longer is he gonna milk that cow?",6
27953,Leonard,9," Sheldon, let it go. It‰Ûªs not a big deal.",6
27954,Sheldon,9," No, no, this is a slippery slope, Leonard. It starts with a parking space, where does it end? It‰Ûªs like my dad always said, first they say you can‰Ûªt drink and drive, next thing you know, you can‰Ûªt let your 10-year-old take the wheel while you sleep one off in the backseat.",6
27955,Leonard,9, All that story does is make me feel bad for your mother.,6
27956,Sheldon,9," Leonard, you‰Ûªre my best friend. Why don‰Ûªt you ever take my side?",6
27957,Leonard,9, Because I can never understand your side.,6
27958,Scene,9, Sheldon‰Ûªs office.,6
27959,Howard,9, Give it back.,6
27960,Sheldon,9," I‰Ûªm sorry, but could you be more specific?",6
27961,Howard,9, My Iron Man helmet. Koothrappali saw you take it. Give it back.,6
27962,Sheldon,9," Oh, that. Well, see, I wanted it, and you weren‰Ûªt using it. Apparently, those are the rules we live by now. Payback, it truly is the B word, isn‰Ûªt it?",6
27963,Howard,9," Sheldon, that is a five hundred dollar limited edition collectible, and I want it back.",6
27964,Sheldon,9," I‰Ûªd love to help you out, but unfortunately (puts helmet on), I‰Ûªm using it.",6
27965,Howard,9, Fine. I‰Ûªm taking your diploma.,6
27966,Sheldon,9, Go ahead. That‰Ûªs the only doctorate you‰Ûªll ever get. It smells funny in here.,6
27967,Scene,9, The apartment stairwell.,6
27968,Bernadette,9," We‰Ûªre so proud of you, Amy. Your first bikini wax.",6
27969,Penny,9," Yeah. So, how you doing?",6
27970,Amy,9," A little sensitive, but not bad. Does it always take that long?",6
27971,Penny,9," Uh, no, they usually don‰Ûªt have to go out and get more wax.",6
27972,Amy,9, I feel like I‰Ûªm five pounds lighter.,6
27973,Bernadette,9, Really? Only five?,6
27974,Penny,9," Hey, anybody want a drink?",6
27975,Amy,9, Sure.,6
27976,Bernadette,9," Okay. So, did you spend last night hearing about this silly parking space fight, too?",6
27977,Amy,9," For hours. Fortunately, I couldn‰Ûªt understand most of it ‰Ûªcause Sheldon was wearing that stupid robot mask.",6
27978,Bernadette,9, Howard was so angry I had to mash up Benadryl in his ice cream to get him to fall asleep.,6
27979,Amy,9," I guess this is what we get for being with two testosterone-fueled alpha males. At some point, they‰Ûªre bound to lock horns.",6
27980,Penny,9, I‰Ûªm assuming these are some kind of horns they bought at Comic-Con?,6
27981,Bernadette,9, I‰Ûªm really sorry they took Sheldon‰Ûªs spot away. He shouldn‰Ûªt have to suffer just because Howard‰Ûªs such a big deal now.,6
27982,Amy,9," I know, Sheldon should just let Howard have his little moment in the sun.",6
27983,Bernadette,9, What‰Ûªs that supposed to mean?,6
27984,Amy,9," Well, I mean, Howard‰Ûªs never gonna go to space again, but Sheldon will always be a genius.",6
27985,Bernadette,9," You‰Ûªre right. And I‰Ûªm sure Sheldon will get a fancy parking spot again, if and when he makes a worthwhile contribution to science.",6
27986,Amy,9, If and when?,6
27987,Penny,9," Okay, maybe we should change the subject. Um, Amy, how are your lady parts? Still chilly down there?",6
27988,Bernadette,9, Hang on. None of Sheldon‰Ûªs theories have ever been definitively proven. My husband actually went to outer space.,6
27989,Amy,9, That‰Ûªs an impressive accomplishment. He‰Ûªs now an inspiration to millions of Americans who know you don‰Ûªt have to be special or even qualified to go into space.,6
27990,Penny,9," You know, I remember the first time I got a bikini wax. My sister did it with melted Crayolas and duct tape. It‰Ûªs a bad idea.",6
27991,Bernadette,9," Gosh, Amy. I‰Ûªm sensing a little hostility. Is it maybe because, like Sheldon‰Ûªs work, your sex life is also theoretical?",6
27992,Penny,9, Damn.,6
27993,Amy,9," Yeah, well, at least when we do make love, Sheldon won‰Ûªt be thinking about his mother. And yes, that is a cleverly veiled reference to Howard‰Ûªs lifelong obsession to crawl back into her spacious womb.",6
27994,Penny,9," Anyway, to this day, I still can‰Ûªt see a box of crayons without crossing my legs.",6
27995,Bernadette,9," I don‰Ûªt have to take this. I‰Ûªm gonna go home and have sex with my husband right now. Maybe I‰Ûªll let him do it to me in the parking spot. Which sounds dirty, but I didn‰Ûªt mean it that way,",6
27996,Scene,9, The stairwell.,6
27997,Leonard,9, Sheldon?,6
27998,Sheldon,9, Cookie.,6
27999,Leonard,9, I don‰Ûªt have any.,6
28000,Sheldon,9," Well, I‰Ûªm not giving it away. (Enters apartment. Howard is sitting naked in his spot with a laptop on his lap)",6
28001,Howard,9, Hi Sheldon.,6
28002,Sheldon,9," He‰Ûªs in my spot. Leonard, make him stop being naked in my spot.",6
28003,Leonard,9," Howard, what are you doing?",6
28004,Howard,9, He wasn‰Ûªt using it. And I needed a nice cool piece of leather to wiggle my naked ass on.,6
28005,Sheldon,9, Get off there.,6
28006,Howard,9, Give me back my Iron Man helmet.,6
28007,Sheldon,9, Give me back my parking space.,6
28008,Howard,9, You don‰Ûªt need a parking space. You don‰Ûªt have a car.,6
28009,Sheldon,9, You don‰Ûªt need an Iron Man helmet. You‰Ûªre not Iron Man.,6
28010,Howard,9," Well, we appear to have reached an impasse. And you know, I have to say, I thought you‰Ûªd be more upset that your laptop is sitting on my junk.",6
28011,Raj,9, I didn‰Ûªt pick up on that. That‰Ûªs a nice touch.,6
28012,Leonard,9, Mmm.,6
28013,Scene,9, The parking spot. Sheldon is spraypainting out Howard‰Ûªs name and replacing it with his own.,6
28014,Amy,9, This is so exciting. I‰Ûªm feeling all tingly. Although that could just be my newly defoliated bikini zone.,6
28015,Sheldon,9, Keep a lookout. This place is swarming with campus security. They will not hesitate to scold us.,6
28016,Amy,9, Freaking pigs.,6
28017,Sheldon,9," Oh, yeah. Okay, now, pull your car into the spot and let‰Ûªs get out of here.",6
28018,Amy,9," Wait, I‰Ûªm leaving my car here?",6
28019,Sheldon,9," Yes, and be sure and put on the emergency brake. Really makes these things tough to budge.",6
28020,Amy,9," Before I park, come in the back seat. I want to show you something I had done today.",6
28021,Sheldon,9," All right, colour me intrigued.",6
28022,Amy,9, What do you think?,6
28023,Sheldon,9," I think you‰Ûªre high on paint fumes. And boy, that‰Ûªs a lot of Band-Aids.",6
28024,Scene,9, Howard and Bernadette‰Ûªs apartment.,6
28025,Penny,9," Okay, Howard‰Ûªs mother is in, like, every one of your wedding photos.",6
28026,Bernadette,9," What can I tell ya? She‰Ûªs a big girl. Wherever you look, there she is. More coffee?",6
28027,Penny,9," No, Leonard‰Ûªs taking me to a physics lecture, and coffee‰Ûªll just keep me awake. (Knock on door) Oh, I‰Ûªll get it.",6
28028,Amy,9," Oh, looks like someone‰Ûªs on Team Bernadette. Where‰Ûªs Howard?",6
28029,Bernadette,9, He‰Ûªs not here. What‰Ûªs wrong?,6
28030,Amy,9, He had my car towed. It cost me two hundred dollars to get it back.,6
28031,Bernadette,9," Oh, no. Where was it parked?",6
28032,Amy,9, In Sheldon‰Ûªs spot.,6
28033,Bernadette,9, That doesn‰Ûªt make sense. Sheldon doesn‰Ûªt have a spot. Was it maybe in Howard‰Ûªs spot?,6
28034,Amy,9," Don‰Ûªt play dumb with me, sister. You tell your husband he owes me two hundred dollars.",6
28035,Bernadette,9," Well, that doesn‰Ûªt make sense, either.",6
28036,Amy,9, Why not?,6
28037,Bernadette,9, Because I‰Ûªm the one who had it towed.,6
28038,Amy,9, You?,6
28039,Bernadette,9," Didn‰Ûªt see that one coming, did ya?",6
28040,Amy,9," Oh, yeah? Well, you‰Ûªre not gonna see this coming. (Swings handbag. Bernadette ducks. Penny is hit in the face)",6
28041,Penny,9, Ow! Ow!,6
28042,Amy,9," Oh, my God,",6
28043,Bernadette,9, Are you okay?!,6
28044,Penny,9," You idiot, what the hell do you have in there?!",6
28045,Amy,9," Just my wallet, keys and a coffee can full of change I‰Ûªve been meaning to take to the bank.",6
28046,Bernadette,9, Don‰Ûªt move. I‰Ûªll get some ice.,6
28047,Amy,9, Are you okay?,6
28048,Penny,9, Get away from me or I swear to God I will rip out what‰Ûªs left of your pubes!,6
28049,Bernadette,9, Here.,6
28050,Penny,9, Thanks. Ah!,6
28051,Bernadette,9," Amy, you think maybe this has gotten a little out of hand?",6
28052,Penny,9," Gee, you think?",6
28053,Amy,9," I do. Penny, Bernadette and I are sorry.",6
28054,Bernadette,9, You hit her! What did I do?,6
28055,Amy,9, You had my car towed.,6
28056,Bernadette,9, You were parked in Howard‰Ûªs spot.,6
28057,Amy,9, I was parked in Sheldon‰Ûªs spot.,6
28058,Bernadette,9, Sheldon doesn‰Ûªt have a spot.,6
28059,Penny,9," Guys, I think I need to go to the emergency room.",6
28060,Bernadette,9," Okay, let‰Ûªs go.",6
28061,Amy,9, I‰Ûªll drive. You can see where the tow truck scratched my car.,6
28062,Bernadette,9, The tow truck didn‰Ûªt scratch your car.,6
28063,Amy,9, How do you know?,6
28064,Bernadette,9, ‰Û÷Cause I did it!,6
28065,Scene,9, The parking spot. Sheldon has set up his office in it.,6
28066,Sheldon,9," Morning, Professor Stevens. Don‰Ûªt look at that whiteboard. That‰Ûªs my math, not your math. Keep walking, nosey.",6
28067,Howard,9, What the hell are you doing?,6
28068,Sheldon,9," Oh. You said I‰Ûªm not using my space, so I‰Ûªm using it.",6
28069,Howard,9," Okay, you need to move now.",6
28070,Sheldon,9," No, I don‰Ûªt.",6
28071,Howard,9, You can‰Ûªt stay there forever.,6
28072,Sheldon,9," Actually, I have a plastic baggy strapped to my leg that says I can. Give up, Wolowitz. You‰Ûªve chosen to tangle with a superior intellect you can‰Ûªt defeat. There is nothing you could possibly do to‰Û_ (Howard starts sounding his horn. Sheldon puts on earphones)",6
28073,Howard,9," Those aren‰Ûªt gonna help you, Sheldon,",6
28074,Sheldon,9," Oh, yes, they are. I mean, what?",6
28075,Howard,9," I‰Ûªm warning you, Sheldon!",6
28076,Sheldon,9," Your threats are empty, nothing can move me. (Howard starts pushing his chair with the front of the car) Stop that.",6
28077,Howard,9, Get out of my spot.,6
28078,Sheldon,9, No. That‰Ûªs it. I am calling campus security. You prepare for the scolding of your life.,6
28079,Leonard,9, What are you idiots doing?,6
28080,Sheldon,9," He‰Ûªs trying to kill me, Leonard. Video games and rock music have desensitized him to violence.",6
28081,Howard,9, Would you please talk some sense into your lunatic roommate?,6
28082,Leonard,9, You‰Ûªre both acting like lunatics. It‰Ûªs just a parking spot.,6
28083,Howard,9, It‰Ûªs not just a parking spot. He can‰Ûªt handle the fact that I‰Ûªm a bigger deal than he is now.,6
28084,Sheldon,9," Oh, preposterous. I have been solely responsible for this university‰Ûªs six loop quantum gravity calculations, I have changed the way we think about Bose-Einstein condensates, and I am also the one who got Nutter Butters in the cafeteria vending machine. Maybe you missed that news while you were floating around like a goof in outer space. Now, if you‰Ûªll excuse me, I have work to do.",6
28085,Howard,9, Can you believe this guy?,6
28086,Leonard,9, What I don‰Ûªt believe is that you tried to run him over.,6
28087,Howard,9," Oh, like you‰Ûªve never thought of doing that. Don‰Ûªt hate me just because I lived the dream. (Horn beeps. Sheldon is sitting naked in Howard‰Ûªs car.) ",6
28088,Sheldon,9," Hey, sweet ride.",6
28089,Howard,9, What are you doing in there?,6
28090,Sheldon,9, Just breaking in your new car.,6
28091,Howard,9, Stop that. You stop that.,6
28092,Sheldon,9, You know what they say? Revenge is a dish best served nude.,6
28093,Scene,9, Sheldon‰Ûªs office.,6
28094,Raj,9," Hey, got a minute?",6
28095,Sheldon,9," Oh, of course, come in. (Raj opens door to reveal Howard) This is an authentic Chinese throwing star, and I must warn you, I have seen many people throw them in movies.",6
28096,Raj,9, Calm down. Howard has something he wants to say to you.,6
28097,Howard,9," All right. Sheldon, when this whole thing with the parking space started, I had no idea just how much of a crazy bastard‰Û_",6
28098,Raj,9," Howard, that‰Ûªs not how we practiced it.",6
28099,Howard,9," I had no idea how much that spot meant to you. Anyway, I called President Siebert and told him it‰Ûªs not worth fighting over the spot, so you keep it, and I‰Ûªll park in the structure across the street.",6
28100,Sheldon,9," Well, Howard, thank you. It‰Ûªs quite a gesture on your part. You‰Ûªve shown yourself to be the bigger man.",6
28101,Howard,9, Thank you.,6
28102,Sheldon,9," Which I find totally unacceptable. I must be the bigger man. Therefore, you may use my spot until such time as I learn to drive or get a Batmobile.",6
28103,Howard,9," Wow, okay. Well, thanks. I don‰Ûªt know what to say.",6
28104,Sheldon,9, There is nothing to say. Except I‰Ûªm the bigger man. I‰Ûªm not kidding. Say it.,6
28105,Raj,9, Just say it.,6
28106,Howard,9," You‰Ûªre the bigger man, Sheldon.",6
28107,Sheldon,9," Oh, stop. And I believe this is yours. FYI, if you wear that into a bank, they will tackle you to the ground.",6
28108,Scene,9, The cheesecake factory.,6
28109,Howard,9," I‰Ûªd like to propose a toast, to burying the hatchet.",6
28110,Sheldon,9, To burying the hatchet.,6
28111,Bernadette,9," You know, I‰Ûªm kind of glad this happened.",6
28112,Amy,9," Me, too. In some weird way, I kind of feel like it brought us closer.",6
28113,Penny (with two black eyes and a plaster across her nose),9," Yeah, everybody‰Ûªs happy, great.",6
28114,Scene,9, A dry cleaners.,6
28115,Shopkeeper,9, Can I help you?,6
28116,Sheldon,9," Yes. According to information I gleaned from Yelp, you had great success when a santeriasuzy37 brought you a pair of leather slacks stained with chicken blood. I believe I may have a similar problem. This cushion experienced a nude revenge wiggle.",6
28117,Shopkeeper,9, A what?,6
28118,Sheldon,9," A naked man sat on it. Now, here‰Ûªs my concern, his diet is rich in fatty deli meats. What test do you have to detect lipid residue?",6
28119,Shopkeeper,9, Lipid what?,6
28120,Sheldon,9," Lipid residue. An anal autograph. A colon calling card, if you will.",6
28121,Shopkeeper,9, Tuesday okay?,6
28122,Sheldon,9, Don‰Ûªt rush it. We may be dealing with befoulment on a molecular level.,6
28123,Shopkeeper,9, Let me write you a ticket.,6
28124,Sheldon,9, Is that your son?,6
28125,Shopkeeper,9, Uh-huh.,6
28126,Sheldon,9," Looks like that laptop‰Ûªs seen better days. If you‰Ûªre interested, I‰Ûªm selling this. It‰Ûªs only two years old, 16 gigabytes of RAM, Intel core i7 processor, and I can personally guarantee it has spent less than 20 minutes resting on an astronaut‰Ûªs penis.",6
28127,Scene,10, The apartment.,6
28128,Sheldon,10, Is anyone else troubled by the Spider-Man theme song?,6
28129,Leonard,10," Why would it trouble you? It‰Ûªs, like, your third favourite cartoon theme song.",6
28130,Sheldon,10," It is, right behind do-do-do-do-do Inspector Gadget., and Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, heroes in a half-shell.",6
28131,Howard and Raj (together),10, Turtle power!,6
28132,Sheldon,10," However, the Spider-Man lyrics posit that Spider-Man, Spider-Man does whatever a spider can.",6
28133,Howard,10," Yeah, so?",6
28134,Sheldon,10," I can think of many things Spider-Man can‰Ûªt do that a spider can. One, crawl in your ear and die. Two, legally leave Guatemala without a passport. Three, have sex with a spider.",6
28135,Raj,10, an we change the subject? Spiders give me the jeebie-jeebies.,6
28136,Howard,10, It‰Ûªs heebie-jeebies.,6
28137,Raj,10," I know, but that sounds anti-Semitic. Anyway, I was thinking we could have a little film festival tonight. The theme, movies that killed their franchises.",6
28138,Leonard,10," Oh. Like Jaws 4, Indiana Jones 4, Daredevil 1.",6
28139,Leonard,10," Penny‰Ûªs working tonight, I‰Ûªm in.",6
28140,Howard,10, Not me. I‰Ûªm having dinner with Bernadette and her parents.,6
28141,Leonard,10, Fun. We know how much you love that.,6
28142,Howard,10, It‰Ûªs torture. Especially with her dad. We have nothing in common.,6
28143,Sheldon,10," You know what I like to do when I‰Ûªm forced to speak with those beneath my intellectual station? I bring up an interesting topic, like the difference between Spider-Man and spiders.",6
28144,Howard,10," Thanks, Sheldon. I‰Ûªll try that with my father-in-law.",6
28145,Sheldon,10," No, you can‰Ûªt use that one. That‰Ûªs mine. Uh, try this one for an ice-breaker. Uh, despite popular lore, there is no place in the continental United States, Alaska or Hawaii from which one can dig straight through the centre of the earth and come up in China.",6
28146,Howard,10," Great, thank you.",6
28147,Sheldon,10," Actually, you can‰Ûªt have that one either. It‰Ûªs too good. Sorry.",6
28148,Raj,10," What about you, Sheldon? Do you have any plans tonight?",6
28149,Sheldon,10," Sadly, yes. Amy‰Ûªs taking me to a memorial service. It‰Ûªs for one of her colleagues who is of Asian descent, so my planned conversational gambit is to casually remark that no matter how deep they dig his grave, he‰Ûªll never make his way back to China.",6
28150,Leonard,10, That should lighten the mood.,6
28151,Sheldon,10, What can I say? I put the fun in funeral.,6
28152,Scene,10, Amy‰Ûªs apartment.,6
28153,Sheldon,10," (Knock, knock, knock) Amy. (Knock, knock, knock) Amy. Oh, right, funeral. (Knock, knock, knock) (solemnly) Amy.",6
28154,Amy,10," Hello, Sheldon.",6
28155,Sheldon,10," I‰Ûªm not allowed to wear my Silver Surfer neck tie, but you can wear a bathrobe?",6
28156,Amy,10, I think I‰Ûªm too sick to go to the funeral.,6
28157,Sheldon,10," You‰Ûªre sick? You poor kid. Well, see ya.",6
28158,Amy,10," Sheldon, aren‰Ûªt you gonna take care of me?",6
28159,Sheldon,10," Me? No. No, I‰Ûªm not that kind of doctor.",6
28160,Amy,10," But our relationship agreement clearly states that when one of us is sick, the other must take care of them.",6
28161,Sheldon,10," Oh, no, I see the confusion. No, the intent behind that clause was to force you to take care of me when I‰Ûªm ill. When you‰Ûªre feeling better, you‰Ûªll think that‰Ûªs funny.",6
28162,Amy,10," Never mind. Good night, Sheldon.",6
28163,Sheldon,10," (Knock, knock, knock) Amy. (Knock, knock, knock) Amy. (Knock, knock, knock) Amy. I made a commitment in writing to comfort you in times like this. Additionally, you are my girlfriend, and I care about your well-being.",6
28164,Amy,10," Thank you, Sheldon.",6
28165,Sheldon,10, You‰Ûªre welcome. Now let‰Ûªs get this over with.,6
28166,Scene,10, Howard and Bernadette‰Ûªs apartment. ,6
28167,Howard,10," So, how have you been?",6
28168,Mr. Rostenkowski,10, Fine.,6
28169,Howard,10, Good. Fine is good. How you liking retirement?,6
28170,Mr. Rostenkowski,10, It‰Ûªs fine.,6
28171,Howard,10, I‰Ûªm sensing a theme. You ever really think about the Spider-Man theme song? How‰Ûªs that dinner coming?,6
28172,Bernadette,10, I just put it in. It‰Ûªs gonna be a while.,6
28173,Howard,10, I like rare chicken. Let‰Ûªs do this.,6
28174,Bernadette,10, You could die.,6
28175,Howard,10, Death by chicken. That‰Ûªs a pretty fowl way to go.,6
28176,Mrs. Rostenkowski,10," Here‰Ûªs another beer, honey.",6
28177,Mr. Rostenkowski,10, Thank you.,6
28178,Howard,10," So, Mrs. Rostenkowski, you took that trip to the Grand Canyon. How was it?",6
28179,Mrs. Rostenkowski,10, It was good.,6
28180,Howard,10, Had no idea you were the chatty one.,6
28181,Scene,10, Amy‰Ûªs apartment.,6
28182,Sheldon,10, 102.2. Exactly what it was half an hour ago. It‰Ûªs like you‰Ûªre not even trying to get better.,6
28183,Amy,10," Sheldon, you don‰Ûªt get over the flu in half an hour.",6
28184,Sheldon,10," Well, not with that attitude.",6
28185,Amy,10," I have to say, I‰Ûªm finding your bedside manner a little lacking.",6
28186,Sheldon,10," I‰Ûªm sorry. I just want you to get better as soon as possible. And with that goal in mind, let me ask you a question. Do you believe in the placebo effect?",6
28187,Amy,10, Of course I do. There have been many studies proving its validity.,6
28188,Sheldon,10," Great. Now, this may look like a Tic Tac, but it is really a powerful medication specifically designed to cure your illness as well as freshen your breath.",6
28189,Amy,10," Sheldon, this isn‰Ûªt helping. Why don‰Ûªt you just let me get some rest.",6
28190,Sheldon,10," How can you sleep? I‰Ûªm not done making you feel better. I still have to put a cold rag on your head, sing to you and apply VapoRub to your chest.",6
28191,Amy,10," You, you want to rub something on my chest?",6
28192,Sheldon,10, Yes. All over it.,6
28193,Amy,10, Maybe we should start with that.,6
28194,Sheldon,10," Now you‰Ûªre being a responsible patient. Now, you may notice some tingling.",6
28195,Amy,10," Oh, I‰Ûªm counting on it.",6
28196,Scene,10, Howard and Bernadette‰Ûªs apartment.,6
28197,Howard,10," Okay, dig in.",6
28198,Mr. Rostenkowski,10," Hold up. Bless us, O Lord for these Thy gifts which we are about to receive from Thy bounty through Christ our Lord. Amen.",6
28199,Howard,10, Took the words right out of my mouth.,6
28200,Bernadette,10," So, Dad, have you done any fishing lately?",6
28201,Mr. Rostenkowski,10, I‰Ûªm going next weekend.,6
28202,Howard,10," Oh, you like to fish?",6
28203,Mr. Rostenkowski,10, Yes.,6
28204,Howard,10, Sure. I can hear it in your voice.,6
28205,Mrs. Rostenkowski,10," Oh, if he didn‰Ûªt like it, he wouldn‰Ûªt go.",6
28206,Howard,10," You know, I hadn‰Ûªt thought of that. (To Bernadette, whispering) Help me.",6
28207,Bernadette,10," Hey, Dad, maybe you could take Howard fishing sometime. Give you guys a chance to get to know each other better.",6
28208,Howard,10," No, no. We know each other well enough. He‰Ûªs been talking my ear off all night.",6
28209,Bernadette,10," Howie, I think you‰Ûªd have fun.",6
28210,Mr. Rostenkowski,10," Fine, you can tag along.",6
28211,Bernadette,10, Terrific. My two favorite fellas gone fishin‰Ûª.,6
28212,Howard,10," Well, hang on a second, Bernie. Next weekend, we have that thing.",6
28213,Bernadette,10, What thing?,6
28214,Howard,10," You know, the thing.",6
28215,Bernadette,10," Oh, that thing. No, I cancelled that thing.",6
28216,Mr. Rostenkowski,10," All right, it‰Ûªs settled. You and I are going fishing.",6
28217,Howard,10, Great. (To Bernadette) Thanks for the help.,6
28218,Scene,10, The stairwell.,6
28219,Howard,10, I‰Ûªve never even been fishing. This is gonna be a disaster.,6
28220,Raj,10," If you don‰Ûªt want to look foolish doing something, you should practice. Do you know how many Beef Wellingtons I made by myself before I invited you guys over? I‰Ûªll give you a hint. You can see them here, here and here.",6
28221,Leonard,10, Raj is probably right. You should get someone to give you some pointers.,6
28222,Howard,10, Do either of you guys know how to fish?,6
28223,Leonard,10, No.,6
28224,Raj,10," No. But if you catch anything, I know how to steam it in banana leaves.",6
28225,Howard,10," Come on, we must know somebody who can do manly stuff like this.",6
28226,Scene,10, Penny‰Ûªs apartment.,6
28227,Penny,10, S‰Ûªup?,6
28228,Scene,10, The apartment.,6
28229,Penny,10," Step one, worms.",6
28230,Howard,10, Ew!,6
28231,Penny,10," Okay, right there, ew is one of the things you‰Ûªre not gonna want to say in front of your father-in-law. It‰Ûªs right up there with icky and get it away. Now pick one up.",6
28232,Howard,10, Really?,6
28233,Penny,10, You‰Ûªre gonna have to do it when you‰Ûªre fishing.,6
28234,Howard,10, Okay.,6
28235,Penny,10, What are you waiting for?,6
28236,Howard,10," I don‰Ûªt know, for them to die of natural causes.",6
28237,Penny,10, Just pick up a worm and put him on this hook.,6
28238,Howard,10, Fine. There.,6
28239,Leonard,10," I‰Ûªm no expert, but I think the hook has to go through the worm.",6
28240,Howard,10," Fine. Sorry, Mr. Worm. Sherm. Sherm the Worm.",6
28241,Penny,10," Hey, don‰Ûªt name him. Just jab a hook in his face.",6
28242,Raj,10," You got this, buddy.",6
28243,Leonard,10," Yeah, come on, Howard. Hook that worm.",6
28244,Raj,10, You can do it.,6
28245,Penny,10," That‰Ûªs great. Cheerleading, way to man things up.",6
28246,Scene,10, Amy‰Ûªs apartment. ,6
28247,Sheldon (reading),10," And the control group displayed significantly fewer genetic abnormalities. But, because of flaws in the experimental design relating to environment and diet, they lived inconclusively ever after. The end.",6
28248,Amy,10, That was great. Rub my chest again. (Knock at door) ,6
28249,Sheldon,10," No. I need to get you down for a nap. And for some reason, that VapoRub gets you all fired up. (Opens door)",6
28250,Bernadette,10, How‰Ûªs the poor thing?,6
28251,Sheldon,10," Oh, I‰Ûªm hanging in there. Thanks for asking.",6
28252,Bernadette,10," Okay, Amy, I brought you some drugs we were working on in the lab. This is proving really good for congestion, but there‰Ûªs a slight chance it can make your tears burn like acid, so if you take it, happy thoughts.",6
28253,Sheldon,10," Uh, I‰Ûªm going to draw you a soothing bath. Where‰Ûªs your bath thermometer?",6
28254,Amy,10, I don‰Ûªt have a bath thermometer.,6
28255,Sheldon,10, Fine. Then I‰Ûªm going to draw you a nerve-wracking bath of indeterminate temperature.,6
28256,Bernadette,10, This is a really good expectorant. Although some test subjects reported lactating uncontrollably when they heard music.,6
28257,Amy,10," Okay, okay, here‰Ûªs the deal. I don‰Ûªt need your medicine. I‰Ûªm not sick.",6
28258,Bernadette,10, I don‰Ûªt understand.,6
28259,Amy,10, I got better two days ago. It‰Ûªs just been so nice having Sheldon take care of me.,6
28260,Bernadette,10, So you‰Ûªve just been lying to him?,6
28261,Amy,10, See the stuff in my nose? Rubber cement.,6
28262,Bernadette,10," I don‰Ûªt mean to be judgy, but this is the kind of thing lunatics do.",6
28263,Amy,10, All right. I‰Ûªll tell him.,6
28264,Sheldon (off),10," Amy, would you be strong enough to bathe yourself, or do you need my help?",6
28265,Amy,10, I‰Ûªll tell him tomorrow. Mama needs a bath.,6
28266,Scene,10, The apartment.,6
28267,Penny,10," Now, let‰Ûªs assume, by some miracle, you actually catch a fish. You‰Ûªre going to have to know how to gut it. So, what you‰Ûªre going to do is you‰Ûªre going to take your knife, slice him right up the belly. (Howard gags) You want me to stop?",6
28268,Howard,10," No, I‰Ûªm fine. Keep going.",6
28269,Penny,10," All right. Now, you don‰Ûªt want to cut too deep into its guts, or the blood will just squirt all over your face. (Howard, Leonard and Raj gag) Oh, my God. What is with you guys?",6
28270,Leonard,10, It‰Ûªs not our fault. Our dads never did anything like this with us.,6
28271,Penny,10," What, never?",6
28272,Leonard,10," My dad was an anthropologist. The only father-son time he spent was with a 2,000-year-old skeleton of an Etruscan boy. I hated that kid.",6
28273,Raj,10," Mine just took me to his gynecology office. I got so bored, I‰Ûªd put vaginal lubricant on the bottom of my shoes and pretend I was ice-skating.",6
28274,Howard,10," Yeah, well, my quality father-son time was spending my adolescence looking out the window waiting for my dad to come back someday.",6
28275,Raj,10," Yeah, okay, Howard wins.",6
28276,Leonard,10," You know, maybe we didn‰Ûªt have opportunities like this when we were growing up, but right now, there‰Ûªs a dad that wants to take you on a fishing trip.",6
28277,Howard,10, You‰Ûªre right. Oh! I should do this.,6
28278,Penny,10," Great. Here you go. What you‰Ûªre going to do is you‰Ûªre going to stick your thumb down its throat, grab the guts and pull.",6
28279,Howard,10, Here we go. Oh!,6
28280,Penny,10," Oh, look, it‰Ûªs a female. You can see all the eggs. (All the guys gag)",6
28281,Scene,10, Amy‰Ûªs apartment. Amy is dancing to ‰ÛÏWalking on Sunshine‰Û. Hears door and turns off stereo.,6
28282,Amy,10," Oh, Sheldon, am I glad you‰Ûªre back. Taking a turn for the worst. I think I‰Ûªm going to need another bath.",6
28283,Sheldon,10," I‰Ûªm surprised to hear that. See, the other day, I was concerned that you weren‰Ûªt recovering, so while you were sleeping, I took a cheek swab and had it cultured in the lab.",6
28284,Amy,10, Oh?,6
28285,Sheldon,10," I got the results back. Have you developed any of the following symptoms? A growing nose, or perhaps a warm sensation in the trouser region? Also known as full-blown liar, liar, pants on fire.",6
28286,Amy,10," All right, all right. But I really was sick at the beginning. It‰Ûªs just been so nice having you take care of me.",6
28287,Sheldon,10," It hurts that you would lie to me, Amy. I thought our relationship was based on trust and a mutual admiration that skews in my favour.",6
28288,Amy,10, I feel terrible I did this.,6
28289,Sheldon,10," It pains me to say it, but I think some form of penalty is in order, so as to discourage this type of behaviour in the future.",6
28290,Amy,10, I suppose that‰Ûªs fair. What do you suggest?,6
28291,Sheldon,10," In a perfect world, I‰Ûªd lock you in a stockade in the public square. That probably requires a permit.",6
28292,Amy,10, I could not be allowed to go to the opening of the next Star Trek movie.,6
28293,Sheldon,10," Oh, that seems overly harsh. I mean, you gave in to a human weakness, you didn‰Ûªt kill a man. You know, it‰Ûªs a tad old-school, but my father was not one to spare the rod when my brother would sneak into his truck and drink his driving whiskey.",6
28294,Amy,10, Are you saying you want to spank me?,6
28295,Sheldon,10, I don‰Ûªt want to. But it looks like you left me no choice.,6
28296,Amy,10, That‰Ûªs true. I‰Ûªve been a very bad girl.,6
28297,Scene,10, Bernadette‰Ûªs parents‰Ûª garage. ,6
28298,Howard,10," Hi-ho, hi-ho, it‰Ûªs off to fish we go.",6
28299,Mr. Rostenkowski,10, That‰Ûªs what you‰Ûªre wearing?,6
28300,Howard,10, No good? The guy at the sporting goods store said these are what fishermen wear.,6
28301,Mr. Rostenkowski,10, Maybe in cartoons.,6
28302,Howard,10, Wish I had known that before I posted all those pictures on Facebook.,6
28303,Mr. Rostenkowski,10," All right, let‰Ûªs hit the road. I wouldn‰Ûªt mind shooting some ducks in the morning.",6
28304,Howard,10," Wait, now we‰Ûªre shooting things?",6
28305,Mr. Rostenkowski,10," I like using a big shell. You can‰Ûªt eat them afterwards, but it‰Ûªs fun watching them blow up.",6
28306,Howard,10," Sir, I‰Ûªm flattered that you invited me, and I really want you to like me, but I don‰Ûªt think this trip is the way to do it. And I can‰Ûªt return these things if there‰Ûªs chunks of duck all over them.",6
28307,Mr. Rostenkowski,10," So, why‰Ûªd you agree to come?",6
28308,Howard,10, ‰Û÷Cause Bernadette made me.,6
28309,Mr. Rostenkowski,10," I tried to back out, too. My wife said I had to go.",6
28310,Howard,10," Really? Your wife makes you do stuff? You‰Ûªre a big, scary cop.",6
28311,Mr. Rostenkowski,10," You‰Ûªre an astronaut, and your wife makes you do things, and she‰Ûªs only four feet tall.",6
28312,Howard,10," So, what do we do now? They expect us to go away for the weekend.",6
28313,Mr. Rostenkowski,10, Ah. There‰Ûªs an Indian casino near Palm Springs. You know how to shoot craps?,6
28314,Howard,10," No, but I‰Ûªm not a stranger to dice games. I was the Temple Beth-El Hebrew School Yahtzee champion.",6
28315,Mr. Rostenkowski,10, Mazel tov. I‰Ûªll teach you how to play.,6
28316,Howard,10," Really? Thank you, sir.",6
28317,Mr. Rostenkowski,10, Call me Mike.,6
28318,Howard,10," Okay. Oh, boy, we‰Ûªre just married to a couple of ballbusters, huh, Mike?",6
28319,Mr. Rostenkowski,10, That‰Ûªs my wife and daughter you‰Ûªre talking about.,6
28320,Howard,10, Great couple of gals.,6
28321,Mr. Rostenkowski,10, I wouldn‰Ûªt go that far.,6
28322,Scene,10, Amy‰Ûªs apartment. ,6
28323,Sheldon,10, Are you prepared to receive your punishment?,6
28324,Amy,10, One second. I want to put on some music.,6
28325,Sheldon,10, Why?,6
28326,Amy,10, I don‰Ûªt want to disturb the people next door while you discipline me.,6
28327,Sheldon,10," Very well, then. Get over my knee. Let‰Ûªs begin.",6
28328,Amy,10," Oh, my.",6
28329,Sheldon,10, Excuse me. You‰Ûªre not supposed to be enjoying this.,6
28330,Amy,10, Then maybe you should spank me harder.,6
28331,Sheldon,10, Maybe I will.,6
28332,Amy,10, Ooh!,6
28333,Scene,11, Penny‰Ûªs apartment.,6
28334,Penny,11," Okay, now holding sides of hearth in position, lower mantelpiece assembly onto top tabs.",6
28335,Leonard,11," Look at that, I built a fireplace with my own two hands.",6
28336,Penny,11, You‰Ûªre so butch.,6
28337,Leonard,11," Aw, I got a little paper cut.",6
28338,Penny,11, Of course you did. Your hands are softer than veal.,6
28339,Leonard,11," Oh, before I forget, Saturday I‰Ûªm planning a little Dungeons and Dragons night with the guys.",6
28340,Penny,11, Really? That‰Ûªs how you‰Ûªre gonna spend your Saturday night?,6
28341,Leonard,11," Oh, come on, I hardly ever get a chance to play anymore.",6
28342,Penny,11," Oh, you poor thing. Is having a real-life girlfriend who has sex with you getting in the way of your board games?",6
28343,Leonard,11," Little bit, yeah.",6
28344,Scene,11, The apartment.,6
28345,Amy,11," Oh, great! I‰Ûªve always wanted to play Dungeons and Dragons.",6
28346,Sheldon,11," Yeah, oh, I‰Ûªm sorry. I should‰Ûªve mentioned this earlier. You‰Ûªre not invited.",6
28347,Amy,11, Why not?,6
28348,Sheldon,11," Amy, from time to time, we men need to break free from the shackles of civility and get in touch with our primal animalistic selves.",6
28349,Amy,11, By rolling dice and playing make-believe with little figurines?,6
28350,Sheldon,11," Yeah, like a bunch of savages.",6
28351,Scene,11, Howard and Bernadette‰Ûªs apartment. Bernadette is on the webcam.,6
28352,Bernadette,11, Saturday night? But I‰Ûªve been working late all week. That was gonna be our night.,6
28353,Howard,11," But I have to go. We play as a group. If-if I‰Ûªm not there, then everyone will blame you. They‰Ûªll be all, Bernadette ruined everything. She‰Ûªs the worst. So, you see? I have to play Dungeons and Dragons for the marriage.",6
28354,Bernadette,11, You‰Ûªre an idiot.,6
28355,Howard,11, I‰Ûªm your idiot. Forever.,6
28356,Scene,11, Raj‰Ûªs apartment.,6
28357,Raj,11," So, listen, I know we talked about getting a bite to eat in Silver Lake, and then seeing the Christmas lights in Griffith Park, but Leonard‰Ûªs talking about a big D and D game at his place.",6
28358,Stuart,11, Saturday night just went from crazy to epic. Woo-hoo!,6
28359,Scene,11, The apartment.,6
28360,Leonard,11," All right, Sheldon, to start our quest you need to open this little Christmas gift I got you.",6
28361,Sheldon,11, A Christmas gift? You know I don‰Ûªt enjoy Christmas.,6
28362,Stuart,11, What‰Ûªs wrong with Christmas?,6
28363,Sheldon,11," Oh, where to begin? Trees indoors. Overuse of the words ‰Ûªtis and ‰Ûªtwas. And the absurd custom of one stocking. Everyone knows socks belong in pairs. Who uses one sock?",6
28364,Howard,11,Pirate with a peg leg?,6
28365,Sheldon,11," Actually that helps, thank you.",6
28366,Leonard,11, Would you just look inside?,6
28367,Sheldon,11," Oh, a scroll. I like scrolls. They‰Ûªre my third favourite system of transmitting the written word. After stone tablets and skywriting. You have all been summoned to join a thrilling Dungeons and Dragons adventure. Your quest begins in a secret northern village of elves who have all been massacred. I like where this is heading. Your task is to rescue their leader from a dungeon of ogres. Oh, that‰Ûªs a saucy twist. That leader‰Ûªs name, Santa Claus. No, no, no.",6
28368,Leonard,11," It‰Ûªs actually ho, ho, ho, but you‰Ûªll get the hang of it. Thought it‰Ûªd be fun to make a quest with a holiday theme.",6
28369,Sheldon,11," Fun? Mixing Dungeons and Dragons with Christmas is like making a sandwich of grape jelly, the best-tasting jelly, and petroleum jelly, the worst-tasting jelly.",6
28370,Leonard,11," Okay, here we go. You find yourselves in the smoking remains of Santa‰Ûªs village. Clearly, a great battle has taken place.",6
28371,Raj,11," Oh, man, the first monster I see, I‰Ûªm gonna sneak up behind him, whip out my wand, and shoot my magic all over his ass.",6
28372,Stuart,11, Do you hear yourself when you say these things?,6
28373,Leonard,11," Okay, there are ogre tracks and a trail of broken candy canes in the snow. Sheldon, what do you do?",6
28374,Sheldon,11, I signal my contempt for your cruel plan to shove Christmas joy down my throat by making a gesture that says get a load of this guy.,6
28375,Leonard,11," Fine. Howard, what do you do?",6
28376,Howard,11," I follow the ogre tracks, checking for secret doors along the way.",6
28377,Leonard,11, And you discover a secret door leading to a dark corridor.,6
28378,Howard,11," Okay, guys, let‰Ûªs make a plan, spell casters in the back, warriors in the front.",6
28379,Raj,11," No, screw that noise, I‰Ûªm going in. Hang on, Santa, I‰Ûªm coming for you.",6
28380,Leonard,11," Okay, you run into a room full of weapons, hit a trip wire, a cannon blows your face off, you die, you‰Ûªre out of the game.",6
28381,Raj,11," But, a cannon? Am I really out of the game?",6
28382,Sheldon,11, Lucky.,6
28383,Leonard,11," Okay, come on, moving on.",6
28384,Raj,11," Wait, doesn‰Ûªt anyone have a rod of resurrection? Because if you‰Ûªve got one, I need it bad. Get in here with your rod and give it to me.",6
28385,Stuart,11," Okay, you need to say these things in your head before you say them out loud.",6
28386,Penny (entering),11," Hey, guys. I don‰Ûªt mean to interrupt your little game, but I thought you‰Ûªd like to see what you‰Ûªre missing out on. So, Bernadette? Bernadette‰Ûªs wearing leopard-print pumps and a rack-tastic red dress from Forever 21. And there‰Ûªs Amy, showing all kinds of ankle. In an outfit I‰Ûªm assuming is from Forever 63. And I, myself am wearing a little number that got me out of two speeding tickets and jury duty.",6
28387,Sheldon,11," I know they‰Ûªre making a rhetorical point, I just don‰Ûªt know what it is.",6
28388,Penny,11," See you, boys. We are going drinking.",6
28389,Raj,11," Uh, wait, can I come with you? My character died.",6
28390,Bernadette,11," Sorry, Raj, it‰Ûªs girls‰Ûª night out.",6
28391,Amy,11, Maybe another time.,6
28392,Leonard,11, Okay‰Û_,6
28393,Penny,11, Come on.,6
28394,Raj,11," Ooh! Girls‰Ûª night, girls‰Ûª night! Ooh! Ooh!",6
28395,Stuart,11, How does he not hear that?,6
28396,Scene,11, A bar.,6
28397,Amy,11," So, what‰Ûªs the plan? Are we gonna teach our fellas a lesson by getting stinking drunk, luring strange men into the bathroom, and turning the toilet stall into a temple of the senses?",6
28398,Bernadette,11, No!,6
28399,Penny,11, No!,6
28400,Amy,11," Geez, who‰Ûªs Forever 63 now?",6
28401,Raj,11, Can we get another bottle of champagne for the table? Don‰Ûªt worry. It‰Ûªs my treat.,6
28402,Amy,11, Thanks.,6
28403,Penny,11," Wow, you should come to girls‰Ûª night more often. And not just because if you weren‰Ûªt here, this would be a can of Pabst.",6
28404,Raj,11," My pleasure, nothing makes me happier than the chance to spoil a lady. Just ask my dog. My vet says if I give her any more foie gras, she‰Ûªs going to die of gout.",6
28405,Bernadette,11," Hey, let‰Ûªs help Raj meet a girl tonight.",6
28406,Raj,11," No, no, no, I‰Ûªm fine.",6
28407,Penny,11," Okay, wait, are we talking one-night stand or do we want to get him into a relationship?",6
28408,Amy,11, Let‰Ûªs get him laid!,6
28409,Raj,11, Stop it. You‰Ûªre ruining girls‰Ûª night.,6
28410,Penny,11," Raj, you‰Ûªre a great guy, you‰Ûªre in a bar full of single women, let us help you.",6
28411,Bernadette,11," Yeah, you‰Ûªre a real catch. I know you‰Ûªre shy, but that doesn‰Ûªt mean you shouldn‰Ûªt have someone wonderful in your life.",6
28412,Raj,11, That‰Ûªs sweet of you. But what can you do to help?,6
28413,Bernadette,11," We‰Ûªll nose around, see if we can find a nice girl, and then introduce you.",6
28414,Raj,11," Okay. Well, a couple of things. Don‰Ûªt tell them I come from money. I want them to love me for me. They must be insanely hot. Like, nines or tens.",6
28415,Penny,11, Nines or tens?,6
28416,Raj,11," Okay, an eight is acceptable if she‰Ûªs willing to bring another eight to the hot tub.",6
28417,Bernadette,11," Bottom line, you‰Ûªll take any woman who‰Ûªll have you, right?",6
28418,Raj,11, In a New Delhi minute.,6
28419,Scene,11, The apartment.,6
28420,Stuart,11, I don‰Ûªt remember you buying these miniatures in my store.,6
28421,Leonard,11," Oh, uh, yeah. I got ‰Ûªem on Amazon.",6
28422,Stuart,11, Sure. I get it. Why support a friend when you can support a multinational conglomerate that is crushing the life out of that friend?,6
28423,Leonard,11," I know, but when I shop online, I can do it on the toilet.",6
28424,Stuart,11, Have you seen my store? The whole place is a toilet.,6
28425,Howard,11, Can we please move this along?,6
28426,Leonard,11," Yeah, sorry. Uh, you come to the end of the tunnel and find a large chest. What do you do? And, Howard, do not say, I feel up the large chest.",6
28427,Howard,11," Excuse me, I‰Ûªm a married man now. I wasn‰Ûªt going to say anything so juvenile.",6
28428,Leonard,11, Great. What do you do?,6
28429,Howard,11," I walk up to the large chest, bury my face in it and go ‰ÛÏblublublublublublublublu‰Û",6
28430,Sheldon,11, I open the chest.,6
28431,Leonard,11," It‰Ûªs locked, but suddenly the door behind you slams shut and now the walls of the room start closing in.",6
28432,Stuart,11, That‰Ûªs not good. My character and I both have claustrophobia.,6
28433,Leonard,11," Glowing letters appear on the chest that read, If squashed to death you wish not to be, sing of Svaty Vaclav and his victory.",6
28434,Howard,11, Who the hell is Svaty Vaclav?,6
28435,Leonard,11, Walls are getting closer.,6
28436,Stuart,11," Oh, boy, happy place, happy place.",6
28437,Sheldon,11," Wait, Svaty Vaclav was the Duke of Bohemia.",6
28438,Leonard,11," You‰Ûªre ten seconds away from getting crushed. Nine, eight.",6
28439,Howard,11, What are we supposed to do?,6
28440,Leonard,11," Seven, six.",6
28441,Sheldon,11," Wait, wait. Svaty Vaclav is better known as Good King Wenceslas from the beloved Victorian Christmas carol.",6
28442,Howard,11, Never heard of it. Must be the one Christmas song not written by a Jewish guy.,6
28443,Leonard,11," Three, two.",6
28444,Stuart,11, Somebody sing the damn song.,6
28445,Sheldon,11," Good King Wenceslas looked out, on the feast of Stephen. When the snow lay ‰Ûªround about, deep and crisp and even",6
28446,Leonard,11, The walls are getting slower.,6
28447,Sheldon,11," Brightly shone the moon that night, though the frost was cruel. When a poor man came in sight gathering winter fuel.",6
28448,Leonard,11,The walls stop. You‰Ûªre safe.,6
28449,Howard,11," That was amazing, Sheldon.",6
28450,Stuart,11, How did you know that?,6
28451,Sheldon,11," It was simple. I combined a well-known historical fact about Bohemia with the memory of my grandparents, Mee-Maw and Pop-Pop, singing Christmas carols while I sat in front of the fire and tried to build a high-energy particle accelerator out of Legos.",6
28452,Leonard,11," Okay, continuing our quest.",6
28453,Sheldon,11," W-W-Wait. There‰Ûªs still four more verses. You don‰Ûªt sing a song and not finish it. Hither, page, and stand by me, if thou know‰Ûªst it, telling. Yonder peasant, who is he? Where and what his dwelling? Brightly shone the moon that night, though the frost‰Û_",6
28454,Scene,11, The bar. ,6
28455,Bernadette,11, Looks like he‰Ûªs doing pretty good.,6
28456,Penny,11," Of course he is. Look, that girl just got dumped by her boyfriend. She‰Ûªs angry, she‰Ûªs drunk, and her favorite movie is Slumdog Millionaire. I mean.",6
28457,Amy,11, That is some low-hanging fruit.,6
28458,Bernadette,11," Oh, here he comes.",6
28459,Penny,11," So, how‰Ûªd it go?",6
28460,Raj,11," Great. I bought her a couple of drinks, and she gave me her e-mail address.",6
28461,Penny,11, Ooh!,6
28462,Bernadette,11, Jennifer at not-even-if-you-were-the-last-guy-on-earth dot loser.,6
28463,Raj,11, What?,6
28464,Bernadette,11," I‰Ûªm sorry, Raj.",6
28465,Raj,11," Why can‰Ûªt I find someone? I‰Ûªm smart, I‰Ûªve got a cool job, and my naturally bronzed complexion means I can pull off mustard yellow in a way most guys can‰Ûªt.",6
28466,Penny,11," Oh, honey, it‰Ûªs not you, it‰Ûªs them.",6
28467,Raj,11," No, it‰Ûªs not. She was too beautiful for me.",6
28468,Bernadette,11, Why would you say that?,6
28469,Raj,11, It‰Ûªs true. I‰Ûªm always attracted to women I can‰Ûªt have. I do it all the time. I did the same thing with the two of you.,6
28470,Amy,11, The two of them? I don‰Ûªt understand.,6
28471,Raj,11," Well, uh, there was a time when I had a thing for Penny, and I thought she was into me, too, because she got drunk and naked and climbed into bed with me. But apparently I misread those signals.",6
28472,Amy,11, And you liked Bernadette also?,6
28473,Raj,11, That was before Penny. I make it a rule to only fall for one of my friends‰Ûª girlfriends at a time. I‰Ûªm very old-fashioned that way.,6
28474,Amy,11," So at, uh, some point, you probably had a thing for me, too.",6
28475,Raj,11," No, not really.",6
28476,Penny,11," Oh, come on, Raj, not even a little bit?",6
28477,Raj,11, Not that I can think of.,6
28478,Bernadette,11, Think harder.,6
28479,Raj,11," Nope. I guess the heart wants what the heart wants. Or in this case, doesn‰Ûªt, I mean, at all. What?",6
28480,Scene,11, The apartment. Sheldon is still singing.,6
28481,Sheldon,11," Ye who now will bless the poor, shall yourselves find blessing. Ba-da-bum.",6
28482,Howard,11, Done?,6
28483,Sheldon,11, I think the word you‰Ûªre looking for is bravo.,6
28484,Leonard,11," Okay, you leave the room and find yourself standing before a pool of melted snowmen.",6
28485,Sheldon,11, Melted snowmen? Are there carrots and lumps of coal in the water?,6
28486,Leonard,11, I don‰Ûªt know. What‰Ûªs the difference?,6
28487,Sheldon,11," Well it‰Ûªs a game of the imagination, Leonard. Paint a picture.",6
28488,Leonard,11, Fine. You leave the room and find yourself standing before a pool of melted snowmen. There are carrots and lumps of coal in the water.,6
28489,Sheldon,11, What happened to the top hats and the corncob pipes?,6
28490,Leonard,11," You see those, too.",6
28491,Sheldon,11," Oh, it‰Ûªs like I‰Ûªm really there.",6
28492,Stuart,11," I gotta tell you, this, this is the most holiday fun I‰Ûªve had since my therapist changed my anxiety medication and I stopped caring about the blood in my stool.",6
28493,Howard,11, Good story.,6
28494,Leonard,11, What are you drinking there? A little eggnog?,6
28495,Sheldon,11," Yes. What, is there a problem?",6
28496,Leonard,11," No, it‰Ûªs nice to see you enjoying a holiday beverage. Pretty Christmassy.",6
28497,Sheldon,11, Since when is eggnog a Christmas drink? Eggs are available all year ‰Ûªround. I‰Ûªve been known to enjoy this poolside.,6
28498,Leonard,11," Come on, Sheldon. You know all the Christmas stories, and the carols, you‰Ûªve got an eggnog moustache going on there. Just admit it. You‰Ûªre getting a little Yuletide spirit.",6
28499,Sheldon,11," Oh, don‰Ûªt be silly. Christmas is a bunch of baloney created by the tinsel industry. Why is this so important to you?",6
28500,Leonard,11," Honestly, because I had enough crappy Christmases as a kid and I‰Ûªm tired of you sucking the joy out of them now.",6
28501,Stuart,11, What was so bad about them?,6
28502,Leonard,11," I grew up in a house full of crazy academics. Instead of leaving Santa milk and cookies, we had to leave him a research paper. And in the morning, you could tell he‰Ûªd been there because the paper would be graded.",6
28503,Sheldon,11, No wonder you love Christmas. That sounds amazing.,6
28504,Leonard,11, It wasn‰Ûªt amazing. I got a C-minus four years in a row.,6
28505,Sheldon,11," Yeah, I‰Ûªm familiar with your work. C-minus was your gift.",6
28506,Scene,11, The bar.,6
28507,Raj,11," Amy, I‰Ûªm really sorry. I didn‰Ûªt mean to upset you.",6
28508,Amy,11," It‰Ûªs fine. I‰Ûªm used to being the girl who never gets looked at twice. I didn‰Ûªt have my first kiss till I was 22, and the guy only did it so I‰Ûªd give him back his insulin.",6
28509,Bernadette,11, Sometimes the pancreas wants what the pancreas wants.,6
28510,Amy,11, Forget it. I don‰Ûªt expect you guys to understand.,6
28511,Raj,11," I understand. In seventh grade, I played Spin the Bottle and it landed on Alina Shankar. She said if I came near her, she would break the bottle and cut me.",6
28512,Amy,11," You think that‰Ûªs bad? In college, I passed out at a frat party and woke up with more clothes on.",6
28513,Raj,11," Sometimes I get so lonely, I sit on my left hand until it goes numb, then I put it in my right hand and pretend I‰Ûªm holding hands with another person.",6
28514,Amy,11," I do that, too. Sometimes the left hand tries to cop a feel. And I let it.",6
28515,Raj,11, It‰Ûªs kind of nice to talk to someone who understands what it feels like to be alone.,6
28516,Amy,11," It is, isn‰Ûªt it?",6
28517,Raj,11, But you‰Ûªre not alone anymore. Now you‰Ûªve got Sheldon.,6
28518,Amy,11," I do. And don‰Ûªt worry, someday you‰Ûªll have somebody, too.",6
28519,Raj,11, Thank you. I hope she‰Ûªs half as lovely and amazing as you are.,6
28520,Amy,11," Thank you, Rajesh. He wants me, I‰Ûªm good. We can go now.",6
28521,Raj,11, Damn it.,6
28522,Penny,11, What?,6
28523,Raj,11," Now that I know she doesn‰Ûªt like me, I‰Ûªm kind of into her.",6
28524,Scene,11, The apartment. Sheldon is writing numbers on a whiteboard.,6
28525,Sheldon,11, All right. I think I cracked the code to lower the drawbridge.,6
28526,Howard,11, Great. Let‰Ûªs do it. (They pick up bells and play according to the numbers. The tune is Jingle Bells),6
28527,Leonard,11, The drawbridge is lowering.,6
28528,Stuart,11, My carpal tunnel‰Ûªs acting up.,6
28529,Sheldon,11, Play through the pain.,6
28530,Leonard,11," You did it. The drawbridge is down. You cross the chasm and find yourself in a small dungeon room. And in the corner, chained to the wall, you see a bloodied and beaten Santa Claus. He says, ho, ho, help me.",6
28531,Howard,11," Yes, we found Santa. Christmas is saved. Don‰Ûªt ever tell my mother I said that.",6
28532,Stuart,11, I take out my skeleton key and run to Santa to unchain him.,6
28533,Sheldon,11," But first, I cast a spell of paralysis on Stuart and Howard.",6
28534,Howard,11," Wait, what are you doing?",6
28535,Sheldon,11," You can‰Ûªt talk, you‰Ûªre paralyzed. I get right up in Santa‰Ûªs big, fat face and say, well, well, well, jolly old Saint Nick, we meet again. Yeah, I believe the last time we spoke was in the Baybrook Mall in Galveston, Texas, when I was five years old, isn‰Ûªt that right?",6
28536,Leonard,11," Uh, okay.",6
28537,Sheldon,11," My mother dragged me there and she plopped me down on your lap and you asked me what I wanted for Christmas. And I told you, my Pop-Pop, because that was the year my grandfather died. I missed him and I wanted him back.",6
28538,Leonard,11," This is weird, right?",6
28539,Sheldon,11," Pop-Pop was the only one in my family who encouraged me to pursue science. But you didn‰Ûªt bring him back, did you? No, instead, I got Lincoln Logs. Well, you can build a lot of neat things out of Lincoln Logs, but Pop-Pop ain‰Ûªt one of ‰Ûªem. And now you‰Ûªre here asking me for something, to save you. Well, sorry, Mr. Kringle, but today‰Ûªs not your day. I‰Ûªm leaving you here to rot, and I hope the ogres feast on your bones. I take the skeleton key, and I toss it into the chasm, and on the way out, I give Santa a swift kick in his bowl full of jelly!",6
28540,Leonard,11," Okay. So Wolowitz and Stuart are paralyzed, Santa‰Ûªs dead, and I picked this over having sex with my girlfriend.",6
28541,Scene,11," The apartment, late at night. ",6
28542,Sheldon,11, Santa?,6
28543,Santa,11," Oh, hello, Sheldon. You should be asleep.",6
28544,Sheldon,11," Well, then, you shouldn‰Ûªt have jingle bells on your boots.",6
28545,Santa,11," Oh. I‰Ûªve been wanting to talk to you. I‰Ûªm sorry I disappointed you when you were a little boy. I can do a lot of magical things, but unfortunately bringing your Pop-Pop back isn‰Ûªt one of them.",6
28546,Sheldon,11, I understand.,6
28547,Santa,11, But I do have something special for you. Close your eyes.,6
28548,Sheldon,11," Oh, I hope it‰Ûªs a train.",6
28549,Santa,11," Oh, it‰Ûªs better than a train.",6
28550,Sheldon,11, Two trains?,6
28551,Santa,11, Better.,6
28552,Sheldon,11, I‰Ûªm getting three trains.,6
28553,Santa,11," Okay, open ‰Ûªem. (It‰Ûªs a cannon, pointed at Sheldon) This is for leaving me in the dungeon to be eaten alive by ogres!",6
28554,Sheldon,11," Wait, uh, uh, hang on. In my defense‰Û_",6
28555,Santa,11," Ho, ho, ho, ya big dork. (Fires cannon)",6
28556,Scene,12, The apartment.,6
28557,Sheldon,12," Well, I must say, Leonard, when I first heard your idea for Giant Jenga, I was sceptical.",6
28558,Leonard,12, I can‰Ûªt blame you. Tiny Twister was a complete bust.,6
28559,Sheldon,12," No, I was wrong. The looming threat of being crushed under a pile of lumber does add a certain spice. I‰Ûªve never felt so alive. (Answers door) Oh, hello, Alex. Uh, let me go get you last night‰Ûªs recordings.",6
28560,Leonard,12, What recordings?,6
28561,Sheldon,12," Well, you remember when you told me I talk in my sleep? Well, it occurred to me that, like most things I say, it‰Ûªs probably pure gold. So I started recording it all, and now Alex gets to comb through eight hours of what I like to call Sheldon After Dark.",6
28562,Alex,12," Hey, Leonard.",6
28563,Leonard,12, Hey. Just playing a little Giant Jenga here.,6
28564,Alex,12," Oh, I know, I‰Ûªm the one who had to buy him the helmet. So, do you have any plans this weekend?",6
28565,Leonard,12," Well, most of Saturday‰Ûªs gonna be figuring out where to put this game when we‰Ûªre done. How about you?",6
28566,Alex,12," Oh, I‰Ûªm gonna go see Kip Thorne give a lecture on subatomic space-time.",6
28567,Leonard,12, Ooh. That‰Ûªs his take on John Wheeler‰Ûªs quantum foam. That should be great.,6
28568,Alex,12," Well, if you want, you can come with me.",6
28569,Leonard,12," Ah, I‰Ûªd love to, but I‰Ûªm supposed to hang out with Penny.",6
28570,Alex,12," Well, bring her.",6
28571,Leonard,12," Well, she‰Ûªs not really into that kind of stuff.",6
28572,Alex,12," Yeah, okay. Well, if you want to hear about the lecture, I can tell you all about it at work, or, you know, over dinner sometime.",6
28573,Leonard (jumping and knocking over the Jenga),12, What?,6
28574,Sheldon,12," Jenga, I win!",6
28575,Scene,12, The cafeteria.,6
28576,Howard,12," Oh, come on, that can‰Ûªt be true.",6
28577,Raj,12," I did the research. Tony the Tiger, Dig‰Ûªem the Frog, Cap‰Ûªn Crunch, Toucan Sam, Count Chocula, Trix the Rabbit, Snap, Crackle and Pop. Not one cereal mascot is a girl. It‰Ûªs a total breakfast sausage fest.",6
28578,Leonard,12, Are we done with this?,6
28579,Raj,12," Almost. Franken Berry, Boo Berry, Sugar Bear and the Honey Nut Cheerio bee, I believe his name is Buzz.",6
28580,Leonard,12, Terrific. Something weird happened and I don‰Ûªt know what to do about it.,6
28581,Howard,12, What‰Ûªs going on?,6
28582,Leonard,12, Sheldon‰Ûªs assistant asked me on a date last night.,6
28583,Raj,12, How could you do that to me? You know I‰Ûªve been working it with Alex for weeks.,6
28584,Leonard,12, Working it? You can‰Ûªt even talk to her.,6
28585,Raj,12, I talk with my eyes.,6
28586,Howard,12, You look like my little cousin when he‰Ûªs dropping one in his diaper.,6
28587,Leonard,12, She knows I have a girlfriend. It‰Ûªs so weird.,6
28588,Raj,12," Oh, my God. You‰Ûªre loving this.",6
28589,Leonard,12," To my bones. I mean, I‰Ûªm not gonna do anything about it. I love Penny. It‰Ûªs just nice to have a young, attractive woman sniffing around the goods.",6
28590,Raj,12, I both hate you and want to be you. This is Ryan Gosling all over again.,6
28591,Sheldon,12," Ah, gentlemen, what is on the conversational menu this morning?",6
28592,Raj,12," Leonard stole my woman, and he knew full well I was only six to eight months away from making my move.",6
28593,Leonard,12, I didn‰Ûªt steal anyone.,6
28594,Raj,12, Your assistant is totally hitting on this jerk and he loves it.,6
28595,Sheldon,12," Well, that‰Ûªs not acceptable. I mean, I‰Ûªm her boss. She needs to be solely focused on my needs, not distracted by your pasty, androgynous brand of sexuality.",6
28596,Leonard,12, I‰Ûªm androgynous?,6
28597,Sheldon,12," Oh, please. Look at you with your pouty bee-stung lips.",6
28598,Leonard,12, What do you guys think I should do?,6
28599,Raj,12," I say you tell Alex your heart belongs to Penny, I provide her a shoulder to cry on, and then roughly half a year later I give it to her good.",6
28600,Scene,12, Amy‰Ûªs apartment.,6
28601,Sheldon,12," I want to thank you all for coming on such short notice. Uh, in the past, I‰Ûªve reached out to each of you individually, but I believe my present situation requires the collective wisdom of the group, which as you can see from your commemorative T-shirts I have dubbed Sheldon Cooper‰Ûªs Council of Ladies.",6
28602,Penny,12, What is happening?,6
28603,Sheldon,12," I need your advice about a delicate workplace situation. Uh, to protect those involved, I‰Ûªll be changing their names.",6
28604,Bernadette,12, Who‰Ûªs involved?,6
28605,Sheldon,12," Well, a short, bespectacled colleague of mine who lives in the shadow of his brilliant roommate. Let‰Ûªs call this colleague Ricardo Shilly-Shally.",6
28606,Penny,12, You‰Ûªre talking about Leonard.,6
28607,Sheldon,12," No, no, Shilly-Shally has red hair and, uh, he briefly served in the Mexican Navy. Anyway, despite the fact that he has a girlfriend, Shilly-Shally has been the recipient of inappropriate workplace flirtations from a young lady.",6
28608,Amy,12," It‰Ûªs your assistant Alex, isn‰Ûªt it?",6
28609,Sheldon,12, No. No. No. This is Tondelaya della Ventimiglia.,6
28610,Penny,12," Wait, what the hell‰Ûªs going on with Leonard and Alex?",6
28611,Sheldon,12," No, uh, no, I‰Ûªm sorry. Who‰Ûªs talking about Leonard and Alex?",6
28612,Penny,12, Fine. Ricardo and Tondelaya.,6
28613,Sheldon,12," Okay, look, it‰Ûªs not really about Ricardo and Tondelaya. It is really about her boss, who doesn‰Ûªt quite know how to handle this situation and could use your advice, which is surprising because Dr. Einstein Von Brainstorm, he‰Ûªs usually pretty smart about these things.",6
28614,Penny,12, I‰Ûªm gonna kill her.,6
28615,Bernadette,12, I‰Ûªm sure you‰Ûªve got nothing to worry about. Leonard would never cheat on you.,6
28616,Amy,12," She‰Ûªs right. But say the word, I got a lab full of cocaine-addicted monkeys with nothing to lose. One of them could end up in the backseat of her car. Or her shower.",6
28617,Sheldon,12," Ladies, ladies, please. We‰Ûªre not here to talk about Penny, okay? We‰Ûªre here to talk about me. Uh, I mean Einstein Von Brainstorm. Oh, darn it! All right, I guess the cat‰Ûªs out of the bag. Let me explain what‰Ûªs going on. Ricardo is really Leonard.",6
28618,Penny,12," We know what‰Ûªs going on, Sheldon!",6
28619,Sheldon,12," Well, what should I do?",6
28620,Bernadette,12," Well, Alex is your employee. If she‰Ûªs doing something that‰Ûªs making Leonard uncomfortable, you should talk to her.",6
28621,Sheldon,12," Oh, no, he‰Ûªs not uncomfortable at all. No, he‰Ûªs loving it. Yeah, he‰Ûªs strutting around like he‰Ûªs five-foot-six.",6
28622,Penny,12, What? He‰Ûªs loving it?,6
28623,Bernadette,12," Sheldon, you need to talk to Alex right away.",6
28624,Sheldon,12," Talk to her? That‰Ûªs all you‰Ûªve got? With a cool name like Sheldon Cooper‰Ûªs Council of Ladies, I really expected more. Give me back the T-shirts.",6
28625,Scene,12, Sheldon‰Ûªs office.,6
28626,Sheldon,12," Alex, check my schedule. What does my afternoon look like?",6
28627,Alex,12," I think it‰Ûªs pretty wide open. Oh, wait. Here‰Ûªs something at four o‰Ûªclock. Give Alex a talking to?",6
28628,Sheldon,12," Well, that snuck up on us, didn‰Ûªt it?",6
28629,Alex,12, Is there a problem?,6
28630,Sheldon,12, Let‰Ûªs not call it a problem. Let‰Ûªs call it an opportunity. To solve a serious problem.,6
28631,Alex,12, What did I do?,6
28632,Sheldon,12," You don‰Ûªt know? Oh, you poor dear. Your ovaries are squirting so much goofy juice into your brains you don‰Ûªt even know which way is up. You made an inappropriate sexual advance towards Dr. Hofstadter.",6
28633,Alex,12, What? I didn‰Ûªt make a sexual advance on anybody.,6
28634,Sheldon,12," Now, there‰Ûªs no need to get defensive. I‰Ûªm not unsympathetic to your plight. My father used to say that a woman is like an egg salad sandwich on a warm Texas day.",6
28635,Alex,12, What?,6
28636,Sheldon,12, Full of eggs and only appealing for a short time.,6
28637,Alex,12, This conversation is making me uncomfortable.,6
28638,Sheldon,12," Yeah, you and me both, sister. Now, please understand, I don‰Ûªt hold you responsible for your behaviour because, see, from an evolutionary standpoint, you‰Ûªre a slave to your desire to reproduce. But during the work day, when you feel possessed by amorous intent, may I suggest that you suppress it by leafing through this illustrated book of sexually transmitted diseases? Let‰Ûªs see here. Oh, yes. Check out this oozy doozy.",6
28639,Alex,12, I have to go.,6
28640,Sheldon,12," So does this fellow, but he can‰Ûªt without it burning like hot soup.",6
28641,Scene,12, The stairwell.,6
28642,Leonard,12," Hey, pretty lady.",6
28643,Penny,12," Oh, you seem extra happy.",6
28644,Leonard,12," Uh, I guess I am.",6
28645,Penny,12, Any particular reason why?,6
28646,Leonard,12," I don‰Ûªt know, just having a good day. This morning Sheldon fell asleep on the way to work, so I got to listen to the radio. That was pretty crazy.",6
28647,Penny,12, Mm-hmm. Anything else?,6
28648,Leonard,12, Mm. I found this quiz online called Which Star Trek Character Are You? and it only took me four tries to get Captain Kirk.,6
28649,Penny,12, That‰Ûªs great.,6
28650,Leonard,12, Oh. It. Was.,6
28651,Penny,12," Hmm. Well, I‰Ûªm glad you‰Ûªre having such a great day.",6
28652,Leonard,12, Yeah. And the one thing that could make it even better is an evening with my special girl.,6
28653,Penny,12," Oh, and who‰Ûªs that?",6
28654,Leonard,12, What do you mean?,6
28655,Penny,12," Oh, I just didn‰Ûªt know if you meant me or Alex.",6
28656,Leonard,12," Um, why would I mean Alex?",6
28657,Penny,12, Because I know she hit on you and I know you liked it.,6
28658,Leonard,12, What?,6
28659,Penny,12," Don‰Ûªt play dumb with me, Ricardo Shilly-Shally!",6
28660,Leonard,12, I‰Ûªm missing something. (Enters apartment. To Sheldon) Did you say something to Penny about Alex?,6
28661,Sheldon,12," Oh, yes. Yeah, and a fat lot of good it did me. All she did was get mad at you.",6
28662,Leonard,12, Why would you do that?,6
28663,Sheldon,12," I needed advice about a woman. I would have asked you, but if the last few years have proven anything, it‰Ûªs that you can‰Ûªt tell a uterus from a unicycle.",6
28664,Leonard,12, At least I know not to blab to a girl about somebody flirting with her boyfriend.,6
28665,Sheldon,12," Good to know. Yeah, a few more helpful hints like that, you may find yourself on the Council of Ladies. (Answering phone) Hello. I see. Uh, what time? Very well, then. Huh. That was the Human Resources Department at the university. Apparently, my assistant Alex has filed a complaint accusing me of inappropriate behaviour in the workplace.",6
28666,Leonard,12," Oh, my God, what did you do?",6
28667,Sheldon,12," Hmm, let me think. Nothing. I‰Ûªm a delight.",6
28668,Scene,12, The Human Resources Department.,6
28669,Sheldon,12," (Knock, knock, knock) Human Resources Department. (Knock, knock, knock) Human Resources Department. (Knock, knock, knock) Human Resources Department.",6
28670,HR Woman,12, Come in.,6
28671,Sheldon,12, Hello.,6
28672,HR Woman,12," Ah, Dr. Cooper, have a seat.",6
28673,Sheldon,12, Thank you.,6
28674,HR Woman,12, I called you in today because your assistant Alex Jensen has lodged a complaint against you.,6
28675,Sheldon,12," So I‰Ûªve been told. But I can‰Ûªt understand what she has to complain about. I mean, she has a front-row seat as I make scientific history. There‰Ûªs string cheese in my mini-fridge, and that‰Ûªs for anyone. Yeah, and just yesterday I led her away from a life of sexual promiscuity by making her look at pictures of disease-ridden genitalia.",6
28676,HR Woman,12," Cancel my next appointment. This is gonna take a while. Dr. Cooper, you said things to your employee that you just cannot say in the workplace.",6
28677,Sheldon,12, Like what?,6
28678,HR Woman,12," Well, according to Ms. Jensen, you said that she was a slave to her biological urges and called her an egg salad sandwich. I don‰Ûªt even know what that means, but I‰Ûªm gonna go ahead and tell you you can‰Ûªt say it.",6
28679,Sheldon,12," Oh! I see the confusion here. No, no, Alex thought I was singling her out. No. I meant that all women are slaves to their biological urges, you know? Even you. You‰Ûªre a slave.",6
28680,HR Woman,12, I‰Ûªm a what?,6
28681,Sheldon,12," Well, y-you, I-I‰Ûªm just saying, you know, at a certain point in a woman‰Ûªs menstrual cycle‰Û_",6
28682,HR Woman,12," Whuh-ah! Woah! You can‰Ûªt talk about that, either, Dr. Cooper. Your language is entirely inappropriate, and I‰Ûªm gonna advise that you shut your mouth right now.",6
28683,Sheldon,12," I don‰Ûªt see why I‰Ûªm the one being persecuted here. Dr. Hofstadter, he was bragging about his sexual desirability to anyone who would listen. You know, and Howard Wolowitz, he spent two years using university resources building a six-breasted sex robot. Oh, and at the office Christmas party, I heard Rajesh Koothrappali refer to you several times as Brown Sugar.",6
28684,HR Woman (writing),12, Hofstadter‰Û_ Wolowitz‰Û_ and the last one was Rajesh Koothrappali?,6
28685,Sheldon,12," Yes. No, yeah, but in his defense, that wasn‰Ûªt racist. He‰Ûªs also brown.",6
28686,Scene,12, Penny‰Ûªs apartment. Penny answers the door. Leonard is playing his cello outside.,6
28687,Leonard (singing),12," I‰Ûªm sorry Alex hit on me, hit on me, hit on me. I‰Ûªm sorry Alex hit on me, I‰Ûªd no idea I‰Ûªm cute.",6
28688,Penny,12," Oh, damn it, you are.",6
28689,Leonard,12, Please forgive me. I should have told you about Alex.,6
28690,Penny,12," I don‰Ûªt care about Alex. Fine, I care. Okay, I hate that bitch. But what really hurt is that you liked it so much. I mean, do I need to be worried?",6
28691,Leonard,12, Of course not. No. Why?,6
28692,Penny,12," Because, she is pretty and smart, and when you talk about work, she doesn‰Ûªt have to go home and look up words in the dictionary to understand what you said.",6
28693,Leonard,12, You do that?,6
28694,Penny,12, No.,6
28695,Leonard,12," Hang on. Are you feeling insecure? Because that‰Ûªs my thing, and if you take it away, I don‰Ûªt know what I‰Ûªm bringing to this relationship.",6
28696,Penny,12," Yes, Leonard, I am insecure. Happy?",6
28697,Leonard,12," No, I‰Ûªm not happy.",6
28698,Penny,12, Why are you smiling?,6
28699,Leonard,12, I‰Ûªm sorry. I just never think of you having feelings like that.,6
28700,Penny,12," Well, I do.",6
28701,Leonard,12, Why? Nothing is ever going to happen between me and Alex.,6
28702,Penny,12, Good.,6
28703,Leonard,12, Come here. Tell you a secret?,6
28704,Penny,12, What‰Ûªs that?,6
28705,Leonard,12," With all these women chasing me, I kind of do feel like Captain Kirk.",6
28706,Penny,12, Can I tell you a secret?,6
28707,Leonard,12, Sure.,6
28708,Penny,12," Keep talking about Captain Kirk, and we‰Ûªre all gonna stop.",6
28709,Leonard,12," Message received. Ah, excuse me. (Answering phone) Hello. This is Dr. Hofstadter. Okay. All right, thank you. That‰Ûªs weird. I‰Ûªm getting called in to Human Resources.",6
28710,Penny,12, What did you do?,6
28711,Leonard,12, I don‰Ûªt know.,6
28712,Scene,12, Howard and Bernadette‰Ûªs kitchen.,6
28713,Howard,12, Huh. I just got called in to Human Resources.,6
28714,Bernadette,12, Why?,6
28715,Howard,12, I don‰Ûªt know.,6
28716,Scene,12, Raj‰Ûªs apartment.,6
28717,Raj,12, Huh. That is so strange. Human Resources wants to talk to me tomorrow. (To his dog) Could you stop licking your ass for two minutes? I have a problem here.,6
28718,Scene,12, Human Resources department.,6
28719,Howard,12, Do you really think you should be drinking right now?,6
28720,Raj,12, How else am I supposed to talk to the Human Resources lady?,6
28721,Howard,12, I don‰Ûªt know. Seek professional help?,6
28722,Raj,12, I did. The guy at the liquor store said this stuff tastes great in coffee.,6
28723,Howard,12," Wait, you got called in, too? What is going on?",6
28724,Leonard,12, Sheldon threw us all under the bus.,6
28725,Howard,12, Oh.,6
28726,Raj,12, I feel like I‰Ûªve been called down to the principal‰Ûªs office. Although I wouldn‰Ûªt mind if Brown Sugar suspended me. From a sex swing. This may have been a mistake.,6
28727,Howard,12," Relax. Everything‰Ûªs gonna be fine. Before I met Bernadette I was in here every other day. Uh, little tip, turn off your I Like Big Butts ringtone before you go in.",6
28728,Raj,12," Well, this is all your fault.",6
28729,Leonard,12, How is this my fault?,6
28730,Raj,12," If you weren‰Ûªt screwing around with Sheldon‰Ûªs assistant, none of this would be happening.",6
28731,Leonard,12, I wasn‰Ûªt screwing around with anyone.,6
28732,Raj,12," Oh, of course not. She was just sniffing around your goods because she was hunting for truffles.",6
28733,HR Woman,12," Ah, Mr. Wolowitz, it‰Ûªs been a while.",6
28734,Howard,12," Hey, Janine. How are Tom and the kids?",6
28735,Janine,12, Fine. You must be Dr. Hofstadter.,6
28736,Leonard,12," Yes, but I think this is all a big misunderstanding.",6
28737,Raj,12," Yeah, yeah, me, too. I didn‰Ûªt do anything.",6
28738,Janine,12, Is that alcohol on your breath?,6
28739,Raj,12, Howard built a sex robot.,6
28740,Howard,12, That is not true. All I did was build a robot.,6
28741,Janine,12, Did it have six breasts?,6
28742,Howard,12," I‰Ûªm sorry, I‰Ûªm a feminist, I don‰Ûªt notice things like how many breasts a robot has.",6
28743,Sheldon,12," Well, hello.",6
28744,Leonard,12, What are you doing here?,6
28745,Sheldon,12," Actually, I came to speak to Mrs. Davis.",6
28746,Janine,12, And I‰Ûªm a little busy right now.,6
28747,Sheldon,12, But I came to file a complaint. Somebody has made me feel uncomfortable in the workplace by using language of an inappropriate and sexual nature.,6
28748,Janine,12, And who was that?,6
28749,Sheldon,12," You, you dirty birdie. I-I thought about the things you said to me yesterday, and I realized I‰Ûªm deeply offended. Now, be a dear and get me one of those complaint forms.",6
28750,Janine,12," That‰Ûªs it. All of you, in my office now!",6
28751,Sheldon,12," And thanks to you, I know better than to ask if you‰Ûªre menstruating. And based on your behaviour, I don‰Ûªt have to.",6
28752,Scene,12, Sheldon‰Ûªs office.,6
28753,Sheldon,12," It has been pointed out to me that some of the things I said to you could be construed as offensive, and I would like to offer you my sincerest apology.",6
28754,Alex,12," Thank you, Dr. Cooper.",6
28755,Sheldon,12," Yeah, additionally, you should know that the university has mandated that I take an online sexual harassment seminar so this sort of thing doesn‰Ûªt happen in the future.",6
28756,Alex,12, Okay.,6
28757,Sheldon,12," Yeah. Now, unfortunately, uh, my time is much too valuable to waste on nonsense like this, so, um, I‰Ûªm gonna need you to take it for me. Oh, and, uh, you‰Ûªd better ace it, they‰Ûªre pretty mad.",6
28758,Scene,12, The apartment.,6
28759,Penny,12," So, hey, I was thinking about that stuff with Alex.",6
28760,Leonard,12," Oh, would you stop worrying about that?",6
28761,Penny,12," I can‰Ûªt help it. But, look, I figured I could sit around and feel insecure, or I could do something about it. So I got a course catalogue at school and looked at some of the science classes.",6
28762,Leonard,12, That‰Ûªs great.,6
28763,Penny,12," No, it isn‰Ûªt, they are extremely boring. I mean, how do you not kill yourself, like, every day? Anyway, I decided I don‰Ûªt need to be a scientist, I could just look like one. So I bought these.",6
28764,Leonard,12," Glasses? I really don‰Ûªt think that‰Ûªs gonna change‰Û_ oh, my God, you look so smart and hot.",6
28765,Penny,12," I know, right? Watch this. Molecules.",6
28766,Leonard,12," Okay, come with me.",6
28767,Penny,12, Where are we going?,6
28768,Leonard,12," To my bedroom, so I can take everything off but those glasses. And maybe the boots.",6
28769,Scene,13, The apartment. Sheldon is steaming a Star Trek uniform.,6
28770,Leonard,13," Hey, will you steam my uniform next?",6
28771,Sheldon,13," Interesting. Do you recall this conversation? Leonard, want to go halfsies on a steamer? No, Sheldon, we don‰Ûªt need a steamer. Looks like that rumpled chicken‰Ûªs come home to roost.",6
28772,Penny,13, Hi. Here are the make-up sponges you asked for.,6
28773,Leonard,13," Oh, thanks, I thought I had more.",6
28774,Penny,13," Damn, you‰Ûªve got more makeup than I do. You‰Ûªve got better makeup than I do. Yeah, I‰Ûªm borrowing this.",6
28775,Leonard,13," Hey, hey, hey, hey. This is my Comic-Con makeup. I love you, but there are some things a man doesn‰Ûªt share with his girlfriend.",6
28776,Sheldon,13," That‰Ûªs a wise policy. I once borrowed my sister‰Ûªs makeup for a costume contest. Got a terrible case of pinkeye. But luckily, I was going as a zombie. I won second place.",6
28777,Penny,13, I feel like you guys just went to Comic-Con.,6
28778,Leonard,13, That was San Diego Comic-Con. This is Bakersfield Comic-Con.,6
28779,Penny,13, Is that better?,6
28780,Leonard,13," Well, it‰Ûªs a lot smaller. It‰Ûªs more about the comic books. The way these conventions used to be before they went all Hollywood.",6
28781,Sheldon,13," So to answer your question, no, it‰Ûªs not better.",6
28782,Penny,13," Well, then why are you going?",6
28783,Sheldon,13," It‰Ûªs a comic book convention. You know, it‰Ûªs like pizza or particle accelerators, even the stinky one‰Ûªs still pretty good.",6
28784,Penny,13," All right. Well, you guys have fun. I guess I‰Ûªll see you Sunday night.",6
28785,Leonard,13, Yeah.,6
28786,Penny,13, Okay.,6
28787,Leonard,13," Oh, hang on a second. (Hands her the day‰Ûªs newspaper) Hold this. (Photographs the two of them together)",6
28788,Penny,13, What was that for?,6
28789,Leonard,13, To show people when they don‰Ûªt believe me.,6
28790,Scene,13, A restaurant.,6
28791,Penny,13," Oh, this is the best. You have booze with breakfast on a Tuesday, you got a problem. You do it on the weekend, you got brunch.",6
28792,Amy,13, Sheldon doesn‰Ûªt believe in brunch. He can‰Ûªt stand being at a table where one person‰Ûªs having an omelette and another person‰Ûªs having a sandwich.,6
28793,Bernadette,13, He‰Ûªs not exhausting at all.,6
28794,Penny (receiving text),13," Oh. It‰Ûªs Leonard. He says they‰Ûªre on the road and headed for Bakersfield at warp speed. Maybe it‰Ûªs the mimosa, but I‰Ûªm gonna give the kid an LOL.",6
28795,Bernadette,13, It‰Ûªs cute how excited they are. You should have seen Howard sewing his costume all week for the convention.,6
28796,Amy,13, When did Howard learn to sew?,6
28797,Bernadette,13," When he was a little boy, every couple months, he would have to let his mom‰Ûªs pants out.",6
28798,Amy,13, I don‰Ûªt even understand why they go to these conventions.,6
28799,Penny,13, I know. The four of them work at a major university. They‰Ûªre all super smart. How can they still be into something made for 12-year-olds?,6
28800,Bernadette,13," I don‰Ûªt mind it. I think Howie‰Ûªs just in touch with his inner child. Although when he comes to bed in his Batman pyjamas, sometimes it feels like I‰Ûªm touching his inner child.",6
28801,Amy,13," It‰Ûªs probably because they were bullied growing up. In a world where you can‰Ûªt fight back, superheroes provide meaningful wish-fulfillment.",6
28802,Penny,13," Mmmm. Now I feel bad for picking on all those kids. Although, in my defence, if Danny Biffle didn‰Ûªt want to eat a mouthful of dirt, he shouldn‰Ûªt have shown up to school wearing a bow tie.",6
28803,Bernadette,13, I‰Ûªve never even read a comic book. You guys?,6
28804,Penny,13, Uh-uh.,6
28805,Amy,13, No.,6
28806,Bernadette,13," I mean, it‰Ûªs such an important part of their lives. Maybe we should try reading some.",6
28807,Amy,13, Seriously?,6
28808,Bernadette,13, The comic book store isn‰Ûªt far from here.,6
28809,Penny,13," That is an amazing idea. Okay, how many of these have I had?",6
28810,Scene,13, Leonard‰Ûªs car.,6
28811,Sheldon,13, I think you should turn on the GPS.,6
28812,Leonard,13, It is on.,6
28813,Sheldon,13, But the turn-by-turn voice option isn‰Ûªt on. I know I‰Ûªd feel more safe if you turn on the turn-by-turn voice option. I love the turn-by-turn voice option.,6
28814,Howard,13, Has it really only been ten miles?,6
28815,Leonard,13," I‰Ûªm turning it on, but just to shut you up.",6
28816,GPS (in Sheldon‰Ûªs voice),13," Leonard, bear left and continue on Interstate 210.",6
28817,Sheldon,13," Ooh, sounds like that fellow knows what he‰Ûªs talking about. I‰Ûªd put on my listening ears if I were you.",6
28818,Leonard,13, What did you do?,6
28819,Sheldon,13, I found a hack online. I was able to upload MP3 recordings of my voice to your GPS.,6
28820,Raj,13, That is so cool.,6
28821,Leonard,13," Counterpoint, no, it‰Ûªs not.",6
28822,GPS,13, Continue on Interstate 210 for five miles. Here‰Ûªs an interesting fact about interstates.,6
28823,Leonard,13, Really?,6
28824,Sheldon,13," Shh, he said it‰Ûªs interesting.",6
28825,GPS,13," Interstates are numbered as follows. Even-numbered routes run east and west, odd-numbered routes run north and south. Three-digit route numbers indicate bypasses or spurs.",6
28826,Howard,13," Look, Leonard, there‰Ûªs a bridge. Drive off it.",6
28827,Raj,13," You know, we‰Ûªre not that far from Vazquez Rocks.",6
28828,Sheldon,13," Oh, they shot a lot of Star Trek episodes out there.",6
28829,Howard,13, We‰Ûªve got our costumes in the trunk. We could go there and have a little photo shoot.,6
28830,Raj,13, Great idea. I haven‰Ûªt had a carbohydrate in two weeks. These cheekbones need to be in front of a camera before I eat a pretzel and they‰Ûªre gone.,6
28831,Leonard,13," Yeah, that sounds fun.",6
28832,Sheldon,13," Oh, smashing. Now, Leonard, do you know how to get there?",6
28833,Leonard,13, No.,6
28834,Sheldon,13," Yeah, well luckily, someone in the car does.",6
28835,GPS,13," Recalculating. While we‰Ûªre waiting, do you know which president signed the Intestate Highway System Act into law? The answer, coming up in 14 miles.",6
28836,Sheldon,13, None of you will get it. It‰Ûªs Eisenhower.,6
28837,Scene,13, The comic book store.,6
28838,Bernadette,13, Why are they staring?,6
28839,Amy,13," Who cares? Just soak it in. Hello, boys.",6
28840,Stuart,13," Oh, hey. Could you please stop staring? They‰Ûªre just girls. It‰Ûªs nothing you haven‰Ûªt seen in movies or in drawings.",6
28841,Penny,13," Hey, Stuart.",6
28842,Stuart,13, What brings you guys here?,6
28843,Bernadette,13, We were looking for a recommendation about comic books.,6
28844,Stuart,13," Oh, well, I recommend you don‰Ûªt open a store and sell them.",6
28845,Penny,13," No, we were just wondering why the guys like this stuff so much, so we thought we‰Ûªd give it a try.",6
28846,Stuart,13," Oh, okay. What do you think you might be into? Superhero, fantasy, graphic novels, manga‰Û_ I swear I will turn a hose on you.",6
28847,Bernadette,13, What kind of comics do the guys like?,6
28848,Stuart,13," Um, a little bit of everything. Mostly superhero stuff.",6
28849,Amy,13," All right, well, who‰Ûªs the best superhero?",6
28850,Stuart,13, Shh! You can‰Ûªt ask a question like that in here. Are you trying to start a rumble?,6
28851,Penny,13," Well then, what do you recommend?",6
28852,Stuart,13," Well, uh, let‰Ûªs see. You‰Ûªve got your basic clean-cut good guys, Superman, Spider-Man, Captain America. Then you have your darker anti-heroes, your Batman, your Wolverine, Punisher.",6
28853,Amy,13," Ooh, I do love a bad boy.",6
28854,Penny,13, As evidenced by your boyfriend and his fear of hamsters.,6
28855,Stuart,13," If I were you, I‰Ûªd go for Fables number one. The artwork is sophisticated, it‰Ûªs intelligently written, and it doesn‰Ûªt objectify or stereotype women.",6
28856,Penny,13," Ooh, Thor! He‰Ûªs hot.",6
28857,Stuart,13," Yeah, he kind of is.",6
28858,Scene,13," Vasquez Rocks. Sheldon, dressed as Data, is having his makeup put on by Raj, dressed as Worf.",6
28859,Raj,13," And we‰Ûªre blending, and we‰Ûªre blending, and we‰Ûªre done.",6
28860,Sheldon,13," I know Mr. Data isn‰Ûªt supposed to smile, but here it comes.",6
28861,Howard (dressed as a Borg),13," Come on, guys. Let‰Ûªs do this.",6
28862,Leonard (dressed as Captain Picard),13," Yeah, I‰Ûªm sweating my bald cap off.",6
28863,Howard,13, So what‰Ûªs our first pose going to be?,6
28864,Raj,13, I say we begin with a classic Star Trek fight scene.,6
28865,Leonard,13, I‰Ûªll set the timer.,6
28866,Howard,13," Sheldon, how is that a fight pose?",6
28867,Sheldon,13, Mr. Data‰Ûªs weapon is his mind. I‰Ûªm wielding it.,6
28868,Raj,13, Phasers on the Borg! Charlie‰Ûªs Angels.,6
28869,Howard,13," Okay, what‰Ûªs next?",6
28870,Raj,13," Now let‰Ûªs do some sexy glamour shots. I‰Ûªll set the mood. (Rhythmically) Oontz, oontz, oontz, oontz, oontz, oontz, oontz, oontz, oontz, oontz, oontz, oontz, oontz, oontz, oontz, oontz, Yeah, nice one, oontz, oontz. That‰Ûªs right. Oontz, oontz, oontz, oontz, oontz, oontz, oontz‰Û_",6
28871,Howard,13," Oh, my God. Leonard, someone‰Ûªs stealing your car!",6
28872,Leonard,13," What? Hey, hey! Come back here!",6
28873,Raj,13, Stop!,6
28874,Sheldon,13, Stealing is against the law!,6
28875,Leonard,13, I don‰Ûªt believe this.,6
28876,Howard,13, Son of a bitch.,6
28877,Raj,13," I‰Ûªll call 911. What, oh, no, my phone is in my other pants.",6
28878,Howard,13," Oh, so is mine.",6
28879,Leonard,13," Mine, too. Anybody got any ideas?",6
28880,Sheldon,13, Nope. The only thing left to do now is assign blame. (To Raj) Nice going.,6
28881,Scene,13, The side of the road.,6
28882,Leonard,13, What kind of a person steals another person‰Ûªs car in broad daylight?,6
28883,Sheldon,13, What kind of person leaves his keys in the car?,6
28884,Leonard,13, I thought we agreed this was all Koothrappali‰Ûªs fault.,6
28885,Sheldon,13, You‰Ûªre right. Nice going.,6
28886,Howard,13, Car.,6
28887,Raj,13, What is wrong with people? Why don‰Ûªt they stop?,6
28888,Sheldon,13, Maybe we‰Ûªre better off. What if we were to get in a car with a crazy person?,6
28889,Leonard,13," Look at us, Sheldon. We‰Ûªre the crazy people.",6
28890,Sheldon,13," Well, perhaps we should hold up a sign that assures passing motorists of our mental competence.",6
28891,Howard,13, Good idea. Why don‰Ûªt you get started on that?,6
28892,Leonard,13," Come on, let‰Ûªs just start walking. There‰Ûªs got to be a gas station or something nearby.",6
28893,Sheldon,13," What, you think just because you‰Ûªre wearing a captain‰Ûªs uniform, you‰Ûªre in charge?",6
28894,Leonard,13, Yes.,6
28895,Sheldon,13, All right.,6
28896,Scene,13, Penny‰Ûªs apartment.,6
28897,Penny,13," Hmm, okay, I‰Ûªm done. How did you guys finish so fast?",6
28898,Bernadette,13," I don‰Ûªt know, there were a lot of pictures, and one page only had the word brakkadoom!",6
28899,Penny,13," Yeah, well, I have street smarts.",6
28900,Bernadette,13," So, what‰Ûªd you guys think?",6
28901,Amy,13," Well, there was a lot of action.",6
28902,Penny,13, Mmm.,6
28903,Amy,13," And the story moved along at a brisk pace. It was, overall, what‰Ûªs the word I‰Ûªm looking for?",6
28904,Penny,13, Stupid?,6
28905,Amy,13, So stupid.,6
28906,Penny,13, I don‰Ûªt know how Leonard can get so caught up in this.,6
28907,Bernadette,13," It‰Ûªs crazy, they spend hours arguing about things that don‰Ûªt even exist.",6
28908,Amy,13, What a waste of time.,6
28909,Penny,13, I know. A hammer so heavy that no one else can pick it up?,6
28910,Bernadette,13," I don‰Ûªt think it‰Ûªs heavy. It‰Ûªs some sort of magic, so only Thor can lift it.",6
28911,Penny,13," That makes even less sense, I mean‰Û_",6
28912,Amy,13," No, no, no, it doesn‰Ûªt. Thor is a god. The hammer is his, only he can use it. It‰Ûªs like Sheldon and his toothbrush. Or his thin, beckoning lips.",6
28913,Penny,13," Okay, hang on, what if Thor‰Ûªs hand is on the hammer? I mean, if he‰Ûªs touching it with his god magic, does that mean I could lift it?",6
28914,Bernadette,13, No.,6
28915,Amy,13, Yes.,6
28916,Penny,13," Well, which is it?",6
28917,Amy,13, Maybe we missed something.,6
28918,Bernadette,13, Let‰Ûªs read it again.,6
28919,Penny,13, Okay.,6
28920,Amy,13, Yeah.,6
28921,Bernadette,13, You want some tea?,6
28922,Amy,13, Good idea. I‰Ûªll help you.,6
28923,Penny,13," Wait, I thought we were reading.",6
28924,Amy,13," We are. We‰Ûªre just, uh, giving you a head start.",6
28925,Scene,13, The desert.,6
28926,Howard,13, I wish my mom was here. We could all hang out in her shadow.,6
28927,Raj,13, Wool pants in the desert. I feel like I‰Ûªve got poached testicles.,6
28928,Leonard,13," Oh, you poor thing, you‰Ûªre sweating. That‰Ûªs so much worse than having your car stolen.",6
28929,Raj,13, Insurance is gonna buy you a new car. It‰Ûªs not gonna de-funk my junk.,6
28930,Sheldon,13," Gentlemen, a little less bellyaching. We‰Ûªre Starfleet officers and a member of the Borg Collective.",6
28931,Leonard,13," Please, Sheldon, I am so not in the mood.",6
28932,Sheldon,13," Leonard, all our lives we have dreamed of finding ourselves inside one of the fantasy worlds we love. And look at us. At this moment, we are, in fact, a Star Trek landing party stranded in an alien and unforgiving environment, relying only on our wits, our fortitude and our moxie. As long as we have those things, nothing can stop‰Û_",6
28933,Guys in Passing Car (throwing a drink over Sheldon),13, Nerds!,6
28934,Sheldon,13, I hate this planet.,6
28935,Scene,13, Penny‰Ûªs Apartment.,6
28936,Amy,13," It says right here on the hammer, whoever holds this hammer, if he be worthy, shall possess the power of Thor.",6
28937,Bernadette,13," Hold on, who decides who‰Ûªs worthy? Does the hammer decide?",6
28938,Penny,13, Yes!,6
28939,Amy,13, No! It can‰Ûªt decide. It‰Ûªs a hammer.,6
28940,Penny,13, You said it‰Ûªs a magic hammer.,6
28941,Amy,13," Yeah, but, it can‰Ûªt make decisions.",6
28942,Penny,13," If Harry Potter‰Ûªs wand can make decisions, why can‰Ûªt Thor‰Ûªs hammer?",6
28943,Amy,13," Okay, if you‰Ûªre going to start comparing wands and hammers, I can‰Ûªt even take you seriously.",6
28944,Scene,13, A diner.,6
28945,Sheldon,13," Hello. Hello. Uh, uh, uh, four glasses of water, please. Anything for you guys?",6
28946,Leonard,13, Can I use your phone? Our car got stolen.,6
28947,Waitress,13, Why don‰Ûªt you ask Scotty to beam you up?,6
28948,Sheldon,13," Scotty was on the original series, and we‰Ûªre Next Generation. So, joke‰Ûªs on you.",6
28949,Howard,13, We‰Ûªre not with him.,6
28950,Scene,13, Penny‰Ûªs apartment.,6
28951,Amy,13," You can‰Ûªt pick something up in outer space. In space, there is no up.",6
28952,Penny,13," Oh, yeah? Then how does the sun come up every day?",6
28953,Amy,13, Hard to argue with those kind of street smarts.,6
28954,Bernadette,13, Leonard and Sheldon have boxes of comics across the hall. Why don‰Ûªt we go look at those?,6
28955,Penny,13," Oh, great. Yes. And then you will see, I am not wrong, because if we were in outer space, then anyone could pick up the hammer because it would be floating around in a weightless environment. Yeah, that‰Ûªs right, the slow reader used science. Suck on that.",6
28956,Scene,13, The diner.,6
28957,Policeman,13, Was there anything valuable in the car?,6
28958,Leonard,13," Our clothes, our wallets, phones.",6
28959,Raj,13," And about three hundred dollars worth of makeup, so this thief could look like anyone right now.",6
28960,Policeman,13, Makeup? Sure.,6
28961,Leonard,13," Uh, we‰Ûªre going to the Comic-Con in Bakersfield. They have a big costume contest. It‰Ûªs cooler than it sounds.",6
28962,Policeman,13," I don‰Ûªt know, sounds pretty cool.",6
28963,Raj,13," It, it is. It‰Ûªs not just comic books. They‰Ûªve got action figures, toys, a Tron-themed dance party.",6
28964,Leonard,13," Okay, he gets how cool it is.",6
28965,Policeman,13, I think I have all I need here. You guys need me to call someone? I‰Ûªm guessing your moms?,6
28966,Leonard,13," Thanks, but we‰Ûªve got it covered.",6
28967,Howard,13," Okay, I just talked to my mom. She arranged for us to get a rental car.",6
28968,Raj,13, Great. We can still make it to Comic-Con.,6
28969,Leonard,13," Are you kidding me? After all we‰Ûªve been through, I just want to go home.",6
28970,Raj,13," Don‰Ûªt be like that. Come on, Howard, talk to him.",6
28971,Howard,13, I‰Ûªm with Leonard. I‰Ûªm done.,6
28972,Raj,13," Fine, then I guess it‰Ûªs two against two. How do we decide?",6
28973,Sheldon,13," Actually, it‰Ûªs three against one.",6
28974,Raj,13, What? What about the mission? You said we were a real-life landing party.,6
28975,Sheldon,13," Yeah, well, we‰Ûªre not. We‰Ûªre an imaginary landing party who had real-life garbage thrown at us by real-life strangers who think we‰Ûªre idiots. And to tell you the truth, I‰Ûªm starting to feel like one. I want to go home now.",6
28976,Raj,13, Okay. Did we at least rent the car from Enterprise? Get it? Enterprise? Screw you. That‰Ûªs funny.,6
28977,Scene,13, The apartment.,6
28978,Bernadette,13," Well, what if the Hulk picked up Thor while Thor is holding the hammer?",6
28979,Amy,13, Yeah?,6
28980,Bernadette,13," Then by the transitive property of picking things up, Hulk picked up the hammer.",6
28981,Amy,13," No. Hulk picked up Thor, Thor picked up the hammer.",6
28982,Penny,13," Okay, hang on. If I go to a bar and pick up a guy, and he picks up a girl, and then we all leave together, did I pick up the girl?",6
28983,Amy,13, Did that ever happen?,6
28984,Penny,13," Hey, are we talking about me or are we talking about Thor?",6
28985,Scene,13, The stairwell.,6
28986,Sheldon,13," Well, I say that‰Ûªs the last time we ever go outside.",6
28987,Amy (off),13," Look, right here. Red Hulk is picking up Thor‰Ûªs hammer ‰Ûªcause Thor‰Ûªs touching it.",6
28988,Penny (off),13," No, it‰Ûªs because they‰Ûªre in space. He‰Ûªs really just touching the strap.",6
28989,Amy(off),13, The strap is part of the hammer.,6
28990,Bernadette (off),13," No, it‰Ûªs not!",6
28991,Raj,13, Are they actually arguing about comic books?,6
28992,Leonard,13," No, that can‰Ûªt be right.",6
28993,Howard,13, Maybe Thor‰Ûªs Hammer is a new colour of nail polish.,6
28994,Bernadette (off),13, Then Red Hulk must be worthy.,6
28995,Penny (off),13, How could Red Hulk be worthy?,6
28996,Bernadette (off),13, You don‰Ûªt know his life.,6
28997,Sheldon,13, There‰Ûªs only one logical explanation. Somewhere in the desert we crossed into an alternate dimension where the women in our lives can finally appreciate great literature.,6
28998,Raj,13," If it‰Ûªs an alternate dimension, sounds like a job for a landing party.",6
28999,Sheldon,13," Captain, what are your orders?",6
29000,Leonard,13, I say we investigate.,6
29001,Sheldon,13, Wait. They might be hostile.,6
29002,Leonard,13," Fine, but set them to stun. If we vaporize Penny, I‰Ûªll never find a girlfriend that pretty again.",6
29003,Scene,13, Leonard‰Ûªs car.,6
29004,GPS,13," Fun fact, President Eisenhower signed the Federal Aid Highway Act from his hospital room.",6
29005,First Car Thief,13," Wow, that is interesting.",6
29006,Second Car Thief,13, You learn something new every day.,6
29007,GPS,13," Say, can you name the four state capitols that are not served by the interstate system?",6
29008,First Car Thief,13," Ooh, another quiz.",6
29009,Second Car Thief,13, Yes!,6
29010,Scene,14, The Apartment.,6
29011,Leonard,14," Sheldon, your food‰Ûªs getting cold.",6
29012,Sheldon,14," I‰Ûªll eat later. Right now, I‰Ûªm suckling at the informative bosom of mother physics.",6
29013,Penny,14, It‰Ûªs hot when Sheldon talks dirty.,6
29014,Raj,14," So, I found this Web site where you send them pictures, they sculpt your head and make an action figure out of you. How awesome is that?",6
29015,Howard,14, Let me see.,6
29016,Raj,14," Yeah, you can pick your wardrobe. You can even choose your accessories.",6
29017,Howard,14," Leonard, you can get a little asthma inhaler.",6
29018,Leonard,14," Oh, this is neat. Think about all the action figures we‰Ûªve bought over the years. It would be kind of cool to have ones that look like us. Don‰Ûªt you think?",6
29019,Penny,14," Yeah, if that‰Ûªs your idea of what‰Ûªs cool, you should get one.",6
29020,Leonard,14," Yeah, so, I‰Ûªm out.",6
29021,Raj,14," What do you think, Sheldon? Want an action figure that looks just like you?",6
29022,Sheldon,14, Would it come with Kung-Fu grip?,6
29023,Raj,14, No.,6
29024,Sheldon,14, Don‰Ûªt waste my time.,6
29025,Leonard,14, You get that these are personalised action figures.,6
29026,Penny,14," Honey, if you want one, just get one.",6
29027,Howard,14," You‰Ûªre still out, right?",6
29028,Leonard,14, Yep.,6
29029,Scene,14, Sheldon‰Ûªs office.,6
29030,Sheldon,14," A hush falls over the crowd as Cooper studies the board. He makes his move. He‰Ûªs dividing both sides by I. He‰Ûªs adding back the coefficient. He has a value for P. He‰Ûªs plugging that back in. He takes the derivative, and he solves the equation. The crowd goes wild. Nobel! Nobel!",6
29031,Kripke,14, Cooper?,6
29032,Sheldon,14, Nobel. Kripke. Don‰Ûªt look at my board.,6
29033,Kripke,14, What‰Ûªs that?,6
29034,Sheldon,14," That‰Ûªs a drawing of a really cool train. Don‰Ûªt look at that, either. What do you want?",6
29035,Kripke,14, I have some bad news. You‰Ûªre working on a gwant pwoposal fow a new fusion weactow. I‰Ûªm working on a gwant pwoposal fow a new fusion weactow. The university is only awowed to submit one pwoposal.,6
29036,Sheldon,14," So they asked you to pack up your things and ship out. That‰Ûªs hard cheese, Barry. You‰Ûªre one of the good ones.",6
29037,Kripke,14," No, they‰Ûªre making us work together.",6
29038,Sheldon,14, That‰Ûªs ridiculous. I am one of the great minds of our generation. I work on a level so rarified you couldn‰Ûªt even imagine it. I said stop looking at my cool train!,6
29039,Scene,14, Howard‰Ûªs lab.,6
29040,Leonard,14, Hmm. Kind of a strange place to put a picture of you and Bernadette.,6
29041,Howard,14," Well, I wanted everybody to know I love my wife. And nobody to know I forgot to turn off the laser.",6
29042,Raj,14, They‰Ûªre here. Our action figures have arrived. This is the best five hundred dollars I‰Ûªve ever spent.,6
29043,Leonard,14, A thousand dollars on action figures? How can you afford that?,6
29044,Howard,14," Easy. His family‰Ûªs loaded, and Bernadette has a great job. My wife came with both fun bags and money bags.",6
29045,Raj,14," Say hello to an exact scale model of me. Oh, I‰Ûªm not dark chocolate. I‰Ûªm melt-in-your-mouth caramel.",6
29046,Howard,14," Oh, man. Look at my nose.",6
29047,Leonard,14, Maybe it‰Ûªs a shipping problem.,6
29048,Howard,14, What?,6
29049,Leonard,14, Yeah. Maybe Wesley Snipes and Toucan Sam just got action figures that look like you guys.,6
29050,Raj,14, This sucks.,6
29051,Howard,14, I can‰Ûªt believe I wasted all that money.,6
29052,Leonard,14," Aw, and my girlfriend wouldn‰Ûªt let me get one. Look at my face. Do I look smug? I feel smug.",6
29053,Scene,14, The stairwell.,6
29054,Penny,14, I hate it when you make me sit through all the credits.,6
29055,Leonard,14," Well, sometimes there‰Ûªs a secret ending, like in The Avengers.",6
29056,Penny,14," Yeah, but I don‰Ûªt think that‰Ûªs going to happen in a documentary about the Holocaust.",6
29057,Leonard,14," They could show bloopers. Oh, no.",6
29058,Penny,14, What is that?,6
29059,Leonard,14," That is Sheldon‰Ûªs ‰ÛÏI‰Ûªm unhappy and about to destroy the planet‰Û music. Come on, let‰Ûªs just go to your place.",6
29060,Penny,14," Well, wait, if he‰Ûªs unhappy,shouldn‰Ûªt we talk to him?",6
29061,Leonard,14, Shouldn‰Ûªt we talk to him? Have you learned nothing in six years?,6
29062,Penny (entering apartment),14," You doing okay, sweetie?",6
29063,Sheldon,14," There is ominous music playing, and there is an afghan over my head. I don‰Ûªt know where you‰Ûªre from, but where I‰Ûªm from, that means I‰Ûªm not doing okay.",6
29064,Leonard,14, Want me to make you some tea?,6
29065,Sheldon,14, Tea is for when I‰Ûªm upset. I‰Ûªm not upset. The university‰Ûªs forcing me to work with Kripke. I‰Ûªm outraged.,6
29066,Leonard,14," So, cocoa?",6
29067,Sheldon,14," Yes, cocoa. Do you have any idea what it‰Ûªs like to be paired with someone who‰Ûªs so incredibly annoying?",6
29068,Leonard,14," Oh, teacher! Me! Me!",6
29069,Sheldon,14," See, I did all this great work, and now he‰Ûªs just going to come along and ruin it. I am angrier than ever and filled with despair.",6
29070,Penny,14, What beverage do you make for that?,6
29071,Leonard,14," Oh, no, no, no, I know this. Uh, hot apple cider with cinnamon sticks?",6
29072,Sheldon,14," Yes, hot apple cider with cinnamon sticks!",6
29073,Scene,14, Sheldon‰Ûªs office.,6
29074,Kripke,14," What the fwig, Cooper? We were supposed to meet in my office a half an hour ago.",6
29075,Sheldon,14," And yet, now you‰Ûªre in my office. Point, Cooper. Welcome to the Thunderdome, Kripke.",6
29076,Kripke,14, We agweed to exchange copies of our work. Let me see yours.,6
29077,Sheldon,14, Why don‰Ûªt you show me yours first.,6
29078,Kripke,14, You think I just few off the turnip twuck? We exchange at the same time.,6
29079,Sheldon,14, How do I know you‰Ûªre not going to take my ideas and publish them as your own?,6
29080,Kripke,14, How do I know you‰Ûªre not going to do that with mine?,6
29081,Sheldon,14," Because I‰Ûªm not interested in getting published in Mad magazine. Zingers fly fast in the Thunderdome, Barry.",6
29082,Kripke,14," Are we going to do this or not? Thank you. So, we wead each other‰Ûªs work, meet again tomowow?",6
29083,Sheldon,14, Fine.,6
29084,Kripke,14, Nice twy. This is bwank paper.,6
29085,Sheldon,14, And I am sure it‰Ûªs still more valuable than whatever‰Ûªs in here.,6
29086,Kripke,14," Cough it up, Cooper.",6
29087,Sheldon,14, Very well.,6
29088,Kripke,14," If this one‰Ûªs bwank, too, I‰Ûªm going to be fuwious.",6
29089,Sheldon,14, Fine.,6
29090,Scene,14, Howard‰Ûªs lab.,6
29091,Raj,14, You! Always bet on black.,6
29092,Howard,14, Get that waste of money out of my face.,6
29093,Raj,14," It‰Ûªs only a waste of money if we don‰Ûªt play with them. (As doll) He‰Ûªs right, dawg.",6
29094,Howard,14," Please, I‰Ûªm working.",6
29095,Raj,14," You know, there is a way we can get action figures to look exactly like us.",6
29096,Howard,14," Oh, yeah? How‰Ûªs that?",6
29097,Raj,14," Two words, 3-D printer. Wait, maybe it‰Ûªs three words. No, hang on. Okay, one word, a letter and a number and maybe a hyphen. 3-D printer.",6
29098,Howard,14, I have always wanted a 3-D printer.,6
29099,Raj,14," Of course you have. They‰Ûªre an engineer‰Ûªs dream. Anything you can design, a 3-D printer can make out of plastic.",6
29100,Howard,14," Yeah, but they‰Ûªre so expensive.",6
29101,Raj,14," Oh, come on. You deserve one. You‰Ûªve worked hard to find a woman who makes a lot of money.",6
29102,Howard,14," Well, the prices have been coming down.",6
29103,Raj,14," Oh, true. They‰Ûªre practically giving them away. You know, in exchange for money.",6
29104,Howard,14," And we can make stuff we need for work with it. Prototypes of my CAD/CAM designs, specialized tools‰Û_",6
29105,Raj,14, Not to mention Malibu Koothrappali and his totally bitchin‰Ûª dream house.,6
29106,Howard,14, We don‰Ûªt need Malibu Koothrappali‰Ûªs dream house.,6
29107,Raj,14," Really, smart guy? Where‰Ûªs he supposed to park his sweet little Corvette?",6
29108,Scene,14, The apartment.,6
29109,Amy,14,"The monkey in my tobacco study has taken to smoking a pipe. I‰Ûªm supposed to remove his brain to examine, but it‰Ûªs hard because now he reminds me of my uncle. You‰Ûªve been awfully quiet tonight. Is everything okay?",6
29110,Sheldon,14, I‰Ûªm fine.,6
29111,Amy,14," All right, well, how was work today? Did you exchange your research with Kripke?",6
29112,Sheldon,14, Yes.,6
29113,Amy,14," Sheldon, what‰Ûªs going on?",6
29114,Sheldon,14," I read his research, and, it‰Ûªs leaps and bounds ahead of mine. Which means the mommy of the smartest physicist at the university is not my mommy as I had thought. It‰Ûªs his mommy.",6
29115,Amy,14," Sheldon, I wish there was something I could do to make you feel better. May I offer you a consoling hug?",6
29116,Sheldon,14, What do we have to lose?,6
29117,Amy,14, How‰Ûªs that?,6
29118,Sheldon,14, I feel like I‰Ûªm being strangled by a boa constrictor. Why‰Ûªd you stop?,6
29119,Scene,14, The apartment.,6
29120,Leonard,14," Come on, Sheldon, we‰Ûªre going to be late.",6
29121,Sheldon,14, I can‰Ûªt go in today. I‰Ûªm sick.,6
29122,Leonard,14, You‰Ûªre not sick. You just don‰Ûªt want to face Kripke.,6
29123,Sheldon,14," No, look.",6
29124,Leonard,14,128,6
29125,Sheldon,14, See?,6
29126,Leonard,14," What did you do, put this in your tea?",6
29127,Sheldon,14," Oh, dear. Now I‰Ûªm not even smarter than you.",6
29128,Leonard,14," Sheldon, Kripke‰Ûªs not smarter than you. You just got stuck on a wrong path. Happened to Einstein. He got stuck on the unified field theory for decades.",6
29129,Sheldon,14," Oh, don‰Ûªt play the Einstein card. His great breakthroughs happened when no one knew anything. So everything was a great breakthrough.",6
29130,Leonard,14," Sheldon Lee Cooper, I do not have time for this nonsense. Now, go put your clothes on, get in the car, and lets go to work.",6
29131,Sheldon,14," All right, geez. What a grouch.",6
29132,Leonard,14, How did I do that? I got to remember how I did that.,6
29133,Scene,14, Howard‰Ûªs lab.,6
29134,Howard,14," Do you realize, by owning a 3-D printer, we are reclaiming the manufacturing process and taking jobs back from sweatshops in China?",6
29135,Raj,14, I think this thing was made in China.,6
29136,Howard,14," Eh, what can you do?",6
29137,Raj,14," Ooh, I, I think it‰Ûªs done. Oh, it worked. We printed a whistle.",6
29138,Howard,14, Amazing. You realize these things go for 25 cents a pop at a party store.,6
29139,Raj,14, And we made it in only three hours. Sounds just like store-bought.,6
29140,Howard,14," Okay, give me a superhero pose, and I will scan you into the computer for your action figure.",6
29141,Raj,14," Oh, I wish I was in better shape.",6
29142,Howard,14, Stop holding your stomach in. I‰Ûªll give you a six-pack with the computer.,6
29143,Raj,14," Oh, okay, great. Now I can look like Val Kilmer as Batman instead of Val Kilmer as he looks today.",6
29144,Howard,14," All right, you can suck it in a little bit.",6
29145,Scene,14, Sheldon‰Ûªs office.,6
29146,Kripke,14," Cooper, we have a pwobwem. Your work is weawy not at a wevew I expected it to be.",6
29147,Sheldon,14," I know. Go ahead, mock me. Just use small words so I understand.",6
29148,Kripke,14, Don‰Ûªt pway dumb with me. We both know what your pwobwem is.,6
29149,Sheldon,14, We do?,6
29150,Kripke,14, You have a girlfwiend.,6
29151,Sheldon,14, So?,6
29152,Kripke,14," So my work would suffew, too, if I was getting waid all the time.",6
29153,Sheldon,14, Yes. That is the reason. My work is suffering because of all the laid I‰Ûªm getting.,6
29154,Kripke,14, You wucky bastard.,6
29155,Sheldon,14," What can I say, you know? She enjoys my genitals. I am giving them to her on a nightly basis.",6
29156,Kripke,14," Okay, stop bwagging. You had some bwiwiant insights in here, but if we‰Ûªre gonna make this work, you need to buckew down and focus.",6
29157,Sheldon,14," I‰Ûªll do what I can. But it‰Ûªs not going to be easy, because when I‰Ûªm with Amy and our bathing suit areas mush together, boy howdy, is it magic",6
29158,Scene,14, Howard and Bernadette‰Ûªs apartment.,6
29159,Howard,14," Oh, good, you‰Ûªre home. Got a little surprise for you.",6
29160,Bernadette,14, What?,6
29161,Howard,14, Say hello to my little friend.,6
29162,Bernadette,14," Oh, my God. That‰Ûªs so cute. I didn‰Ûªt think there could be a smaller version of you.",6
29163,Howard,14," I know, right? And, thanks to photographs and a little 3-D modeling, here comes the bride.",6
29164,Bernadette,14," Oh, Howie, I love these.",6
29165,Howard,14, I thought you might.,6
29166,Bernadette,14, Were they expensive?,6
29167,Howard,14, Didn‰Ûªt cost a thing. I made them myself.,6
29168,Bernadette,14, How?,6
29169,Howard,14," Koothrappali and I bought a used 3-D printer for $5,000.",6
29170,Bernadette,14," $5,000 for a couple of dolls? Are you out of your mind?",6
29171,Howard,14, Not just for a couple of dolls. For as many dolls as we want. And whistles.,6
29172,Bernadette,14," At any point, did it dawn on you to talk to me about spending this kind of money?",6
29173,Howard,14, It‰Ûªs kind of dawning on me now.,6
29174,Bernadette,14," I don‰Ûªt believe you. Howie, we can‰Ûªt afford to waste money on junk like this.",6
29175,Howard,14, What are you talking about? We make plenty of money.,6
29176,Bernadette,14, I make plenty of money. You make peanuts.,6
29177,Howard,14," Yes, but we‰Ûªre married now. That means, when you get sick, I take care of you. And when you make a bunch of money, I get to buy stuff. Sorry if you don‰Ûªt like it, but that‰Ûªs how love works.",6
29178,Bernadette,14," No, here‰Ûªs how love works. You‰Ûªre gonna return the machine, or you can print out a working set of lady parts and sleep with those. Oh, my God! Are you actually thinking about it?",6
29179,Scene,14, The apartment.,6
29180,Penny,14," All right, I don‰Ûªt understand. Why didn‰Ûªt you just tell Kripke the truth?",6
29181,Sheldon,14," Because the truth made me look bad, whereas a ridiculous bald-faced lie makes me look good. Anyway, if Kripke asks, tell him my coitus with Amy is frequent, intense and whimsically inventive.",6
29182,Leonard,14, Is my coitus whimsically inventive?,6
29183,Penny,14," That is what I write on the bathroom walls. For a whimsically inventive time, call Leonard Hofstadter.",6
29184,Leonard,14," I know you‰Ûªre joking, but I‰Ûªd be okay with that.",6
29185,Penny,14," Yeah. Sheldon, can I ask you a question?",6
29186,Sheldon,14, Of course.,6
29187,Penny,14, You ever going to sleep with Amy?,6
29188,Sheldon,14, That‰Ûªs awfully personal.,6
29189,Leonard,14, We don‰Ûªt ask Sheldon things like that.,6
29190,Penny,14," Maybe you don‰Ûªt, I do. What‰Ûªs the deal?",6
29191,Sheldon,14," Well, word around the university is I‰Ûªm giving her sex organs a proper jostling.",6
29192,Penny,14," All right, come on, be serious. Look, you guys have been going out a long time. She would clearly like to have a physical relationship with you, so what are you doing?",6
29193,Leonard,14," All right, we‰Ûªre down the rabbit hole. What are you doing?",6
29194,Sheldon,14," Well, first of all, I‰Ûªm quite fond of Amy.",6
29195,Penny,14, Then what‰Ûªs the problem?,6
29196,Sheldon,14," Penny, all my life, I have been uncomfortable with the sort of physical contact that comes easily to others, hand-shaking, hugging, prostate exams. But I‰Ûªm working on it, you know? Just recently, I had to put VapoRub on Amy‰Ûªs chest. A year ago, that would have been unthinkable.",6
29197,Leonard,14, Now you know how I feel when I have to put it on you.,6
29198,Penny,14, Okay. Hang on. Are you saying someday you and Amy might actually get physical?,6
29199,Sheldon,14, It‰Ûªs a possibility.,6
29200,Penny (under breath while hitting Leonard),14," Oh, my God! (Out loud) Sheldon, I know this wasn‰Ûªt easy for you, and I‰Ûªm really glad we could have this conversation.",6
29201,Sheldon,14, Fine.,6
29202,Penny (under breath while hitting Leonard),14," Oh, my God!",6
29203,Leonard,14, Ow!,6
29204,Scene,14, The cafeteria.,6
29205,Raj,14, Are you sure you want to do this? Give up your half of the 3-D printer?,6
29206,Howard,14, Yes. And can you please make that out to Bernadette? I was taken off the joint account until I learn the value of money.,6
29207,Raj,14," Wow, that‰Ûªs harsh.",6
29208,Howard,14, Tell me about it.,6
29209,Raj,14, Aren‰Ûªt you gonna eat lunch?,6
29210,Howard,14," Nah, I blew my food allowance on Pokemon cards.",6
29211,Scene,14, Sheldon‰Ûªs office.,6
29212,Sheldon,14," Well, the equation balances, but it‰Ûªs certainly not elegant.",6
29213,Kripke,14, Whatever. You get any wast night?,6
29214,Sheldon,14, Yes.,6
29215,Kripke,14," Gave it to her good, huh?",6
29216,Sheldon,14," No, I gave it to her well. Now, over here, I was thinking the turbulence could be reduced if we just put‰Û_",6
29217,Kripke,14," Yeah, yeah, yeah. Was she naked, or was she weawing wingewie?",6
29218,Sheldon,14, I didn‰Ûªt notice.,6
29219,Kripke,14, How could you not notice?,6
29220,Sheldon,14, I was too busy squishing all the desirable parts of her body.,6
29221,Kripke,14," Ah, you‰Ûªre kiwing me, Cooper!",6
29222,Sheldon,14, Can we get back to work?,6
29223,Kripke,14," Sure, sure, sure. You guys ever use any toys?",6
29224,Sheldon,14, Toys? I do have a model rocket next to my bed.,6
29225,Kripke,14, A wocket? You‰Ûªwe a fweak! I wove it!,6
29226,Scene,15, The apartment,6
29227,Leonard,15, I don‰Ûªt know why I avoided the Harry Potter books for so long. These are great. I just started number six.,6
29228,Sheldon,15," That‰Ûªs a good one. Dumbledore dies in that one. Yeah, I know, I didn‰Ûªt see it coming, either.",6
29229,Leonard,15, Why would you say that?,6
29230,Sheldon,15," You brought up the subject. I contributed an interesting fact on that subject. It‰Ûªs called the art of conversation. Okay, your turn.",6
29231,Leonard,15, That was a huge spoiler.,6
29232,Sheldon,15, Good.,6
29233,Leonard,15," What is wrong with you? If I did that, you‰Ûªd bitch about it for weeks.",6
29234,Sheldon,15," Oh, really, Leonard? Are you going to have another one of your hissy fits?",6
29235,Leonard,15, Hissy fits? I have hissy fits?,6
29236,Sheldon,15," Yes, and I have a theory why. Because of your lactose intolerance, you switched over to soy milk. Soy contains estrogen-mimicking compounds. I think your morning Cocoa Puffs are turning you into a hysterical woman.",6
29237,Leonard,15," You are unbelievable. I don‰Ûªt know why I put up with you. You‰Ûªre controlling, you‰Ûªre irritating.",6
29238,Sheldon,15," There you go again, nag, nag, nag. You‰Ûªre only proving my point, little lady.",6
29239,Leonard,15," You know what? Screw you, Sheldon. You are the most annoying person I have ever met.",6
29240,Sheldon,15," What? I‰Ûªm annoying? You criticize my behaviour all the time. Sheldon, don‰Ûªt talk about your bowel movements over breakfast. Sheldon, when the president of the university is giving a eulogy at a funeral, don‰Ûªt yawn and point at your watch. Sheldon, don‰Ûªt throw away my shirts ‰Ûªcause you think they‰Ûªre ugly. You‰Ûªre impossible.",6
29241,Leonard,15," That‰Ûªs it. I don‰Ûªt, I don‰Ûªt have to put up with this.",6
29242,Sheldon,15," Actually, I have your signature on a roommate agreement that says you do.",6
29243,Leonard,15, Aw. Here‰Ûªs what I think of your roommate agreement.,6
29244,Sheldon,15, You pick that up right now.,6
29245,Leonard,15, No.,6
29246,Sheldon,15," Roommate agreement, section 27, paragraph 5, the roommate agreement, like the American flag, cannot touch the ground.",6
29247,Leonard,15, I don‰Ûªt care. I don‰Ûªt have to do anything you say because I don‰Ûªt think I want to live here anymore.,6
29248,Sheldon,15, Where are you going?,6
29249,Leonard,15," To live with Penny and not you, you crazy bastard.",6
29250,Sheldon,15, Crazy bastard?,6
29251,Leonard,15, Yes.,6
29252,Sheldon,15," Leonard, wait.",6
29253,Leonard,15, What?,6
29254,Sheldon,15, Dobby the elf dies in book seven.,6
29255,Scene,15, Howard and Bernadette‰Ûªs apartment.,6
29256,Raj,15, Here you go.,6
29257,Howard,15, Great. Come on in.,6
29258,Raj,15," What, you don‰Ûªt say thank you?",6
29259,Howard,15, It‰Ûªs my suitcase. I lent it to you two years ago.,6
29260,Raj,15," Well, then, I should tell you I broke the wheel and the handle. So, is everyone from Bernadette‰Ûªs company going to Vegas?",6
29261,Howard,15," No, just me, her and a couple of the big wigs. It‰Ûªs part of a bonus she got.",6
29262,Raj,15, Cool. Did she discover a cure for something?,6
29263,Howard,15, Not exactly. They spent a ton of money developing this dandruff medication that had the side effect of horrible anal leakage.,6
29264,Raj,15, Is there a good anal leakage?,6
29265,Howard,15," Anyway, it was Bernie‰Ûªs idea to rebrand the stuff as a cure for constipation.",6
29266,Raj,15," Way to make lemonade. You know, from around the corner where fudge is made.",6
29267,Howard,15," Hey, I got a favour to ask.",6
29268,Raj,15, Sure.,6
29269,Howard,15, My mom‰Ûªs been kind of an emotional wreck since that dentist she was dating dumped her.,6
29270,Raj,15," Dumped her? What, did he use a forklift? Sorry. There‰Ûªs nothing funny about morbid obesity.",6
29271,Howard,15," She‰Ûªs huge. It was funny. Anyway, I was just hoping that maybe you could check in on her tomorrow night and make sure she‰Ûªs doing okay.",6
29272,Raj,15," Dude, I‰Ûªm a single man. Saturday night is my party night.",6
29273,Howard,15, Really? What do you got going on?,6
29274,Raj,15," I don‰Ûªt know, maybe drive down to Hollywood, hit a few hot spots, see if I can get lucky.",6
29275,Howard,15," Yeah, tell me if this sounds familiar. You pay fifteen dollars to park, you stand on the pavement for an hour until you break down and give the bouncer twenty bucks to let you in. You push your way to the bar, where you drink an eighteen dollar cosmopolitan, then you stare at a pretty girl and imagine your perfect life together. Your children, grandchildren. Meanwhile, she leaves with a guy who claims he wrote Beverly Hills Chihuahua. Then you give up on anyone ever loving you, go to Marie Callender‰Ûªs, buy a pie and eat it in your car in the parking lot.",6
29276,Raj,15,What time should I be at your mother‰Ûªs?,6
29277,Howard,15, I told her around seven.,6
29278,Scene,15, Penny‰Ûªs apartment.,6
29279,Leonard,15," I swear, that man is the most egotistical, insufferable human being I have ever met.",6
29280,Penny,15," Yeah, but you two make such a cute couple. Like Burt and Ernie. You guys even teach me stuff about words and numbers.",6
29281,Leonard,15," Well, I‰Ûªve had it. I am done. I can‰Ûªt, I can‰Ûªt live with him for one more minute.",6
29282,Penny,15, Wow. Where are you going to go?,6
29283,Leonard,15, I was thinking here with you.,6
29284,Penny,15, Oh.,6
29285,Leonard,15, That a problem?,6
29286,Penny,15," No, not at all. No, it‰Ûªs, it‰Ûªs great. It‰Ûªs terrific. I, you know, I just can‰Ûªt help feel bad about Sheldon. I mean, how‰Ûªs he going to get by without you? Ernie.",6
29287,Leonard,15, He‰Ûªs got Amy now.,6
29288,Penny,15," Yeah, he does, but it‰Ûªs not the same.",6
29289,Leonard,15, Why?,6
29290,Penny,15," Um, well, um, all right. You, you know how in Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince, Ron didn‰Ûªt abandon Harry just because Harry started dating Ron‰Ûªs sister?",6
29291,Leonard,15, Harry and Ginny get together?,6
29292,Penny,15," Sorry. Spoiler alert. My point is, as much as I want to live with you, I can‰Ûªt do it knowing how much Sheldon needs you.",6
29293,Leonard,15," Please, the only thing he needs me for is to be his whipping boy, his, his stooge, his doormat.",6
29294,Penny,15," Well, you know what they say, if it ain‰Ûªt broke.",6
29295,Leonard,15, Wow. It sounds to me like you don‰Ûªt want us to live together.,6
29296,Penny,15," No. No, no, I do. I do. It‰Ûªs just, I mean, it‰Ûªs a really big step.",6
29297,Leonard,15," Is it? We‰Ûªre together all the time. Financially, it makes great sense. Can you think of one reason why we shouldn‰Ûªt do this?",6
29298,Penny,15," Well, um, I‰Ûªm just a little thirsty.",6
29299,Leonard,15, Yeah.,6
29300,Penny,15, I got nothing.,6
29301,Leonard,15, Great. I‰Ûªll go get my stuff.,6
29302,Penny,15," Yeah. Okay, all right, don‰Ûªt freak out. You can make this work.",6
29303,Leonard,15," Oh, could you clear off a shelf for me in the bathroom? I take a lot of medicine.",6
29304,Penny,15," Oh, please let some of it be Xanax.",6
29305,Scene,15, Mrs Wolowitz‰Ûªs house.,6
29306,Mrs Wolowitz (off),15, Are you ready for dessert?,6
29307,Raj,15," No, thank you, Mrs. Wolowitz. As it is, I‰Ûªm going to have to carry my stomach out of here like I‰Ûªm a fireman rescuing an infant.",6
29308,Mrs Wolowitz (off),15," Oh, please. You‰Ûªre a tall glass of brown water. Have dessert.",6
29309,Raj,15," Well, I, I really couldn‰Ûªt. But, uh, I‰Ûªve had a lovely time eating your brisket and hearing about the things you‰Ûªve had removed from your body over the years. Didn‰Ûªt know you could have a cyst inside another cyst.",6
29310,Mrs Wolowitz (off),15," The doctor said they were like Russian nesting dolls. Well, if you have to go, how about I put a little doggie bag together for you?",6
29311,Raj,15," That would be lovely. Thank you. (Sound of crying) Mrs. Wolowitz, uh, are you okay?",6
29312,Mrs Wolowitz (off),15, Don‰Ûªt mind me. I just cry when I‰Ûªm lonely and have nothing to live for.,6
29313,Raj,15," I, uh, I suppose I could stay for some dessert.",6
29314,Mrs Wolowitz (off),15, Great. You like chocolate chip cheesecake?,6
29315,Raj,15, Sure.,6
29316,Mrs Wolowitz (off),15, I‰Ûªll make one.,6
29317,Scene,15, The apartment.,6
29318,Sheldon,15, One vintage Mr. Mxyzptlk action figure. That‰Ûªs Leonard‰Ûªs.,6
29319,Amy,15, Children‰Ûªs toy.,6
29320,Amy,15, Children‰Ûªs toy.,6
29321,Sheldon,15," One Game of Thrones collector‰Ûªs edition Longclaw sword. Oh, Leonard and I bought that together. That‰Ûªs a bit of an ethical conundrum. Eh, I‰Ûªll keep it.",6
29322,Amy,15," So, uh, what‰Ûªs your plan moving forward?",6
29323,Sheldon,15," Uh, suppose I‰Ûªll have to find and cultivate a new roommate. What a task that will be. Do you know how uncivilized Leonard was when I took him in?",6
29324,Amy,15, No.,6
29325,Sheldon,15," Oh, it took me forever to get him on a bathroom schedule. He would just go whenever the mood struck him.",6
29326,Amy,15, Like a dog-boy.,6
29327,Sheldon,15, Exactly.,6
29328,Amy,15, What if you could find a roommate who was a scientist and already familiar and comfortable with your ways?,6
29329,Sheldon,15," That would be ideal. If a person like that existed, I would sign on, no further questions asked.",6
29330,Amy,15, Great. Here I am!,6
29331,Sheldon,15, Wait. Here who is where?,6
29332,Amy,15, Me. Aren‰Ûªt I your perfect roommate?,6
29333,Sheldon,15, Um‰Û_,6
29334,Amy,15," Think about it, Sheldon. I‰Ûªm not a stranger, we‰Ûªre intellectually compatible, I‰Ûªm willing to chauffeur you around town, and your personality quirks, which others find abhorrent or rage-inducing, I find cute as a button. What do you think?",6
29335,Sheldon,15, Um‰Û_,6
29336,Amy,15, Tell me one reason why this isn‰Ûªt a fantastic idea.,6
29337,Sheldon,15, Um‰Û_,6
29338,Amy,15, See? You can‰Ûªt. I‰Ûªm gonna go see if Leonard‰Ûªs room is big enough for my water bed.,6
29339,Sheldon,15, Um‰Û_,6
29340,Scene,15, Penny‰Ûªs apartment. ,6
29341,Sheldon,15," (Knock, knock, knock) Good buddy Leonard. (Knock, knock, knock) Good buddy Leonard. (Knock, knock, knock) Good buddy Leonard.",6
29342,Leonard,15, What do you want?,6
29343,Sheldon,15," Hey, good buddy. So, uh, I was just talking to Amy, and she made me realize that this little dust-up between you and me is much ado about nothing.",6
29344,Leonard,15, Is that so?,6
29345,Sheldon,15," Yes. All is forgiven, so come back home. I‰Ûªll make you some soy hot chocolate, and then I‰Ûªll you tell you about our exciting new devil-may-care bathroom policy.",6
29346,Leonard,15," Cut to the chase, Sheldon.",6
29347,Sheldon,15," Okay. Amy‰Ûªs decided she wants to move in with me, so I need you to come back home, you lovable scamp. That‰Ûªs a lot of product.",6
29348,Penny,15, Hey. What‰Ûªs going on?,6
29349,Leonard,15," Oh, get this, suddenly, Sheldon wants me back because Amy wants to move in with him.",6
29350,Penny,15, Really? Interesting.,6
29351,Leonard,15," Well, too late, pal. I‰Ûªm not going anywhere. Penny and I are very happy living together. Isn‰Ûªt that right?",6
29352,Penny,15, It‰Ûªs like the happiness won‰Ûªt ever leave the apartment.,6
29353,Sheldon,15," Leonard, please. You know Amy moving in marks a level of intimacy our relationship isn‰Ûªt ready for.",6
29354,Penny,15," Yes. That is a real thing. And it doesn‰Ûªt mean you don‰Ûªt care about each other, it just means things are moving at a pace you‰Ûªre not comfortable with, and that‰Ûªs fine.",6
29355,Leonard,15," Well, if he doesn‰Ûªt want to live with her, then he should tell her how he feels.",6
29356,Penny,15," Well, maybe he doesn‰Ûªt know how to say it without hurting her feelings.",6
29357,Sheldon,15," Feelings? What am I, a hippie at a love-in? No. The problem is, she laid out a series of logical arguments that I couldn‰Ûªt refute.",6
29358,Penny,15," That is the worst, isn‰Ûªt it?",6
29359,Sheldon,15, Yes.,6
29360,Leonard,15," I‰Ûªm sorry, Sheldon. I can‰Ûªt help you. Oh, spoiler alert, this door‰Ûªs about to slam in your face.",6
29361,Amy,15," Oh, there you are. When do I get a key to our apartment?",6
29362,Sheldon,15, Um‰Û_,6
29363,Scene,15, Howard‰Ûªs old bedroom. A phone is ringing.,6
29364,Raj,15, Hello?,6
29365,Howard,15, Hey. How‰Ûªd it go last night with my mom?,6
29366,Raj,15," Okay, I guess.",6
29367,Howard,15, What time did you leave?,6
29368,Raj,15," Actually, I‰Ûªm still here.",6
29369,Howard,15, What? You spent the night?,6
29370,Raj,15," Yeah. Uh, after dinner, we watched a rerun of Rockford Files, and then she opened a bottle of, uh, cream sherry, and the next thing I know, she was tucking me into your bed.",6
29371,Howard,15, You wore my pyjamas?,6
29372,Raj,15," Mm-hmm. How do you sleep in these things? Silk pajamas on satin sheets? I slid out of the bed, like, three times.",6
29373,Mrs Wolowitz (off),15, Rajesh! You up? You ready for breakfast?,6
29374,Raj,15," Oh, boy. Breakfast.",6
29375,Howard,15," Okay, Raj, listen to me. You need to get out of there.",6
29376,Raj,15, But I have a cream sherry hangover and I smell blintzes.,6
29377,Howard,15," If you don‰Ûªt leave now, she‰Ûªll use food and guilt to keep you there for the rest of your life.",6
29378,Raj,15," Oh, Howard, stop.",6
29379,Howard,15," Trust me, you‰Ûªre not Jewish. That‰Ûªs how they get you.",6
29380,Raj,15, You‰Ûªre being silly. I can leave whenever I want.,6
29381,Howard,15," Oh, really? Where are your clothes and your shoes?",6
29382,Raj,15," They‰Ûªre on the chair, right over‰Û_ Oy vey.",6
29383,Scene,15, The stairwell.,6
29384,Sheldon,15," Hello, home wrecker.",6
29385,Penny,15, What did I do?,6
29386,Sheldon,15," You gave Leonard somewhere to go. Thanks to you, Amy‰Ûªs out buying his and hers bath towels. Like I‰Ûªd ever dry myself with something that has a possessive pronoun on it.",6
29387,Penny,15," Okay. Listen, the truth is I don‰Ûªt want him living with me.",6
29388,Sheldon,15, Great. Kick him out. Break his heart. Everybody wins.,6
29389,Penny,15," No, I don‰Ûªt want to break his heart. I love him. This is just happening too fast.",6
29390,Sheldon,15, You think this is fast? It‰Ûªs just a matter of time before I see Amy‰Ûªs leg stubble in my shower.,6
29391,Penny,15," Yeah, and I‰Ûªve seen those legs. You might want to get some Drano.",6
29392,Sheldon,15," Hold on. If you don‰Ûªt want to live with Leonard, why don‰Ûªt you just tell him?",6
29393,Penny,15," Well, you know how he is. He‰Ûªs sensitive and emotional.",6
29394,Sheldon,15, That‰Ûªs because he drinks too much soy milk.,6
29395,Penny,15," Well, I don‰Ûªt know what else we can do but tell them the truth.",6
29396,Sheldon,15," I suppose there‰Ûªs no choice but to face the crying, angry accusations and the high-pitched wails of despair.",6
29397,Penny,15, Yeah. And who knows how Amy will react.,6
29398,Scene,15, A hotel room.,6
29399,Howard,15, Here‰Ûªs some more ice.,6
29400,Bernadette,15," Oh, thanks.",6
29401,Howard,15, What were we thinking? We should have just done it the regular way.,6
29402,Bernadette,15, Those Chinese acrobats in Cirque du Soleil made it look so easy.,6
29403,Howard,15," Honestly, if I could bend that far, what would I need with you?",6
29404,Bernadette,15," If you could bend that far, you‰Ûªd be doing us both a favour. (Phone) ",6
29405,Howard,15," Hey, Raj. What‰Ûªs up?",6
29406,Raj,15, You were right. I can‰Ûªt get out of here.,6
29407,Howard,15, You‰Ûªre still at my mother‰Ûªs?,6
29408,Raj,15," I‰Ûªm trapped. My clothes have been in the laundry all day, and she hid my keys. I think they might be in her bra, because she jingles when she walks. What do I do?",6
29409,Howard,15," Hey, you wanted a woman in your life. Now you got one.",6
29410,Raj,15," Come on, Howard, help me.",6
29411,Mrs Wolowitz (off),15," Rajesh, tatellah, I ran you a bath.",6
29412,Raj,15," Oh, my God. She‰Ûªs not gonna bathe me, is she?",6
29413,Howard,15," Gee, I wish I could tell you no. All right, well, thanks again for helping me out.",6
29414,Raj,15," But, Howard‰Û_",6
29415,Bernadette,15, Should we go back and rescue him?,6
29416,Howard,15, It‰Ûªs too late. We‰Ûªll see him at his Bar Mitzvah.,6
29417,Scene,15, The apartment.,6
29418,Amy,15, Here you go. I picked up the Chinese food just the way Leonard used to.,6
29419,Sheldon,15, Is it kung pao chicken?,6
29420,Amy,15, Yes.,6
29421,Sheldon,15," Brown rice, not white rice?",6
29422,Amy,15, Yes.,6
29423,Sheldon,15, Spicy mustard from the Korean deli?,6
29424,Amy,15," Yes. I did good, right?",6
29425,Sheldon,15," Yes. Amy, are you worried that us living together will take the mystery out of our relationship?",6
29426,Amy,15, No.,6
29427,Sheldon,15," Yeah, why would you?",6
29428,Amy,15," Oh, and, uh, check this out. I took the liberty of scripting a new outgoing voice mail message for both of us.",6
29429,Sheldon,15, Hello. This is Sheldon.,6
29430,Amy,15, And this is Amy.,6
29431,Sheldon,15, We‰Ûªre not home right now.,6
29432,Amy,15," ‰Û÷Cause we out dropping science, son.",6
29433,Together,15, Leave a message.,6
29434,Amy,15, Beep.,6
29435,Sheldon,15, You can‰Ûªt live here.,6
29436,Amy,15, What? Why? Is it the message? I only used urban slang to sound tough so people wouldn‰Ûªt break in.,6
29437,Sheldon,15, No. It‰Ûªs not the message.,6
29438,Amy,15," Well, what is it, then? I did everything just the way you like it.",6
29439,Sheldon,15, You did.,6
29440,Amy,15," Then what the hell, Sheldon? We have been going out for over two years, and I have been nothing but patient with you. I watch your dopey space movies. I signed your ridiculous contract. I even stopped wearing lip gloss ‰Ûªcause you said it made my mouth look too slippery. I am the best girlfriend you‰Ûªre ever gonna have. You give me one good reason why I can‰Ûªt live here.",6
29441,Sheldon,15, It‰Ûªs Penny‰Ûªs fault.,6
29442,Amy,15, What?,6
29443,Sheldon,15," She doesn‰Ûªt want to live with Leonard, so he has to come live here again. She‰Ûªs the snake in our garden. She‰Ûªs the reason we can‰Ûªt be happy.",6
29444,Scene,15, Penny‰Ûªs apartment.,6
29445,Penny,15," Hey, Ames.",6
29446,Amy,15," Yeah. Hey, Ames, nothing. I was all set to move in with Sheldon, and now I hear I can‰Ûªt ‰Ûªcause you don‰Ûªt want to live with Leonard.",6
29447,Leonard (off),15, What?,6
29448,Penny,15," Sheldon, what did you say?",6
29449,Sheldon,15," I said the truth. You don‰Ûªt want to live with Leonard, and you know it.",6
29450,Leonard,15, Since when don‰Ûªt you want to live with me?,6
29451,Penny,15," Oh, don‰Ûªt get all huffy. You‰Ûªre the one who decided to move in without even asking me if I was ready.",6
29452,Sheldon,15," Yeah, I think we should talk about that.",6
29453,Penny,15," And since you love the truth so much, why don‰Ûªt you tell Amy you don‰Ûªt want to live with her instead of blaming it on me?",6
29454,Sheldon,15, I thought we were talking about the other thing.,6
29455,Amy,15, You‰Ûªre a coward.,6
29456,Sheldon,15," Well, the evidence does support that.",6
29457,Penny,15," Come on, Amy, let‰Ûªs go drink wine and talk about what jerks our boyfriends are.",6
29458,Amy,15, You know what would show them? I should move in here with you.,6
29459,Penny,15, Um‰Û_,6
29460,Sheldon,15, Do you want to catch up on some Walking Dead?,6
29461,Leonard,15, ‰Û÷Kay.,6
29462,Sheldon,15, Have you seen the one where Lori dies?,6
29463,Leonard,15, No.,6
29464,Sheldon,15, Or maybe she doesn‰Ûªt. Let‰Ûªs find out.,6
29465,Scene,15, Mrs Wolowitz‰Ûªs house. Raj is climbing out of the window.,6
29466,Mrs Wolowitz (off),15, Where you going?,6
29467,Raj (screams),15, No!,6
29468,Scene,16, Penny‰Ûªs apartment.,6
29469,Penny,16, You‰Ûªll never believe what happened to me at work today.,6
29470,Leonard,16, Hmm?,6
29471,Penny,16," This old guy was choking on his food, and I saved his life.",6
29472,Leonard,16, You‰Ûªre kidding. Did you Heimlich him?,6
29473,Penny,16," No. I said, oh, my God, I think that old guy‰Ûªs choking, and then one of the busboys Heimlich‰Ûªed him.",6
29474,Leonard,16, You‰Ûªre a hero.,6
29475,Penny,16," Yeah, that was the point of the story.",6
29476,Leonard,16," Oh, yeah, speaking of work, do you know if you have Thursday night off?",6
29477,Penny,16," Um, I think so. Why?",6
29478,Leonard,16," What do you mean, why? It‰Ûªs Valentine‰Ûªs Day.",6
29479,Penny,16," Oh, right. Yeah, we can do something.",6
29480,Leonard,16, You could be a little more into it.,6
29481,Penny,16," No, I‰Ûªm into it, I‰Ûªm into it. Just, there‰Ûªs so much pressure to make the night special, and it never works out.",6
29482,Leonard,16," Okay, well, this time it‰Ûªs going to be different. Because I am like a romance ninja. You don‰Ûªt see it coming, and then bam, romance, watch out, hearts, kisses, love, ooh-ya!",6
29483,Penny,16," You know, sometimes I think I‰Ûªve made you so much cooler than you used to be, and then you go and do that.",6
29484,Scene,16, The stairwell.,6
29485,Sheldon,16," So, in conclusion, I believe the painful sensation felt after passing a meal of spicy chillies is proof that the rectum does possess the sense of taste.",6
29486,Amy,16," I concur, but you changed the subject. What are we doing for Valentine‰Ûªs Day?",6
29487,Sheldon,16," Oh, you caught that, did you?",6
29488,Scene,16, The comic book store.,6
29489,Howard (on phone),16, Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay! Okay.,6
29490,Raj,16, Everything okay?,6
29491,Howard,16," Bernie‰Ûªs a little cranky since she‰Ûªs been working, like, 17 hours a day. And I‰Ûªve got a lot on my plate, too, because I‰Ûªve been busting my tail playing Assassin‰Ûªs Creed.",6
29492,Raj,16," Hey, Stuart, you got anything going on for Valentine‰Ûªs Day?",6
29493,Stuart,16, Not really. Other than hiding all the sharp objects around here and white-knuckling it till morning. What do you got going on?,6
29494,Raj,16," Oh, well, I was going to spend the night with my special little lady, but, uh, she got worms, and then I had to take her to the vet.",6
29495,Stuart,16, There must be something we can do.,6
29496,Raj,16," Well, uh, how about you keep the store open late, and we throw a party for all the people who don‰Ûªt have dates?",6
29497,Raj,16," Yeah, the theme will be that the greatest love a man can have is the love he has with himself.",6
29498,Stuart,16, That‰Ûªs good. Or maybe something a little less hand in the pants.,6
29499,Scene,16, Sheldon‰Ûªs office.,6
29500,Sheldon,16," Ah, Alex, excellent. I have a research problem that I believe you can help with.",6
29501,Alex,16," Oh, Dr. Cooper, thank you. I‰Ûªve been waiting for an opportunity to contribute to your scientific work.",6
29502,Sheldon,16," Oh, no, no. That‰Ûªs not going to happen, no. What I need you to do is find a Valentine‰Ûªs gift for my girlfriend.",6
29503,Alex,16, You realize I passed up an opportunity to work at Fermilab to take this job with you.,6
29504,Sheldon,16," Well, I guess those chaps will have to have someone else buy their girlfriends presents. Now, here is, let‰Ûªs see, this is, this is about two thousand dollars, um, I think she likes monkeys and the colour grey. Contribute to my work. Ah, kids say the darnedest things.",6
29505,Scene,16, Howard‰Ûªs lab.,6
29506,Leonard,16," Hey, you coming to lunch?",6
29507,Howard,16," Yeah, one second. Come here. I want to show you something.",6
29508,Leonard,16, What you looking at?,6
29509,Howard,16," Well, I was trying to come up with something really romantic to give Bernadette for Valentine‰Ûªs Day since she‰Ûªs been such a pain in the ass.",6
29510,Leonard,16, You can‰Ûªt find a card that says that?,6
29511,Howard,16, Check it out. I used the atomic force microscope in the material science lab and wrote our initials in a heart one one-thousandth the size of a grain of sand.,6
29512,Leonard,16," Oh, that‰Ûªs cool.",6
29513,Howard,16, A micro-valentine for a microbiologist.,6
29514,Leonard,16, From her micro-husband. That is amazing. How long did this take you?,6
29515,Howard,16," Mmm, about twelve hours. I pulled an all-nighter.",6
29516,Leonard,16," Oh, wow.",6
29517,Howard,16," Yeah, I know, it really took a bite out of my video game time. What are you and Penny doing?",6
29518,Leonard,16," Oh, I‰Ûªm going to take her to a nice restaurant for dinner.",6
29519,Howard,16," Oh, that‰Ûªs not bad, but as far as romance goes, I think my gift hits it right out of‰Û_ (Bumps into chair and drops the slide)",6
29520,Leonard,16, Want to come to dinner with us?,6
29521,Howard,16," Yes, please.",6
29522,Scene,16, The apartment.,6
29523,Sheldon,16," Okay. Amy will be here shortly, expecting the perfect Valentine‰Ûªs gift, so, you‰Ûªre up kid. Dazzle me. Go.",6
29524,Alex,16," Okay, I think I have some really great choices. I went on Amy‰Ûªs Facebook page and read up on her interests.",6
29525,Sheldon,16," Now, see, I never would have thought to do that. Clearly, I made a good choice farming this out to you. But I am telling you, Amy hit the boyfriend jackpot. Anyway, my socks are on. Let‰Ûªs knock them off.",6
29526,Alex,16," Well, um, I know she loves playing the harp, so I found this beautiful music box that plays one of her favourite songs.",6
29527,Sheldon,16," Now, Amy already has a real harp. And it can play any song. What are you trying to pull here?",6
29528,Alex,16," No, I just thought it would be‰Û_",6
29529,Sheldon,16, Next.,6
29530,Alex,16," Okay. Um, I know she‰Ûªs a fan of The Canterbury Tales.",6
29531,Sheldon,16, Mmm.,6
29532,Alex,16, So I found this cool map that illustrates the character‰Ûªs journey through England. I thought we could put it in a really nice frame.,6
29533,Sheldon,16, But she‰Ûªs got Google Maps on her phone.,6
29534,Alex,16, I don‰Ûªt know how to respond to that.,6
29535,Sheldon,16," Well, I hope it‰Ûªs with a third good option, because these first two, buh.",6
29536,Alex,16," Okay. Well, uh, luckily, I saved the best for last. Since Amy‰Ûªs a neuroscientist, I did some research and found out that Santiago Ramon y Cajal, the father of modern neuroscience, did lots of hand drawings of brain cells. And I managed to find this signed print.",6
29537,Sheldon,16," Wow. Oh, this is truly remarkable.",6
29538,Alex,16, Thank you.,6
29539,Sheldon,16, I think I‰Ûªll keep it for myself.,6
29540,Alex,16, What about your girlfriend?,6
29541,Sheldon,16, It‰Ûªs too late. I call dibs.,6
29542,Scene,16, a restaurant.,6
29543,Penny,16, This place is really beautiful.,6
29544,Leonard,16," Waugh, romance ninja.",6
29545,Penny,16, Hey.,6
29546,Howard,16, Sorry we‰Ûªre late.,6
29547,Penny,16, No problem. We just sat down.,6
29548,Leonard,16," Mmm, would you like some wine?",6
29549,Bernadette,16," Yeah, fill her up. I‰Ûªll tell you when to stop.",6
29550,Penny,16, Is everything okay?,6
29551,Howard,16, Terrific. Couldn‰Ûªt be better.,6
29552,Bernadette,16," Oh, bite me.",6
29553,Howard,16," Look, we can still have a nice night. Just tell me where it is.",6
29554,Bernadette,16," Maybe if you did what you said you were going to do, I‰Ûªd tell you.",6
29555,Leonard,16," Uh, where what is?",6
29556,Howard,16," She hid my Xbox like I‰Ûªm a child. Yeah, and my mom got me that for my birthday, so if you don‰Ûªt give it back, I‰Ûªm telling.",6
29557,Bernadette,16," I‰Ûªve been working late every night. All I asked was that he clean the apartment and do one load of laundry. But did he do it? No. He just kept on playing that stupid game. You like pushing buttons so much, try pushing them on the washing machine.",6
29558,Howard,16, I said I‰Ûªm sorry.,6
29559,Bernadette,16," Sorry doesn‰Ûªt clean my underpants, buddy.",6
29560,Howard,16," I told you, turn them inside out.",6
29561,Bernadette,16, And I told you to bite me.,6
29562,Leonard,16," Trying to have a magical night here, guys.",6
29563,Penny,16," Oh, son of a bitch.",6
29564,Leonard,16, What?,6
29565,Penny,16, Nothing. Nothing.,6
29566,Leonard,16," No, tell me.",6
29567,Penny,16, It‰Ûªs just this guy I used to date.,6
29568,Leonard,16, Oh.,6
29569,Penny,16," Until he cheated on me with my friend Gretchen, who‰Ûªs here with him now.",6
29570,Leonard,16, You‰Ûªre kidding.,6
29571,Penny,16," And it looks like she lost a lot of weight, damn it.",6
29572,Leonard,16," I know it‰Ûªs not ideal, but don‰Ûªt let them ruin our night.",6
29573,Penny,16," No, you‰Ûªre totally right. She could be skinny ‰Ûªcause she‰Ûªs dying.",6
29574,Leonard,16, That‰Ûªs the spirit.,6
29575,Penny,16," You know what, screw them. Our night is going to be way more special than theirs.",6
29576,Leonard,16, Yeah.,6
29577,Bernadette,16, Uh-oh.,6
29578,Penny,16," What? (Penny‰Ûªs ex is proposing to Gretchen) Oh, you got to be kidding me.",6
29579,Gretchen,16," Oh, my God, yes. Of course I‰Ûªll marry you.",6
29580,Leonard,16, Two can play this game. Penny‰Û_,6
29581,Penny,16, Get up.,6
29582,Leonard,16, All right.,6
29583,Scene,16, The comic book store.,6
29584,Raj,16, It‰Ûªs nice that all the people who are lonely on Valentine‰Ûªs Day can come here tonight and be together.,6
29585,Stuart,16," Yeah, I‰Ûªm really looking forward to it. In fact, there‰Ûªs no place I would rather be than here.",6
29586,Raj,16, Except on a date with anybody.,6
29587,Stuart,16, Literally anybody.,6
29588,Raj,16," You know, you and I have so much fun hanging out. If you were a girl, all our problems would be solved.",6
29589,Stuart,16, What?,6
29590,Raj,16," Oh, yeah, think about it. We‰Ûªd hang out, we‰Ûªd read comic books, we‰Ûªd see movies. It‰Ûªd be like the best relationship ever.",6
29591,Stuart,16, That does sound nice.,6
29592,Raj,16," Then I‰Ûªd take you home, slip off your little black dress and just pile-drive you into oblivion.",6
29593,Stuart,16, What?,6
29594,Scene,16, The restaurant.,6
29595,Penny,16," Oh, I can‰Ûªt believe he‰Ûªs going to marry the girl he cheated on me with.",6
29596,Leonard,16," Isn‰Ûªt it kind of nice? I mean, he was with the wrong person, and now he found the right person.",6
29597,Penny,16," What, so I‰Ûªm the wrong person? Maybe you want to be with Gretchen, too.",6
29598,Bernadette,16, They do look happy.,6
29599,Howard,16," Yeah, maybe tonight. But a year from now, he‰Ûªll be crawling under the sink looking for his Xbox. Well, he will.",6
29600,Leonard,16, You know what? Why don‰Ûªt we just forget about them and enjoy our Valentine‰Ûªs Day?,6
29601,Penny,16," Yes, absolutely. Now they‰Ûªre doing that phony link-arm-drink thingy. I totally taught him that.",6
29602,Leonard,16, I thought we were letting it go.,6
29603,Penny,16," We were; it‰Ûªs just, it‰Ûªs not fair, okay? They‰Ûªre bad people. It‰Ûªs not supposed to end happy for them, it‰Ûªs supposed to end happy for me.",6
29604,Leonard,16," Um, it did end happy for you. You‰Ûªre here with me.",6
29605,Penny,16," Yeah, yeah, I know.",6
29606,Leonard,16," Okay, this is getting a little hard to not take personally.",6
29607,Penny,16," Oh, come on, don‰Ûªt make this about you.",6
29608,Leonard,16," Oh, I‰Ûªm not. It‰Ûªs about you.",6
29609,Penny,16," Yeah, well, whatever, okay? I told you, Valentine‰Ûªs Day sucks.",6
29610,Leonard,16," This one does, and you‰Ûªre the reason why.",6
29611,Penny,16, What?,6
29612,Bernadette,16," You know, compared to them, I‰Ûªm feeling pretty good about us.",6
29613,Howard,16," Me, too. How about we blow off dessert, go home early, I‰Ûªll do that laundry.",6
29614,Bernadette,16, Thank you.,6
29615,Howard,16, I love you.,6
29616,Bernadette,16," Love you, too.",6
29617,Howard,16, So where‰Ûªd you hide it?,6
29618,Bernadette,16, Where you‰Ûªd never look.,6
29619,Howard,16," Damn it, it‰Ûªs in the washing machine.",6
29620,Scene,16, The apartment.,6
29621,Amy,16, Hello.,6
29622,Sheldon,16, Hello.,6
29623,Amy,16, Happy Valentine‰Ûªs Day.,6
29624,Sheldon,16, Okay. Shall we go to dinner?,6
29625,Amy,16," Hang on. As you know, I had planned a traditional evening of romance and gifts.",6
29626,Sheldon,16," Yes, and as you know, I planned to pretend to enjoy it. I‰Ûªve been working on this facial expression all day.",6
29627,Amy,16," And I appreciate your effort, but upon contemplation, I decided I was being selfish. So, I cancelled our dinner reservations and came up with an even better way to celebrate Valentine‰Ûªs Day.",6
29628,Sheldon,16, What is that?,6
29629,Amy,16," By doing none of it. No dinner, no romance, no gifts. We stay here, order a pizza and watch one of your beloved Star War Trek things.",6
29630,Sheldon,16, Really?,6
29631,Amy,16," Well, that‰Ûªs what you‰Ûªd love, isn‰Ûªt it?",6
29632,Sheldon,16, More than anything.,6
29633,Amy,16," Well, then, that‰Ûªs what we‰Ûªre going to do.",6
29634,Sheldon,16," Well, I don‰Ûªt know what to say. This is the most thoughtful gift that anyone‰Ûªs ever given me. And that‰Ûªs including an amazing gift that I gave myself earlier today.",6
29635,Amy,16," I‰Ûªm your girlfriend. That‰Ûªs my job. And I know gift-giving puts a lot of pressure on you, so whatever you got me, you can return.",6
29636,Sheldon,16," No. No, after everything you didn‰Ûªt do for me tonight, I want you to have it.",6
29637,Amy,16, What‰Ûªs this?,6
29638,Sheldon,16, Read it.,6
29639,Amy,16," Sheldon Cooper, Caltech University employee information?",6
29640,Sheldon,16, At the bottom.,6
29641,Amy,16," In case of emergency, please contact‰Û_ Amy Farrah Fowler. And there‰Ûªs my phone number. This is the most beautiful gift you could‰Ûªve ever given me.",6
29642,Sheldon,16," Well, I thought, if I have a stroke or a kidney stone, who would I want to share that with?",6
29643,Amy,16, And you picked me.,6
29644,Sheldon,16," It‰Ûªs like you said, you‰Ûªre my girlfriend.",6
29645,Amy,16," Oh, Sheldon.",6
29646,Sheldon,16, Yeah. Okay. Stop ruining Valentine‰Ûªs Day and order my pizza.,6
29647,Scene,16, The stairwell.,6
29648,Penny,16, Night.,6
29649,Leonard,16," Yep. You know what? That was pretty crappy of you. I mean, all I wanted to do was give you a great night, and it‰Ûªs like you-you went out of your way to destroy it.",6
29650,Penny,16," Yeah, I know. I‰Ûªm a total bitch.",6
29651,Leonard,16, I‰Ûªm not saying that.,6
29652,Penny,16," Well, I am.",6
29653,Leonard,16," Fine, you win. You‰Ûªre a bitch. Why couldn‰Ûªt we just have a nice time?",6
29654,Penny,16, I don‰Ûªt know. Maybe ‰Ûªcause things are going so well between us lately and I‰Ûªve been really happy.,6
29655,Leonard,16," Okay, you‰Ûªre gonna have to make a lot more sense than that.",6
29656,Penny,16," Obviously, I have some commitment issues.",6
29657,Leonard,16, Glaringly obvious. Go on.,6
29658,Penny,16," As long as things keep going great between us, you‰Ûªll keep asking me to marry you, and eventually I‰Ûªm gonna end up saying yes, and then we‰Ûªre gonna be married forever, and the whole thing just freaks me out.",6
29659,Leonard,16, Okay. I know I propose a lot. So how about this? I promise I will never ask you to marry me again.,6
29660,Penny,16," What, what do you mean? Are you breaking up with me?",6
29661,Leonard,16," No. No, no, no, no. But if someday you decide you want to get married, you have to propose to me.",6
29662,Penny,16, Really?,6
29663,Leonard,16," Yes. It‰Ûªs all on you. But I got to tell you, when the time comes, I want the whole nine yards. I want you down on one knee, flowers, I want to be swept off my feet.",6
29664,Penny,16," Yeah, you got it.",6
29665,Leonard,16, And I‰Ûªm cool with surprises. But nothing on a Jumbotron. I don‰Ûªt want to cry on a big screen like that.,6
29666,Penny,16," Okay. You know what? This might be the wine talking, but I have a very important question to ask you.",6
29667,Leonard,16, You do?,6
29668,Penny,16, Leonard Hofstadter?,6
29669,Leonard,16, Yes?,6
29670,Penny,16, Will you be my valentine?,6
29671,Leonard,16, Sorry. Maybe next year. I‰Ûªm just kidding. Romance ninja. Let‰Ûªs have sex. Waugh!,6
29672,Scene,16, The comic book store.,6
29673,Nerdy guy,16," Thank you, guys, for doing this.",6
29674,Raj,16, We‰Ûªre glad you could make it.,6
29675,Nerdy guy,16," Usually I spend Valentine‰Ûªs Day sad and alone. This year, I‰Ûªm just sad.",6
29676,Raj,16, What is it about this holiday that makes people so unhappy?,6
29677,Stuart,16," I know. I hate myself most of the time, but tonight‰Ûªs the night I know everyone else does, too.",6
29678,Nerdy guy,16, I think you‰Ûªre cool.,6
29679,Stuart,16, Great.,6
29680,Raj,16," I got to tell you, we‰Ûªve got to stop beating ourselves up like this. Excuse me, everybody. Can I have your attention, please? We‰Ûªre all here tonight because we have no one to be with. But that doesn‰Ûªt make us mutants. The only mutants here are in these comic books. We‰Ûªve got to stop defining our self-worth by whether or not we‰Ûªre in a relationship. You know what I see when I look around? I see a room full of great people. So let‰Ûªs give ourselves a break. We are a community, and as long as we have each other, we‰Ûªre never truly alone.",6
29681,Girl,16, That was cool. What you said.,6
29682,Raj,16, You really think so?,6
29683,Girl,16," Yeah, I do.",6
29684,Raj,16," Thank you. Uh, would you like to, uh, get a cup, a cup of coffee or‰Û_?",6
29685,Girl,16, Okay.,6
29686,Raj,16," Later, losers!",6
29687,Scene,16, Amy‰Ûªs lab. Phone rings.,6
29688,Amy,16," Hello? Another medical emergency? What‰Ûªs wrong with him now? I seriously doubt he was bitten by a Chinese bird spider. How exactly does a bump feel Asian? Just put him on the phone. Sheldon, I am not driving over there again. Because I drove over there yesterday for a brain tumour that turned out to be an ice cream headache. Yes, I still want to be your emergency contact. Yes, you can eat your ice cream too fast and also have a brain tumour. I‰Ûªm on my way. Brain tumour would explain a lot.",6
29689,Scene,17, (After a ‰ÛÏpreviously on‰Û sequence) A coffee shop,6
29690,Raj,17," So then I went to Cambridge, which was wonderful not only because it‰Ûªs a good school but because it totally looks like Hogwarts. That‰Ûªs where I fell in love with astronomy, and now I‰Ûªm an astrophysicist at Caltech, so I guess you could say, uh, Raj is my name and stars are my game. And rhyming is also my game. So, uh, two games. Uh, anyway, that, that‰Ûªs enough about me. I want to hear everything about you.",6
29691,Girl,17, I have to go to the bathroom.,6
29692,Raj,17," I go to the bathroom, too. Sometimes more frequently than I care to admit. Oh, I‰Ûªve had it checked out, it‰Ûªs nothing. Hmm. This is going great. Mmm, can I have a refill on my chai tea? Yes, I have a good feeling about this. (Girl can be seen sneaking past window and leaving) I should have bought condoms.",6
29693,Scene,17, The apartment.,6
29694,Sheldon,17," Hello, I‰Ûªm Dr. Sheldon Cooper. Welcome to Sheldon Cooper Presents Fun with Flags. My apologies that this episode is coming late. I did shoot one last week, in honour of Black History Month, but I was informed by my roommate that my spot-on portrayal of George Washington Carver could be considered wildly racist. My heart goes out to the members of the African-American community, who, like me, have been kept down by The Man. Now, Fun with Flags is not just for the flag aficionado, it‰Ûªs also for the flag novice, so, to help me with that, please welcome my friend, neighbour, and flag virgin, yeah, not a real virgin. She‰Ûªs had coitus many times. Sometimes within earshot of this flag enthusiast. Once while he was trying to watch The Incredibles. Penny.",6
29695,Penny,17, Hello.,6
29696,Sheldon,17," So, Penny, I understand you would like to learn more about flags.",6
29697,Penny,17," Yeah, I can‰Ûªt tell you how many times I‰Ûªve been at a party where everyone‰Ûªs talking about flags and I just couldn‰Ûªt join in.",6
29698,Sheldon,17," Yeah. Well, you came to the right place.",6
29699,Penny,17," Uh, I‰Ûªm sorry, can we just pause for a minute?",6
29700,Sheldon,17, What‰Ûªs wrong?,6
29701,Penny,17," I just think it might look more natural if you talked to me instead of the camera, you know, like, like a real conversation. It‰Ûªs something we work on in my acting class.",6
29702,Sheldon,17, Interesting. A few people in the comments section have said that my delivery is robotic. Perhaps that isn‰Ûªt the compliment it sounds like.,6
29703,Penny,17," Yeah, let‰Ûªs try it again, and maybe, this time, you could work on your body language a bit. You know, when you‰Ûªre all hunched like that, you‰Ûªre shutting the audience out, but when you‰Ûªre relaxed and open, you‰Ûªre inviting them in.",6
29704,Sheldon,17, Right. And which one do I want?,6
29705,Penny,17, Let‰Ûªs try open.,6
29706,Sheldon,17," If our friend, the flag, has taught me anything, it‰Ûªs to go where the wind takes you. As long as you remain firmly attached to a rigid pole. And, action. So, Penny, what sort of flag questions keep you awake at night?",6
29707,Penny,17," Um, well, I‰Ûªm from Nebraska. So what can you tell me about the state flag?",6
29708,Sheldon,17," Gosh, Penny, what‰Ûªd you have for breakfast? A big glass of good question juice? The Nebraska state flag is simply the state seal on a field of blue. Spread your legs, invite them in.",6
29709,Scene,17, Outside Raj‰Ûªs apartment.,6
29710,Howard,17," I‰Ûªm telling you, something‰Ûªs wrong. I can always feel it when Raj is in trouble.",6
29711,Bernadette,17," Geez, how close were you guys before we got married?",6
29712,Leonard,17," Don‰Ûªt look under that rock. (Knocking) Raj, you okay?",6
29713,Howard,17, You in there?,6
29714,Raj (off),17, Go away!,6
29715,Leonard,17," Come on, buddy, open up.",6
29716,Howard,17, We‰Ûªre worried about you.,6
29717,Raj (off),17," Oh, just because I‰Ûªve stopped going to work and answering my phone you think something bad happened? Maybe something good happened.",6
29718,Bernadette,17, Did something good happen?,6
29719,Raj (off),17," Of course not. Nothing good ever happens. (Opens door. He is wearing a stained vest, his hair is unkempt, and he is drinking wine from a bottle.)",6
29720,Leonard,17, Whoa.,6
29721,Raj,17, What?,6
29722,Leonard,17," Nope, just, just, whoa.",6
29723,Bernadette,17, It smells pretty ripe in here. You kind feel it in your eyes.,6
29724,Leonard,17," Raj, what‰Ûªs going on?",6
29725,Raj,17, I was humiliated by yet another woman.,6
29726,Howard,17," You didn‰Ûªt kill her and chop her up, that‰Ûªs not what we‰Ûªre smelling, right?",6
29727,Raj,17," No. I took her for coffee, and she snuck out the bathroom window to get away from me.",6
29728,Bernadette,17," Oh, you poor baby.",6
29729,Raj,17, I went and looked. It was a high and tiny window. She must have been very motivated.,6
29730,Howard,17," I‰Ûªm sorry. That‰Ûªs awful, but come on, you got to shake it off.",6
29731,Leonard,17," Yeah, you can‰Ûªt stay in your apartment for the rest of your life.",6
29732,Raj,17," Why not? With online shopping and overnight delivery, I can get anything I want. Look, I just ordered a case of Dinty Moore beef stew and two live lobsters on Amazon.",6
29733,Leonard,17, Lobsters overnight?,6
29734,Howard,17," Oh, you‰Ûªre kidding. Let me see. Well, I‰Ûªll be. Look, you can throw in a couple steaks and have a surf and turf.",6
29735,Leonard,17, The surf and turf sounds good. See if they have corn on the cob.,6
29736,Bernadette,17," Guys, we‰Ûªre trying to get him out of here, not you in.",6
29737,Raj,17," You‰Ûªre wasting your time. Just please, leave me alone.",6
29738,Howard,17, Now what?,6
29739,Leonard,17, I don‰Ûªt know.,6
29740,Bernadette,17, We could go to Red Lobster and talk about it. We‰Ûªre all thinking it. I just had the decency to wait for him to leave.,6
29741,Scene,17, The apartment.,6
29742,Amy (on webcam),17," Hello, Sheldon.",6
29743,Sheldon,17, Hello. How‰Ûªs the final stage of your nicotine addiction study going?,6
29744,Amy,17," Fine. Just hold on. Mommy‰Ûªs on the phone! Sorry. We‰Ûªve cut the monkeys down to one cigarette a day, so things are a little intense. Makes me miss my marijuana-abusing flatworms. Those guys were mellow.",6
29745,Sheldon,17," Good news. Uh, the latest episode of Fun with Flags is online.",6
29746,Amy,17," Oh, that‰Ûªs right. How‰Ûªd it go with Penny?",6
29747,Sheldon,17, Much better than I expected. She even gave me some helpful tips about acting and body language. Watch. Welcome to my world. Not welcome to my world. Welcome. Not welcome.,6
29748,Amy,17," Subtle, but powerful.",6
29749,Sheldon,17, I know. I‰Ûªm still learning to control it.,6
29750,Amy,17, Did you tell Penny how helpful she was?,6
29751,Sheldon,17, Why would I do that?,6
29752,Amy,17," Because she‰Ûªs your friend, and she did a nice job. I‰Ûªm sure she‰Ûªd like to hear it.",6
29753,Sheldon,17, All right.,6
29754,Amy,17," I didn‰Ûªt mean now. Hello? Yeah, yeah, you want a cigarette. Well, I‰Ûªd like a normal boyfriend. Deal with it.",6
29755,Scene,17, Penny‰Ûªs apartment.,6
29756,Penny,17," Oh, hi. What‰Ûªs up?",6
29757,Sheldon,17, Um‰Û_,6
29758,Penny,17, You need me to shut the door so you can do your knocking thing?,6
29759,Sheldon,17," No. I didn‰Ûªt start yet, it‰Ûªs fine.",6
29760,Penny,17," Okay. So, what do you need?",6
29761,Sheldon,17," Well, I was thinking about you helping me out last night (knock, knock, knock) Penny. And I just wanted to tell you (knock, knock, knock) Penny, that the answer to the question, who did a great job? is you, (knock, knock, knock) Penny.",6
29762,Penny,17, Really?,6
29763,Sheldon,17," Yes, you were very natural in front of the camera, and I found your suggestions extremely helpful.",6
29764,Penny,17," Aw, sweetie, you just made my day.",6
29765,Sheldon,17, Okay.,6
29766,Penny,17," Hey, my acting class is putting on a play Friday night. I could put you and Amy on the guest list.",6
29767,Sheldon,17," Oh, that sounds terrible. Why would I want to do that?",6
29768,Scene,17, The apartment.,6
29769,Amy (on webcam),17, That‰Ûªs right. They‰Ûªre no good without the lighter.,6
29770,Sheldon,17," Well, so much for your advice on complimenting Penny.",6
29771,Amy,17, Why? What happened?,6
29772,Sheldon,17," She tried to rope us into going to her acting class to see a play. Don‰Ûªt worry. Luckily, I had the good sense to drown that kitten in the river.",6
29773,Amy,17," Sheldon, that‰Ûªs very rude. She helped you with your show. The right thing to do is reciprocate by going to see her play.",6
29774,Sheldon,17," Oh, so many crazy rules.",6
29775,Amy,17, That better be Tootsie Rolls you‰Ûªre throwing at me!,6
29776,Scene,17, Penny‰Ûªs apartment.,6
29777,Sheldon,17," (Knock, knock, knock) Penny. (Knock, knock, knock) Penny. (Knock, knock, knock) Penny. Oh yeah, much better.",6
29778,Penny,17, What?,6
29779,Sheldon,17," Amy pointed out to me that since you did something nice for me, I‰Ûªm obligated to do something nice for you. So, yes, I‰Ûªll go to your dopey play.",6
29780,Penny,17," Hey, I don‰Ûªt want you to go any more.",6
29781,Sheldon,17, Why not?,6
29782,Penny,17," You should go ‰Ûªcause you want to go, not because you have to.",6
29783,Sheldon,17," Oh, Dear Lord, more rules? Where does it stop? Can I want to go because I have to want to go?",6
29784,Penny,17, Okay. Do whatever you want.,6
29785,Sheldon,17," Yeah, but now, wait. Do whatever I want? Or whatever I have to want?",6
29786,Penny,17," Oh, for God‰Ûªs sake, just come to the play.",6
29787,Sheldon,17," All right. I don‰Ûªt want to, but at least that makes sense.",6
29788,Scene,17, The comic book store.,6
29789,Sheldon,17," You know, I haven‰Ûªt seen Raj in several days. Is he no longer a part of our social group? And if so, should we be interviewing for a replacement? Perhaps, this time, we go Latin.",6
29790,Howard,17, He‰Ûªs just decided he‰Ûªs never leaving his apartment again.,6
29791,Sheldon,17," Oh, brilliant. I‰Ûªve been itching to pull that trigger.",6
29792,Howard,17, He‰Ûªs upset because he can‰Ûªt get anywhere with women.,6
29793,Sheldon,17, Would it help if I gave him some pointers? I‰Ûªm just funnin‰Ûª ya.,6
29794,Girl,17," Hi. I don‰Ûªt know if you remember me, but I was here the other night at your party.",6
29795,Stuart,17," Oh, yeah, you left with Raj.",6
29796,Girl,17," Uh, yeah.",6
29797,Howard,17," You‰Ûªre the one? Okay, let me tell you something. That guy you blew off happens to be my best friend. Okay? He was devastated.",6
29798,Girl,17, Sorry. Can you just give him this?,6
29799,Howard,17," Okay. But I gotta warn you, Raj is a proud, passionate man. If you go running out on him again, you‰Ûªre only gonna get, like, three or four more chances before you are history.",6
29800,Scene,17, Raj‰Ûªs apartment.,6
29801,Howard,17," Come on, she came back. This is good news. You should celebrate.",6
29802,Raj,17, I don‰Ûªt want to celebrate.,6
29803,Howard,17," Not even a little? I mean, we could have a pants party. Go put some on.",6
29804,Raj,17, Why would I want her number? I don‰Ûªt want anything to do with this woman.,6
29805,Howard,17," Oh, come on, Raj.",6
29806,Raj,17," No, you don‰Ûªt get it. I want nothing to do with any woman. My heart is stone. From now on, I‰Ûªm a monk. I renounce all worldly pleasures. Except for lobster. And garlic butter.",6
29807,Howard,17," Boy, I want to tell you it‰Ûªs her loss, but you are not making it easy.",6
29808,Raj,17," You‰Ûªre, you‰Ûªre a good friend for trying to help, but, I‰Ûªve made my choice.",6
29809,Howard,17," All right. Well, I‰Ûªll see you around.",6
29810,Raj,17," See you. No, wait, take her number. I don‰Ûªt want the temptation.",6
29811,Howard,17, Okay.,6
29812,Raj,17," I must be strong so I don‰Ûªt stray from my true purpose, the study of the universe.",6
29813,Howard,17, All right. Thanks for ruining lobster for me.,6
29814,Scene,17, Outside on the street.,6
29815,Raj,17, Wait! Give me the number! Give me the number! Give me the number!,6
29816,Scene,17, The apartment.,6
29817,Leonard,17," So, Amy, what‰Ûªs going on with your addiction study?",6
29818,Amy,17," Sadly, I‰Ûªm no longer associated with that project.",6
29819,Leonard,17, Why? What happened?,6
29820,Amy,17," Typical bureaucratic nonsense. You can get animals addicted to a harmful substance, you can dissect their brains, but you throw their own faeces back at them and suddenly you‰Ûªre unprofessional.",6
29821,Leonard,17, I‰Ûªm sorry. That I asked.,6
29822,Sheldon,17," All right, let‰Ûªs get this stupid play over with.",6
29823,Leonard,17," Uh, hang on. Empty your pockets.",6
29824,Sheldon,17, Why?,6
29825,Leonard,17, You know why. The Nintendo DS. And the PSP. Now the Gameboy.,6
29826,Sheldon,17," Aw, for Pete‰Ûªs sake. Can we go now?",6
29827,Leonard,17," Well, is that all of it? (Pulls a Rubik‰Ûªs cube from his pants.) Just set it down.",6
29828,Amy,17," Just so you know, this is not a stupid play. A Streetcar Named Desire is an American classic.",6
29829,Sheldon,17," It‰Ûªs about streetcars? Oh, great. I won‰Ûªt need this. (Pulls out an etch-a-sketch.)",6
29830,Scene,17, Outside Raj‰Ûªs apartment. The girl from the comic book store knocks on the door.,6
29831,Raj,17," Just a sec. Oh, who says just a sec? I hate myself. Hello.",6
29832,Girl,17, Hi.,6
29833,Raj,17," Uh, would you like to come in?",6
29834,Girl,17," Oh, no, I can‰Ûªt stay.",6
29835,Raj,17, Oh.,6
29836,Girl,17," I just wanted to say, I‰Ûªm sorry for running out of the coffee shop. That wasn‰Ûªt cool. So, uh, yeah. I‰Ûªm sorry.",6
29837,Raj,17," Wait. Can you at least tell me what went wrong? It‰Ûªs okay. I can take anything. Unless it‰Ûªs something I did, or said, or am. ‰Û÷Cause those are, like, my buttons.",6
29838,Girl,17," No, it‰Ûªs not any of that. It‰Ûªs just, I kind of have a hard time around people I don‰Ûªt know.",6
29839,Raj,17, Really? Then what were you doing at the comic book store that night?,6
29840,Girl,17," I‰Ûªve been trying to force myself into situations that I‰Ûªm not comfortable with. I saw the flyer in the store window, and I made myself go in. I don‰Ûªt even like comic books.",6
29841,Raj,17," Yeah, me neither.",6
29842,Girl,17, Then what were you doing there?,6
29843,Raj,17, I lied. I love them. I only said that so you‰Ûªd go out with me.,6
29844,Girl,17," Oh, you don‰Ûªt want to do that. I‰Ûªm kind of broken.",6
29845,Raj,17," That‰Ûªs great. I‰Ûªm broken, too.",6
29846,Girl,17," Oh, no, you‰Ûªre not.",6
29847,Raj,17," Oh, I totally am. If it wasn‰Ûªt for this beer, I couldn‰Ûªt even talk to you right now. I‰Ûªm a wreck. There are many things seriously wrong with me. And not quirks, either. Like, diagnosable psychological problems. Maybe brain damage.",6
29848,Girl,17," Well, how do I know you‰Ûªre not just saying that?",6
29849,Raj,17," Go out with me on one date, and I promise you, you‰Ûªll see.",6
29850,Girl,17, Okay. Text me. Bye.,6
29851,Raj,17," You won‰Ûªt regret it. I‰Ûªm the most pathetic guy you‰Ûªve ever met. And that, boys and girls, is how it‰Ûªs done.",6
29852,Scene,17, The theatre.,6
29853,Penny (as Blanche DuBois) ,17," You love her very much, don‰Ûªt you?",6
29854,Actor (as Mitch),17, Yes.,6
29855,Penny,17," I think you have a great capacity for devotion. You‰Ûªll be lonely when she passes on, won‰Ûªt you? I understand what that is.",6
29856,Actor,17, To be lonely?,6
29857,Leonard,17," She‰Ûªs pretty good, huh?",6
29858,Sheldon,17, She is. But when do they get to the part about streetcars?,6
29859,Penny (as Blanche),17," ‰Û_when I was a very young girl. When I was 16 years old, I made the discovery, love. All at once, and much, much too completely. It was like you suddenly turned a blinding light on something that had always been half a shadow. That‰Ûªs how it struck the world for me. But I was unlucky. Deluded.",6
29860,Sheldon,17, She‰Ûªs remarkable.,6
29861,Leonard,17, She really is.,6
29862,Amy,17, Our Penny‰Ûªs a star.,6
29863,Sheldon,17," How can she remember all those lines, but as a waitress, she can‰Ûªt remember no tomato on my hamburger?",6
29864,Scene,18, The apartmentåÊ,6
29865,Leonard,18," Look, I know you guys don‰Ûªt want to do this, but we have no choice. So, you can either bitch and whine or we can just get it over with.",6
29866,Howard,18, I got whine.,6
29867,Sheldon,18, I got the B word.,6
29868,Leonard,18," Yeah, well, it‰Ûªs in our contract to serve on a university committee. And frankly, this is one I believe in. Okay, here we go. Encouraging more women to pursue a career in the sciences.",6
29869,Howard,18," Come on, if I was any good at convincing women to do stuff, I wouldn‰Ûªt have spent so much of my twenties in the shower.",6
29870,Sheldon,18," If you ask me, this whole thing is a waste of our time.",6
29871,Leonard,18, Helping women? Y,6
29872,Sheldon,18, Helping anyone. People should take care of themselves.,6
29873,Leonard,18," Oh, like yesterday, when you made me drive you to the dry cleaners, the pharmacy and the post office?",6
29874,Sheldon,18, I‰Ûªm not saying people can‰Ûªt use tools. Even an otter picks up a rock when he wants a clam.,6
29875,Leonard,18, You don‰Ûªt think it‰Ûªs worthwhile to try to get more women working in science.,6
29876,Sheldon,18," I think that‰Ûªs incredibly sexist of you. I believe in a gender-blind society like in Star Trek, where women and men of all races and creeds work side by side as equals.",6
29877,Leonard,18," You mean where they were advanced enough to invent an interstellar warp drive, but a black lady still answered the space phone?",6
29878,Howard,18," Oh, I did spend a lot of my shower time with Lieutenant Uhura.",6
29879,Sheldon,18," Howard‰Ûªs disturbing recollections aside, I don‰Ûªt appreciate being forced to do banal committee work.",6
29880,Leonard,18," Yes, I know, you‰Ûªre too smart for this.",6
29881,Sheldon,18, Exactly. It‰Ûªs like asking the Human Torch to heat up your frozen burrito.,6
29882,Leonard,18," Got it. All right, I‰Ûªm thinking one way to counter bias in the peer-review process, is for papers to be submitted under gender-neutral names. Like S. Smith instead of Samantha Smith.",6
29883,Sheldon,18," I suppose there is a history of professional women using their initials so as not to be pre-judged. Harry Potter‰Ûªs J.K. Rowling, uh, Star Trek‰Ûªs D.C. Fontana.",6
29884,Howard,18," Van Nuys pole-dancer D.D. Melons. All right, I think we‰Ûªve really helped women today. Let‰Ûªs fire up the old Xbox.",6
29885,Leonard,18," Guys, please don‰Ûªt make this a school project where I‰Ûªm the smart kid doing all the work while the slackers sit back and watch.",6
29886,Sheldon,18, We‰Ûªre not. This time you‰Ûªre the smart kid doing all the work while the even smarter kids sit back and watch.,6
29887,Howard,18," So, you think I‰Ûªm one of the smarter kids?",6
29888,Sheldon,18," No, you‰Ûªre a tool I was using to make my point.",6
29889,Scene,18, The apartment.,6
29890,Leonard,18," Guys, our topic is encouraging women in science, can you at least play a less sexist game",6
29891,Sheldon,18, How is it sexist? My character wields a battle axe as well as any man.,6
29892,Howard,18, Not to mention she has mammary glands that could nurse a family of 30. And have enough milk left over to open a Baskin Robbins.,6
29893,Sheldon,18," Mother, warrior-princess, franchise owner, I hear glass ceilings shattering all over town.",6
29894,Leonard,18," Sheldon, you‰Ûªre always saying how much smarter you are than me. Spend five seconds and come up with one idea on how to get more women into science.",6
29895,Sheldon,18, All your ideas address the issue at a university level. By then it‰Ûªs too late. You need to design an outreach program that targets girls at the middle school level and sets them on an academic track towards the hard sciences.,6
29896,Leonard,18, That‰Ûªs actually good. Why didn‰Ûªt I think of that?,6
29897,Sheldon,18," Some people are otters, some people are rocks.",6
29898,Leonard,18, I wonder if there‰Ûªs a way we could give the idea a trial run.,6
29899,Howard,18," Maybe I could call my old middle school, see if we can talk to some of the female students.",6
29900,Leonard,18," That‰Ûªs great, try to set up something for the three of us to go over there.",6
29901,Sheldon,18," Oh, hold on. While I‰Ûªm comfortable speaking about science, I‰Ûªm not sure I know how to spark the interest of schoolchildren. Better Google it.",6
29902,Howard,18, What exactly are you looking up?,6
29903,Sheldon,18, How do I get 12-year-old girls excited.,6
29904,Leonard and Howard (together),18, No!,6
29905,Scene,18, Penny‰Ûªs apartment.,6
29906,Raj,18, Thanks again for letting me crash girls‰Ûª night.,6
29907,Penny,18, Are you kidding? You brought fancy wine and made fondue. I‰Ûªve slept with guys for less. It‰Ûªs a joke. Based on real events.,6
29908,Raj,18," Anyway, I was hoping I could, uh, pick your brains a little. I‰Ûªm supposed to take Lucy out Friday and I need a killer first date.",6
29909,Amy,18," Well, evolutionary biology says that women are attracted to a man who is steady n the face of danger, so I recommend an unsafe environment. Seedy bar on the wrong side of the tracks, picnic near a lunatic asylum, a wine tasting on Skid Row.",6
29910,Raj,18," Uh, Lucy has some, uh, social anxiety issues. Maybe we could start with something simpler.",6
29911,Bernadette,18," Why don‰Ûªt you take her to Disneyland? You go on Space Mountain, you‰Ûªre in the dark, she‰Ûªs holding onto you.",6
29912,Penny,18," Yeah, but you just have to remember, that ride is shorter than you think and they take a picture of you at the end, so make sure you got your clothes back on. It‰Ûªs a joke. Based on real events.",6
29913,Raj,18," Mm, Disneyland? I don‰Ûªt know. With all the crowds and the weird characters walking around, just reminds me too much of India.",6
29914,Amy,18, I haven‰Ûªt been to Disneyland since I was a kid. We should definitely go one weekend.,6
29915,Bernadette,18, Weekends are too crowded.,6
29916,Penny,18," So, blow off work, go on a weekday.",6
29917,Amy,18, Hooky? I‰Ûªve never played hooky in my life. My mom said that‰Ûªs how girls end up addicted to reefer and jazz music.,6
29918,Penny,18, It‰Ûªs more like how girls end up at a Best Western hotel with a 34-year-old guy named Luther.,6
29919,Bernadette,18, Joke?,6
29920,Penny,18, I can laugh about it now.,6
29921,Bernadette,18," So, what do you say? This Friday we ditch work and go to Disneyland?",6
29922,Penny,18, I‰Ûªm in.,6
29923,Amy,18," Me, too.",6
29924,Raj,18," Excuse me, I thought we were trying to solve my problem?",6
29925,Penny,18," Oh, yeah, right. Wait, what was your problem again?",6
29926,Raj,18," I am a man who can‰Ûªt talk to women, trying to figure out how to go on a romantic date with a girl who suffers from such crippling social anxiety she can‰Ûªt be around other people.",6
29927,Penny,18," Yeah, that‰Ûªs a toughie.",6
29928,Bernadette,18, Let‰Ûªs think.,6
29929,Amy,18," Hmm. We doing just Disney or California Adventure, too?",6
29930,Scene,18, A school hallway.,6
29931,Leonard,18, It‰Ûªs nice of your old school to let us try out our science talk on some female students.,6
29932,Howard,18," Well, they‰Ûªre actually pretty excited. I‰Ûªm their most famous alum. If you don‰Ûªt count the serial killer who ate all those prostitutes.",6
29933,Sheldon,18," This must feel pretty good for you, coming back to your alma mater as an astronaut.",6
29934,Howard,18," Yeah, last time I was here, I was just a scrawny little nerd.",6
29935,Leonard,18, And now you‰Ûªre also an astronaut.,6
29936,Howard,18," So many memories. I mean, how many times in these hallways was I tripped, punched and spit on? Oh, look, here‰Ûªs my old locker. I have a masters in engineering and I still can‰Ûªt figure out how Scott Kapinski got me and my briefcase to fit in there. (Kid bumps into him) Hey.",6
29937,Kid,18, What?,6
29938,Howard,18, Nothing.,6
29939,Sheldon,18, Smart. We don‰Ûªt want any problems.,6
29940,Scene,18, Bernadette‰Ûªs car.,6
29941,Amy,18, I can‰Ûªt believe I ditched work for Disneyland.,6
29942,Bernadette,18, What did you tell your boss?,6
29943,Amy,18," Oh, I was very clever, I did it in stages. At seven o‰Ûªclock last night, I called about a problem at the lab and casually mentioned I was going out for seafood. At nine thirty, I called and told him that one of my scallops tasted weird. At eleven thirty, I called and said I was throwing up like a fire hose. At twelve forty-five, I called and made nothing but dry heaving sounds, and now I‰Ûªm going to Disneyland.",6
29944,Bernadette,18," Penny, what did you say?",6
29945,Penny,18," I work at the Cheesecake Factory, I said bye.",6
29946,Amy,18," So, what are we gonna do first?",6
29947,Bernadette,18," I don‰Ûªt know about you guys, but I‰Ûªm gonna make a beeline for the place that gives you a princess makeover.",6
29948,Amy,18," Ooh, that sounds like fun.",6
29949,Penny,18," You‰Ûªre kidding, right? We‰Ûªre not just gonna get drunk and go on rides?",6
29950,Amy,18," Come on, do it with us.",6
29951,Penny,18," All right, whatever. How does it work?",6
29952,Bernadette,18," Okay, so, you pick your princess, Sleeping Beauty, Snow White, Cinderella, they give you hair, makeup, the works.",6
29953,Penny,18, Guess it would be fun to be Cinderella.,6
29954,Amy,18," Oh, I want to be Cinderella, too.",6
29955,Penny,18, Yeah.,6
29956,Bernadette,18, We can‰Ûªt all be Cinderella.,6
29957,Amy,18, Then how do we decide?,6
29958,Bernadette,18," Well, it‰Ûªs simple. This was my idea. I‰Ûªm driving. I‰Ûªm Cinderella. You bitches got a problem with that, we could stop the car right now.",6
29959,Scene,18, A library.,6
29960,Raj,18," Excuse me, I‰Ûªm meeting a girl here. It‰Ûªs kind of our first date.",6
29961,Man,18, In a library?,6
29962,Raj,18," She and I are both a little awkward in social situations, so this seemed like a good idea.",6
29963,Man,18," People say I‰Ûªm a little awkward, too. May I join you?",6
29964,Raj,18," No, you can‰Ûªt join us. Just go, go climb back up whatever beanstalk you came down from.",6
29965,Man (to Lucy),18, You can do better.,6
29966,Lucy,18," Oh, we‰Ûªre eating here? (Reading) We‰Ûªre having a texting date? (By text) I love that.",6
29967,Raj (by text),18," As you‰Ûªre reading, it will help to remember I have an adorable accent.",6
29968,Scene,18, A classroom.,6
29969,Leonard,18," Okay, who‰Ûªs ready for some science? Me, too. Okay, I am Dr. Leonard Hofstadter. I am here with my friends Dr. Cooper and real-life astronaut Howard Wolowitz, and we are going to show you girls how cool a job in science can be. How cool, you ask? Well, how about negative 273 degrees, ‰Ûªcause that‰Ûªs the temperature at which entropy reaches its minimum value. Did I just learn something new and have fun doing it? What? All right. So now let‰Ûªs bring out theoretical physicist Dr. Sheldon Cooper.",6
29970,Sheldon,18," Hello, female children. Allow me to inspire you with a story about a great female scientist. Polish-born, French-educated Madame Curie. Co-discoverer of radioactivity, she was a hero of science, until her hair fell out, her vomit and stool became filled with blood, and she was poisoned to death by her own discovery. With a little hard work, I see no reason why that can‰Ûªt happen to any of you. Are we done? Can we go?",6
29971,Howard,18," The thing to remember is you can go to outer space, too. I mean, look at me. I went to this very school. Those desks you‰Ûªre sitting in, I was once superglued to one of them.",6
29972,Girl,18, Did you go to the moon?,6
29973,Howard,18," No, but I did go to the International Space Station.",6
29974,Girl,18, Did you fly the rocket?,6
29975,Howard,18," No, but I was in the rocket. I didn‰Ûªt actually‰Û_",6
29976,Girl,18, So you just flew around? That‰Ûªs kind of like my uncle. He‰Ûªs a flight attendant.,6
29977,Howard,18," No, I‰Ûªm an American hero. Your uncle brings people nuts, okay?",6
29978,Leonard,18," Alright, alright. Boy, we are learning a lot here, huh? Thank you, astronaut Howard. Um, I am what‰Ûªs called an experimental physicist, which is super-fun, because I get to test theories and work with lasers. Yes?",6
29979,Girl 2,18, How did you decide to become a scientist?,6
29980,Leonard,18," Uh, excellent question. Um, I suppose I‰Ûªve always been into science, you know. My mother and father are scientists, so I was kind of led in that direction. Uh, pushed might be a better way to describe it. To be honest with you guys, when I was your age, I wanted to be a rap star. Like Snoop Dogg, but with a healthy respect for the police. Yeah, no, sure, you laugh. Just like my mother did. After I confided, I was derided and chided, my moms and I collided. She said my dreams were misguided. That‰Ûªs just a little freestyle.",6
29981,Scene,18, The library.,6
29982,Raj (by text),18," My dad‰Ûªs a gynaecologist in India, so if you‰Ûªre over there and need a check up, as he likes to say, he‰Ûªs at your cervix.",6
29983,Lucy(by text),18, That‰Ûªs terrible. Your dad should be sent to the pun-itentiary.,6
29984,Raj (by text),18, That‰Ûªs a fitting pun-ishment. I still don‰Ûªt know what you do for a living.,6
29985,Lucy (by text),18, Web design.,6
29986,Raj (by text),18, Anything I might have seen?,6
29987,Lucy (by text),18, I don‰Ûªt know. You ever look at porn Web sites?,6
29988,Raj (by text),18," No, never. What is porn?",6
29989,Lucy (by text),18, Sorry. Autocorrect. That was supposed to say prom Web sites.,6
29990,Raj (by text),18," Ooh, fun. I love prom. The romance, the gowns, it‰Ûªs like a fairy tale come to life. Sorry. Autocorrect. That was supposed to say, I like sports.",6
29991,Scene,18, The classroom.,6
29992,Leonard,18," I never wanted to play the cello. How do you meet girls playing the cello? Hey, you want to come over to my house and listen to me play an instrument that sounds like a suicidal bumblebee?",6
29993,Howard,18," Quick, pull the fire alarm. Let‰Ûªs get out of here.",6
29994,Sheldon,18," Uh, hello again. Um, yeah, I don‰Ûªt know if women in general have been actively discouraged from pursuing the sciences, but it‰Ûªs clear you young women here, today, have been. While I was listening to my colleagues waste your time, it occurred to me that it might be much more meaningful to hear about women in science from actual women in science, and, uh, I happen to know two brilliant examples who have agreed to speak to you on the phone right now. Uh, Dr. Rostenkowski, Dr. Fowler, are you there?",6
29995,Amy (voice),18, We‰Ûªre here.,6
29996,Sheldon,18, Thank you for taking time out of your very busy schedule to enlighten these young women.,6
29997,Amy,18," It‰Ûªs our pleasure. I‰Ûªm Dr. Fowler, and I‰Ûªm a neuroscientist.",6
29998,Bernadette,18," And I‰Ûªm Dr. Rostenkowski Wolowitz, and I‰Ûªm a microbiologist.",6
29999,Amy,18," The world of science needs more women, but from a young age, we girls are encouraged to care more about the way we look than about the power of our minds.",6
30000,Bernadette,18, That‰Ûªs true. Every one of you has the capacity to be anything you want to be.,6
30001,Penny,18, Unless you want to be Cinderella.,6
30002,Bernadette,18, Come at me. See what happens.,6
30003,Scene,18, The library.,6
30004,Raj (by text),18, This was really fun.,6
30005,Lucy ,18," My battery‰Ûªs dying, so I‰Ûªm just gonna talk. Thanks for today. I‰Ûªve been trying to do more things that scare me, and coming here was definitely one of them. But it was also really nice. So thanks, and, um, I‰Ûªm gonna go. Maybe I could do one more scary thing before I go and give you a kiss good-bye? You know, if that‰Ûªs okay. Okay. Panic attack. Maybe next time.",6
30006,Raj,18, I‰Ûªm counting that as foreplay.,6
30007,Scene,18, Howard and Bernadette‰Ûªs apartment.,6
30008,Howard,18," Bernie, I‰Ûªm home. You have fun today?",6
30009,Bernadette,18," Yes, and I have a surprise for you.",6
30010,Howard,18, Please be Cinderella. Please be Cinderella.,6
30011,Bernadette,18," Well, hello, Prince Charming.",6
30012,Howard,18, Milady.,6
30013,Scene,18, Penny‰Ûªs apartment.,6
30014,Leonard,18," Hey, how was your‰Û_ what?",6
30015,Penny,18," I can explain. I played hooky with the girls, then we all went to Disneyland and got‰Û_ What are you doing?",6
30016,Leonard (undressing),18," Disneyland. Go on, I‰Ûªm listening.",6
30017,Scene,18, The apartment.,6
30018,Amy,18," Sheldon, all Snow White needs is one little kiss to wake up.",6
30019,Sheldon,18, Heard you the first time.,6
30020,Scene,19, Howard and Bernadette‰Ûªs apartment.,6
30021,Bernadette,19, What you doing?,6
30022,Howard,19, You said clean up. I‰Ûªm cleaning up.,6
30023,Bernadette,19, You can‰Ûªt just throw everything in the closet.,6
30024,Howard,19," Hey, you can tell me what to do or you can tell me how to do it, but you can‰Ûªt do both. This isn‰Ûªt sex.",6
30025,Bernadette,19, What if someone looks in there?,6
30026,Howard,19, They‰Ûªre just coming over for dinner. No one‰Ûªs gonna look in the closet.,6
30027,Bernadette,19," Well, you don‰Ûªt know that. What if someone‰Ûªs looking for the bathroom and they open that door?",6
30028,Howard,19, Could work out. For all we know there‰Ûªs a toilet in there somewhere.,6
30029,Bernadette,19, Fine. But after tonight we need to get a handle on this mess.,6
30030,Howard,19, You know what we should do? We should show the closet to Sheldon.,6
30031,Bernadette,19, Why?,6
30032,Howard,19," Are you kidding? He‰Ûªs like a savant at organizing. Everything in his apartment has a label on it. Including his label maker, which has a label that says label maker. And if you look really close at that label maker label, you‰Ûªll see a label that says label.",6
30033,Bernadette,19," He‰Ûªs our guest, we can‰Ûªt just ask him to straighten our closet.",6
30034,Howard,19," No, we wouldn‰Ûªt ask him. We‰Ûªd just show him the closet and let the goblins in his head take it from there.",6
30035,Howard,19," Hey, guys, come on in.",6
30036,All,19, Hi.,6
30037,Penny,19," Ooh, it smells good.",6
30038,Bernadette,19," Thanks. And, Sheldon, I know tonight‰Ûªs the night you eat Thai food, so I went to the Asian market, got all the ingredients and made it from scratch.",6
30039,Sheldon,19," Oh, you shouldn‰Ûªt have.",6
30040,Bernadette,19," Oh, it‰Ûªs my pleasure.",6
30041,Sheldon,19," No, you really shouldn‰Ûªt have. I brought my own.",6
30042,Bernadette,19, You stopped and got him takeout?,6
30043,Leonard,19, I had no choice. He kept kicking the back of my seat.,6
30044,Bernadette,19," Sheldon, I‰Ûªve been cooking all day.",6
30045,Sheldon,19," Well, now don‰Ûªt you feel silly.",6
30046,Bernadette,19, Show him the closet.,6
30047,Scene,19, Howard and Bernadette‰Ûªs apartment.,6
30048,Raj,19," These spring rolls are amazing. Good job, Bernadette.",6
30049,Bernadette,19, That‰Ûªs the takeout that Sheldon brought.,6
30050,Raj,19," Oh, well, I‰Ûªm sure they wouldn‰Ûªt have tasted nearly as good if I hadn‰Ûªt tried your food first.",6
30051,Sheldon,19," Howard, did you want your clothes arranged seasonally or by colour?",6
30052,Howard,19, Colour‰Ûªs fine.,6
30053,Sheldon,19," Wrong, they‰Ûªll be arranged seasonally.",6
30054,Penny,19," Sheldon, aren‰Ûªt you gonna spend a little time with Amy?",6
30055,Amy,19," Oh, it‰Ûªs okay, I‰Ûªm used to it. The other day at Whole Foods, he spent an hour optimizing the cheese aisle.",6
30056,Sheldon,19," Yeah, and some thanks I got. The assistant manager chased me out with an artisanal salami.",6
30057,Amy,19, His quirks just make you love him more. Someone please agree with me.,6
30058,Scene,19, The closet.,6
30059,Leonard,19," Sheldon, come on. It‰Ûªs getting late. Time to go.",6
30060,Sheldon,19," Oh, five more minutes.",6
30061,Leonard,19, That‰Ûªs what you said five minutes ago. Amy and Penny are already in the car. Let‰Ûªs move it.,6
30062,Sheldon,19, How come I never get to do anything I want to do?,6
30063,Howard,19," You know, if he really wants to stay and finish, I can give him a ride home.",6
30064,Sheldon,19," Please, Leonard, he said it‰Ûªs okay.",6
30065,Leonard,19," Sheldon, it‰Ûªs, wait, I can go home without you? Bye.",6
30066,Sheldon,19," Howard, I have a few questions. I found three bowling pins. Now, do you juggle these, or are you missing seven?",6
30067,Howard,19, Juggle.,6
30068,Sheldon,19, You health nuts kill me.,6
30069,Bernadette,19," Oh, my God, it‰Ûªs beautiful. Look, he found the juggling pins I hid.",6
30070,Sheldon,19," Uh, just a couple more items. Howard, I found this letter from your dad in a box. Now, based on the content, it could either be filed‰Û_",6
30071,Howard,19," Whoa, you opened this?",6
30072,Sheldon,19," Well, I had to find out if it was personal correspondence or memorabilia. Now, as I was saying, based on the content‰Û_",6
30073,Howard,19," I couldn‰Ûªt be less interested. Now, come on, I‰Ûªll take you home.",6
30074,Bernadette,19," Howard, don‰Ûªt you want to know what‰Ûªs in the letter?",6
30075,Howard,19," If I wanted to know, I would‰Ûªve opened it years ago. The closet looks great. Let‰Ûªs get out of here.",6
30076,Sheldon,19," Wait, can I bring this box of extra shirt buttons to sort on the ride?",6
30077,Howard,19, Do whatever you want.,6
30078,Sheldon,19, Thanks. Oh. Great party.,6
30079,Scene,19, The stairwell.,6
30080,Leonard,19," You know, when I first met Howard, he would pull his scrotum out of his shorts and say, aw, I sat in gum.",6
30081,Penny,19, What is your point?,6
30082,Leonard,19," Well, it‰Ûªs just kind of weird how grown up he is now. Happily married guy throwing dinner parties.",6
30083,Penny,19, Really? You couldn‰Ûªt just say that? You had to tell the scrotum story?,6
30084,Leonard,19, Trying to paint a picture.,6
30085,Penny,19, It was a nice change of pace not eating takeout around a coffee table.,6
30086,Leonard,19," Mm, you know, we could throw a dinner party, too. Maybe even ask everyone to get dressed up.",6
30087,Penny,19," Sure. Just, when you say dressed up, you mean nice clothes, right? Not, like, capes and tights and crap?",6
30088,Leonard,19, Yeah. Although‰Û_,6
30089,Penny,19, No.,6
30090,Scene,19, Howard and Bernadette‰Ûªs apartment.,6
30091,Bernadette,19," Howie, you okay?",6
30092,Howard,19," Yeah, I just couldn‰Ûªt sleep.",6
30093,Bernadette,19," Told you you shouldn‰Ûªt have espresso after dinner. I know the little cups make you feel big, but it‰Ûªs not worth it.",6
30094,Howard,19, It‰Ûªs this stupid letter.,6
30095,Bernadette,19, Did you read it?,6
30096,Howard,19, No.,6
30097,Bernadette,19, You must be curious.,6
30098,Howard,19," Of course I‰Ûªm curious. I haven‰Ûªt seen the man since, oh, I was a little kid. And a letter shows up on my 18th birthday? What‰Ûªs that about?",6
30099,Bernadette,19, Why don‰Ûªt you read it? Maybe he apologizes or explains why he left.,6
30100,Howard,19, He abandoned me and my mother. Why does he deserve a chance to explain anything?,6
30101,Bernadette,19," I get that. So, what do you want to do with it?",6
30102,Howard,19, Something I should have done a long time ago. (Sets fire to it),6
30103,Bernadette,19, Really? Are you sure?,6
30104,Howard,19, Yep.,6
30105,Bernadette,19, Feel better?,6
30106,Howard,19, I do. (Smoke alarm goes off) Great. Neither one of us is tall enough to reach that.,6
30107,Scene,19, Penny‰Ûªs apartment.,6
30108,Amy,19, I can‰Ûªt believe he set it on fire.,6
30109,Bernadette,19," Yeah, just seeing that letter really freaked him out. And he was already having a tough day ‰Ûªcause he accidentally wore my pants to work. I don‰Ûªt know why he was upset. They were bigger on him than me.",6
30110,Amy,19," Boy, I‰Ûªm really curious what was in that letter.",6
30111,Bernadette,19," Me, too, but I guess now we‰Ûªll never know.",6
30112,Amy,19," Well, you said Sheldon read it. Why not ask him?",6
30113,Bernadette,19, I can‰Ûªt do that. What kind of wife would I be if I didn‰Ûªt respect my husband‰Ûªs privacy?,6
30114,Penny,19," What if I ask Sheldon, you just happen to be in the room?",6
30115,Bermadette,19, That works.,6
30116,Penny,19, Okay.,6
30117,Scene,19, The laundry room.,6
30118,Sheldon,19, Bleuch. Like cleaning out the entire building‰Ûªs belly button.,6
30119,Penny,19," Hey, Sheldon.",6
30120,Sheldon,19," Oh, hello. What can I do for you ladies?",6
30121,Amy,19, You have something we want.,6
30122,Sheldon,19," Oh, dear. My mother warned me this is what happens to pretty boys in the big city.",6
30123,Penny,19," No, we just want information.",6
30124,Sheldon,19," Oh. Oh, I‰Ûªve got that in spades. Ravage me.",6
30125,Penny,19, We heard you read the letter from Howard‰Ûªs father.,6
30126,Sheldon,19, I did.,6
30127,Penny,19, What did it say?,6
30128,Sheldon,19, I can‰Ûªt tell you that. I‰Ûªm bound by closet organizer/organizee confidentiality.,6
30129,Amy,19," Sheldon, that‰Ûªs not a real thing.",6
30130,Sheldon,19," Well, neither is the rule that you have to hold your girlfriend‰Ûªs hand at the movies. You know. That doesn‰Ûªt stop you from pawing at me like you‰Ûªre a bear and I‰Ûªm a trash can full of sweets.",6
30131,Penny,19, Why do you even care? Just tell us what it says.,6
30132,Sheldon,19," Control over the information contained in that letter belongs to Howard. By happenstance, I came to know it. That doesn‰Ûªt give me the right to disseminate it freely.",6
30133,Penny,19," Come on. Look, the letter was found in Bernadette‰Ûªs closet. Doesn‰Ûªt that count for something?",6
30134,Sheldon,19," Are you pointing out that California is a community property state, and since Howard and Bernadette are married, the intellectual property contained in that letter is jointly owned by the two spouses?",6
30135,Penny,19," Yeah, obviously.",6
30136,Sheldon,19," Well played. Sometimes I don‰Ûªt give you enough credit, Penny.",6
30137,Scene,19, The apartment.,6
30138,Raj,19," Dude, you made the right choice coming to me for help with this party.",6
30139,Leonard,19," Actually, all I did was invite you.",6
30140,Raj,19," Well, put your mind at ease. I‰Ûªm here to make sure your dinner party kicks Howard‰Ûªs dinner party‰Ûªs ass. Now, the first thing we need is a theme. I‰Ûªm thinking, ah, turn-of-the-century Moulin Rouge.",6
30141,Leonard,19," I‰Ûªm thinking you need a testosterone patch. Penny and I just want to do something low-key. You know, cocktails, light jazz music, hors d‰Ûªoeuvres.",6
30142,Raj,19, So your theme is I saw a rerun of Mad Men and bought some crab puffs from Trader Joe‰Ûªs? Hate to miss that.,6
30143,Leonard,19," Hey, where have you been?",6
30144,Sheldon,19," Oh, Leonard. If I was prone to sarcasm, I‰Ûªd say I was pulling off a major heist at the museum of laundry baskets.",6
30145,Leonard,19," One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten. I meant, golly, Sheldon, you‰Ûªve been gone a long time.",6
30146,Sheldon,19," Oh. Yeah, well, I was waylaid by Penny, Bernadette and Amy. They made me reveal confidential information about Howard‰Ûªs father.",6
30147,Leonard,19, What information?,6
30148,Sheldon,19, I can‰Ûªt tell you that. I am bound by closet organizer/organizee confidentiality.,6
30149,Raj,19," Well, come on, we won‰Ûªt tell anyone.",6
30150,Sheldon,19," Sorry, badgering me won‰Ûªt work. What you should have said is, It‰Ûªs pointless to keep this a secret because Penny will tell us.",6
30151,Leonard,19," Fine, then that.",6
30152,Sheldon,19," All right, I‰Ûªll tell you. My goodness, everyone‰Ûªs on their game today.",6
30153,Scene,19, The apartment kitchen.,6
30154,Amy,19, This is really fun.,6
30155,Raj,19," Yeah, it‰Ûªs nice to get dressed up once in a while.",6
30156,Penny,19," Yeah, and the hors d‰Ûªoeuvres are delightful.",6
30157,Leonard,19, As is the company.,6
30158,Penny,19, Aw.,6
30159,Sheldon,19, My shirt is itchy and I wish I were dead.,6
30160,Leonard,19," Hey, uh, listen, everybody. Before Howard gets here, et‰Ûªs all just agree to not bring up the letter from his father.",6
30161,Raj,19, Of course.,6
30162,Penny,19, Sure.,6
30163,Amy,19, Absolutely.,6
30164,Sheldon,19," If I say yes, can we turn off that Latin orgy music?",6
30165,Scene,19, The stairwell.,6
30166,Howard,19, Ridiculous that we still have to walk up all these flights of stairs.,6
30167,Bernadette,19," Yeah, try doing it in heels.",6
30168,Howard,19, I am.,6
30169,Bernadette,19, Wait. There‰Ûªs something I have to tell you.,6
30170,Howard,19, What?,6
30171,Bernadette,19, I know what was in your dad‰Ûªs letter.,6
30172,Howard,19," Sheldon, I swear to God, I‰Ûªm gonna kill you.",6
30173,Amy,19, Hey.,6
30174,Bernadette,19, I made him tell us.,6
30175,Howard,19, What? Us? Who else knows?,6
30176,Penny,19, I know.,6
30177,Amy,19," Me, too.",6
30178,Leonard,19, Same here.,6
30179,Raj,19, Shame on all of you.,6
30180,Leonard,19," You know, too.",6
30181,Raj,19," Couldn‰Ûªt leave him one friend, could you?",6
30182,Howard,19, So everybody knows what‰Ûªs in that letter except for me?,6
30183,Sheldon,19," Yes, it‰Ûªs six against one. Stand down, sir.",6
30184,Howard,19, How could you do this?,6
30185,Bernadette,19, I‰Ûªm sorry.,6
30186,Raj,19," If you want, we could tell you.",6
30187,Howard,19," No, I don‰Ûªt want to know. I mean, I do, but‰Û_ I got to go.",6
30188,Amy,19, Use me as a human shield!,6
30189,Sheldon,19, I panicked. He looked taller than usual.,6
30190,Scene,19, The closet.,6
30191,Bernadette (off),19, Howard?,6
30192,Howard,19, In here.,6
30193,Bernadette,19, I‰Ûªm sorry. I should have left it alone.,6
30194,Howard,19, It‰Ûªs okay. Sorry I ran off like that.,6
30195,Bernadette,19, What are you looking at?,6
30196,Howard,19," Uh, pictures of my dad and me when I was a kid.",6
30197,Bernadette,19, That‰Ûªs nice.,6
30198,Howard,19," I got to tell you, as angry as I am at Sheldon for blabbing, he did a hell of a job organizing this closet. Look at this. Photos of Wolowitz family before father left forever. Check out nine-year-old Howie with cornrows. Neither race was happy to see me with those.",6
30199,Bernadette,19, Think you could take a break?,6
30200,Howard,19, Why?,6
30201,Bernadette,19, Got a little surprise for you. Come on.,6
30202,Howard,19," Oh, honey, I am in no mood to have sex tonight. I‰Ûªll lay there if you absolutely have to have it, but‰Û_ Oh. What are you guys doing here?",6
30203,Leonard,19," When you left, you weren‰Ûªt sure whether or not you wanted to know what was in your dad‰Ûªs letter, so we came up with kind of a cool solution.",6
30204,Howard,19," Oh, yeah, what‰Ûªs that?",6
30205,Sheldon,19," It‰Ûªs simple, really. It occurred to me that knowing and not knowing can be achieved by creating a macroscopic example of quantum superposition. The, the principle that a physical system exists partially in all its possible states at once.",6
30206,Penny,19," We were all thinking it, really. It was kind of the elephant in the room, so‰Û_",6
30207,Sheldon,19," Anyway, um, I realized that if we each present you with an account of what your father wrote to you, only one of which is true, and then we don‰Ûªt tell you which one it is, you will forever be in a state of epistemic ambivalence.",6
30208,Penny,19," Yeah. And I said if it wasn‰Ûªt epistemic, we might as well not do it.",6
30209,Bernadette,19," Sit down, honey.",6
30210,Leonard,19," Raj, you‰Ûªre up.",6
30211,Raj,19," Okay, um, It was a card for your 18th birthday. Inside it said, Happy birthday, Howard. I love you. Dad. Oh, and it was a Far Side card, the one where the frog has its tongue stuck to the underside of an airplane. Thinks it‰Ûªs a fly. Silly frog. So funny.",6
30212,Leonard,19, Sheldon.,6
30213,Sheldon,19, It was a map leading to the lost treasure of famous pirate One-Eyed Willy.,6
30214,Howard,19, Nice try. That‰Ûªs the plot for Goonies.,6
30215,Amy,19, Told you.,6
30216,Sheldon,19, Don‰Ûªt.,6
30217,Leonard,19, Amy.,6
30218,Amy,19," You didn‰Ûªt know it, but your father was in the auditorium at your high school graduation. And he cried because he was so proud of you.",6
30219,Howard,19, Really?,6
30220,Sheldon,19, Or that‰Ûªs complete poppycock which Amy made up. It still could be the map.,6
30221,Leonard,19, Penny.,6
30222,Penny,19," It was a letter explaining that your dad wasn‰Ûªt who he said he was. Eventually, his other life caught up to him, and the only way to keep you and your mom safe was to leave.",6
30223,Sheldon,19, I would like to change mine. The pirate‰Ûªs name was Peg-Leg Antoine. Now it‰Ûªs completely different from Goonies.,6
30224,Amy,19," No, it‰Ûªs not.",6
30225,Sheldon,19, Don‰Ûªt.,6
30226,Leonard,19," Okay, my turn. Your dad wrote about how family is the most important thing, and that you should never throw it away like he did.",6
30227,Howard,19, Hmm.,6
30228,Leonard,19, Bernadette.,6
30229,Bernadette,19," Inside the envelope was a picture of your dad holding you the day you were born. On the back he wrote Howard, my son, my greatest gift. You okay?",6
30230,Howard,19, Yeah. I‰Ûªm terrific.,6
30231,Leonard,19," So, which one do you think it is, matey?",6
30232,Howard,19," Actually, I don‰Ûªt want to know. I want all of them to be true.",6
30233,Leonard,19," Well, one of them is.",6
30234,Howard,19," That‰Ûªs pretty cool. Thank you, guys.",6
30235,Penny,19," Hey, it‰Ûªs still early. Why don‰Ûªt we go back and have that party?",6
30236,Raj,19," Yeah,",6
30237,Leonard,19," Yeah, cool.",6
30238,Amy,19, Okay.,6
30239,Sheldon,19," You know, surprisingly, uh, the letter from your father wasn‰Ûªt the most interesting thing I read in the closet. Bernadette‰Ûªs diary has some saucy passages.",6
30240,Bernadette,19," Sheldon, don‰Ûªt you dare.",6
30241,Sheldon,19, There‰Ûªs nothing to worry about. Your secret‰Ûªs safe with me.,6
30242,Bernadette,19, That‰Ûªs more like it.,6
30243,Sheldon,19, Although copyright law would allow me to quote snippets in the context of a review.,6
30244,Scene,19, The apartment.,6
30245,Bernadette,19, Glad you‰Ûªre feeling better.,6
30246,Howard,19," Me, too. If I‰Ûªd known we were gonna be dancing, would have worn my flats.",6
30247,Penny,19," This turned out pretty well, huh?",6
30248,Leonard,19," Yeah, I think so.",6
30249,Raj,19," I agree. That is, if you‰Ûªve never been to or heard of a party before.",6
30250,Amy,19," If you‰Ûªd let me pierce your brain with a hot needle in the right place, you‰Ûªd be happy all the time.",6
30251,Sheldon,19," Uh, Penny, I, I have a couple of questions about your closet. Is there any reason you‰Ûªre keeping this dead goldfish?",6
30252,Penny,19," Damn, I forgot to feed him. And that I had him.",6
30253,Sheldon,19," Well, now, did you also have a dog? Because I found what appears to be a battery-operated chew toy.",6
30254,Penny,19, Party‰Ûªs over! Party‰Ûªs over!,6
30255,Scene,20, The cafeteria.,6
30256,Leonard,20," I was reading about this jellyfish that never dies. Instead, it reverts to its asexual state and then grows up again.",6
30257,Howard,20," We thought my 90-year-old grandfather had reverted to an asexual state, but the lawsuit from his Jamaican caregiver proved us all wrong.",6
30258,Leonard,20," My point is, immortality is not only a possibility, it is real.",6
30259,Raj,20, Only if you‰Ûªre this jellyfish which periodically reverts to a mass of undifferentiated protoplasm.,6
30260,Sheldon,20," If I could keep my Gmail account, I‰Ûªd be okay with that.",6
30261,Barry,20," ‰ÛÒ Hewwo, fewwas.",6
30262,All,20, Hey.,6
30263,Barry,20, Wemember when we were twying to figuwe out what that smell coming fwom Pwofessor Tupperman‰Ûªs office was?,6
30264,Howard,20, Yeah?,6
30265,Barry,20, Turns out it was Tupperman. Dead at his desk for two weeks.,6
30266,Howard,20, That‰Ûªs terrible.,6
30267,Leonard,20," Oh, my God.",6
30268,Barry,20," In wieu of fwowers, the department chair is asking that evewyone donate a bottle of Febweze.",6
30269,Sheldon,20," If we‰Ûªre going to change the topic from jellyfish, I‰Ûªd be okay with brine shrimp or the history of the unicycle.",6
30270,Howard,20," Show a little compassion, a man died.",6
30271,Barry,20," And turned into a puddew of goo. Now, we can either sit awound and cwy over spilt pwofessor, or we can wejoice in the knowwedge that a tenured position has just opened up. I choose to do the watter.",6
30272,Sheldon,20," Excuse me, the whole tenure system is ridiculous. A guaranteed job for life only encourages the faculty to become complacent. If we really want science to advance, people should have chips implanted in their skulls that explode when they say something stupid.",6
30273,Raj,20," Well, I believe people do their best work when they feel safe and secure.",6
30274,Sheldon,20, Pchew!,6
30275,Barry,20," If you need my nose, you‰Ûªll find it firmwy wodged up the qectum of the tenure committee.",6
30276,Howard,20, You Ph.D‰Ûªs gonna go suck up like Kripke?,6
30277,Leonard,20," No. I mean, I‰Ûªll apply, but I‰Ûªm not gonna stoop to playing politics.",6
30278,Raj,20," Yeah, me neither. It should be about the work. And if I can‰Ûªt get tenure, I‰Ûªd like to see you or Sheldon get it.",6
30279,Sheldon,20," Raj, don‰Ûªt dangle false hope in front of Leonard like that.",6
30280,Leonard,20," Excuse me, but I think I‰Ûªm just as qualified as you are.",6
30281,Sheldon,20, Pchew! Pchew! Pchew! Pchew!,6
30282,Scene,20, Penny‰Ûªs apartment. ,6
30283,Penny,20, So tenured means a job for life?,6
30284,Leonard,20, Yup.,6
30285,Penny,20, You can‰Ûªt get fired even if you‰Ûªre bad at it?,6
30286,Leonard,20," Mm, not really.",6
30287,Penny,20," Wow, sounds a lot like being a pretty waitress at the Cheesecake Factory.",6
30288,Scene,20, The apartment.,6
30289,Sheldon,20," While I disagree with the premise of tenure, if they gave it to me, it wouldn‰Ûªt diminish my output. You know, I‰Ûªm like the sun. Can‰Ûªt turn this off.",6
30290,Amy,20, Are Rajesh and Leonard competing for it as well?,6
30291,Sheldon,20, Mm-hmm.,6
30292,Amy,20, Do they know they don‰Ûªt stand a chance ‰Ûªcause you‰Ûªre so great?,6
30293,Sheldon,20," Well put. You know, I must say I go back and forth on this boyfriend-girlfriend thing, but those moments when you worship me really keep you in the running.",6
30294,Scene,20, Howard and Bernadette‰Ûªs apartment.,6
30295,Raj,20, It would be nice to have the increased income. Stop taking money from my parents.,6
30296,Howard,20, Money from family does come with strings attached.,6
30297,Raj,20," You have no idea. They buy me a new BMW for my birthday but can I get seat warmers? No. Rajesh, if you want a warm butt, you‰Ûªre gonna have to pay for it yourself. Well, maybe I will, old man.",6
30298,Bernadette,20, I think that‰Ûªs enough wine for now.,6
30299,Scene,20, Penny‰Ûªs apartment.,6
30300,Leonard,20, I just keep thinking about how cool it would be if I called my mom and told her that I got tenure at Caltech.,6
30301,Penny,20," She‰Ûªd be proud, huh?",6
30302,Leonard,20," Oh, very. Assuming she takes my call.",6
30303,Scene,20, The apartment.,6
30304,Sheldon,20, My primary concern with being granted tenure is living with an insanely jealous roommate after the fact. I might need to sleep with a gun under my pillow. Or a chainsaw.,6
30305,Amy,20," Or you take advantage of your newfound economic stability and move out, buy a house, get married. start a family.",6
30306,Sheldon,20," Or, the chainsaw.",6
30307,Scene,20, Howard and Bernadette‰Ûªs apartment.,6
30308,Raj,20," And I will return to New Delhi in triumph atop a bejeweled white elephant. And you know what will be on that elephant‰Ûªs back? A seat warmer. No, Father, you may not have a ride.",6
30309,Bernadette,20, I‰Ûªm gonna make some coffee.,6
30310,Scene,20, Penny‰Ûªs apartment.,6
30311,Penny,20," So, who do you have to schmooze to get this deal?",6
30312,Leonard,20, I‰Ûªm not gonna schmooze anybody. I‰Ûªm gonna let my work speak for itself.,6
30313,Penny,20, That‰Ûªs great. That shows a lot of integrity.,6
30314,Leonard,20," Thank you. I‰Ûªm a naive idiot, right?",6
30315,Penny,20," Oh, good, you heard me.",6
30316,Scene,20, The apartment.,6
30317,Amy,20," You know, if you really want tenure, maybe you should cozy up to the people making the decision.",6
30318,Sheldon,20, Sheldon Cooper does not do cozy.,6
30319,Amy,20, You don‰Ûªt say.,6
30320,Sheldon,20," But I suppose it wouldn‰Ûªt hurt to know who‰Ûªs on the committee. Let‰Ûªs see. Oh, Janine Davis. Oh, dear.",6
30321,Amy,20, Is that a problem?,6
30322,Sheldon,20, Well‰Û_,6
30323,Sheldon,20, Even you. You‰Ûªre a slave.,6
30324,Janine,20, I‰Ûªm a what?,6
30325,Sheldon,20," I‰Ûªm not sure, it could go either way.",6
30326,Scene,20, The university gymnasium.,6
30327,Leonard,20, Hey-hey-hey-hey-hey. Mrs. Davis.,6
30328,Janine,20, Hey.,6
30329,Leonard,20, Hey.,6
30330,Janine,20, Dr. Hofstadter.,6
30331,Leonard,20, Yeah. Just thought I‰Ûªd come down and start getting ready for swimsuit season.,6
30332,Janine,20, Good for you.,6
30333,Leonard,20, Not that you need it. I bet you look great in a swimsuit.,6
30334,Janine,20, Thank you.,6
30335,Leonard,20," I‰Ûªve got what my father used to call furniture disease. My chest is falling into my drawers. I‰Ûªm not, uh, familiar with this model. How do I make it start?",6
30336,Janine,20, You push start.,6
30337,Leonard,20, Right. This one might be broken.,6
30338,Janine,20, You have to move.,6
30339,Leonard,20," Got it. Oh. There. Oh, yeah. Yeah, now I‰Ûªm feeling it. Oh, this is great. I could do this for the rest of my life. Hey, speaking, speaking of things you do for the rest of your life, uh, did I read that you‰Ûªre on that-that tenure committee?",6
30340,Janine,20, Yep. I got to get a home gym.,6
30341,Leonard,20," Well, I‰Ûªm sure you have a lot of good applicants, I just wanted to say hi and let you know that I‰Ûªll be throwing my hat in the ring.",6
30342,Janine,20," All right, I‰Ûªll keep an eye out for that.",6
30343,Leonard,20, Yeah.,6
30344,Barry,20," Hey, Hofstadter. Funny seeing you here for the first time in‰Û_ ever.",6
30345,Leonard,20, Go away.,6
30346,Barry,20," Janine the Machine, wet‰Ûªs do this!",6
30347,Janine,20," Hey, Barry.",6
30348,Leonard,20," Well, look at that. Burned a whole calorie.",6
30349,Barry,20, I guess you got here ewwy to burn off that banana bwead I baked you.,6
30350,Janine,20," Yeah, it was delicious. Thank you.",6
30351,Barry,20," No, my pweasure.",6
30352,Leonard,20," Oh, if you, if you like banana bread, I‰Ûªve got a-a great recipe. The trick is in, in fresh ground, I‰Ûªll e-mail it to you.",6
30353,Barry,20," Aw wight, I‰Ûªm warm. Weady to kick it up a notch?",6
30354,Janine,20, Let‰Ûªs go.,6
30355,Leonard,20, That‰Ûªs enough cardio for me. I‰Ûªm just gonna stretch out before I hit the weights.,6
30356,Janine,20, You okay?,6
30357,Leonard,20, Call someone.,6
30358,Scene,20, Janine‰Ûªs office. There is a sound on her computer. It opens up an online video.,6
30359,Raj,20," Good day, Mrs. Davis. This is Dr. Rajesh Koothrappali from the astrophysics department. Don‰Ûªt be alarmed, I‰Ûªm not really in space. Anyhoo, I‰Ûªd like to take this opportunity to tell you about myself, so sit back, relax and enjoy the following 90-minute video.",6
30360,Janine,20," Oh, come on.",6
30361,Raj,20," Born in New Delhi, the third son of an itinerant gynecologist, I showed early signs of genius. At the age of five I discovered a celestial object which later turned out to be the moon.",6
30362,Shelldon (off),20," (Knock, knock, knock) Mrs Davis? (Knock, knock, knock) Mrs Davis? (Knock, knock, knock) Mrs Davis?",6
30363,Janine,20," God, they‰Ûªre everywhere. Come in. Dr. Cooper, how can I help you?",6
30364,Sheldon,20," Yes, hello. I‰Ûªm fine. Um, I understand you may have a bad impression of me, so I bought you a gift.",6
30365,Janine,20," Uh, Dr. Cooper, that‰Ûªs not necessary.",6
30366,Sheldon,20, It‰Ûªs too late. Get ready to like me.,6
30367,Janine,20, Roots?,6
30368,Sheldon,20, The tragic history of slavery in America. Fun for the whole family.,6
30369,Janine,20, Why would you think this is an appropriate gift?,6
30370,Sheldon,20," Um‰Û_ Well‰Û_ You are black, right?",6
30371,Janine,20, This meeting has come to an end.,6
30372,Sheldon,20," Because you want to start watching it right now. Copy that. Let‰Ûªs see. Up next on the tenure committee is Professor Wu. Well, get ready for the complete works of Jackie Chan.",6
30373,Scene,20, The cafeteria.,6
30374,Leonard,20, Gentlemen.,6
30375,Raj,20, Where have you been?,6
30376,Leonard,20, Nurse‰Ûªs office.,6

30380,Raj,20, I don‰Ûªt know.,6
30381,Leonard,20, Probably not.,6
30382,Sheldon,20, Barely knew him.,6
30383,Howard,20," Yeah, you wouldn‰Ûªt want to look like you guys are brown-nosing the tenure committee, who will all be there. Oh, yeah, that‰Ûªs what I was hoping for, meerkats.",6
30384,Scene,20, The apartment.,6
30385,Sheldon,20," I won‰Ûªt be able to make our date night this Thursday, so, bad news for you.",6
30386,Amy,20," Well you better have a good excuse this time, because trimming Q-tips to fit your ears right is obvious nonsense.",6
30387,Sheldon,20," First of all, when you say things like that, people think you‰Ûªre crazy. Second, the reason I‰Ûªm cancelling is because I have to attend a memorial service for Professor Tupperman.",6
30388,Amy,20, It sounds like a long and tedious evening.,6
30389,Sheldon,20," Eh, it will be. Honestly, if I must endure a long and tedious evening, I‰Ûªd rather it be with you on date night. But I have no choice. The tenure committee‰Ûªs going to be there.",6
30390,Amy,20," Oh. Well, in that case, perhaps I should come along.",6
30391,Sheldon,20," Well, now that I think about it, that would be most helpful.",6
30392,Amy,20," Of course it would. I‰Ûªm well-versed in academic politics, and as a respected scientist, I can only raise your stock as a candidate.",6
30393,Sheldon,20," Actually, I meant you could drive me. But if it makes you happy, that other stuff, too.",6
30394,Scene,20, Penny‰Ûªs apartment.,6
30395,Leonard,20, Do anything interesting today?,6
30396,Penny,20," Oh, not really. I was out shopping with Amy. She wanted me to help her find something for this memorial thing.",6
30397,Leonard,20," Wait, Sheldon‰Ûªs going to be there? We all promised we weren‰Ûªt going to go.",6
30398,Penny,20," Oh, what a jerk.",6
30399,Leonard,20, I know. I was hoping to go without anyone finding out.,6
30400,Penny,20," Well, since Amy‰Ûªs going, do you want me there? You know, to support you?",6
30401,Leonard,20," Oh, that‰Ûªs nice, but it-it‰Ûªs just gonna be a room full of boring old men and I‰Ûªm not sure how much help you‰Ûªd be.",6
30402,Penny,20, Okay. I‰Ûªm just gonna tie my shoe while you think about that.,6
30403,Leonard,20," Oh, yeah. No. Thanks, that would be great help. You realize you might kill some of them.",6
30404,Penny,20," Oh, then you all can get tenure.",6
30405,Scene,20, Raj‰Ûªs apartment.,6
30406,Raj,20," Come on, Daddy. All the other scientists have seat warmers. This is so humiliating. I‰Ûªve got to get tenure. Okay, let‰Ûªs meet halfway. How about I cut my cleaning lady down to twice a week? Looks like we‰Ûªre both going to be living like animals.",6
30407,Scene,20, The memorial.,6
30408,Amy,20, Let‰Ûªs go over our emotional responses one last time.,6
30409,Sheldon,20, Okay.,6
30410,Amy,20," Professor Tupperman is dead, and that makes us?",6
30411,Sheldon,20, Sad.,6
30412,Amy,20, The fact that there are so many people here tonight doesn‰Ûªt make us cranky and claustrophobic. It makes us?,6
30413,Sheldon,20, Glad.,6
30414,Amy,20, Giving Mrs. Davis the box set of Roots was?,6
30415,Sheldon,20, Bad. However‰Û_,6
30416,Amy,20, No.,6
30417,Sheldon,20, Fine. Bad.,6
30418,Raj,20, Unbelievable. You have some nerve showing up here just to schmooze with the tenure committee.,6
30419,Sheldon,20, You‰Ûªre here.,6
30420,Raj,20," Excuse me. I‰Ûªm here to pay my respects to Professor Tupperware, or whatever his name is.",6
30421,Sheldon,20, So am I. His passing makes me feel bad.,6
30422,Leonard,20," Well, well, well, Sheldon, fancy meeting you here. I guess the train store in Glendale wasn‰Ûªt having a cotillion after all. And you, you said you weren‰Ûªt coming here, either.",6
30423,Raj,20, I have a thick accent. You don‰Ûªt know what I said.,6
30424,Amy,20, I‰Ûªd like to know why Penny‰Ûªs here.,6
30425,Penny,20," I‰Ûªm here to support my man, just like you.",6
30426,Sheldon,20, What are you going to do? Take people‰Ûªs drink orders and get them wrong?,6
30427,Leonard,20, Do it.,6
30428,Sheldon,20, What? Did she do it yet?,6
30429,Amy,20, She plans on flirting with members of the tenure committee to further Leonard‰Ûªs cause.,6
30430,Sheldon,20," Well, that‰Ûªs a fine how-do-you-do. Don‰Ûªt just stand there. Take your breasts out.",6
30431,Howard,20," Ooh, meerkat fight!",6
30432,Amy,20," You‰Ûªre all wasting your time. Sheldon is the most qualified for the job, and no amount of gravity-defying bosom‰Ûªs going to change that. Seriously, is that tape? Like, how are they staying up like that?",6
30433,Leonard,20, Way to hit ‰Ûªem with both barrels.,6
30434,Raj,20," You two should be ashamed of yourselves. Using women to advance your cause with sexuality, and whatever Amy plans on doing.",6
30435,Sheldon,20, Are you implying that my girlfriend has no sexuality to exploit?,6
30436,Raj,20, Yes.,6
30437,Sheldon,20," Okay, because that was not clear.",6
30438,Amy,20, Sheldon!,6
30439,Sheldon,20, What? That was ambiguous.,6
30440,Raj,20," Well, now it‰Ûªs biguous. What are you gonna do about it?",6
30441,Sheldon,20, Um‰Û_,6
30442,Howard,20, You could talk some smack about his mother.,6
30443,Sheldon,20," Well, yes, of course, he wouldn‰Ûªt like that at all. Last night, I was feeling in need of sexual release when I happened to come across your mother.",6
30444,Leonard,20," Okay, okay. Guys, what are we doing here?",6
30445,Sheldon,20," I don‰Ûªt know what you‰Ûªre doing, but I was about to insinuate that I had coitus with Raj‰Ûªs mother for a dollar.",6
30446,Leonard,20," Oh, you do what you want, but I don‰Ûªt want to lose my friends over tenure. Friends are forever.",6
30447,Howard,20, So is tenure.,6
30448,Bernadette,20, Walk.,6
30449,Leonard,20, I‰Ûªm just gonna go home and let my work speak for itself.,6
30450,Raj,20, You‰Ûªre right. This is beneath me. Lie your mother was last night.,6
30451,Leonard,20," How about it, Sheldon?",6
30452,Sheldon,20, What do you think I should do?,6
30453,Amy,20," Well, you‰Ûªll always be an academic success, but I seriously question whether you‰Ûªll make any more friends.",6
30454,Sheldon,20," I don‰Ûªt want any more, but let‰Ûªs go.",6
30455,Barry,20, Are you kidding? I would wove to baby-sit for you.,6
30456,Janine,20, I could not ask you to do that.,6
30457,Barry,20, Nonsense. Childwen wove me. Something about me just makes them waugh and waugh.,6
30458,Leonard,20, No. We cannot lose to that jerk.,6
30459,Raj,20," Yeah, screw it. I‰Ûªm going in.",6
30460,Sheldon,20," Wait. Hold on. I believe screw it, I‰Ûªm going in is what I said to your mother last night. Don‰Ûªt worry, I didn‰Ûªt really say that. I find the concept of coitus ridiculous and off-putting.",6
30461,Amy,20, Should have taken my breasts out while I had the chance.,6
30462,Scene,20, Janine‰Ûªs office.,6
30463,Sheldon,20," (Knock, knock, knock) Mrs Davis? (Knock, knock, knock) Mrs Davis? (Knock, knock, knock) Mrs Davis? I know you‰Ûªre in there. I saw your car in the parking lot.",6
30464,Janine,20, What?,6
30465,Sheldon,20," I just found out that you recommended myself, Dr. Hofstadter and Dr. Koothrappali to be on the short list for tenure.",6
30466,Janine,20," Well, despite your quirks, the three of you are very accomplished in your respective fields.",6
30467,Sheldon,20," I don‰Ûªt know what you mean by quirks, but, um, I do want to express my gratitude.",6
30468,Janine,20," You didn‰Ûªt bring another gift, did you?",6
30469,Sheldon,20," No, no. No, I learned my lesson. I understand that was inappropriate.",6
30470,Janine,20, Good.,6
30471,Sheldon,20," Anyway, thank you.",6
30472,Janine,20, You‰Ûªre welcome. (Sheldon attempts a jive handshake) I‰Ûªm gonna pretend that didn‰Ûªt happen.,6
30473,Sheldon,20," Yeah, right on, sister.",6
30474,Scene,21, The apartment.,6
30475,Sheldon,21," Oh, dear. Penny, have you been recording shows on our DVR again?",6
30476,Penny,21, No.,6
30477,Sheldon,21, Answer honestly. This is not a trial. That‰Ûªll come later.,6
30478,Penny,21," Absolutely not. Help me out here, I can‰Ûªt afford another demerit.",6
30479,Leonard,21," Yeah. Uh, maybe we were hacked. You know, the Chinese have been hacking everything lately.",6
30480,Leonard,21, I don‰Ûªt know. It‰Ûªs a fat guy on a Segway. That‰Ûªs funny everywhere.,6
30481,Sheldon,21, I‰Ûªm deleting it.,6
30482,Penny,21," Well, hang on. Maybe the Chinese haven‰Ûªt finished watching it yet.",6
30483,Leonard,21," You know, if you‰Ûªre trying to make space on the DVR, why don‰Ûªt you just get rid of some of the stuff you‰Ûªve already watched? Like, um, Alphas.",6
30484,Sheldon,21," No, that‰Ûªs the season two finale. That was quite the cliffhanger. I‰Ûªm going to re-watch it before season three starts.",6
30485,Leonard,21, There is no season three. They cancelled that show.,6
30486,Sheldon,21," Well, they can‰Ûªt cancel it. It ended on a cliffhanger.",6
30487,Leonard,21, They did.,6
30488,Penny,21," Uh, Sheldon, there are two dumplings left. Do you want them?",6
30489,Sheldon,21, Dumplings? Don‰Ûªt you understand what‰Ûªs going on here?,6
30490,Penny,21," As a rule, no.",6
30491,Sheldon,21," That show ended with all the residents of New York either dead or unconscious. Oh, now I‰Ûªll never know what happened.",6
30492,Penny,21," Well, why don‰Ûªt you make up your own ending?",6
30493,Sheldon,21," Oh, sure, what a wonderful idea. And after that, I‰Ûªll make up my own rules of oral hygiene. You know, instead of flossing, I‰Ûªll rub pudding on my gums. I‰Ûªm going to get the number of the SyFy Channel and give them what for.",6
30494,Leonard,21," Oh, please, don‰Ûªt do that.",6
30495,Sheldon,21, No. They can‰Ûªt just cancel a show like Alphas. You know? They have to help the viewers let go. Firefly did a movie to wrap things up. Buffy the Vampire Slayer continued on as a comic book. Heroes gradually lowered the quality season by season till we were grateful it ended.,6
30496,Penny,21, I feel bad for whoever gets that phone call.,6
30497,Leonard,21," Ah, don‰Ûªt. If they didn‰Ûªt want to be yelled at by crazy nerds, they shouldn‰Ûªt have started a sci-fi channel.",6
30498,Scene,21, Raj‰Ûªs apartment.,6
30499,Howard,21," I think you‰Ûªre gonna be really happy with this security camera. The optics are great, it‰Ûªs got infrared technology, and there‰Ûªs even a backup battery when the power goes out.",6
30500,Raj,21," Whatever. I can see my little princess while I‰Ûªm at work, right?",6
30501,Howard,21, Why can‰Ûªt you just watch porn like a regular guy? I need your laptop so I can configure the software.,6
30502,Raj,21," Wait, hold on. This is weird.",6
30503,Howard,21, What?,6
30504,Raj,21," I was Googling that girl I‰Ûªve been dating, and I found her blog.",6
30505,Howard,21, Cool. Anything juicy?,6
30506,Raj,21," She said she recently went on a date with a guy named Roger? And he‰Ûªs Indian? And he‰Ûªs an astrophysicist, too?",6
30507,Howard,21," You know what‰Ûªs going on, don‰Ûªt you?",6
30508,Raj,21," Yes, Mummy was right. American girls are sexually voracious devils.",6
30509,Howard,21, I can‰Ûªt believe I have to explain this. People change names on blogs to protect their privacy. Roger is Raj.,6
30510,Raj,21," Oh. I always thought, if I had a white name, it would be Gavin.",6
30511,Howard,21, Keep reading. What does it say?,6
30512,Raj,21," No, no, I don‰Ûªt know if I should. If she wanted me to know about her blog, she would‰Ûªve told me. It‰Ûªs almost like I‰Ûªm reading her diary.",6
30513,Howard,21, It‰Ûªs exactly what it‰Ûªs like. Keep reading.,6
30514,Raj,21," No, this is creepy.",6
30515,Howard,21," Oh, I think we were looking at creepy in the rearview mirror when I put up that camera.",6
30516,Raj,21," It‰Ûªs not creepy. Don‰Ûªt listen to him. Oh, look who‰Ûªs got the sweetest kisses.",6
30517,Howard,21, Should I go?,6
30518,Scene,21, Penny‰Ûªs apartment.,6
30519,Leonard,21," With all the TV Sheldon was talking about, I had the greatest idea ever. It even blows away my idea for a Star Wars themed coffee shop called Brewbacca‰Ûªs. You need to watch Buffy the Vampire Slayer. It is the perfect show for the two of us. It‰Ûªs got action and jokes and hot vampires and romance. I cannot oversell this. What do you say?",6
30520,Penny,21, It‰Ûªs six thirty in the morning.,6
30521,Leonard,21, I thought you grew up on a farm.,6
30522,Scene,21, The apartment.,6
30523,Sheldon (on phone),21," Hello, SyFy Network? Yeah, this is your vice president of programming. Now, we have made a horrible mistake regarding Alphas. Yeah, we need to uncancel it immediately. Well, you just put me through to the people who handle that, you tell them it‰Ûªs me, and I don‰Ûªt want to answer a lot of questions about if I really am who I say I am, you know? I just. I want this done. No, I am not the person who just called. That man was clearly a cowboy. Yeah, who was plumb concerned about y‰Ûªall cancelling his favourite show. Why do they keep hanging up on me?",6
30524,Amy,21," I‰Ûªm sorry you‰Ûªre upset. You know, Sheldon, sometimes people seek the comfort of physical contact in moments like this.",6
30525,Sheldon,21, I am not flying back to Texas just so my mom can give me a hug.,6
30526,Amy,21," Okay. Well, what I think is going on here is you have a pathological need for closure.",6
30527,Sheldon,21," Oh, that‰Ûªs nonsense. I mean, you tell me stories about your day all the time. I don‰Ûªt care how they end.",6
30528,Amy,21," You know, I might be able to help you with this. There‰Ûªs a whole field of behavioural neuroscience that examines ways to retrain your neural pathways so stuff like this bothers you less.",6
30529,Sheldon,21," Yeah, but I just told you, I don‰Ûªt have a problem with closure.",6
30530,Amy,21, You sure about that?,6
30531,Sheldon,21," Oh, quite sure. (Amy starts a knocking sequence on the table. After staring at her a moment, Sheldon completes it.) That proves nothing.",6
30532,Scene,21, Raj‰Ûªs office.,6
30533,Howard,21, Ready to go to lunch?,6
30534,Raj,21, Do you think I‰Ûªm feminine?,6
30535,Howard,21, Yeah. Let‰Ûªs go.,6
30536,Raj,21, Thanks a lot.,6
30537,Howard,21, What‰Ûªs going on?,6
30538,Raj,21," I broke down, and I read Lucy‰Ûªs blog, and in one of the entries she said, when we first met, I struck her as a little feminine.",6
30539,Howard,21, Just a little? That‰Ûªs great.,6
30540,Raj,21, I have to talk to her about this.,6
30541,Howard,21," Oh, geez, why do you girls always want to talk about things? Listen to me, if she‰Ûªs writing about your relationship, use it to your advantage. Rig the game.",6
30542,Raj,21," Well, that doesn‰Ûªt seem fair.",6
30543,Howard,21," Is it fair that girls like confident, normal guys more than nervous weirdos?",6
30544,Raj,21," No, it‰Ûªs not. I‰Ûªve always thought that was unfair.",6
30545,Howard,21, So take what‰Ûªs in that blog and use it to get her pants off.,6
30546,Raj,21, Why do you have to make everything so filthy? Why couldn‰Ûªt you just say the blog is like her giving me the key to her heart?,6
30547,Howard,21, The key to her heart. That‰Ûªs nice. Were you quoting someone or is it tattooed on the small of your back?,6
30548,Raj,21," I was quoting a man who knows a thing or two about women, Sir Elton John.",6
30549,Scene,21, Penny‰Ûªs apartment.,6
30550,Leonard,21," So, did you love it? Of course you loved it. How could you not love it? Tell me how much you loved it.",6
30551,Penny,21, It was cute.,6
30552,Leonard,21," Oh, don‰Ûªt say cute. That‰Ûªs the worst.",6
30553,Penny,21, What‰Ûªs wrong with cute?,6
30554,Leonard,21, It just makes things seem small. It diminishes them.,6
30555,Penny,21, So you want me to stop calling your little tushy cute?,6
30556,Leonard,21," You can try, but nobody‰Ûªs gonna believe you. I just, I don‰Ûªt understand how you can watch a show that great and not be excited by it.",6
30557,Penny,21, I liked it. I‰Ûªm excited.,6
30558,Leonard,21," Well, then, tell your face.",6
30559,Penny,21, What do you want from me?,6
30560,Leonard,21, You know what? Never mind. We gave it a shot. Let‰Ûªs just see what else is on.,6
30561,Penny,21," Oh, come on, don‰Ûªt be like that.",6
30562,Leonard,21, Well‰Û_,6
30563,Penny,21, I‰Ûªm sorry I called it cute. Let‰Ûªs watch another one.,6
30564,Leonard,21, Really?,6
30565,Penny,21," Yeah, it was fun. Kind of reminded me of my high school. But instead of vampires, we had meth heads. But both came out at night and had messed up teeth.",6
30566,Leonard,21," All right, cool. I think you‰Ûªll like the next one better. All the cheerleaders are suffering from an evil curse.",6
30567,Penny,21," Oh. Well, that‰Ûªs like my high school, too. But instead of a curse, it was crabs.",6
30568,Scene,21, The apartment.,6
30569,Amy,21, I‰Ûªve come up with a series of exercises to help with your compulsive need for closure.,6
30570,Sheldon,21, I take issue with the word compulsive.,6
30571,Amy,21," All I‰Ûªm saying is, we live in a world where closure isn‰Ûªt always an op‰Û_",6
30572,Sheldon,21," ‰Û_tion. Okay. For the sake of argument, let‰Ûªs say I have a problem. What would be your plan for addressing it?",6
30573,Amy,21, I‰Ûªm going to recondition your brain so that the need for completion isn‰Ûªt so overwhelming.,6
30574,Sheldon,21, By playing tic-tac-toe?,6
30575,Amy,21, Yep. Your turn.,6
30576,Sheldon,21," Oh, Amy. And you wonder why people think neuroscience is nothing but a goofy game for diaper babies. Tic-tac-toe can only end in win, lose or draw, none of which will deny me closure. Especially since I‰Ûªm about to win. (She wipes the board clean.) B-But we didn‰Ûªt finish.",6
30577,Amy,21, Exactly. How does that make you feel?,6
30578,Sheldon,21, The same way any normal person would. I feel like I want to peel off my own face and tear it in two and then again and again until I have a handful of Sheldon-face confetti.,6
30579,Amy,21, And that‰Ûªs exactly the feeling we want to address with this course of treatment.,6
30580,Sheldon,21," Or you could pitch in, grab a nostril and help me get this face off.",6
30581,Amy,21," Come on, you can do this.",6
30582,Sheldon,21, You don‰Ûªt know what it‰Ûªs like to feel completely frustrated. To have a desire build up within you and be denied any opportunity for release.,6
30583,Amy,21," Yeah, sounds like a drag.",6
30584,Scene,21, Penny‰Ûªs apartment.,6
30585,Penny,21," Okay, help me out here. Why does he love this show so much?",6
30586,Bernadette,21," Well, there was action, it was funny. I mean, you do get that usually the monster chases the pretty girl, but this time the pretty girl chases the monsters?",6
30587,Penny,21," Yippee, it‰Ûªs backwards. I get it.",6
30588,Bernadette,21, Why does this bother you so much?,6
30589,Penny,21," I don‰Ûªt know. It‰Ûªs just, he‰Ûªs so passionate about so many different things. I just don‰Ûªt get that way. Do you?",6
30590,Bernadette,21," Well, sure. I‰Ûªm pretty passionate about science. I remember the first time I looked through a microscope and saw millions of tiny microorganisms. It was like a whole other universe. If I wanted to, I could wipe it out with my thumb like a god.",6
30591,Penny,21," See? I wish I had some of that fire in my life. I mean, I want to care about things and get excited like you guys.",6
30592,Bernadette,21," Well, there‰Ûªs no reason you can‰Ûªt.",6
30593,Penny,21, You think?,6
30594,Bernadette,21, Absolutely. All we need to do is spend a little time and find something you‰Ûªre passionate about.,6
30595,Penny,21," Ugh, that sounds like a lot of work.",6
30596,Scene,21, Raj‰Ûªs apartment. ,6
30597,Howard (on webcam),21," Hey, what‰Ûªs up?",6
30598,Raj,21," Uh, Lucy‰Ûªs coming over. I need some advice.",6
30599,Howard,21," However long you think the foreplay should be, triple it.",6
30600,Raj,21, Just tell me which one you think is more manly. This hockey jersey or this football jersey.,6
30601,Howard,21, I don‰Ûªt know. Go with hockey.,6
30602,Raj,21," Good, black is more slimming. Oh, that‰Ûªs her. I got to go be butch. Toodles. Hey.",6
30603,Lucy,21, Hi.,6
30604,Raj,21, Come in.,6
30605,Lucy,21," Oh, look how cute your little doggy is.",6
30606,Raj,21," Yeah, well, I wouldn‰Ûªt get too close. If I give the right command in German, she‰Ûªll rip your face off.",6
30607,Scene,21, The apartment. Montage of scenes.,6
30608,1. Amy (singing),21," O‰Ûªer the land of the free, and the home of the‰Û_ Next.",6
30609,2. (Sheldon is laying out an intricate pattern of dominoes) Amy,21," That‰Ûªs quite an impressive layout, isn‰Ûªt it?",6
30610,Sheldon,21, Yes.,6
30611,Amy,21, Let‰Ûªs box it up.,6
30612,Sheldon,21, Let‰Ûªs box it up.,6
30613,3. (Sheldon is turning the handle on a jack-in-the-box. Just before the end of the tune) Amy,21," That‰Ûªs enough. Sheldon, Sheldon, give it!",6
30614,4. Amy,21," Okay, Sheldon, make a wish and blow out the candles. Oops, missed one. Now your wish can‰Ûªt come true.",6
30615,Sheldon,21," Lucky for you, ‰Ûªcause I wished you were dead.",6
30616,Scene,21, Raj‰Ûªs apartment.,6
30617,Lucy,21, I like your jersey.,6
30618,Raj,21, Thanks. I love hockey.,6
30619,Lucy,21," Oh, cool. So does my dad. We watched it all the time growing up. Who‰Ûªs your favourite player?",6
30620,Raj,21," Not Brian Boitano, that‰Ûªs for sure. How‰Ûªs your burrito?",6
30621,Lucy,21, It‰Ûªs still a little frozen in the middle.,6
30622,Raj,21, Probably because I didn‰Ûªt read the instructions. No wrapper‰Ûªs going to tell me what to do. Unless his name is Jay-Z.,6
30623,Lucy,21, Is something going on?,6
30624,Raj,21, What do you mean?,6
30625,Lucy,21," Well, you‰Ûªre acting all weird, and I‰Ûªm pretty weird, so I think I know what I‰Ûªm talking about.",6
30626,Raj,21, I don‰Ûªt know. Maybe it‰Ûªs all those steroids I‰Ûªve been taking.,6
30627,Lucy,21, I think I‰Ûªm gonna go. Thank you for the burrito and the pork rinds and the 20-minute lecture on why monster trucks are better than regular trucks.,6
30628,Raj,21," Wait, wait. I, I found your blog here you wrote about me.",6
30629,Lucy,21, Oh. I kind of just write that for myself. I didn‰Ûªt think anybody actually read it.,6
30630,Raj,21," No kidding. You didn‰Ûªt make it easy to find. I spent hours digging around online. For the record, you have excellent credit scores. And your diabetic aunt seems to be adjusting to her new leg just fine.",6
30631,Lucy,21, Why were you acting so strange tonight?,6
30632,Raj,21," You called me feminine. And I, I wanted you to think I was more manly.",6
30633,Lucy,21," Raj, I didn‰Ûªt say feminine was a bad thing. I meant that you‰Ûªre sweet and thoughtful and your skin looks so much like caramel, I just want to dip an apple in your face.",6
30634,Raj,21, I do have a pretty balls-to-the-wall moisturising regimen.,6
30635,Lucy,21," So, are you okay?",6
30636,Raj,21, Yeah.,6
30637,Lucy,21, Good. Do you even like hockey?,6
30638,Raj,21, No. Bought this at the Staples Center when I went to see Taylor Swift.,6
30639,Scene,21, Penny‰Ûªs apartment. ,6
30640,Penny,21," So, I was thinking how excited you get about stuff like Buffy or science or which TV remote you and Sheldon should buy.",6
30641,Leonard,21," The Harmony One was fine. We didn‰Ûªt need to upgrade to the eleven hundred, which he knows is too big for my hand.",6
30642,Penny,21," See, that‰Ûªs the kind of passion I didn‰Ûªt think I had. But then I realized I‰Ûªm passionate about you.",6
30643,Leonard,21," Oh, my cute little tushy strikes again.",6
30644,Penny,21," No, I‰Ûªm serious. Look, I‰Ûªve always had these plans. I was gonna be in movies and live this glamorous life, and anything less than that just wasn‰Ûªt worth getting excited about.",6
30645,Leonard,21, Those things can still happen.,6
30646,Penny,21," Oh, obviously it‰Ûªs gonna happen. Yeah, a psychic at a bachelorette party told me so. Anyway, what I meant was, I shouldn‰Ûªt wait, you know? I‰Ûªve got you, I‰Ûªve got Sheldon, all these wonderful friends. My life is exciting right now.",6
30647,Leonard,21, That‰Ûªs a big deal.,6
30648,Penny,21," It is, isn‰Ûªt it?",6
30649,Leonard,21," So, does that mean we get to do stuff like talk about cool shows or get dressed up in matching costumes and go to Comic-Con?",6
30650,Penny,21," Leonard, I had an epiphany, not a stroke.",6
30651,Scene,21, The apartment. ,6
30652,Sheldon,21," Amy, I must say, I was sceptical at first, but this has truly been a transformative evening.",6
30653,Amy,21, I‰Ûªm a little surprised to hear you feeling so positive.,6
30654,Sheldon,21," Well, you‰Ûªre an excellent neuroscientist, you‰Ûªre a wonderful girlfriend, and‰Û_",6
30655,Amy,21, And?,6
30656,Sheldon,21," Doesn‰Ûªt matter, does it?",6
30657,Amy,21," I‰Ûªm proud of you, Sheldon. (Exits.)",6
30658,Sheldon,21, And a complete sucker.,6
30659,1. (Redraws tic-tac-toe board) Sheldon,21," Oh, yeah.",6
30660,3. (Winds up jack-in-the-box until it pops out.) Sheldon,21, There he is.,6
30661,4. Sheldon (singing),21, And the home of the brave.,6
30662,5. (Knocks over first of intricate domino pattern) Sheldon,21," Don‰Ûªt stop. Yes, keep going. Just like that.",6
30663,Penny,21," Sheldon, you big weirdo, I want you to know that I love that you‰Ûªre in my life.",6
30664,Sheldon,21," I love you, too.",6
30665,Scene,21, Later.,6
30666,Sheldon,21," Hello. Uh, is this the Bruce Miller who wrote the season finale of Alphas? Oh, smashing. Yeah, you already sound nicer than the last Bruce Miller who suggested I have sexual relations with myself. Now, down to business. Um, your show ended on a cliffhanger. Could you please tell me how you planned to resolve it? Uh-huh. Mm-hmm. I see. Well, that all stinks. No wonder you got cancelled. Bye.",6
30667,Scene,22, The apartment.,6
30668,Leonard,22," The interface is pretty simple. You put your horizontal X coordinate here, vertical Y coordinate here. When you‰Ûªre happy with those, you press this button.",6
30669,Penny,22, Got it.,6
30670,Sheldon,22," Leonard, you‰Ûªll never guess who I just found online. Hey!",6
30671,Leonard,22, Nice shot.,6
30672,Penny,22," Eh, his giant head did most of the work.",6
30673,Sheldon,22," Very mature. You‰Ûªre lucky I‰Ûªm out of silly string. As I was saying, Leonard, you‰Ûªll never guess who I just found online. Professor Proton.",6
30674,Leonard,22, You‰Ûªre kidding. He‰Ûªs still alive?,6
30675,Sheldon,22, Yes.,6
30676,Penny,22, Who‰Ûªs Professor Proton?,6
30677,Leonard,22, He was the host of this great‰Û_ Hey!,6
30678,Penny,22," Yes! Sorry, tell me about Professor Proton.",6
30679,Sheldon,22, Professor Proton hosted my favourite science show when I was a child. I never missed an episode. He demonstrated scientific principles using everyday objects.,6
30680,Leonard,22, It was pretty cool.,6
30681,Penny,22," Aw, so cute when you use the word cool wrong. Like when kids say pasghetti.",6
30682,Sheldon,22," Oh, dear lord, Leonard, look. He‰Ûªs still available for parties and events. We should hire him.",6
30683,Leonard,22, Hire him to do what?,6
30684,Sheldon,22," Well, whatever we want. Hang out, do experiments, make him take 12 pictures with us so we can make a calendar.",6
30685,Leonard,22," It would be pretty awesome to hang out with him. I just used awesome wrong, didn‰Ûªt I?",6
30686,Sheldon,22," Well, I‰Ûªm e-mailing him right now.",6
30687,Leonard,22, Do you remember his old theme song?,6
30688,Sheldon,22, Of course I do.,6
30689,Together,22," Grab your goggles, put your lab coat on, here he comes, Professor Proton.",6
30690,Scene,22, The cafeteria.,6
30691,Raj,22," Hey, I just found out I have to be at the telescope lab all weekend. Any chance you and Bernadette could take care of my dog?",6
30692,Howard,22, Why don‰Ûªt you put her in a kennel?,6
30693,Raj,22, Why don‰Ûªt you put your mother in a home?,6
30694,Howard,22," To be honest, she‰Ûªd do better in the kennel. I‰Ûªll talk to Bernie. I‰Ûªm sure it‰Ûªs fine.",6
30695,Raj,22, Thank you.,6
30696,Sheldon,22," It‰Ûªs happening. Leonard, it‰Ûªs happening. Professor Proton is coming to our house.",6
30697,Leonard,22, You‰Ûªre kidding.,6
30698,Howard,22, You mean the guy who used to host that lame kids show?,6
30699,Sheldon,22, And you just got yourself uninvited. See? I told you I‰Ûªd find a tactful way to do that.,6
30700,Howard,22, How‰Ûªd you get him to come to your house?,6
30701,Sheldon,22," As Professor Proton always says, there is no problem you can‰Ûªt solve if you use your noggin.",6
30702,Leonard,22, And he wrote him a cheque.,6
30703,Sheldon,22," Yeah, that, too. Big cheque.",6
30704,Scene,22, Howard and Bernadette‰Ûªs apartment.,6
30705,Raj,22, Uncle Howard. Cinnamon‰Ûªs here for her sleepover party.,6
30706,Howard,22," You know if you had a stroke, she‰Ûªd eat you, right?",6
30707,Raj,22, And it would be my pleasure to be her num-num.,6
30708,Howard,22," Okay, so what do I need to know to take care of her?",6
30709,Raj,22," It‰Ûªs very simple. For breakfast, she has an egg-white frittata. Feel free to give her a choice of home fries or an English muffin, but not both. We‰Ûªre watching our weight. Uh, for dinner, something simple, a veal chop, some scampi, whatever you like.",6
30710,Howard,22, Classy dog.,6
30711,Raj,22," Yes. Also, don‰Ûªt forget to close the toilet or she‰Ûªll drink out of it.",6
30712,Howatd,22," I feel for ya. I‰Ûªve got a psychotic mommy, too.",6
30713,Scene,22, Leonard‰Ûªs bedroom.,6
30714,Sheldon (off),22," Leonard, are you in bed?",6
30715,Leonard,22, Yes.,6
30716,Sheldon (off),22," Me, too.",6
30717,Leonard,22, Great.,6
30718,Sheldon (off),22, I can‰Ûªt sleep.,6
30719,Leonard,22," Well, I can, so shut up.",6
30720,Sheldon (off),22," Do you realize that in less than nine hours, Arthur Jeffries, aka Professor Proton, will be in our apartment?",6
30721,Leonard,22," Sheldon, you know that if you stay up all night, you‰Ûªre gonna be sleepy tomorrow. And a sleepy Sheldon is a cranky Sheldon. And a cranky Sheldon is actually no different than a regular Sheldon. Good night.",6
30722,Sheldon (off),22, I‰Ûªm thinking of wearing a tuxedo.,6
30723,Leonard,22, That‰Ûªs not ridiculous. Good night.,6
30724,Sheldon (off),22, Do you have cufflinks?,6
30725,Leonard,22, No.,6
30726,Sheldon (off),22," Ah, just as well. Where can you rent a tuxedo at three o‰Ûªclock in the morning?",6
30727,Leonard,22," Okay, good night.",6
30728,Sheldon (off),22," Nice to meet you, Professor Proton. Nice to meet you, Professor Proton. Nice to meet you, Professor Proton. Nice to meet you, Prof‰Û_ Ow! Leonard?",6
30729,Leonard,22, What?,6
30730,Sheldon (off),22, I still can‰Ûªt sleep.,6
30731,Scene,22, Howard and Bernadette‰Ûªs apartment.,6
30732,Howard,22," She really tuckered herself out at the park, huh?",6
30733,Bernadette,22," Yeah, you two were so cute playing together.",6
30734,Howard,22, It was kind of fun throwing a ball and not having anyone laugh at me.,6
30735,Bernadette,22, And you were sweet not to throw it too far so she didn‰Ûªt wear out her tiny legs.,6
30736,Howard,22," Yeah, that‰Ûªs what I was doing.",6
30737,Bernadette,22," You know, there were a few moments today when I almost felt like we were a little family.",6
30738,Howard,22, Really?,6
30739,Bernadette,22," Yeah. I never thought of myself as a mom, but when the three of us were out there having fun, I felt like maybe someday we could do it.",6
30740,Howard,22," Of course we can. Especially if our baby‰Ûªs as calm and quiet as little Cinna‰Û_ Son of a bitch, she‰Ûªs gone.",6
30741,Bernadette,22, Where‰Ûªd she go?,6
30742,Howard,22," I don‰Ûªt know, she didn‰Ûªt leave a note.",6
30743,Bernadette,22," Well, you were the one who was supposed to put her back in the stroller.",6
30744,Howard,22," No, I wasn‰Ûªt. You were.",6
30745,Bernadette,22," No, I wasn‰Ûªt.",6
30746,Howard,22," Yes, you were!.",6
30747,Bernadette,22," Yeah, well, you throw like a girl.",6
30748,Scene,22, The apartment. ,6
30749,Sheldon,22, I‰Ûªm getting worried.,6
30750,Penny,22," Relax, Sheldon, he‰Ûªs only a few minutes late.",6
30751,Sheldon,22," Professor Proton was never late when he was on TV. You know, every day, four o‰Ûªclock, he was there. Unless tornadoes were ripping apart East Texas, in which case we‰Ûªd join him in progress. (Phone rings) It‰Ûªs him. Hello. Well, I see. Yes. All right, we can come get you. Yeah, well, see you soon. Bye.",6
30752,Leonard,22, Where is he?,6
30753,Sheldon,22, The third floor landing. The poor old guy‰Ûªs been walking up the stairs for half an hour. It‰Ûªs really you.,6
30754,Leonard,22," Mr. Jeffries, I am so sorry. We should‰Ûªve told you about the broken elevator.",6
30755,Arthur,22, I agree.,6
30756,Sheldon,22," Professor Proton, it‰Ûªs an honour to meet you.",6
30757,Arthur,22," Just, just call me Arthur.",6
30758,Sheldon,22," Leonard, you hear that? Professor Proton said I should call him Arthur. That means we‰Ûªre friends.",6
30759,Arthur,22," No. A friend would‰Ûªve, would‰Ûªve told me about the elevator.",6
30760,Sheldon,22, Look at me. I can get as close to you as I want without my mom saying it‰Ûªs going to ruin my eyes.,6
30761,Arthur,22," Is, uh, is he dangerous?",6
30762,Leonard,22," Actually, he‰Ûªs a genius.",6
30763,Sheldon,22, I am.,6
30764,Arthur,22, That doesn‰Ûªt answer my question.,6
30765,Leonard,22," Mr. Jeffries, I‰Ûªm, I‰Ûªm Leonard. This is my girlfriend, Penny.",6
30766,Arthur,22, Hi.,6
30767,Penny,22, Hello.,6
30768,Arthur,22," Well, I hope I haven‰Ûªt, uh, kept the kids waiting too long for, for the show.",6
30769,Sheldon,22," Oh, no, there are no kids. No, the, the show‰Ûªs for me. Come on. I‰Ûªll race ya, Arthur.",6
30770,Arthur,22," Is the, is the blonde girl really your, your girlfriend?",6
30771,Leonard,22," Yes, sir.",6
30772,Arthur,22, You‰Ûªre the genius.,6
30773,Penny,22," So, do you do a lot of appearances like this?",6
30774,Arthur,22," It, it‰Ûªs hard to say. I‰Ûªm, I‰Ûªm still trying to figure out what, what th, what this is.",6
30775,Leonard,22, We just wanted to hang out with you and maybe learn a little about your life.,6
30776,Arthur,22," Well, there, there really isn‰Ûªt too much to tell. After the TV show was, was cancelled, nobody in the scientific world would, uh, would take me seriously. So I was forced to do these, uh, children‰Ûªs parties to, to make a living.",6
30777,Leonard,22," That‰Ûªs too bad. But still, working with kids, it must be rewarding.",6
30778,Arthur,22," You, you get bit a lot. Let me see if, if I have this straight. You, you two are, are physicists, and you, and you want me to do a children‰Ûªs science show?",6
30779,Sheldon,22," Yes. And if there‰Ûªs time, take 12 pictures with us in seasonal clothing.",6
30780,Arthur,22," You know, I‰Ûªm a real scientist. I, I have a PhD from Cornell University.",6
30781,Sheldon,22," Yeah, that‰Ûªs great. Did you bring your puppet?",6
30782,Arthur,22," No, no. I, I hate that puppet.",6
30783,Sheldon,22," Oh, no. How could anybody hate Gino the Neutrino? It‰Ûªs nice, huh? I got him for 20 bucks on eBay. Including the shipping!",6
30784,Arthur,22," I‰Ûªm, I‰Ûªm awake, right? Th, this is happening?",6
30785,Scene,22, Bernadette‰Ûªs car.,6
30786,Bernadette,22, Cinnamon!,6
30787,Howard,22, Cinnamon!,6
30788,Bernadette,22," You know, maybe she doesn‰Ûªt recognize her name because of Raj‰Ûªs accent.",6
30789,Howard,22," Good thinking. (In a bad Indian accent) Cinnamon, come to Daddy.",6
30790,Bernadette (likewise),22," Cinnamon. Where are you, my little lamb chop?",6
30791,Howard,22, Nice.,6
30792,Bernadette,22, Thanks.,6
30793,Howard,22," When this all blows over, remember that voice. It‰Ûªs kind of a turn-on.",6
30794,Bernadette,22, It turns you on when I sound like Raj?,6
30795,Howard,22, Cinnamon!,6
30796,Scene,22, The apartment. ,6
30797,Arthur,22," Okay, as, as I put the egg on top, and, and the flame goes out and, and, and the air pressure decreases in, in the flask, what do you think will happen?",6
30798,Penny,22, I think I know.,6
30799,Sheldon,22, It‰Ûªs gonna get sucked in. It‰Ûªs going to get sucked in.,6
30800,Penny,22," Okay, I didn‰Ûªt know.",6
30801,Sheldon,22, Yes.,6
30802,Penny,22," See, I‰Ûªm not a scientist like them.",6
30803,Arthur,22," I, I figured that out.",6
30804,Sheldon,22, Potato clock. Do potato clock.,6
30805,Penny,22, What‰Ûªs that?,6
30806,Arthur,22," I, I power a clock with a, with a potato.",6
30807,Penny,22," Shut up. You can do that? I mean, wouldn‰Ûªt that solve the world‰Ûªs energy crisis?",6
30808,Arthur,22," No. Look, guys, keep your money. I, I think, uh, I, I think I‰Ûªm done.",6
30809,Sheldon,22," What, well what‰Ûªs wrong? Is she upsetting you? Because I can make her go away.",6
30810,Arthur,22," No, she, she‰Ûªs the only reason I‰Ûªve, I‰Ûªve stayed this long.",6
30811,Leonard,22, Then what is it?,6
30812,Arthur,22," I don‰Ûªt know. I think I‰Ûªm just, I, I just, I just don‰Ûªt want to be Professor Proton any more.",6
30813,Sheldon,22," Well, how can you say that? Professor Proton‰Ûªs the best.",6
30814,Arthur,22," What, what has it ever gotten me? I mean, I‰Ûªm, I‰Ûªm an 83-year-old man who has potatoes in, in his suitcase. Other scientists think, think I‰Ûªm a joke. And the, the puppeteer who did, who did Gino, well, he also did my wife.",6
30815,Penny,22, I‰Ûªm sorry to hear about your troubles.,6
30816,Arthur,22," Uh, thanks.",6
30817,Penny,22," But if you don‰Ûªt mind me asking, uh, the potato clock, how does it work? Is it a trick clock or a trick potato?",6
30818,Arthur,22, What do you two talk about?,6
30819,Sheldon,22," I wrote a fan letter to you when I was a child in Texas, and you sent this autographed picture back to me. Do you remember that?",6
30820,Arthur,22," I‰Ûªll, I‰Ûªll give you a hint. I have a bracelet with my own address on it.",6
30821,Sheldon,22," Well, anyway, um, you may find this hard to believe, but I didn‰Ûªt have any friends growing up.",6
30822,Arthur,22," No, I, I get that.",6
30823,Sheldon,22," But, um, I did have you. And every day at four o‰Ûªclock, you‰Ûªd come to my house on Channel 68, and we‰Ûªd do science together. If it hadn‰Ûªt been for you, well, who knows what would‰Ûªve become of me? You know? Instead of a world-class physicist, I could‰Ûªve wound up as a hobo. Or a surgeon.",6
30824,Leonard,22," I bet there are important discoveries being made every day because you inspired millions of kids to pursue science. In a way, their discoveries are your discoveries.",6
30825,Sheldon,22," Yeah, it‰Ûªs true. A generation of young scientists are standing on your shoulders.",6
30826,Arthur,22," Well, thank, thank you, guys. That, that, that means a lot.",6
30827,Leonard,22, It‰Ûªs important you know how much you mean to us.,6
30828,Arthur,22, Uh-oh.,6
30829,Penny,22," Arthur, are you okay?",6
30830,Arthur,22, I‰Ûªm having a problem with my pacemaker.,6
30831,Leonard,22," I‰Ûªll, I‰Ûªll call for help.",6
30832,Penny,22, Any chance we could plug it into the potato?,6
30833,Arthur,22, No.,6
30834,Scene,22, The telescope lab. Raj‰Ûªs phone rings.,6
30835,Raj,22," Hello? What do you mean, you found my dog? She‰Ûªs with my friends. Is she okay? Oh, thank you. Uh, just text me your address, I‰Ûªm on my way. Oh, and if she‰Ûªs hungry, go ahead and feed her. But do not give her anything starchy. She‰Ûªs having risotto for dinner.",6
30836,Scene,22, The apartment.,6
30837,Paramedic,22," Your vitals are stable, but let‰Ûªs take you in for some tests just to be safe.",6
30838,Leonard,22, You want one of us to go with you in the ambulance?,6
30839,Sheldon,22, I‰Ûªll do it.,6
30840,Arthur,22," He‰Ûªs not a relative, he‰Ûªs not allowed, right?",6
30841,Paramedic,22," No, that‰Ûªs not a rule. He can go.",6
30842,Sheldon,22," Oh, yeah.",6
30843,Arthur,22, I can‰Ûªt catch a break today.,6
30844,Penny,22, We‰Ûªll pack up your stuff and meet you at the hospital.,6
30845,Leonard,22, I‰Ûªm sorry things turned out this way.,6
30846,Arthur,22," Well, at, at this point, I‰Ûªm just glad someone‰Ûªs carrying me down the stairs.",6
30847,Sheldon,22," Met my childhood hero, now I get to ride in an ambulance. Boy, if we can get him to do that calendar, this‰Ûªll be the best day ever.",6
30848,Scene,22, Howard and Bernadette‰Ûªs apartment.,6
30849,Bernadette,22, Can‰Ûªt believe we lost her. What was I thinking? I‰Ûªd be a terrible mom.,6
30850,Howard,22," Well, maybe with the first one. But kids are like pancakes. The first one‰Ûªs always a throwaway. How‰Ûªs this look?",6
30851,Bernadette,22, It‰Ûªs fine. Where‰Ûªd you get that picture of her?,6
30852,Howard,22," It‰Ûªs not her. I just googled foo-foo little dogs. (Skype tone) It‰Ûªs Raj. Stay quiet. Hey, bad timing. Bernadette just took Cinnamon out for a walk.",6
30853,Raj,22, Hmm. Interesting. Did they take a walk down Liars‰Ûª Lane?,6
30854,Howard,22, What?,6
30855,Raj,22," A lane frequented by liars. Like you, you big liar.",6
30856,Howard,22, You have her?,6
30857,Bernadette,22," Oh, thank God she‰Ûªs okay.",6
30858,Raj,22," Well, I trusted you, and you let me down. The poor thing‰Ûªs been shaking for hours.",6
30859,Howard,22, I‰Ûªm really sorry.,6
30860,Bernadette,22," Hang on, you‰Ûªve had her for hours?",6
30861,Raj,22," Yes. I picked her up, and then we both went for massages to try and calm down. And then we got Pinkberry.",6
30862,Bernadette,22," So you knew she was okay, and you couldn‰Ûªt pick up the phone to tell us?",6
30863,Raj,22," Well, I, I thought about‰Û_",6
30864,Bernadette,22," Don‰Ûªt well me, mister. We‰Ûªve been worried sick. She could have been dead for all we knew. You should be ashamed of yourself.",6
30865,Raj,22," Sorry. I, I just‰Û_",6
30866,Bernadette,22, Sorry‰Ûªs not good enough. Maybe you need to take some time and think about what you‰Ûªve done.,6
30867,Howard,22, Nice guilt trip. You are gonna be an amazing mom.,6

30870,Arthur,22," Thank you, Sheldon. That, that was very nice.",6
30871,Sheldon,22, Want me to sing it again?,6
30872,Arthur,22," No. The fourth, the fourth time was, was the charm.",6
30873,Sheldon,22," There anything I can get for you? Some apple juice? Uh, some Jell-O?",6
30874,Arthur,22," No. No, thank you. But I, I do, I do have a favour to, to ask.",6
30875,Sheldon,22, Name it.,6
30876,Arthur,22," Well, I‰Ûªm, I‰Ûªm booked to do a children‰Ûªs party tomorrow, and, um, frankly I, you know, I, I don‰Ûªt feel up to it.",6
30877,Sheldon,22," Oh, you‰Ûªre not. You look awful.",6
30878,Arthur,22," Thank you. Anyway, uh, I mean, you know my act better than anybody. I was, I was hoping that maybe, you know, maybe you‰Ûªd fill in for me.",6
30879,Sheldon,22, Are you saying that you want me to be Professor Proton?,6
30880,Arthur,22, Yeah.,6
30881,Sheldon,22," Oh, my. What an honour. Oh, this is like being asked to ascend Mount Olympus and dine with the gods.",6
30882,Arthur,22, Or a Korean family in Alhambra.,6
30883,Sheldon,22," But they‰Ûªll know I‰Ûªm not you. Should I call myself Professor Proton, Jr.?",6
30884,Arthur,22, Sounds great.,6
30885,Sheldon,22," So, in a way it‰Ûªs like I‰Ûªm your son.",6
30886,Arthur,22," What, Whatever.",6
30887,Sheldon,22, Father.,6

30893,Amy,23," No rules? We‰Ûªre not gonna get drunk and have a six-way with the Blue Man Group, are we?",6
30894,Penny,23, No.,6
30895,Amy,23, So there are some rules.,6
30896,Bernadette,23," Fine. No husbands, no boyfriends, some rules.",6

30906,Amy,23, I got some old underwear I‰Ûªm gonna throw on stage at the Garth Brooks concert.,6
30907,Penny,23," I‰Ûªm sorry, why old?",6
30908,Amy,23," ‰Û÷Cause last time I saw him, I threw new ones and it got me nothing.",6

30919,Raj,23, I‰Ûªm actually glad Lucy had to work tonight. Saved me the awkward conversation about how I was gonna be hanging with my bros.,6
30920,Howard,23, Isn‰Ûªt every conversation you two have awkward?,6
30921,Raj,23," Painfully so. We have this rule on the phone that if no one talks for three minutes, you can just hang up. So into her.",6
30922,Howard,23, Ready whenever you guys are.,6
30923,Sheldon,23," Yeah, yeah, we‰Ûªll be right there. Leonard?",6
30924,Leonard,23, Yeah?,6
30925,Sheldon,23, I‰Ûªm not sure how I feel about Howard being dungeon master instead of you.,6
30926,Leonard,23," Oh, that‰Ûªs nice. But relax, sometimes change is good. Uh, you were worried about Zachary Quinto being the new Spock, but you wound up liking him.",6
30927,Sheldon,23," Oh, please. Every time the topic of change comes up, you throw Zachary Quinto in my face. I‰Ûªm upset the mailman has a new haircut, Zachary Quinto. I‰Ûªm upset that daylight saving time started, Zachary Quinto. I‰Ûªm upset daylight saving time ended, Zachary Quinto. I‰Ûªm saying this for the last time, Zachary Quinto was a weird, wonderful, unrepeatable event. So stop using him against me.",6
30928,Howard,23," Okay, here we go. You find yourselves in an overgrown old forest. Before you is a giant oak tree with a face on it that looks a lot like Nicolas Cage. He says, (Nicolas Cage voice) Travel with caution. These woods are home to the bones of many a fallen hero.",6
30929,Leonard,23," See, Howard‰Ûªs just as good a dungeon master as I am.",6
30930,Sheldon,23," As good? You just got pantsed in the schoolyard, four-eyes.",6
30931,Raj,23," Hey, come on, guys, focus. Um, uh, oh, mighty Nicolas Cage tree, we thank you for your warning, but we are brave warriors, and nothing short of death will keep us from our goal. (Text sound) Oh, Lucy‰Ûªs free after all. See ya.",6
30932,Leonard,23," Hey, hey, hey, you can‰Ûªt leave. We just started.",6
30933,Raj,23," You‰Ûªre right, I should finish the game. I take my plus-one long sword, stab myself in the face with it. I‰Ûªm dead, I‰Ûªve got a date with a girl. Bye.",6
30934,Howard,23," We‰Ûªll be fine, watch. Suddenly, a spectral shape rises from Koothrappali‰Ûªs bloody corpse, and says, (Raj voice) don‰Ûªt worry, buddies, ghost Raj will help guide you through the forest. (Nicolas Cage voice) Well, I‰Ûªm just a tree, but if I were you, I‰Ûªd listen to your ghost friend.",6
30935,Sheldon,23," Go on, give him your lunch money.",6
30936,Scene,23, A restaurant,6
30937,Raj,23, I‰Ûªm very happy you were able to hang out tonight.,6
30938,Lucy,23," Me, too.",6
30939,Raj,23," Not that it‰Ûªs up to you to make me happy. Uh, well, unless you find neediness sexy. In which case, you‰Ûªre about to have dinner with the hottest man on the planet.",6
30940,Lucy,23," Can I tell you something? I was so nervous about seeing you, before I left my apartment, I put roll-on antiperspirant all over my body.",6
30941,Raj,23, Really?,6
30942,Lucy,23," Yeah. If sweat starts squirting out the top of my head, you‰Ûªll know why.",6
30943,Raj,23," I, uh, I‰Ûªm sorry to put you through that.",6
30944,Lucy,23," Oh, it‰Ûªs okay. I‰Ûªve been trying to force myself to do things that make me scared.",6
30945,Raj,23, What else have you been thinking about doing?,6
30946,Lucy,23," Well, let‰Ûªs see. I‰Ûªd love to be able to tell the lady who cuts my hair that I don‰Ûªt like bangs.",6
30947,Raj,23, I like your bangs.,6
30948,Lucy,23," Oh, thanks, I like ‰Ûªem, too.",6
30949,Raj,23, What else?,6
30950,Lucy,23," Mmm, it‰Ûªs kind of a tie between sending food back in a restaurant and saying no to those kids who sell magazines door-to-door.",6
30951,Raj,23," Mm, yeah. Those are both toughies.",6
30952,Lucy,23, I know. I have a two-year subscription to Guns & Ammo.53,6
30953,Scene,23, The apartment.,6
30954,Leonard,23, I push my shoulder against the secret door to see if it gives way.,6
30955,Howard,23," Uh, it does. (Creaking sound)",6
30956,Sheldon,23," He does sound effects, too!",6
30957,Leonard,23," Hey, I always did sound effects. A-A swarm of bloodthirsty bats fly through the dungeon. (Clicking sounds) Uh, uh, they attack a nearby unicorn. (Strange howl)",6
30958,Sheldon,23," Okay, well, I have a sound effect for those sound effects. (Blows raspberry)",6
30959,Penny,23, Guess who?,6
30960,Howard,23, What are you doing back?,6
30961,Bernadette,23, That‰Ûªs an excellent question. Amy?,6
30962,Amy,23," Uh, well, when we were going through security, I got pulled out of line for a pat-down. The, uh, TSA agent got a little handsy. I may have broken her nose with my elbow.",6
30963,Bernadette,23," Long story short, she‰Ûªs on the No Fly List and we might have been followed here by a drone.",6
30964,Amy,23, I‰Ûªm sorry. I feel like such an idiot.,6
30965,Penny,23," Oh, it‰Ûªs not so bad. You lost money, you‰Ûªre filled with shame and you got groped by a stranger. I mean, that‰Ûªs Vegas, you nailed it.",6
30966,Amy,23, You guys enjoy your evening. I‰Ûªm gonna go before I ruin anybody else‰Ûªs weekend.,6
30967,Sheldon,23," Ah, that‰Ûªs my girl.",6
30968,Leonard,23," No, no, no, Amy, wait. I know it‰Ûªs not the night you had in mind, but why don‰Ûªt you guys stay and play with us? It‰Ûªll be fun.",6
30969,Sheldon,23," It would? Fun? Okay, three weeks ago you bought crunchy peanut butter, now you want the girls to play D&D? Do you have a drug problem?",6
30970,Leonard,23," What‰Ûªs the big deal? Raj bailed, so we could use some extra players.",6
30971,Sheldon,23," Well, I‰Ûªve just never played Dungeons & Dragons with girls before.",6
30972,Penny,23," Oh, don‰Ûªt worry, sweetie. No one has.",6
30973,Leonard,23," So, what do you say?",6
30974,Sheldon,23, I‰Ûªll leave it up to the dungeon master.,6
30975,Howard,23," A satanic fungus that looks suspiciously like Al Pacino rises from the forest floor and says, (Al Pacino voice) You‰Ûªre playing D&D. You‰Ûªre playing D&D. This whole apartment is playing D&D.",6
30976,Scene,23," Later, the same.",6
30977,Penny,23," Okay, who wants a drink?",6
30978,Sheldon,23," Yeah, we, now, Penny, we don‰Ûªt consume alcohol during Dungeons & Dragons. It impairs our judgment.",6
30979,Penny,23," Oh, this isn‰Ûªt alcohol. It‰Ûªs a magic potion that makes me like you.",6
30980,Leonard,23," Double potion, please.",6
30981,Howard,23," Okay, here we go. You find yourselves face-to-face with two hulking ogres. What are you doing in our dungeon? You shall die!",6
30982,Sheldon,23," Okay, literal goose bumps. Look.",6
30983,Howard,23, What do you do?,6
30984,Leonard,23, I draw my broadsword.,6
30985,Sheldon,23, I ready my quarter-staff.,6
30986,Penny,23, I drink my potion.,6
30987,Bernadette,23, I say we attack the big one.,6
30988,Penny,23," You know what? Give me the dice, I want to roll.",6
30989,Howard,23, The dungeon master‰Ûªs supposed to roll.,6
30990,Penny,23," Yeah, well I‰Ûªm supposed to be in Vegas throwing up on a shrimp buffet. Now give it. All right, what do I need?",6
30991,Howard,23," Uh, fifteen or higher.",6
30992,Penny,23," Fifteen‰Ûªs the point, the point is fifteen. Give the little lady some room, here it is, coming out. Sixteen! Yes! Oh, please tell me we‰Ûªre playing for money.",6
30993,Sheldon,23," Oh, even better than money. You gained experience points.",6
30994,Penny,23," More potion, please.",6
30995,Leonard,23, Yeah.,6
30996,Scene,23, The restaurant.,6
30997,Raj,23, How are your crab cakes?,6
30998,Lucy,23, Kind of funky.,6
30999,Raj,23, That‰Ûªs great.,6
31000,Lucy,23, It is? Does funky mean something different in India?,6
31001,Raj,23," No, no. Uh, you‰Ûªve always wanted to send your food back in a restaurant, here‰Ûªs your chance.",6
31002,Lucy,23," Mmm, it‰Ûªs okay. I just won‰Ûªt eat ‰Ûªem.",6
31003,Raj,23, Don‰Ûªt be ridiculous. Waiter?,6
31004,Waiter,23, Everything all right?,6
31005,Lucy,23," Uh, yeah. Everything all right with you?",6
31006,Waiter,23, Yes.,6
31007,Lucy,23," ‰Û÷Kay, thanks, bye.",6
31008,Raj,23, Hold on. Isn‰Ûªt there something else you wanted to tell him?,6
31009,Lucy,23," N-No, it, it‰Ûªs fine. Uh, He‰Ûªs from a different country, he doesn‰Ûªt understand our ways.",6
31010,Raj,23, Don‰Ûªt be silly. Just tell him.,6
31011,Lucy,23, I have to go to the bathroom. And it‰Ûªs not because the crab cakes are funky.,6
31012,Waiter,23, So you‰Ûªre okay here?,6
31013,Raj,23," Uh, yeah, sorry. She‰Ûªs just a little shy. The first time we met, she was so nervous, she climbed out a bathroom window to get away from me.",6
31014,Scene,23, Lucy climbs out of bathroom window to find a locked gate.,6
31015,Lucy,23," Uh-oh. (Dials phone) Hey, Raj. Funny story.",6
31016,Scene,23, The apartment.,6
31017,Bernadette,23," Come on, mama wants a pair of dead ogres.",6
31018,Howard,23," Seventeen, the larger ogre is dead. The-the other ogre says, you killed my brother, now Ogre Thanksgiving is ruined.",6
31019,Sheldon,23, That is amazing. He made me care about the ogre.,6
31020,Leonard,23," All right, Amy, there‰Ûªs one ogre left. Take him out.",6
31021,Amy,23, Okay.,6
31022,Penny,23, Pretend he‰Ûªs that TSA agent. Come on.,6
31023,Amy,23," Nineteen. Yes, this is turning out to be even better than Vegas.",6
31024,Penny,23," No, it‰Ûªs not.",6
31025,Scene,23, An alley behind the restaurant.,6
31026,Raj,23, Lucy?,6
31027,Lucy,23, Hey. Long time no see.,6
31028,Raj,23," You don‰Ûªt know me very well, but each time you crawl out a bathroom window to escape my company, it chips away at my masculinity.",6
31029,Lucy,23, I‰Ûªm sorry.,6
31030,Raj,23, Why would you leave like that?,6
31031,Lucy,23," You were pushing me. I clearly didn‰Ûªt want to send my food back, and you tried to make me do it anyway.",6
31032,Raj,23," Okay, if I upset you, then why didn‰Ûªt you just say something?",6
31033,Lucy,23," Well, how can I tell you I‰Ûªm upset if I can‰Ûªt tell the woman at Supercuts that my forehead‰Ûªs my best feature? It‰Ûªs scary.",6
31034,Raj,23," Yeah, well, I like you a lot, and that‰Ûªs scary for me. Mostly because you‰Ûªre a proven flight risk.",6
31035,Lucy,23, How could you like me a lot?,6
31036,Raj,23," Well, uh, for one thing, you have bigger emotional problems than I do, and I find that very attractive in a woman. I, I don‰Ûªt know. I just, I think you‰Ûªre wonderful.",6
31037,Lucy,23, I‰Ûªm sweating out of my head.,6
31038,Scene,23, The apartment. ,6
31039,Howard,23," The dragon falls from the sky, crashing into the volcano.",6
31040,Sheldon,23, Yay!,6
31041,Howard,23," But wait., he‰Ûªs not dead. He crawls out, spreads his wings and prepares to attack.",6
31042,Sheldon,23," Yeah, uh, wait. Doesn‰Ûªt he say something first? You know, maybe in the voice of a beloved celebrity?",6
31043,Howard,23," Fine. (Christopher Walken voice) You‰Ûªd think, after all these years, I‰Ûªd know not to fly over volcanoes. I‰Ûªm a freaking idiot.",6
31044,Sheldon,23, The dragon‰Ûªs Christopher Walken. That‰Ûªs perfect.,6
31045,Leonard,23," All right, Amy, it‰Ûªs your turn. We need one more hit. Finish him off.",6
31046,Amy,23, Here we go. Fifteen?,6
31047,Howard,23, It‰Ûªs a hit. The dragon collapses to the ground.,6
31048,Sheldon,23, Wait. Wait. And says?,6
31049,Howard,23, Mother? Is that you? Your little boy is coming home.,6
31050,Sheldon,23," Oh, I don‰Ûªt know about you guys, but I have been through the emotional wringer tonight.",6
31051,Bernadette,23," This may be the potion talking, but you are one fine-ass dungeon master.",6
31052,Howard,23," Oh, yeah? Well, when we get home, I‰Ûªm gonna take you on a whole different adventure.",6
31053,Sheldon,23, Another quest by Wolowitz? Count me in.,6
31054,Amy,23," Sheldon, they‰Ûªre talking about sex.",6
31055,Sheldon,23," Oh, then I‰Ûªm out.",6
31056,Penny,23," Ooh, I have an idea. Since it‰Ûªs not happening any time soon, why don‰Ûªt your character and your character do it in the game?",6
31057,Bernadette,23," Ooh! Come on, back me up here.",6
31058,Howard,23, Oh.,6
31059,Together,23, Ooh!,6
31060,Bernadette,23," Okay, I cast a love spell on Sheldon and Amy.",6
31061,Leonard,23," Ooh! Sorry, I thought you were gonna do that.",6
31062,Howard,23," The love spell takes effect. When Sheldon looks at Amy, she is the most beautiful half-orc he‰Ûªs ever seen, and he‰Ûªs overcome with a desire to rip her armour off and gaze fondly at her four hairy breasts. When Amy sees Sheldon, he looks, well, just like Sheldon, ‰Ûªcause apparently she‰Ûªs into that. What do you do?",6
31063,Amy,23, I don‰Ûªt like this.,6
31064,Sheldon,23, You see what happens when you let girls play D&D?,6
31065,Scene,23, Sheldon‰Ûªs bedroom. ,6
31066,Sheldon (off),23," (Knock, knock, knock) Amy. (Knock, knock, knock) Amy. (Knock, knock, knock) Amy.",6
31067,Amy,23, What?,6
31068,Sheldon,23, I‰Ûªve never knocked on my own door before. That was a wild ride.,6
31069,Amy,23, You don‰Ûªt have to come in here and cheer me up.,6
31070,Sheldon,23, Thank you. Would you go tell everyone else that? Because they sure think otherwise.,6
31071,Amy,23, I‰Ûªll tell you what they think. They think our relationship is a joke.,6
31072,Sheldon,23," Well, I don‰Ûªt think our relationship is a joke. I think ‰ÛÏa horse goes into a bar, bartender says, why the long face?‰Ûª, that‰Ûªs a joke. It‰Ûªs a good one, too, because a horse has a long face.",6
31073,Amy,23," Sheldon, are we ever going to have an intimate relationship?",6
31074,Sheldon,23," Oh, my. That‰Ûªs an uncomfortable topic. Amy, before I met you, I never had any interest in being intimate with anyone.",6
31075,Amy,23, And now?,6
31076,Sheldon,23, And now what?,6
31077,Amy,23, Do you have any interest now?,6
31078,Sheldon,23, I have not ruled it out.,6
31079,Amy,23, Wow. Talk dirty to me.,6
31080,Sheldon,23," I know it doesn‰Ûªt seem like it to you, but, for me, what we have is extremely intimate.",6
31081,Amy,23," I guess I know that. It‰Ûªs just, part of me wants more.",6
31082,Sheldon,23," More? I mean, look at us. It‰Ûªs only been three years, here we are in bed together.",6
31083,Amy,23, Come on. Let‰Ûªs go back out there.,6
31084,Sheldon,23," Well, no. Hold on. My Elven magic-user and your half-orc warrior did have a love spell cast on them. We wouldn‰Ûªt really be playing the game right if we didn‰Ûªt see that through.",6
31085,Amy,23, Okay.,6
31086,Sheldon,23," I believe that, uh, we just killed a dragon. While the others pillage the corpse, I lead you to a secluded area where I attempt to remove your leather armour. (Rolls dice) It comes off.",6
31087,Amy,23, Oh.,6
31088,Sheldon,23, What do you do?,6
31089,Amy,23, I kiss you on the lips.,6
31090,Sheldon,23, I kiss you back on the (Rolls dice) lips as well. Your turn.,6
31091,Amy,23, I remove your armour. What do you do?,6
31092,Sheldon,23, I erotically caress your (Rolls dice) nose.,6
31093,Amy,23, Keep rolling.,6
31094,Scene,23, Outside Sheldon‰Ûªs bedroom.,6
31095,Leonard,23," Hey, you guys have been in there for a while. You doing okay?",6
31096,Sheldon (off),23," We‰Ûªre fine, thank you.",6
31097,Penny,23," Okay, we just want to say, we feel really bad about‰Û_",6
31098,Amy,23, Go away! Sheldon is nibbling on my (sound of dice) 14! Yes!,6
31099,Scene,24, The cafeteria.,6
31100,Raj,24," So, anyway, last night on video chat, I spent, like, twenty minutes just staring into Lucy‰Ûªs eyes.",6
31101,Leonard,24," Oh, that sounds romantic.",6
31102,Raj,24, It was until I realized the screen had frozen. Still one of my top three dates of all time.,6
31103,Leonard,24," So, are we ever gonna hang out with this girl?",6
31104,Raj,24," I‰Ûªd love that, but she‰Ûªs not really comfortable around people.",6
31105,Sheldon,24," Yeah, I used to be uncomfortable around people, but then I learned a trick. I pretend everyone I meet is a beloved character from Star Trek.",6
31106,Leonard,24, How‰Ûªs that been working for you?,6
31107,Sheldon,24," Oh, like a charm, unnamed crewman in a red shirt.",6
31108,Howard,24," Leonard, I may have gotten you a job.",6
31109,Leonard,24, I have a job.,6
31110,Sheldon,24," Yes, he does. He caters to my every whim.",6
31111,Howard,24," No, in a couple of weeks, Stephen Hawking‰Ûªs team is sending an expedition to the North Sea to test hydrodynamic simulations of black holes. One of their experimental physicists dropped out, and I recommended you.",6
31112,Leonard,24," Well, do you really think I have a shot?",6
31113,Howard,24," Yeah, I‰Ûªve worked with Hawking. I talked you up. He knows your research. I think this could happen.",6
31114,Leonard,24," He knows, wow.",6
31115,Sheldon,24," Well, now, but do you think that‰Ûªs a good idea? Uh, you know Star Trek. Should a guy with no name and a red shirt really go on an expedition?",6
31116,Raj,24," Hey, don‰Ûªt discourage him. This is a fantastic opportunity.",6
31117,Sheldon,24," No one asked you, Uhura.",6
31118,Scene,24, Leonard‰Ûªs car.,6
31119,Sheldon,24, Would you like to hear a classic Sheldon Cooper factoid?,6
31120,Leonard,24, What do you think?,6
31121,Sheldon,24, Great. I‰Ûªve been doing some reading about vehicular safety. Did you know that the highest number of drowning accidents happen on or around boats?,6
31122,Leonard,24, Interesting that you would bring that up when I might go work on a boat.,6
31123,Sheldon,24," Well, that‰Ûªs the thing about factoids, they‰Ûªre interesting.",6
31124,Leonard,24, I know what you‰Ûªre doing. You don‰Ûªt want me going on this research trip because you‰Ûªre afraid to be alone.,6
31125,Sheldon,24," I‰Ûªm not afraid to be alone. On land. On the sea, it would be terrifying. Because of all the drowning.",6
31126,Leonard,24, Sheldon.,6
31127,Sheldon,24," Fine, no more drowning talk. I‰Ûªll change the subject. Oh. Who do you think would win in a fight, you or a shark?",6
31128,Leonard,24," Look, I appreciate your signature blend of concern for me and incredible selfishness. If I get the chance to do this, there is nothing you can say that‰Ûªs going to stop me.",6
31129,Sheldon,24," Very well. Things between you and Penny have never been better. I hope four months apart doesn‰Ûªt change anything. I should have opened with that, huh?",6
31130,Scene,24, Raj‰Ûªs apartment. Lucy is looking through Raj‰Ûªs telescope.,6
31131,Raj,24," If you look carefully at Venus, you should be able to see the International Space Station pass by.",6
31132,Lucy,24, Wow. Your friend was actually up there?,6
31133,Raj,24, Yeah. He brought me back a T-shirt that said My Friend Went to the Space Station and All I Got Was This Lousy T-Shirt,6
31134,Lucy,24, Did he take the T-shirt to space?,6
31135,Raj,24," Nope. It‰Ûªs exactly as lousy as advertised. Speaking of friends, they have been asking to meet you. I was thinking maybe we could all hang out sometime?",6
31136,Lucy,24, I don‰Ûªt know. How many are there?,6
31137,Raj,24," Let‰Ûªs see. Six. That‰Ûªs pretty cool, I have six friends. Kind of like Sinatra.",6
31138,Lucy,24," Six strangers? That‰Ûªs a lot of pressure. Staring at me, asking me personal questions. Like, what do you do? Where are you from? Why did you lock yourself in the bathroom?",6
31139,Raj,24," Okay, how about you just dip your toe in and meet one of them?",6
31140,Lucy,24, Will you be there?,6
31141,Raj,24, Of course.,6
31142,Lucy,24," Well, that‰Ûªs two. Three if you count me. Oh, this is getting out of hand.",6
31143,Scene,24, Penny‰Ûªs apartment. ,6
31144,Penny,24," So, then, during my afternoon shift, I spilled an entire tray of drinks on myself.",6
31145,Leonard,24," Oh, that‰Ûªs awful.",6
31146,Penny,24," Not really. My shirt was soaking wet. I got, like, the biggest tip of my life.",6
31147,Leonard,24," So, listen, do you remember when I said the similarities of the equations of general relativity and hydrodynamics suggest you could find the equivalent of Unruh radiation in a large body of water?",6
31148,Penny,24, I thought I said that to you.,6
31149,Leonard,24," Anyway, Stephen Hawking‰Ûªs team is looking into that, and I‰Ûªve been invited to join them.",6
31150,Penny,24," Wow, Hawking. Good for you.",6
31151,Leonard,24," Well, it is. Just, you know, I‰Ûªd be gone for a while.",6
31152,Penny,24," Well, how long?",6
31153,Leonard,24," Three, four months.",6
31154,Penny,24, Whoa. When would you leave?,6
31155,Leonard,24, Couple of weeks.,6
31156,Penny,24," Wow. Oh, okay, well, I‰Ûªll just come visit you.",6
31157,Leonard,24," That‰Ûªs the thing, you can‰Ûªt. I‰Ûªll be on a ship in the North Sea.",6
31158,Penny,24, On a ship? Aren‰Ûªt they afraid Hawking will just roll overboard?,6
31159,Leonard,24," Uh, he‰Ûªs not gonna be there. He‰Ûªs just sending a team to research his theory.",6
31160,Penny,24," Oh, sure. Like when you send me to kill spiders in your bathtub. Wow. Okay. Four months.",6
31161,Leonard,24," Yeah. And I‰Ûªm a little worried because things between us have been so great, and I‰Ûªd hate to do anything that screws that up.",6
31162,Penny,24," Oh, sweetie, if you‰Ûªre gonna screw things up, it‰Ûªs gonna be while you‰Ûªre here, not while you‰Ûªre away. No. I mean, look, you have to go. It sounds like an amazing opportunity. And I‰Ûªm just basing that on how much I didn‰Ûªt understand what you said about it.",6
31163,Leonard,24, Okay. I‰Ûªll confirm the travel arrangements in the morning.,6
31164,Penny,24, Okay. Good.,6
31165,Leonard,24, I do have to ask you one favour.,6
31166,Penny,24, Sure.,6
31167,Leonard,24, Sheldon‰Ûªs nervous about me leaving. Just keep an eye on him while I‰Ûªm gone.,6
31168,Penny,24," Oh, I don‰Ûªt know. Remember what happened when I took care of your goldfish?",6
31169,Leonard,24," Well, flush Sheldon down the toilet and get me a new one.",6
31170,Scene,24, The apartment. ,6
31171,Leonard,24," Really, you guys do not need to throw me a going-away party.",6
31172,Howard,24, Are you kidding me? How often can you say bon voyage to somebody when they‰Ûªre actually going on a voyage?,6
31173,Amy,24," Hello, Rajesh.",6
31174,Howard (in Raj accent),24," Hello, Amy. Nice to see you. What can I say? It‰Ûªs funnier with the accent.",6
31175,Leonard,24," There‰Ûªs beer in the fridge. Anyway, you guys really don‰Ûªt need to make a big deal.",6
31176,Sheldon,24," Leonard, you‰Ûªre being selfish. We need to give you a proper send-off so we‰Ûªll have closure when you die at sea and crabs eat your face.",6
31177,Penny,24," Sheldon, sweetie, shut up.",6
31178,Bernadette,24," You know, one of the things that helped me get through Howard being in space for so long was getting married before he left.",6
31179,Penny,24," Bernadette, sweetie, shut up.",6
31180,Raj,24, Okay. I have a request to make.,6
31181,Amy,24, And now he can talk. I want to cut open your brain and see what the heck‰Ûªs going on in there.,6
31182,Raj,24," The only person allowed inside this head is Dr. Phil. Anyway, I, I spoke to my new lady friend about meeting you all, and she thought it would be easier for her to start with just one.",6
31183,Sheldon,24," Oh, gee, I don‰Ûªt know. My schedule‰Ûªs a little busy.",6
31184,Raj,24," Actually, I was thinking Leonard.",6
31185,Leonard,24," Oh. Thank you, Raj. I‰Ûªd be honoured.",6
31186,Howard,24, What the hell? I thought I was your best friend.,6
31187,Raj,24," You are, but you‰Ûªve got kind of a big personality, with your flashy clothes and your Woody Allen swagger.",6
31188,Penny,24," You know, maybe she‰Ûªd be more comfortable meeting a girl first.",6
31189,Raj,24, Good idea. Bernadette?,6
31190,Penny,24, What the hell?,6
31191,Raj,24," Well, you‰Ûªre very pretty. That could be intimidating to another woman.",6
31192,Penny,24," Oh, yeah.",6
31193,Bernadette,24," Hey, you don‰Ûªt think I‰Ûªm pretty enough to scare your girlfriend?",6
31194,Howard,24," Calm down, Bernie. You‰Ûªre very scary.",6
31195,Amy,24, It should be me.,6
31196,Raj,24, Why? So you can make jokes about cutting open my brain?,6
31197,Amy,24," A, that was not a joke, that was a sincere request. And B, more importantly, I was the outsider to this group, and I know how frightening that can be. But you guys took me in and made me feel loved, like I was family.",6
31198,Sheldon,24," Fine, I‰Ûªll do it.",6
31199,Scene,24, Raj‰Ûªs apartment.,6
31200,Amy,24," So, after I started dating Sheldon, I met Leonard, and then everybody else, and they‰Ûªve all been so wonderful to me.",6
31201,Lucy,24, That‰Ûªs really nice to hear.,6
31202,Amy,24," Maybe next week, we could all get together.",6
31203,Raj,24," Oh, Lucy, you don‰Ûªt have to answer that. Don‰Ûªt put her on the spot. She hates that. Am I right? Tell her how much you hate being put on the spot. Go ahead, tell her.",6
31204,Amy,24, Ignore him. He‰Ûªs a little nervous ‰Ûªcause he doesn‰Ûªt think I understand the severity of your social anxiety.,6
31205,Raj,24, What the? Are you crazy? You can‰Ûªt talk about social anxiety to someone who has social anxiety. It makes them socially anxious!,6
31206,Amy,24," Excuse me, but I‰Ûªm a neurobiologist. I think I‰Ûªm a little more qualified than you to understand what‰Ûªs not working in your girlfriend‰Ûªs brain!",6
31207,Raj,24," Don‰Ûªt call her my girlfriend. We haven‰Ûªt discussed whether or not we‰Ûªre girlfriend or boyfriend yet. Now that it‰Ûªs out there, are you my girlfriend? By the way, if you say no, I‰Ûªll never be happy again. Not to put you on the spot.",6
31208,Lucy,24, I think I have to go to the bathroom.,6
31209,Raj,24, We might as well go ahead and eat. She‰Ûªs not coming back anytime soon.,6
31210,Scene,24, A store.,6
31211,Sheldon,24," This is ridiculous, we‰Ûªre shopping for a party and this store doesn‰Ûªt even have a party section.",6
31212,Penny,24," Yeah, it does, and here we are.",6
31213,Sheldon,24," You know, I have to say, Penny, I don‰Ûªt understand why you of all people are encouraging Leonard to do this.",6
31214,Penny,24," Well, I‰Ûªm his girlfriend, of course I‰Ûªm gonna support him.",6
31215,Sheldon,24," Yeah, well, you‰Ûªre his girlfriend for now. You know, maybe you‰Ûªre not aware of this, but there is a rich tradition of men at sea finding comfort in each other‰Ûªs arms and britches.",6
31216,Penny,24," Honey, this is a big deal for Leonard, okay? He gets to work with Stephen Hawking. Who, by the way, will not be on the boat. I checked it out.",6
31217,Sheldon,24," It‰Ûªs not that big of an opportunity. And even if Hawking‰Ûªs theories are correct, all they prove is where the universe came from, why everything exists and what its ultimate end will be. I mean, me? I‰Ûªm interested in the big questions.",6
31218,Penny,24," Oh, my God, Sheldon the genius is jealous of Leonard.",6
31219,Sheldon,24, I‰Ûªm not jealous. I‰Ûªm just very unhappy that good things are happening for him and not happening for me.,6
31220,Penny,24," Look, sweetie, this is a natural thing to feel, okay? But just because good things are happening to Leonard doesn‰Ûªt take anything away from you. You know what? Let me tell you a little story. Once there was a girl who worked at the Cheesecake Factory, and she wasn‰Ûªt very good at her job.",6
31221,Sheldon,24, It was you.,6
31222,Penny,24," It wasn‰Ûªt me. But she was also an actress, and we were both up for the same part in a toothpaste commercial. She got it. Look, I was so jealous. But instead of ripping out her fake blonde hair‰Û_",6
31223,Sheldon,24, You ripped out your own fake blonde hair.,6
31224,Penny,24," I, looked her in the eye, smiled and said, I‰Ûªm happy for you. Because that‰Ûªs what friends do.",6
31225,Sheldon,24, They lie so they don‰Ûªt look petty.,6
31226,Penny,24, Yeah.,6
31227,Sheldon,24, How?,6
31228,Penny,24, Like this. I am so happy for you.,6
31229,Sheldon,24, Wow. No wonder you didn‰Ûªt get that toothpaste commercial.,6
31230,Scene,24, Raj‰Ûªs apartment.,6
31231,Raj (on skype),24, Hey.,6
31232,Lucy,24, Hi.,6
31233,Raj,24," I want to apologize for Amy last night. She was completely out of line. Are you, are you not speaking to me or did the screen freeze again?",6
31234,Lucy,24, Amy wasn‰Ûªt the problem.,6
31235,Raj,24," Okay. I know. It was me. I, I pushed too hard. I‰Ûªm sorry.",6
31236,Lucy,24, Thank you.,6
31237,Raj,24," You know, I, I‰Ûªve been thinking that maybe meeting somebody one-on-one is too intense, so Friday night, my friends are having a party.",6
31238,Lucy,24, A party?,6
31239,Raj,24," A little one. It‰Ûªs, it‰Ûªs a farewell for Leonard, so all the attention will be on him. If you wear something brown and sit on the couch, they won‰Ûªt even know you‰Ûªre there.",6
31240,Lucy,24, I‰Ûªm not sure.,6
31241,Raj,24," Oh, please?",6
31242,Lucy,24, Raj.,6
31243,Raj,24," Come on. Don‰Ûªt make me beg. And I‰Ûªm from India, so I know how to do it.",6
31244,Lucy,24, Okay.,6
31245,Raj,24," Yeah, thank you! This means a lot to me. My friends are like my family. Unless you don‰Ûªt like them, in which case, they‰Ûªre dead to me.",6
31246,Scene,24, The apartment. ,6
31247,Bernadette,24," So, have you ever spent a long time on a boat before?",6
31248,Leonard,24, Yeah.,6
31249,Bernadette,24, Are you referring to the time we got stuck on the Small World ride at Disneyland?,6
31250,Leonard,24, Yeah.,6
31251,Howard,24," I‰Ûªm proud of you, Leonard. Working out on the North Sea for months, that‰Ûªs really something.",6
31252,Leonard,24," I know. As far as science goes, this is the adventure of a lifetime.",6
31253,Howard,24, Maybe your lifetime. I went to space.,6
31254,Leonard,24, It‰Ûªs not a competition.,6
31255,Howard,24," You‰Ûªre right, you‰Ûªre right. I‰Ûªm really proud of you, and I‰Ûªm gonna miss you when you‰Ûªre gone. And space beats water.",6
31256,Amy,24," Rajesh, I thought Lucy was coming.",6
31257,Raj,24," She is. She‰Ûªs just running a little late. You know how it is, girls always fussing about their hair, their makeup. She‰Ûªll be here. Just give it a rest, okay?",6
31258,Sheldon,24," Um, can I have your attention, everyone? (Clinks glass) That‰Ûªs, uh, B-flat, for those who don‰Ûªt have perfect pitch. I would like to propose a toast to my best friend, Dr. Leonard Hofstadter. He has been presented with a wonderful opportunity, and I couldn‰Ûªt be happier for him.",6
31259,Leonard,24," Thank you, Sheldon. That must‰Ûªve been very hard for you to say.",6
31260,Sheldon,24," Well, I mean it. I‰Ûªm really happy for you. And that‰Ûªs how you get a toothpaste commercial. Cheers.",6
31261,Howard,24, Cheers.,6
31262,Penny,24, Cheers.,6
31263,Howard,24, It was really nice of you to try to be happy for Leonard.,6
31264,Sheldon,24, Thank you.,6
31265,Howard,24, It must‰Ûªve killed you when I went to space.,6
31266,Raj (Looking at phone),24," Oh, no.",6
31267,Howard,24," Buddy, you okay? Oh, man.",6
31268,Bernadette,24, What‰Ûªs going on?,6
31269,Raj,24," Uh, go ahead. Read it.",6
31270,Howard,24," Raj, I can‰Ûªt come to the party. This is all just too much for me. I don‰Ûªt think we should see each other any more. Sorry. Lucy.",6
31271,Raj,24, Excuse me.,6
31272,Penny,24," Raj, I‰Ûªm so sorry.",6
31273,Amy,24," Me, too.",6
31274,Sheldon,24, It did not kill me when you went to space. Monkeys went to space.,6
31275,Scene,24," Penny‰Ûªs car, outside the Airport.",6
31276,Penny,24," Well, here we are.",6
31277,Leonard,24, Yep. I‰Ûªm really gonna miss you.,6
31278,Penny,24," I‰Ûªm gonna miss you, too.",6
31279,Sheldon,24," Penny, we‰Ûªre in the red zone. The white zone is for loading and unloading. We‰Ûªre breaking the law.",6
31280,Penny,24," Okay, there‰Ûªs no space in the white zone, so‰Û_",6
31281,Leonard,24," Anyway, we can e-mail, and I think the phone connections are pretty good.",6
31282,Sheldon,24," All right, you have to get out of the car right now. I‰Ûªm not going to jail for you.",6
31283,Leonard,24, Would you just relax?,6
31284,Sheldon,24," Oh, I see a space in the white zone. Quick, circle the airport.",6
31285,Penny,24, Did you bring enough inhalers?,6
31286,Leonard,24, Yeah.,6
31287,Penny,24," And, uh, extra Dramamine? You remember what happened on It‰Ûªs a Small World.",6
31288,Leonard,24, I‰Ûªm covered.,6
31289,Penny,24, Okay.,6
31290,Sheldon,24," Oh, dear Lord, a police officer‰Ûªs glancing in our direction. We‰Ûªve been made.",6
31291,Leonard,24, Calm down. I‰Ûªm getting out. I have something I want to give you.,6
31292,Penny,24," Oh, Leonard.",6
31293,Sheldon,24," It‰Ûªs just a heart-shaped locket with a picture of Leonard‰Ûªs face in it. He got it at the mall on clearance. Now move, move, move.",6
31294,Penny,24, I love you.,6
31295,Leonard,24," I love you, too.",6
31296,Sheldon,24," Don‰Ûªt worry, Officer. They just love each other. We‰Ûªre not smuggling drugs.",6
31297,Scene,24, Raj‰Ûªs apartment. ,6
31298,Penny,24," Raj, it‰Ûªs Penny. Are you in there?",6
31299,Raj,24, Hang on.,6
31300,Penny,24, Hey. I‰Ûªm just coming back from the airport. I wanted to see how you‰Ûªre doing.,6
31301,Raj,24," That‰Ûªs, that‰Ûªs very nice of you. Uh, come, come. Come on in.",6
31302,Penny,24," Can‰Ûªt stay long. I left Sheldon in the car with the window cracked open. He‰Ûªs gonna go through that activity book in, like, 30 seconds, so‰Û_ Are you okay?",6
31303,Raj,24, No.,6
31304,Penny,24, Oh. I‰Ûªm so sorry.,6
31305,Raj,24," No. It‰Ûªs my fault. You know, I finally found someone who was right for me, and I, I drove her away.",6
31306,Penny,24," Oh, Raj.",6
31307,Raj,24," Penny, I, I miss her already.",6
31308,Penny,24," I know how you feel. I miss Leonard, too.",6
31309,Raj,24," What‰Ûªs like, what is wrong with me? Why, why can‰Ûªt I ever have love?",6
31310,Penny,24, You will.,6
31311,Raj,24," No, I, I won‰Ûªt. I‰Ûªm, I‰Ûªm unlovable.",6
31312,Penny,24, That‰Ûªs just the booze talking.,6
31313,Raj,24," No, it‰Ûªs not. I haven‰Ûªt had a drink since last night.",6
31314,Penny,24, You‰Ûªre talking to me.,6
31315,Raj,24, I am. And now I‰Ûªm crying for a whole different reason!,6
31316,Penny,24," Oh, me, too.",6
31317,Scene,24, Penny‰Ûªs apartment.,6
31318,Raj,24, So I guess what I‰Ûªm saying is I get where Lucy‰Ûªs coming from.,6
31319,Penny,24, That‰Ûªs great. Do you want some wine?,6
31320,Raj,24," Uh, no, water‰Ûªs fine. Anyhow, I‰Ûªve been thinking about it a lot and, and I totally see why Lucy did what she did. I pushed too hard. But you know what? If I back off and give her enough space, maybe there‰Ûªs still a future for us. Yeah, the funny thing about life is that, you know, sometimes‰Û_",6
31321,Amy,24, Does he ever shut up?,6
31322,Raj,24," ‰Û_ but then it turns good again, and that means it‰Ûªs better than if it had never been bad for a while. I know that now, thing‰Ûªs aren‰Ûªt good, they are in fact very very bad but at least my heart is starting to heal. Slowly but surely. And oh how I cried. It was like a little, uh, thunderstorm on my face. But I‰Ûªm a man, okay? So I need to pull myself together, pick up a pen and get it all out in my journal. I mean, it‰Ûªs not all bad, right? Having my heart broken has allowed me to finally speak in front of you, so, you know, a silver lining‰Û_.",6
31323,Scene,1," On the deck of a ship on the North Sea, in the middle of a storm. Leonard is on a sat-phone.",7
31324,Leonard,1," Sheldon, it‰Ûªs not a great time, what do you want?",7
31325,Sheldon (in the apartment),1," Hello to you, too. I‰Ûªm sorry, but this is important.",7
31326,Leonard,1, What is it?,7
31327,Sheldon,1," Back to the Future II was in the Back to the Future III case, and Back to the Future III was, get this, in the Back to the Future II case.",7
31328,Leonard,1, So?,7
31329,Sheldon,1," So, did you do that, or am I in the house with an intruder?",7
31330,Leonard,1," Sheldon, I got to go inside. It‰Ûªs getting rough out here.",7
31331,Sheldon,1," You‰Ûªre dodging the question, I knew it was you. What was that?",7
31332,Leonard,1, What was what?,7
31333,Sheldon,1," This isn‰Ûªt a very good connection, but it sounded like someone just released a kraken.",7
31334,Leonard,1," Okay, I‰Ûªm hanging up now. You know there‰Ûªs no such thing as a k‰Û_ (Leonard is attacked and dragged into the sea by a huge tentacle. Sheldon wakes up in bed.)",7
31335,Sheldon,1, No!,7
31336,Scene,1, Penny‰Ûªs apartment door.,7
31337,Sheldon,1," (Knock, knock, knock) Penny. (Knock, knock, knock) Penny. (Knock, knock, knock) Penny. ",7
31338,Penny,1, What‰Ûªs the matter?,7
31339,Sheldon,1," Um, well, I was worried that you might be missing Leonard. And that might be causing you to have bad dreams, like the kind you‰Ûªd get if you watched Clash of the Titans right before you went to bed.",7
31340,Penny,1," Sweetie, did you have a bad dream?",7
31341,Sheldon,1," To be honest, I did.",7
31342,Penny,1, Aw.,7
31343,Sheldon,1, Back to the Future II was in the Back to the Future III case. Leonard did it.,7
31344,Penny,1, Good night.,7
31345,Sheldon,1," No, wait. Perhaps I should sleep here so you don‰Ûªt miss Leonard as much, uh, ‰Ûªcause you‰Ûªre being kind of a baby about it.",7
31346,Penny,1, You know what? That would make me feel better. Thank you.,7
31347,Sheldon,1, You‰Ûªre welcome. Good night.,7
31348,Scene,1, The cafeteria. ,7
31349,Raj,1," I think you‰Ûªd be pleased to hear that this morning in the parking garage I saw this oil stain on the ground that was shaped just like my ex-girlfriend, Lucy, and I didn‰Ûªt get upset at all.",7
31350,Howard,1, I‰Ûªm proud of you.,7
31351,Raj,1," Well, you should be, ‰Ûªcause she was looking good.",7
31352,Sheldon,1," Dear Lord, you‰Ûªre an astronomer. Although you may have earthly woes, get your mind back on the stars. Gee, even the lowly dung beetle chooses to plot its course by using the Milky Way.",7
31353,Raj,1, Is that true?,7
31354,Sheldon,1," Everything I say is true. Now, of course, the dung beetle also enjoys eating faeces, living in faeces and making little balls out of faeces, so, you know, pick and choose which aspects of its lifestyle you want to embrace.",7
31355,Howard,1," Come on, you can talk to girls now. It shouldn‰Ûªt be hard for you to meet someone new.",7
31356,Raj,1," How can I meet someone new when everywhere I look, I see Lucy‰Ûªs face? Tell me you don‰Ûªt see her smile in the crust of this chicken pot pie.",7
31357,Howard,1," Oh, will you stop it. Now, listen to me, there‰Ûªs a welcome party for incoming post-docs tonight. Go to it and meet someone who isn‰Ûªt made of grease or pie.",7
31358,Raj,1, You think you‰Ûªre so cool because your wife is a person?,7
31359,Howard,1," Look, Bernie‰Ûªs at a neuroscience conference with Amy, I‰Ûªll go with you.",7
31360,Raj,1, You would do that for me?,7
31361,Howard,1, Of course. You‰Ûªre my friend. I want you to be happy.,7
31362,Raj,1," Thanks. Oh, Sheldon, since Amy‰Ûªs out of town, would you like to join us?",7
31363,Sheldon,1," I want you to be happy, too, but not enough to do anything about it.",7
31364,Scene,1, A hotel room.,7
31365,Bernadette (on phone),1," Howie, stop. I can‰Ûªt talk like that. Amy‰Ûªs right here.",7
31366,Amy (on phone),1," Sheldon, stop. For the last time, I will not bring home bed bugs. ",7
31367,Bernadette,1," The hotel‰Ûªs nice. There‰Ûªs a pool, a gym, the bar looks like fun. ",7
31368,Amy,1," Because I looked in the bed, and there are no bugs.",7
31369,Bernadette,1," Aw, I love you, too. If I don‰Ûªt talk to you before you go to sleep, I‰Ûªll meet you in dreamland.",7
31370,Amy,1," Good night. No, I will not consider sleeping in my garment bag.",7
31371,Scene,1, The apartment.,7
31372,Sheldon,1," Penny, did you ever wonder how Starfleet captains‰Û_",7
31373,Penny,1, No.,7
31374,Sheldon,1," Well, now that I‰Ûªve piqued your interest, welcome to the exciting world of 3D chess.",7
31375,Penny,1, Why don‰Ûªt you just admit you only want to play this game because you always play it with Leonard and you miss him?,7
31376,Sheldon,1, You overestimate his significance in my life.,7
31377,Penny,1, Mmm.,7
31378,Sheldon,1, Do I miss how he makes a face on my toaster waffle with syrup? No. Do I miss the way he fixes the zipper on my jacket when it gets stuck? I don‰Ûªt think so. Do I miss how we say good night to each other through the walls of our bedroom using Morse code? (Taps out No in morse code on the table),7
31379,Penny,1," Okay, I get it, I get it. You are an emotionless robot.",7
31380,Sheldon,1," Well, I try.",7
31381,Penny,1," All right, let‰Ûªs just get this stupid game over with.",7
31382,Sheldon,1, Great. I‰Ûªll go first.,7
31383,Penny,1, Okay.,7
31384,Sheldon,1," By the way, how are you with zippers?",7
31385,Penny,1, Why?,7
31386,Sheldon,1," Well, I really need to go to the bathroom, and this one‰Ûªs gone all cattywampus.",7
31387,Scene,1, The mixer party. ,7
31388,Raj,1," Wow, your work on jellyfish neural nets sounds so interesting. ",7
31389,Girl,1, It is. You can download my paper off the university server.,7
31390,Raj,1, I will. You can download my paper on the Van Allen Belts from the university server as well.,7
31391,Girl,1, I will.,7
31392,Raj,1, All right.,7
31393,Howard,1, How‰Ûªd it go?,7
31394,Raj,1," Well, if you like dry, factual statements interspersed with painful moments of silence, it was bananas.",7
31395,Howard,1, Check it out. Mrs. Davis from Human Resources is here. She‰Ûªs probably on the lookout for sexual harassment.,7
31396,Raj,1," Oh, great. There go my chances of being sexually harassed.",7
31397,Howard,1," I heard her husband left her for a hot, young undergrad.",7
31398,Raj,1," That‰Ûªs so much better than the old, ugly ones.",7
31399,Mrs Davis,1," Mr. Wolowitz, Dr. Koothrappali. ",7
31400,Howard,1," Mrs. Davis, nice to see you. ",7
31401,Raj,1," You know, I recently read a fascinating article on infidelity among penguins.",7
31402,Mrs Davis,1, Okay.,7
31403,Raj,1," So if the fact that your husband left you makes you feel unattractive, just remember, penguins get cheated on, and they‰Ûªre adorable.",7
31404,Howard,1, It was better when you couldn‰Ûªt talk to women.,7
31405,Scene,1, The hotel bar.,7
31406,Bernadette,1, I was thinking of going to the lecture on posterior cingulate cortex lesions in the formation of autobiographical memory.,7
31407,Amy,1," Oh, brain lesions are fascinating. Unless they‰Ûªre yours, then they‰Ûªre a drag.",7
31408,Bernadette,1, To the advancement of science.,7
31409,Amy,1, And to the sick and dying who make it possible.,7
31410,Bernadette,1," This is fun, we never really get to talk shop with Penny around. We usually just end up talking about boys.",7
31411,Amy,1," Which is fine, but it‰Ûªs nice to mix it up with a little intellectual conversation.",7
31412,Waiter,1, From the two gentlemen at the bar.,7
31413,Amy,1," Oh, my gosh, boys bought us drinks, boys bought us drinks. Thank you, thank you, thank you so much.",7
31414,Bernadette,1, Be cool.,7
31415,Amy,1," You be cool. Guys are hitting on us, and not just to get to Penny.",7
31416,Bernadette,1, You‰Ûªre right. Thank you.,7
31417,Scene,1, The apartment.,7
31418,Sheldon,1, Ooh. Bad move.,7
31419,Penny,1, Really? Why?,7
31420,Sheldon,1, My queen can now take your rook from below.,7
31421,Penny,1," So that means I lose, right? It‰Ûªs over?",7
31422,Sheldon,1," If I make this move, but I won‰Ûªt because we‰Ûªre having too much fun.",7
31423,Penny,1," Okay, let‰Ûªs take a break. ",7
31424,Sheldon,1, We‰Ûªre all out of alcohol.,7
31425,Penny,1," I wasn‰Ûªt going to get alcohol. Gosh, I wonder what Leonard‰Ûªs doing right now. I miss him so much.",7
31426,Sheldon,1," Well, if you‰Ûªd like, we could call him. I mean that you could call him. As I‰Ûªve explained, the absence of my friends does not cause me pain. As rock and roll bad boy Paul Simon once said, I am a rock, I am an i-i-i-island.",7
31427,Penny,1, I‰Ûªm calling him.,7
31428,Sheldon,1," Oh, goodie, put him on speaker phone.",7
31429,"Leonard (on board boat, at a party, dancing)",1," Excuse me, ladies, my pants are buzzing. North Sea, how can I kelp you?",7
31430,Penny,1, Leonard?,7
31431,Leonard,1," Penny? Hey, it‰Ûªs Penny. Everybody say hi to Penny.",7
31432,Everybody,1," Hi, Penny!",7
31433,Penny,1," Wow, it sounds like you‰Ûªre having a good time.",7
31434,Leonard,1, Best time of my life. ,7
31435,Sheldon,1, Isn‰Ûªt it five thirty in the morning there?,7
31436,Leonard,1," Is it? Hey, everybody, it‰Ûªs five thirty in the morning!",7
31437,Penny,1," Uh, okay, well, we were just calling you because we were missing you.",7
31438,Random voice,1, Iceberg!,7
31439,Leonard,1," Uh-oh, hang on.",7
31440,Sheldon,1, Are you in danger?,7
31441,Leonard,1," No, it‰Ûªs a drinking game. Whenever we see an iceberg, we take a shot!",7
31442,Everybody,1, Berg! Berg! Berg! Berg! Berg! Berg!,7
31443,Penny,1," Leonard, Leonard? I cannot believe we were missing that jerk.",7
31444,Sheldon,1, You were.,7
31445,Scene,1, The hotel bar.,7
31446,Amy,1, So what happened? How‰Ûªd it go?,7
31447,Bernadette,1, It‰Ûªs fine. I thanked them again and let them know we‰Ûªre not available.,7
31448,Amy,1, So I can drink this without having to give up the goodies?,7
31449,Bernadette,1," Yes, it‰Ûªs all cool. Although, if you wanted to talk to one of them, no one would blame you.",7
31450,Amy,1, And why would no one blame me?,7
31451,Bernadette,1, I don‰Ûªt know what I‰Ûªm saying.,7
31452,Amy,1," Well, it sounds like you‰Ûªre saying that I could do better than Sheldon.",7
31453,Bernadette,1," Boy, these drinks are strong. Hoo, mama, I‰Ûªm gonna be huggin‰Ûª the toilet tonight.",7
31454,Amy,1," No, tell me, I want to know what you meant by that.",7
31455,Bernadette,1," I just meant that you‰Ûªre not married and your boyfriend‰Ûªs kind of, Sheldon.",7
31456,Amy,1, And your husband is extremely Howard. What‰Ûªs your point?,7
31457,Bernadette,1, Sorry. I have no point. That was a stupid thing to say. Can we please just go back to having a nice time?,7
31458,Amy,1," We could, but unfortunately my brain is lesion-free and I remember that rotten thing you just said about my sweet baboo.",7
31459,Bernadette,1, Come on. I apologize. Can we please just let it go?,7
31460,Amy,1, Sure.,7
31461,Bernadette,1, Thanks.,7
31462,Amy,1, Your husband‰Ûªs weird and his clothes are ridiculous.,7
31463,Scene,1, The apartment.,7
31464,Penny,1, I can‰Ûªt believe it. All this time I‰Ûªve been doing nothing but sit around and miss that guy. And you know what the worst part is?,7
31465,Sheldon,1, That you‰Ûªre having to process your emotional pain without vodka?,7
31466,Penny,1, No. Yeah. But you know what the second-worst part is? He does not miss me at all.,7
31467,Sheldon,1, Allow me to comfort you. At least you‰Ûªve got your health.,7
31468,Penny,1," Really? That, that‰Ûªs it? That‰Ûªs comforting?",7
31469,Sheldon,1," Um, uh, in a hundred years, you‰Ûªll both be dead and it won‰Ûªt matter?",7
31470,Penny,1," No. Come on, you‰Ûªre supposed to say, of course he misses you, the only reason he‰Ûªs partying is to cover up his pain.",7
31471,Sheldon,1," Oh, no, I don‰Ûªt think that‰Ûªs true at all.",7
31472,Penny,1, This is ridiculous. Why am I upset just because he‰Ûªs off having a good time?,7
31473,Sheldon,1," Well, perhaps you‰Ûªre obsessively picturing him engaged in drunken coitus with another woman. Is that it? Did I get it right?",7
31474,Penny,1," Okay, that, that‰Ûªs great. You can stop trying to make me feel better now.",7
31475,Sheldon,1," Actually, I can‰Ûªt. Before Leonard left, he made me promise that I‰Ûªd take care of you.",7
31476,Penny,1, He did?,7
31477,Sheldon,1, Yes.,7
31478,Penny,1," Oh, that‰Ûªs really sweet.",7
31479,Sheldon,1," Plus, if I do a good job, he said he‰Ûªd bring me back a sailor‰Ûªs cap.",7
31480,Penny,1," Well, now I miss him even more.",7
31481,Sheldon,1," Well, if it‰Ûªs any consolation, I‰Ûªm sure Leonard‰Ûªs tormented every moment he‰Ûªs away from your warm embrace and cherry lips.",7
31482,Penny,1, Thanks.,7
31483,Sheldon,1," Oh, seriously?",7
31484,Scene,1, The mixer.,7
31485,Raj,1," Uh, excuse me, Mrs. Davis?",7
31486,Mrs Davis,1, What?,7
31487,Raj,1," I‰Ûªd like to apologize for being insensitive. And for possibly making penguins seem like jerks, because 99% of them are stand-up guys.",7
31488,Mrs Davis,1, Forget about it.,7
31489,Raj,1," You know, you, you and I, you and I have a lot in common.",7
31490,Mrs Davis,1, Is that right?,7
31491,Raj,1," Oh, yes, I, I too am in the throes of heartbreak. Okay, fine, I‰Ûªll tell you about it.",7
31492,Scene,1, The apartment.,7
31493,Sheldon,1, Here is a hot beverage to comfort you. It‰Ûªs in a to-go cup. Make of that what you will.,7
31494,Penny,1, Come on. It‰Ûªs still early. Let‰Ûªs do something.,7
31495,Sheldon,1," Well, I have been toying around with an idea for 4D chess.",7
31496,Penny,1, How about we just talk?,7
31497,Sheldon,1, All right. In 4D chess‰Û_,7
31498,Penny,1," No. Come on, let‰Ûªs talk about our lives. Tell me something about you I don‰Ûªt know.",7
31499,Sheldon,1, I own nine pairs of pants.,7
31500,Penny,1," Okay, that, that‰Ûªs a good start, but I was thinking maybe something a little more personal.",7
31501,Sheldon,1, I see. I own nine pairs of underpants.,7
31502,Penny,1, How about I go first?,7
31503,Sheldon,1," But I don‰Ûªt want to know how many underpants you own. Although, based on the floor of your bedroom, I‰Ûªd say it‰Ûªs a thousand.",7
31504,Penny,1," Okay, look, here‰Ûªs something people do not know about me. When I first moved out to L.A., I did a topless scene in a low-budget horror movie about a killer gorilla. Ugh! After I did it, I felt so ashamed. Thankfully, that thing never came out.",7
31505,Sheldon,1, I‰Ûªve seen that. Yeah. Serial Apeist. Howard found it online the day we met you.,7
31506,Penny,1," Oh, God.",7
31507,Sheldon,1," And it was literally the moment you walked out the door. But I see the type of personal revelations you‰Ûªre going for. Okay, here‰Ûªs one I thought I‰Ûªd take to the grave.",7
31508,Penny,1, Okay.,7
31509,Sheldon,1," Hmm. A while back, YouTube changed its user interface from a star-based rating system to a thumbs-up rating system. I tell people I‰Ûªm okay with it, but I‰Ûªm really not.",7
31510,Penny,1, That‰Ûªs your big revelation?,7
31511,Sheldon,1," Yes. Whew, I feel ten pounds lighter.",7
31512,Penny,1," Okay, you know what? I give up. I‰Ûªm going to bed.",7
31513,Sheldon,1, Here‰Ûªs something else you don‰Ûªt know about me. You just hurt my feelings.,7
31514,Penny,1, What did I do?,7
31515,Sheldon,1," I opened up and shared something deeply upsetting to me, and you treated it as if it were nothing.",7
31516,Penny,1," I, I didn‰Ûªt think it was a big deal.",7
31517,Sheldon,1, It is to me; that‰Ûªs the point.,7
31518,Penny,1," Sheldon, you are right. I‰Ûªm really sorry. I should‰Ûªve known better.",7
31519,Sheldon,1, Your apology is accepted.,7
31520,Penny,1, Thank you. How about a hug?,7
31521,Sheldon,1, How about a hearty handshake?,7
31522,Penny,1, Come on.,7
31523,Sheldon,1, Now I know how you felt getting mauled by that sex-crazed gorilla.,7
31524,Scene,1, The hotel room.,7
31525,Bernadette,1, Good night.,7
31526,Amy,1, Mm-hmm. It was rather flattering to have strangers send us drinks.,7
31527,Bernadette,1," Yeah, that felt nice.",7
31528,Amy,1, Maybe tomorrow morning we put on some hot pants and see if we can score us some free omelettes.,7
31529,Bernadette,1," So, hypothetically, if, if we were to have gone with them, which one would you have picked?",7
31530,Amy,1, I think I would have gone with the short one with the goofy haircut.,7
31531,Bernadette,1," Oh, good, ‰Ûªcause I liked the tall thin one. He seemed intelligent, kind of a loner, maybe a little sexually inexperienced, like I‰Ûªd have to teach him a thing or two.",7
31532,Amy,1," Not my guy. I caught him staring at my rack. It‰Ûªd be nice to be with a man who wants to know what‰Ûªs underneath my cardigan. FYI, it‰Ûªs another cardigan.",7
31533,Bernadette,1, Your short sexed-up guy kind of sounds like Howard.,7
31534,Amy,1, Your brainy virgin kind of sounds like Sheldon.,7
31535,Both,1, Good night.,7
31536,Scene,1, The mixer.,7
31537,Mrs Davis,1," All right, Dr. Koothrappali, it‰Ûªs been nice talking to you, but I need to go home and relieve my babysitter.",7
31538,Raj,1," Yeah, I can relate to being a single parent. I have a dog.",7
31539,Mrs Davis,1," Yeah, it‰Ûªs exactly the same thing. Good night.",7
31540,Raj,1," Mrs. Davis, I, uh, I must confess, I came here tonight in a futile attempt to pick up some lonely postdoc, but instead I got to connect with you at a human level. That‰Ûªs a much better evening. You‰Ûªre a lovely person.",7
31541,Mrs Davis,1, Are you hitting on me?,7
31542,Raj,1," No, no, no, that would be crazy. I mean, if I were hitting on you, you‰Ûªd know it ‰Ûªcause you‰Ûªd feel uncomfortable and a little sad for me.",7
31543,Mrs Davis,1," You‰Ûªre sweet. Good night, Dr. Koothrappali.",7
31544,Raj,1, Good night.,7
31545,Howard,1, Looks like she accepted your apology.,7
31546,Raj,1, And then some. I think we had a moment.,7
31547,Howard,1," Oh, please, you did not have a moment.",7
31548,Raj,1, Who died and made you king of moments?,7
31549,Howard,1," Okay, fine. Let‰Ûªs say there was a moment.",7
31550,Raj,1, There was.,7
31551,Howard,1," There wasn‰Ûªt. But, but even if there was, what are you gonna do about it?",7
31552,Raj,1," I will slowly seduce her until she falls helpless into my bed, hungry for the pleasure only I can give her.",7
31553,Howard,1, So nothing.,7
31554,Raj,1," No, not a thing.",7
31555,Scene,1, A bathroom shower.,7
31556,Penny (acting),1," Ah, I‰Ûªm so glad the police finally caught that psychotic genetically engineered ape.",7
31557,Leonard (on ship),1, That is my girlfriend. I swear to God.,7
31558,Everyone (on ship),1, Leonard! Leonard! Leonard! Leonard!,7
31559,Penny,1, Aaaaaaah!,7
31560,Scene,2, The stairwell,7
31561,Sheldon,2, And here‰Ûªs another interesting weather fact.,7
31562,Penny,2, Another? Great.,7
31563,Sheldon,2," Changes in jet streams can affect the speed at which the Earth rotates on its axis, so bad weather can actually make the day longer.",7
31564,Penny,2," Well, there must be a hell of a storm somewhere.",7
31565,Sheldon,2," Joke if you must, but you‰Ûªre going to miss these moments. With Leonard home in a few days, this was your last time driving me to the grocery store.",7
31566,Penny,2," You know, I will miss this.",7
31567,Sheldon,2," I‰Ûªll tell you what, if my apples are mealy, we‰Ûªll hit the produce section for one last crazy blowout. Heck, you can even push the cart. Please don‰Ûªt take my looking forward to Leonard‰Ûªs return as criticism of the job you‰Ûªve been doing in his absence.",7
31568,Penny,2, I won‰Ûªt.,7
31569,Sheldon,2, That criticism will come later in your report card.,7
31570,Penny,2," Yeah, I didn‰Ûªt stay for the detention, I‰Ûªm not gonna read the report card.",7
31571,Leonard (in Penny‰Ûªs apartment),2, Hello.,7
31572,Penny (screams),2, Leonard! Hi!,7
31573,Leonard,2, Keep your voice down.,7
31574,Penny,2," Oh, my God. You weren‰Ûªt supposed to be here till Sunday.",7
31575,Leonard,2," We finished the experiment early, so I thought I‰Ûªd come home and surprise you.",7
31576,Penny,2," Oh, my gosh, why are we whispering?",7
31577,Leonard,2," I didn‰Ûªt tell Sheldon, so we could have a few days alone.",7
31578,Penny,2," Oh, that is so romantic.",7
31579,Leonard,2," Uh, sure, that‰Ûªs why I did it.",7
31580,Penny,2," Oh, I just cannot believe you‰Ûªre here.",7
31581,Sheldon (off),2," Penny, it‰Ûªs your lucky day. Three of the eggs are clearly not jumbo. Grab your keys.",7
31582,Scene,2, The comic book store.,7
31583,Sheldon,2," Uh, Stuart, I was wondering if you could help me find something.",7
31584,Stuart,2," Happy to, unless it‰Ûªs hope or a reason to live.",7
31585,Sheldon,2," Oh, you make me laugh, sad clown. Anyhoo, Leonard will be back in a couple days and I need a welcome home gift for him. As he‰Ûªs been at sea, perhaps something with a nautical theme might be appropriate.",7
31586,Stuart,2," Okay, well, I don‰Ûªt know how much you want to spend, but I do have this pretty cool Aquaman statue.",7
31587,Sheldon,2," Aquaman? Oh, this isn‰Ûªt a gag gift, Stuart.",7
31588,Stuart,2," Yeah, just as well. It‰Ûªs a pretty rare piece. I‰Ûªd rather just sell it to a real collector.",7
31589,Sheldon,2, I‰Ûªm a real collector. How rare is it?,7
31590,Stuart,2," Oh, I shouldn‰Ûªt even have mentioned it. How about a Batman squirt gun?",7
31591,Sheldon,2, Don‰Ûªt try and trick me into buying something I don‰Ûªt want. Now let‰Ûªs talk Aquaman. ,7
31592,Howard,2," What were they thinking, putting Doctor Octopus‰Ûªs mind in Spider-Man‰Ûªs body?",7
31593,Raj,2," Well, I‰Ûªve been quite enjoying that. It combines all the superhero fun of Spider-Man with all the body-switching shenanigans of Freaky Friday. Both versions, original and Lohan.",7
31594,Raj,2," Hey, what‰Ûªs your problem?",7
31595,Howard,2," I‰Ûªm sorry, I‰Ûªve been kind of snippy lately. It‰Ûªs probably this stupid diet I‰Ûªm on.",7
31596,Raj,2, Why are you on a diet?,7
31597,Howard,2, I‰Ûªve put on a couple pounds. Had to buy these pants in the men‰Ûªs section.,7
31598,Raj,2," Well, we‰Ûªve all seen your mom. That Butterball turkey was bound to come home to roost.",7
31599,Sheldon,2, Twelve hundred dollars. That‰Ûªs my final offer.,7
31600,Stuart,2," All right, Sheldon, you win. I‰Ûªm sure Leonard is gonna love this.",7
31601,Sheldon,2," Oh, right, a present for Leonard. You better throw in that squirt gun.",7
31602,Stuart,2," Ooh, yeah, I don‰Ûªt know. This squirt gun, it‰Ûªs, uh, it‰Ûªs pretty rare.",7
31603,Sheldon,2, Oh.,7
31604,Scene,2, Penny‰Ûªs apartment. ,7
31605,Leonard,2, And this is me doing the Titanic pose on the boat.,7
31606,Penny,2, Ah.,7
31607,Leonard,2," And, oh, that‰Ûªs me getting rescued after I fell in.",7
31608,Penny,2," Oh. (Knock on door) Oh, that‰Ûªs the pizza.",7
31609,Leonard,2, Yep. Here‰Ûªs some money.,7
31610,Penny,2, Thank you.,7
31611,Leonard,2, And I‰Ûªm gonna hit the head. That‰Ûªs what us salty sea dogs say when we have to go pee-pee.,7
31612,Penny,2, Hey.,7
31613,Pizza guy,2, Twenty-two fifty.,7
31614,Penny,2," Okay, here‰Ûªs, uh, twenty-five. Keep the change.",7
31615,Pizza guy,2," Seriously? I just walked up, like, four flights of stairs.",7
31616,Penny,2," Oh. Okay. Well, here‰Ûªs, um, thirty something cents and a promise I won‰Ûªt call your boss and tell him you reek of marijuana.",7
31617,Sheldon,2," Oh, Penny, I see you‰Ûªve ordered pizza. I have Chinese food. ",7
31618,Penny,2, That‰Ûªs nice.,7
31619,Sheldon,2," Oh, that‰Ûªs a rather earthy cologne. My uncle used to wear that. Perhaps we can enjoy one last meal together before Leonard returns.",7
31620,Penny,2," Yeah, thanks, but I kind of feel like eating alone tonight, so‰Û_",7
31621,Sheldon,2," Are you sure? With your Italian pizza and my Chinese noodles, we could play Marco Polo. I mean, of course, a re-enactment of a meal in the life of Marco Polo the Venetian explorer, not Marco Polo the terrifying water sport.",7
31622,Penny,2," Uh, yeah, it sounds fun, but no thanks. (Toilet flushes) Have a good night!",7
31623,Sheldon,2," What, now, do you have company?",7
31624,Penny,2," No. No, no, no. You know what? The toilet‰Ûªs been doing that. I called the building manager, so‰Û_",7
31625,Sheldon,2," Oh, I can take a look at it.",7
31626,Penny,2, Well‰Û_,7
31627,Sheldon,2," I‰Ûªm quite familiar with plumbing. Not to brag, but I spent most of fifth grade with my head in a toilet.",7
31628,Penny,2," Yeah, no, no, no. You know what, Sheldon, it‰Ûªs okay. You don‰Ûªt have to go into the bathroom.",7
31629,Sheldon,2," That‰Ûªs curious. If there‰Ûªs no one here, why are there two glasses of wine on the table?",7
31630,Penny,2," Oh. Well, you know, I, I‰Ûªve got two hands and a bit of a drinking problem.",7
31631,Sheldon,2, Of course. Ask a silly question. ,7
31632,Penny,2, Oh. ,7
31633,Sheldon,2, That‰Ûªs odd.,7
31634,Penny,2," Um, what?",7
31635,Sheldon,2, There are takeout containers in the trash can.,7
31636,Penny,2, So? That‰Ûªs my dinner from last night.,7
31637,Sheldon,2, What‰Ûªs odd is they‰Ûªre in the trash can.,7
31638,Penny,2," Okay. Look, honey, I promise there‰Ûªs no one‰Ûªs here. I‰Û÷ve had a long day. I just want to have a quiet dinner by myself.",7
31639,Sheldon,2," Oh, very well. I‰Ûªm no stranger to enjoying the pleasures of solitude. Oh!",7
31640,Penny,2, What?,7
31641,Sheldon,2, Have you gotten Leonard a welcome-home gift yet?,7
31642,Penny,2, No.,7
31643,Sheldon,2," Oh, great. Do you want to go halfsies on a two hundred dollar squirt gun?",7
31644,Scene,2, Howard and Bernadette‰Ûªs apartment.,7
31645,Bernadette,2," Hi, honey.",7
31646,Howard,2, Hey.,7
31647,Bernadette,2, I made some brownies. You want one?,7
31648,Howard,2," You‰Ûªre kidding, right? I mean, you know I‰Ûªm trying to lose weight. God, I thought we were partners in this marriage.",7
31649,Bernadette,2," We are. Stop it. And for the last time, you‰Ûªre not fat.",7
31650,Howard,2," Really? Tell that to the bathroom scale, ‰Ûªcause one of you is lying.",7
31651,Bernadette,2," Fine, forget I asked. How was dinner at your mom‰Ûªs?",7
31652,Howard,2, Awful. I had to rub her ointment all over her again.,7
31653,Bernadette,2, Why can‰Ûªt she do it?,7
31654,Howard,2," ‰Û÷Cause we‰Ûªve got a deeply unhealthy relationship. Which reminds me, do you think you can get any samples of this from work? This was supposed to last her a month, but they didn‰Ûªt take into account the square footage of her back.",7
31655,Bernadette,2, Let me see. How long have you been putting this on her?,7
31656,Howard,2, I don‰Ûªt know. Few weeks. Why?,7
31657,Bernadette,2, This is really strong oestrogen cream. Please tell me you‰Ûªve been wearing gloves.,7
31658,Howard,2, Like these swollen sausages could fit in gloves.,7
31659,Bernadette,2," Howie, the oestrogen‰Ûªs getting absorbed by your skin. That‰Ûªs why you‰Ûªve been all bloated and moody and a giant pain in the ass. ",7
31660,Howard,2, You‰Ûªre full of oestrogen and you don‰Ûªt act like that.,7
31661,Bernadette,2, That‰Ûªs ‰Ûªcause I‰Ûªm a woman. I‰Ûªve had years of practice riding the dragon.,7
31662,Howard,2, Fine. I‰Ûªll wear gloves next time.,7
31663,Bernadette,2, It‰Ûªs still gonna take a few weeks for the hormones to leave your system.,7
31664,Howard,2, I feel so stupid. And fat.,7
31665,Bernadette,2," It‰Ûªs okay. You still look great to me. In fact, why don‰Ûªt we go in the bedroom and I‰Ûªll prove it to you?",7
31666,Howard,2," Sex? Really? I mean, that‰Ûªs just your solution to everything. ",7
31667,Scene,2, The apartment.,7
31668,Amy,2," Oh, and here‰Ûªs a fun thing. I worked it out so that there are two different words for spoon, planko and janko. Planko is a spoon with food, janko is a spoon without food. Janko is spelled with a silent ptang. Sheldon, you‰Ûªre not even listening to the rules of my made-up language.",7
31669,Sheldon,2," Yes, I am.",7
31670,Amy,2, Then what does tweepadock mean?,7
31671,Sheldon,2," Uh, elephant?",7
31672,Amy,2, Lucky guess.,7
31673,Sheldon,2, I‰Ûªm sorry. I‰Ûªm just distracted by something that happened over at Penny‰Ûªs.,7
31674,Amy,2, What happened?,7
31675,Sheldon,2, I fear Penny is being unfaithful to Leonard.,7
31676,Amy,2, What?,7
31677,Sheldon,2," She claimed to be alone when there was obviously someone else in her apartment. I have no choice but to assume the worst, given Leonard‰Ûªs lengthy sea voyage and her famously ravenous nether regions.",7
31678,Amy,2, I don‰Ûªt think Penny would cheat on Leonard.,7
31679,Sheldon,2," Oh, really? She and I once had a staring contest. She clapped really loud and made me blink. It‰Ûªs a small leap from there to sexual infidelity.",7
31680,Amy,2, You‰Ûªre being ridiculous.,7
31681,Sheldon,2," Amy, there were Chinese food containers in the trash can.",7
31682,Amy,2, Poor Leonard.,7
31683,Scene,2, Sheldon and Amy listening at Penny‰Ûªs door.,7
31684,Amy,2, Do you hear anything?,7
31685,Sheldon,2, I hear a woman‰Ûªs voice.,7
31686,Amy,2, Is it Penny?,7
31687,Sheldon,2," No, it‰Ûªs you. All right, I hear whispering and giggling. Now I think I hear kissing.",7
31688,Amy,2," Yeah, like you know what kissing sounds like.",7
31689,Sheldon,2," There‰Ûªs kissing in Star Trek, smarty-pants.",7
31690,Amy,2, Let me listen. Sounds like Leonard.,7
31691,Sheldon,2," Please. Why would Leonard come home early and waste his time kissing Penny when he could be hanging out with his best buddy? Yeah, that‰Ûªs it. I‰Ûªm catching her in the act. (Unlocks door)",7
31692,Amy,2," No, Sheldon, don‰Ûªt.",7
31693,Sheldon,2, Aha. ,7
31694,Penny,2, What the hell?,7
31695,Sheldon,2, Leonard?,7
31696,Penny,2," Sheldon, you cannot just barge in here like that. ",7
31697,Sheldon,2," Right. (Goes out.) (Knock, knock, knock) Penny. (Knock, knock, knock) Penny. (Knock, knock, knock) Penny. Are you going to answer the door or should I open it and say aha again?",7
31698,Scene,2, Penny‰Ûªs apartment. ,7
31699,Leonard,2," I‰Ûªm sorry, Sheldon. I should‰Ûªve told you I was back. I just wanted to have a couple days alone with Penny.",7
31700,Sheldon,2," Oh, no, I should apologize. Uh, I never realized to what extent our friendship was a burden to you.",7
31701,Leonard,2, That is not fair. I complain about what a burden it is at least once a month.,7
31702,Sheldon,2," Oh, no, no, let‰Ûªs not sugarcoat this. You find me finicky, pedantic and annoying.",7
31703,Penny,2," No, he doesn‰Ûªt.",7
31704,Leonard,2, I actually have used those exact words before. In that order.,7
31705,Sheldon,2," Well, Leonard, I think it‰Ûªs high time you and I address the tweepadock in the room.",7
31706,Leonard,2, The what?,7
31707,Sheldon,2, Amy?,7
31708,Amy,2, Please leave me out of this.,7
31709,Sheldon,2," Fine. Leonard, there‰Ûªs no need for you to pretend to like me anymore.",7
31710,Leonard,2," Come on, I said I was sorry.",7
31711,Sheldon,2," No, no, you save your apologies for after you‰Ûªve had disappointing coitus with Penny.",7
31712,Penny,2, It was fine.,7
31713,Leonard,2," Come on, this is silly. Hey, um, I brought you back a little present from my trip, huh? It‰Ûªs that sailor cap that you wanted. It‰Ûªs neat, huh?",7
31714,Sheldon,2, You honestly think you can buy back my friendship with a cheap souvenir?,7
31715,Leonard,2," I don‰Ûªt. I really don‰Ûªt. Just try it on. Oh, yeah.",7
31716,Amy,2," Hello, sailor.",7
31717,Penny,2," Ooh, now we‰Ûªre talking.",7
31718,Sheldon,2," Excuse me. This changes nothing. Except the Halloween costume I‰Ûªm wearing this year. Amy, you‰Ûªre going to be Olive Oyl. Lay off the doughnuts.",7
31719,Scene,2, Howard and Bernadette‰Ûªs apartment.,7
31720,Howard,2, Thanks for coming over.,7
31721,Raj,2," No problem. Ooh, you made little sandwiches.",7
31722,Howard,2," Yeah, that‰Ûªs cucumber and cream cheese. That‰Ûªs turkey and loganberry. And don‰Ûªt tell my hips, but I‰Ûªm warming up a brie in the oven.",7
31723,Raj,2," Nice. So, mmm. What‰Ûªs up?",7
31724,Howard,2," Okay, well, I‰Ûªve been reading up on all the side effects you can get from oestrogen, and, I need you to be honest with me. Do my boobs look bigger to you?",7
31725,Raj,2," Well, it‰Ûªs kind of hard to tell. ",7
31726,Howard,2," Come on, Raj, it‰Ûªs a yes or no question.",7
31727,Raj,2," I‰Ûªm not sure. Um, wait. Jump up and down, let‰Ûªs see if they jiggle. Uh, no, I, I still can‰Ûªt tell, uh, oh, you know what? Okay, uh, give me some of this.",7
31728,Howard,2, Seriously?,7
31729,Raj,2, Do you want my help or not?,7
31730,Howard,2, Fine.,7
31731,Raj,2," Okay, yup. See, see, that, that looks like, that looks like they could be bigger. But you know, I bet, I bet when I do it, mine do the same thing.",7
31732,Howard,2," Yeah, they kind of do.",7
31733,Raj,2," Hmm. Uh, let me see something. (Grabs his boob)",7
31734,Howard,2," Hey, easy, my nipples are sensitive.",7
31735,Raj,2," Oh. Sorry, sorry, uh, okay. (Grabs boob again. Behind them, Bernadette walks in) I mean, yeah, maybe.",7
31736,Howard,2," Okay, let me feel. No, I am definitely up a cup size. ",7
31737,Raj,2," You know, but, but they‰Ûªre very firm, so you‰Ûªve got that going for you.",7
31738,Howard,2, You think?,7
31739,Raj,2," Yeah, yeah, yeah, very perky.",7
31740,Howard,2," Thank you. I really needed to hear that today. (Bernadette rolls eyes and walks out) Ooh, brie‰Ûªs ready.",7
31741,Raj,2, Yay.,7
31742,Scene,2, The apartment. ,7
31743,Leonard,2, Good morning.,7
31744,Sheldon,2, Hello.,7
31745,Leonard,2, So am I driving you to work or are you still mad at me?,7
31746,Sheldon,2, I‰Ûªd like a ride. Assuming you actually do take me to work.,7
31747,Leonard,2, Where do you think I would take you?,7
31748,Sheldon,2," Who knows? Uh, you said you‰Ûªd be home yesterday, but you came home three days ago. You say you‰Ûªre taking me to work, but for all I know, I‰Ûªll end up in a deserted amusement park. Or a cornfield maze. Or a back alley dog fight. You tell me.",7
31749,Leonard,2, I‰Ûªm going to work. You can come if you want.,7
31750,Sheldon,2," Okay. By the way, you have something on your shirt.",7
31751,Leonard,2," No, I don‰Ûªt.",7
31752,Sheldon,2," Hurts, doesn‰Ûªt it? You know, I find myself wondering if anything you‰Ûªve ever told me is true.",7
31753,Leonard,2," I didn‰Ûªt make it back. The ship sank, I‰Ûªm in hell.",7
31754,Sheldon,2," You say you‰Ûªre from New Jersey, but how can I believe you?",7
31755,Leonard,2, Why would anyone claim to be from New Jersey if they weren‰Ûªt?,7
31756,Sheldon,2," All right, I‰Ûªll give you that one.",7
31757,Leonard,2," Hey, I said I was sorry. What else do you want from me?",7
31758,Sheldon,2, I want you to admit that what you did was wrong.,7
31759,Leonard,2, Fine. What I did was wrong.,7
31760,Sheldon,2, I wish I could believe you.,7
31761,Leonard,2," You know what? I‰Ûªm not driving you to work, because you‰Ûªre incredibly annoying.",7
31762,Sheldon,2," You say one thing and do the other, so then you are driving me and you find me a delight.",7
31763,Leonard,2, Stop it.,7
31764,Sheldon,2, Keep it up?,7
31765,Leonard,2, Bye.,7
31766,Sheldon,2, Hello. So I guess you‰Ûªre really holding up the other four fingers?,7
31767,Scene,2, The stairwell.,7
31768,Penny,2," Oh, hey, what are you doing here so early?",7
31769,Amy,2, Driving Sheldon to work.,7
31770,Penny,2," He‰Ûªs still mad at Leonard, huh?",7
31771,Amy,2," Well, he‰Ûªs mad at you, too. He says you‰Ûªre the succubus who led his friend astray.",7
31772,Penny,2," I don‰Ûªt know what succubus is, but it has suck in it, so that can‰Ûªt be good.",7
31773,Sheldon,2, Thought I heard you out here.,7
31774,Penny,2," Hey, Sheldon.",7
31775,Sheldon,2, You don‰Ûªt get a hey. You get a hmm.,7
31776,Penny,2," Come on, don‰Ûªt be like that. We had so much fun together the last couple of months.",7
31777,Sheldon,2, You‰Ûªre right. Which makes your betrayal all the more devastating.,7
31778,Penny,2, Sheldon.,7
31779,Sheldon,2, I let you buy feminine hygiene products with my supermarket club card. You have any idea the kind of coupons I‰Ûªm going to get in the mail now?,7
31780,Amy,2," Sheldon, your fight‰Ûªs with Leonard. Penny‰Ûªs got nothing to do‰Û_",7
31781,Sheldon,2," Careful, Amy. The friend of my enemy‰Ûªs girlfriend is my enemy. ",7
31782,Amy,2, Really?,7
31783,Sheldon,2, Yes. You‰Ûªre either with me or against me.,7
31784,Amy,2, You want to take the bus to work?,7
31785,Sheldon,2, Maybe there‰Ûªs a third option.,7
31786,Amy,2," FYI, I had a doughnut for breakfast, you jerk.",7
31787,Scene,2, The cafeteria.,7
31788,Leonard,2," So now we‰Ûªre just waiting for the data from the ship to be crunched, but the numbers look pretty promising.",7
31789,Howard,2," That‰Ûªs so great. If you guys prove the existence of Unruh radiation‰Û_ Hey, hey, hey, hey. My eyes are up here.",7
31790,Sheldon,2," Howard, Raj. Judas.",7
31791,Leonard,2, You know what? You‰Ûªre a crazy person.,7
31792,Sheldon,2," A crazy person with a long memory, and if all goes according to plan, a robot army.",7
31793,Howard,2, Stop it.,7
31794,Sheldon,2, Or a mutant army. It depends on how my Kickstarter goes.,7
31795,Howard,2," I said, stop it. Now, listen to me. You two aren‰Ûªt just friends. You‰Ûªre best friends. And that‰Ûªs a beautiful thing. I mean, Leonard, you know why he‰Ûªs so mad at you? It‰Ûªs ‰Ûªcause he missed you. Yeah, and as his friend, you should be happy he has love in his life. As I do. This man held my breast the other day and I love him for it.",7
31796,Raj,2," A little loud, dude.",7
31797,Howard,2," So, can we please put aside these petty differences and just be glad we‰Ûªre here together?",7
31798,Leonard,2, Okay.,7
31799,Sheldon,2, I suppose so.,7
31800,Howard,2, Thank you.,7
31801,Raj,2," Uh, it wasn‰Ûªt anything weird. It was just to see how big they were.",7
31802,Scene,2, The apartment.,7
31803,Sheldon,2," And then Leonard took me to the barber and the dentist, and then to cap off the perfect day, the Los Angeles Bureau of Weights and Measures. ",7
31804,Leonard,2," I thought the measures were going to be the stars of the show, turns out it was the weights.",7
31805,Penny,2, I‰Ûªm so glad you guys are friends again.,7
31806,Sheldon,2," And I‰Ûªm glad you and I are friends again, too.",7
31807,Penny,2, Aw.,7
31808,Sheldon,2," Which reminds me. This came in the mail, and I want you to have it.",7
31809,Penny,2, Fifty cents off Vagisil.,7
31810,Sheldon,2, Think of me when you apply it.,7
31811,Raj,2," Uh, can I just say, I‰Ûªve missed all of us hanging out together.",7
31812,Sheldon,2, Yeah.,7
31813,Penny,2," Me, too.",7
31814,Leonard,2," Um, since when can Koothrappali talk in front of the girls without a beer?",7
31815,Bernadette,2," Oh, that happened right after you left.",7
31816,Leonard,2, And no one told me?,7
31817,Howard (crying),2, Can‰Ûªt believe we forgot to tell him.,7
31818,Penny (handing Howard the Vagisil coupon),2, Think of Sheldon when you apply it.,7
31819,Scene,3, The Cheesecake Factory,7
31820,Raj,3," So, couldn‰Ûªt help but notice none of you RSVP‰Ûªd to my murder mystery dinner party.",7
31821,Leonard,3," Oh, yeah. We were meaning to do that.",7
31822,Raj,3," No, you weren‰Ûªt because it was a week ago and nobody came. So, if you want to solve the mystery of who stabbed Koothrappali in the back with the weapon of indifference, it was all of you.",7
31823,Sheldon,3," I don‰Ûªt think thatqualifies as a mystery, we all knew what we were doing.",7
31824,Amy,3," We‰Ûªre sorry, Rajesh. ",7
31825,Bernadette,3, Maybe we can do it next week.,7
31826,Howard,3," Whoa, whoa, we‰Ûªre not that sorry.",7
31827,Raj,3," Don‰Ûªt worry, I can take a hint. No more murder mystery parties.",7
31828,Leonard,3, Great. ,7
31829,Sheldon,3, Thank you.,7
31830,Howard,3, Hallelujah.,7
31831,Raj,3, Because I‰Ûªve got something even better planned.,7
31832,Leonard,3, Aw.,7
31833,Howard,3, Why?,7
31834,Sheldon,3, Come on.,7
31835,Raj,3, Just hear me out. I‰Ûªm going to make you guys a scavenger hunt like they have at M.I.T.,7
31836,Howard,3," Oh, I loved those. I did them every year there.",7
31837,Leonard,3," We did them at Princeton, too.",7
31838,Howard,3," Oh, that‰Ûªs cute. Like it‰Ûªs a real college.",7
31839,Sheldon,3," That‰Ûªs amusing, I was going to say that about M.I.T., but it works for Princeton, too.",7
31840,Amy,3," Scavenger hunts at Harvard were really tough. I always got stuck on the first challenge, trying to find someone to be on a team with me. I guess that story‰Ûªs more sad than funny.",7
31841,Penny,3, I love scavenger hunts. My friends and I had them all the time.,7
31842,Leonard,3," Oh, these are a little different. There‰Ûªs a tradition at elite universities‰Û_",7
31843,Howard,3, And Princeton.,7
31844,Leonard,3," A tradition of hunts full of puzzles that rely on logic and obscure knowledge, science.",7
31845,Penny,3," Oh, in ours we would just run around town looking for a store that would sell us beer.",7
31846,Raj,3," So, uh, who‰Ûªs in?",7
31847,Leonard,3, I think it sounds fun.,7
31848,Amy,3," Yeah, me, too.",7
31849,Various,3," I‰Ûªm in, let‰Ûªs do it.",7
31850,Sheldon,3, I‰Ûªm sorry. Are we really doing this or are we tricking Koothrappali again like with the dinner party?,7
31851,Scene,3, The apartment.,7
31852,Leonard,3, What‰Ûªs all this?,7
31853,Sheldon,3," Oh, everything I could possibly need to win the scavenger hunt.",7
31854,Leonard,3, You really think he‰Ûªs gonna send us to a bowling alley?,7
31855,Sheldon,3," Well, if he does, do you know how filthy those rental balls are? They might as well stand on the corner and give away free rectal exams.",7
31856,Raj,3," Okay, everybody. Who‰Ûªs ready for a scavenger hunt? (Pumping disco music) Somewhere in the city of Pasadena, I‰Ûªve hidden a golden coin. You will be faced with a total of ten puzzles. Each p‰Û_ (cough) each, each puzzle will lead you to the location of the next, the last of which will lead you to the coin. The first team that finds it wins.",7
31857,Sheldon,3, He is a born showman.,7
31858,Raj,3, Any questions?,7
31859,Howard,3," Yes, to be fair, do people who went to Princeton get a head start?",7
31860,Leonard,3, It‰Ûªs not funny.,7
31861,Sheldon,3," No, Oh, it actually is if you get the joke. It‰Ûªs based on the premise that Princeton isn‰Ûªt a very good school. ",7
31862,Leonard,3, Ha-ha.,7
31863,Sheldon,3," Oh, see? Now he gets it.",7
31864,Raj,3," Okay, guys, go ahead and divide yourselves into teams of two.",7
31865,Bernadette,3, Should we just do couples?,7
31866,Leonard,3, Couples sounds great. Or we could mix things up. Maybe pick names out of a hat. Whatever.,7
31867,Penny,3," Whoa, whoa, whoa. Why don‰Ûªt you just admit you don‰Ûªt want to be on a team with me.",7
31868,Leonard,3," I just said, couples sound great.",7
31869,Penny,3," Mm-hmm, yeah, you don‰Ûªt think I‰Ûªm smart enough. You think I‰Ûªm gonna be a liability. Even though I totally just used the word liability correctly in a sentence. Yeah.",7
31870,Leonard,3," All right, let‰Ûªs, let‰Ûªs do couples. I want to.",7
31871,Penny,3," No, no. Let‰Ûªs mix things up. I choose Sheldon, and we‰Ûªre gonna kick your ass!",7
31872,Sheldon,3, Really? The only time I‰Ûªm ever picked first for a team and I‰Ûªm stuck with the liability?,7
31873,Amy,3, Stop that. Penny is not a liability.,7
31874,Penny,3, Thank you. Do you want to be on my team?,7
31875,Amy,3, Maybe we pick names out of a hat.,7
31876,Scene,3, Penny‰Ûªs apartment. (Montage with scenes in the apartment and Leonard‰Ûªs bedroom) ,7
31877,Penny,3," All right, hurry up and close the door so they can‰Ûªt hear us. Would you stop pouting? So, you picked my name. Get over it.",7
31878,Sheldon,3," Yes, and do you know what the odds are I‰Ûªd pick your name?",7
31879,Penny,3, No.,7
31880,Sheldon,3," It‰Ûªs not hard, one in five. Now you know why I‰Ûªm pouting.",7
31881,Raj (over walkie-talkie),3," All right, teams. Get ready to open your first puzzle. Go. Do you see what I did? The first puzzle is a puzzle. Oh, my God, how adorable is that? I wish I had a friend like me.",7
31882,Sheldon,3, What are you doing? You have to start with the edges.,7
31883,Penny,3," Well, there‰Ûªs no right way, Sheldon. I already found a few pieces that fit.",7
31884,Sheldon,3," Yeah, well, take them apart and start with the edges. And stop wasting time.",7
31885,Howard,3," Wow, you‰Ûªre really good at puzzles.",7
31886,Amy,3," I did them all the time as a kid. As my mom used to say, when you‰Ûªre doing a puzzle, it‰Ûªs like having a thousand friends. She was full of fun lies like that.",7
31887,Howard,3," If it makes you feel any better, my mom‰Ûªs just full of pound cake.",7
31888,Amy,3, I‰Ûªm sorry you got stuck with me. I bet you wanted to be with Bernadette.,7
31889,Howard,3, Have you ever played a game with Bernadette?,7
31890,Amy,3, No.,7
31891,Howard,3, Have you ever gone into a steel cage with a wolverine?,7
31892,Bernadette,3," Faster, faster, faster! Do you not know that word? It means more fast!",7
31893,Leonard,3, Stop yelling at me.,7
31894,Bernadette,3," Hey, you‰Ûªll know when I‰Ûªm yelling at you.",7
31895,Penny,3," Ooh, ooh, it‰Ûªs the comic book store. All right, come on, that‰Ûªs where we have to go.",7
31896,Sheldon,3, But we haven‰Ûªt finished the puzzle.,7
31897,Penny,3," But, it, it doesn‰Ûªt matter. We know the answer, come on.",7
31898,Sheldon,3," You think you know the answer. But it could be a trick. What if when the puzzle‰Ûªs complete, there‰Ûªs a sign in the window that says go to the train store?",7
31899,Penny,3," Okay, it‰Ûªs not gonna say that.",7
31900,Sheldon,3," Well, I hope you‰Ûªre wrong. I really want to go to the train store.",7
31901,Howard,3, It‰Ûªs the comic book store. Let‰Ûªs go.,7
31902,Bernadette,3," Come on, numb nuts, it‰Ûªs the comic book store.",7
31903,Penny,3," It‰Ûªs the comic book store, it‰Ûªs the comic book store, it‰Ûªs the comic book store.",7
31904,Sheldon,3, It‰Ûªs the comic book store.,7
31905,Scene,3, Leonard‰Ûªs car.,7
31906,Leonard,3, Do you think Penny‰Ûªs mad at me?,7
31907,Bernadette,3, Because you‰Ûªre in the right lane behind a bus and you won‰Ûªt go around it? I‰Ûªm sure she finds it charming.,7
31908,Leonard,3," No, because I didn‰Ûªt want her on my team.",7
31909,Bernadette,3, I‰Ûªm starting to think she dodged a bullet. The slowest bullet in the world.,7
31910,Leonard,3," Geez, I never realized you were so competitive.",7
31911,Bernadette,3," Yeah, I know. Its, it‰Ûªs probably because I grew up with five brothers and sisters so I had to fight for every‰Û_ Oh, my God, you did not just slow down for a bird, you know they fly, right?",7
31912,Scene,3, Howard‰Ûªs car.,7
31913,Amy,3, I think this is the first time we‰Ûªve ever actually been alone together.,7
31914,Howard,3," Huh, I guess you‰Ûªre right. Wonder why that is?",7
31915,Amy,3," Well, off the top of my head, I‰Ûªd say we don‰Ûªt have a lot in common except for the people we‰Ûªre involved with. Plus, when we first met, Penny warned me never to get into a car alone with you.",7
31916,Howard,3," Yeah. You know, I bet you and I have more in common than we think.",7
31917,Amy,3, Such as?,7
31918,Howard,3, I don‰Ûªt know. Tell me some things you like.,7
31919,Amy,3," Uh, let‰Ûªs see. I like harps, Little House on the Prairie, medieval poetry, medieval literature‰Û_",7
31920,Howard,3," Hey, how about some music?",7
31921,Amy,3, Great. Sheldon never lets me listen to music in the car. He doesn‰Ûªt want to be mistaken for a gang member. ,7
31922,Howard,3, Find something you like.,7
31923,Amy,3," Beatles, boring. Eminem, scary. Weird Al? How old are you? Neil Diamond?",7
31924,Howard,3," Yeah, I love Neil Diamond.",7
31925,Amy,3, I love Neil Diamond.,7
31926,Both,3," Sweet Caroline, bum-ba-da, good times never seemed so good, so good, so good, so good. I‰Ûªve been inclined‰Û_",7
31927,Scene,3, The comic book store.,7
31928,Raj,3," Oh, hey, thanks for letting me use the comic book store as part of the scavenger hunt.",7
31929,Stuart,3," Oh, my pleasure. Always happy to help out with fun things that I wasn‰Ûªt invited to be a part of.",7
31930,Raj,3," Oh, congratulations. You‰Ûªre the first team to arrive.",7
31931,Amy,3," Yes, it‰Ûªs not a ruse to make fun of me. It‰Ûªs a real game and I‰Ûªm winning it.",7
31932,Raj,3, Your next puzzle is a riddle. And who better to give it to you than The Riddler?,7
31933,Bernadette,3," Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go! How am I faster than you? I‰Ûªm in heels and I stopped to take a phone call.",7
31934,Leonard,3, I have asthma. Back off.,7
31935,Howard,3," Riddle me this. Arrah, Arrah, and gather round, the work of this hero is legion-bound. He multiplies N by the number of He, and in this room the thing you‰Ûªll see.",7
31936,Raj,3," Good riddle, huh?",7
31937,Stuart,3," Yeah. So when you guys plan fun activities, does my name even come up, or‰Û_?",7
31938,Raj,3, I invited you to my murder mystery party.,7
31939,Stuart,3," No, you didn‰Ûªt. ",7
31940,Raj,3, Oh.,7
31941,Penny,3," Ugh, we‰Ûªre the last ones here, hurry up.",7
31942,Sheldon,3," It is a marathon, not a sprint.",7
31943,Penny,3, People run in a marathon.,7
31944,Sheldon,3, Not with a bowling ball on their back.,7
31945,Leonard,3," Hey, Penny, I just wanted to say good luck, and I hope there‰Ûªs no hard feelings.",7
31946,Bernadette,3," Hey, Romeo. Repair your relationship on your own time.",7
31947,Leonard,3," Relax, it‰Ûªs a hard puzzle. It‰Ûªs gonna take a while to solve.",7
31948,Penny,3, Riddle me this‰Û_,7
31949,Sheldon,3, Got it.,7
31950,Penny,3," Hey, Princeton, look at that, Team Community College Night School is in the lead.",7
31951,Sheldon,3, I thought we were the Lightning Sharks.,7
31952,Howard,3," Hey, you know what this could mean (whispers).",7
31953,Amy,3," Oh, oh, that‰Ûªs good. Then this would be (whispers back)",7
31954,Howard,3, That‰Ûªs it. ,7
31955,Amy,3, To the Neil Mobile.,7
31956,Bernadette,3," I knew it, we‰Ûªre gonna lose.",7
31957,Leonard,3," Wait, I got it. I got it/",7
31958,Bernadette,3," Congratulations, you got it last. ",7
31959,Leonard,3," You‰Ûªre really mean, you know that?",7
31960,Stuart,3, So no one‰Ûªs gonna buy anything.,7
31961,Scene,3, The geology lab at the University. ,7
31962,Penny,3," Aha. Okay, let‰Ûªs see. To continue on your quest, leave no stone unturned. Ooh.",7
31963,Sheldon,3, The next clue must be hidden under one of these rocks.,7
31964,Penny,3," Oh. Okay. Sheldon, I, I‰Ûªve got to ask, how did you figure out that it was the geology lab?",7
31965,Sheldon,3," Oh, simple, the ‰Û÷arrah, ‰Û÷arrah in the riddle mean Jan Arrah, a member of the Legion of Superheroes, known as Element Lad. And then the word He, it wasn‰Ûªt the masculine pronoun, but rather H e, the abbreviation for helium. See where I‰Ûªm going with this?",7
31966,Penny,3, Yes.,7
31967,Sheldon,3," Nice try. Now, Element Lad‰Ûªs ability is the power to transmute chemical elements. Helium has an atomic number of two. If you multiply that by the atomic number of N, nitrogen, you get 14, which is the atomic number of? I‰Ûªm just funnin‰Ûª you, silicon. And that is the most common element in the Earth‰Ûªs surface. So that narrowed it down to the geology lab or the chemistry lab.",7
31968,Penny,3, Wow. I can drink a beer underwater.,7
31969,Sheldon,3," And I‰Ûªm sure your parents are proud. Now, finally, the line in this room the thing you‰Ûªll see was an obvious reference to Fantastic Four member The Thing, who‰Ûªs made entirely of‰Û_",7
31970,Penny,3, Shut up. I solved it.,7
31971,Sheldon,3, Those are map coordinates. Got ‰Ûªem. Let‰Ûªs go.,7
31972,Penny,3," Well, wait. Don‰Ûªt you want to know how I figured it out?",7
31973,Sheldon,3," No one likes a know-it-all, Penny.",7
31974,Scene,3, Howard‰Ûªs car.,7
31975,Howard,3, On the boats and on the planes. ,7
31976,Amy,3, They‰Ûªre coming to America. ,7
31977,Howard,3, Never looking back again. ,7
31978,Amy,3, They‰Ûªre coming to America‰Û_ ‰ª»,7
31979,Scene,3, Leonard‰Ûªs car.,7
31980,Leonard,3," Um, I‰Ûªm okay with you driving my car. I‰Ûªm not okay with you flying my car.",7
31981,Bernadette,3," Don‰Ûªt sweat it, my dad‰Ûªs a cop. He can fix things.",7
31982,Leonard,3, Uh-huh. Like death?,7
31983,Bernadette (out of the window),3, Your kid may be an honour student but you‰Ûªre a moron.,7
31984,Leonard,3, Penny‰Ûªs not answering my texts.,7
31985,Bernadette,3, Who cares? Focus on the game.,7
31986,Leonard,3, This stupid game is why she‰Ûªs mad in the first place. I‰Ûªm telling her I‰Ûªm quitting.,7
31987,Bernadette,3, No. Quitting would be the worst thing for your relationship.,7
31988,Leonard,3, Why?,7
31989,Bernadette,3, Because it would make you seem like something she already thinks you are. ,7
31990,Leonard,3, What does she think I am?,7
31991,Bernadette,3, How do I put this? She‰Ûªs been known to call you a name that usually applies to a lady part. Or a cat. Or a willow.,7
31992,Leonard,3, I can‰Ûªt believe she would say that about me.,7
31993,Bernadette,3, If you‰Ûªre gonna cry about it there‰Ûªs tissues in my purse. Unless you got some in yours. Big willow.,7
31994,Scene,3, Howard‰Ûªs car.,7
31995,Howard,3," They‰Ûªre coming to America, They‰Ûªre coming to America.",7
31996,Amy,3, Today!,7
31997,Howard,3, Today!,7
31998,Together,3, Today! Today!,7
31999,Scene,3, Penny‰Ûªs car.,7
32000,Sheldon,3," Okay, another 30 feet.",7
32001,Penny,3," Okay. Oh, it‰Ûªs a bowling alley.",7
32002,Sheldon,3, Yes. Yes. My brain is better than everybody‰Ûªs.,7
32003,Scene,3, The geology lab.,7
32004,Howard,3, Love on the rocks. ,7
32005,Amy,3, Ain‰Ûªt no big surprise.,7
32006,Howard,3, Just pour me a drink.,7
32007,Amy,3, And I‰Ûªll tell you some lies. ,7
32008,Scene,3, The apartment stairwell. Leonard is lowering himself down the lift shaft.,7
32009,Leonard,3, Call me a lady part. We‰Ûªll see about that.,7
32010,Bernadette,3, Can you reach the clue?,7
32011,Leonard,3, Almost.,7
32012,Bernadette,3," Hurry, Sheldon and Penny were right behind us in the bowling alley.",7
32013,Leonard,3, Got it.,7
32014,Bernadette,3," Great, climb back up. Come on.",7
32015,Leonard,3," Yeah, Penny might be onto something.",7
32016,Scene,3, Penny‰Ûªs car. ,7
32017,Sheldon,3, To the planetarium.,7
32018,Penny,3, Let‰Ûªs go.,7
32019,Scene,3, Leonard‰Ûªs car.,7
32020,Leonard,3, To the tar pits.,7
32021,Bernadette,3, Let‰Ûªs go.,7
32022,Scene,3, Howard‰Ûªs car.,7
32023,Amy,3, There‰Ûªs a Neil Diamond concert next month.,7
32024,Howard,3, Let‰Ûªs go.,7
32025,Scene,3, The laundry room.,7
32026,Penny,3," Three bags, no one‰Ûªs opened ‰Ûªem. we‰Ûªre the first ones here.",7
32027,Sheldon,3, It‰Ûªs dirty laundry. You‰Ûªre up.,7
32028,Penny,3, What? Why me?,7
32029,Sheldon,3, Because you‰Ûªve been training for this your whole life. You live in a pile of dirty laundry.,7
32030,Bernadette,3, They‰Ûªre here first. This is because you made me slow down for that blind guy.,7
32031,Penny,3," Okay, the clue must be in the bag.",7
32032,Leonard,3, The clue must be in the bag.,7
32033,Penny,3, It‰Ûªs just a bunch of pants.,7
32034,Leonard,3, It‰Ûªs just a bunch of pants.,7
32035,Penny,3," You know, I‰Ûªm surprised you want to copy my answers since I‰Ûªm not even smart enough to be on your team. ",7
32036,Leonard,3," Well, why would you want to be on someone‰Ûªs team who you like to call a, I can‰Ûªt even say it in front of Sheldon.",7
32037,Penny,3, What are you talking about?,7
32038,Leonard,3, You know exactly what I‰Ûªm talking about.,7
32039,Bernadette,3," No, she doesn‰Ûªt. I just made that up.",7
32040,Leonard,3, Why would you do that?,7
32041,Bernadette,3," Because you were about to quit like a big, Sheldon, cover your ears.",7
32042,Sheldon,3, I‰Ûªm not a child. I know the word ninny.,7
32043,Penny,3," Yeah, well, you should have quit ‰Ûªcause I‰Ûªm still gonna beat your ass.",7
32044,Bernadette,3, Wish I had a man like her on my team.,7
32045,Leonard,3," Hey, I am every bit as much of a man as Penny. Now, let‰Ûªs do this.",7
32046,Sheldon,3," Wait, it‰Ûªs not all pants, there‰Ûªs one shirt.",7
32047,Penny,3, Oh.,7
32048,Sheldon,3," Hey, that‰Ûªs my shirt.",7
32049,Leonard,3," This one is, too.",7
32050,Sheldon,3," No, no, that‰Ûªs not mine. It has a big spot on it.",7
32051,Penny,3, But wait. So does this one.,7
32052,Bernadette,3, Maybe the spot‰Ûªs the clue.,7
32053,Penny,3, Sheldon‰Ûªs spot. The coin is in your spot.,7
32054,Sheldon,3," Oh, that‰Ûªs clever.",7
32055,Penny (off),3, Hurry.,7
32056,Sheldon,3, Be there in a minute. I just have to pre-soak these.,7
32057,Scene,3, The stairwell.,7
32058,Bernadette,3," Stop her, Leonard, stop her.",7
32059,Penny,3," Well, where the hell‰Ûªs the coin?",7
32060,Leonard,3, Wasn‰Ûªt the answer Sheldon‰Ûªs spot?,7
32061,Raj,3," Oh, yes, Leonard. Yes, it was.",7
32062,Bernadette,3, Then where‰Ûªs the coin?,7
32063,Raj,3," Yes, exactly. Where is the coin? Why don‰Ûªt you look in your pockets? I slipped them in there earlier today.",7
32064,Penny,3, I don‰Ûªt get it.,7
32065,Raj,3," Don‰Ûªt you see? When we‰Ûªre all having fun together, we‰Ûªre already winners. Oh, look. See? Even I‰Ûªm a winner.",7
32066,Leonard,3, Are you kidding me?,7
32067,Penny,3, That is the stupidest thing I‰Ûªve ever heard. ,7
32068,Bernadette,3, You suck so hard.,7
32069,Raj,3," Well, I thought‰Û_ Come on, I didn‰Ûªt want anyone to feel bad at the end of the game. And some of those puzzles were really hard and I didn‰Ûªt know who was gonna get Penny.",7
32070,Penny,3, Run.,7
32071,Raj,3," Okay, okay, that-that came out wrong, but you have to admit, you all had a wonderful time.",7
32072,Penny,3, Run to India.,7
32073,Raj,3, I just wanted to do something beautiful.,7
32074,Sheldon (entering),3," Hey, look. I won.",7
32075,Scene,3," The Cheesecake Factory, karaoke night.",7
32076,Howard,3," Hey, she got the way to move me, Cherry,",7
32077,Amy,3, She got the way to groove me.,7
32078,Howard,3," Cherry, baby",7
32079,Amy,3," She got the way to move me, honey.",7
32080,Together,3, She got the way to groove me. She got the way to move me.,7
32081,Howard,3, Cherry,7
32082,Together,3," She got the way to groove me, yeah!",7
32083,Scene,4, The apartment.,7
32084,Sheldon,4, So what‰Ûªd you think?,7
32085,Amy,4, It was good.,7
32086,Sheldon,4, That‰Ûªs it? Good‰Û,7
32087,Amy,4," I enjoyed it. When you told me I was going to be losing my virginity, I didn‰Ûªt think you meant showing me Raiders of the Lost Ark for the first time.",7
32088,Sheldon,4," My apologies. I chose my words poorly. I should have said you were about to have your world rocked on my couch. Anyway, thank you for watching it. It‰Ûªs one of my all-time favourites.",7
32089,Amy,4, It was very entertaining despite the glaring story problem.,7
32090,Sheldon,4," Story problem? You, oh, Amy, what a dewy-eyed moon-calf you are. Raiders of the Lost Ark is the love child of Steven Spielberg and George Lucas, two of the most gifted filmmakers of our generation. I‰Ûªve watched it 36 times, except for the snake scene and the face-melting scene, which I can only watch when it‰Ûªs still light out, but, I defy you to find a story problem. Here‰Ûªs my jaw, drop it.",7
32091,Amy,4," All right. Indiana Jones plays no role in the outcome of the story. If he weren‰Ûªt in the film, it would turn out exactly the same.",7
32092,Sheldon,4," Oh, I see your confusion. You don‰Ûªt understand. Indiana Jones was the one in the hat with the whip.",7
32093,Amy,4," No, I do, and if he weren‰Ûªt in the movie, the Nazis would have still found the ark, taken it to the island, opened it up and all died, just like they did. Let me close that for ya.",7
32094,Scene,4, The foyer.,7
32095,Leonard,4, Hey.,7
32096,Penny,4, Hi. I thought you went to the comic book store on Wednesdays.,7
32097,Leonard,4," Yeah, but Sheldon and Amy were having date night and they don‰Ûªt need me there to make it awkward. They have each other for that. So, how was school?",7
32098,Penny,4," Oh, good. Check it out, The Disappointing Child by Beverly Hofstadter.",7
32099,Leonard,4, You bought my mom‰Ûªs book?,7
32100,Penny,4, Yeah. It‰Ûªs on the recommended reading list for my psychology class.,7
32101,Leonard,4," Oh, come on. Not that book. It, it‰Ûªs got, like, every horrible story from my childhood in it.",7
32102,Penny,4," Oh, cool. Are there pictures?",7
32103,Leonard,4," Seriously, please find another book.",7
32104,Penny,4," Oh, come on. Why? How bad could it be?",7
32105,Leonard,4," There, there‰Ûªs chapters about potty training, and bed-wetting and masturbation. Basically, if something came out of me, she wrote about it. You know what? Do whatever you want, just don‰Ûªt talk to me about it.",7
32106,Penny,4, Not even the chapter on the breast-feeding crisis?,7
32107,Leonard,4," It was not a crisis. Apparently, I favoured the left one, she got a little lopsided.",7
32108,Penny,4," Oh, my God, you still go left.",7
32109,Scene,4, The cafeteria.,7
32110,Raj,4, Which celebrity would you say I look like the most?,7
32111,Howard,4, Halle Berry. Why?,7
32112,Raj,4," Stuart and I are putting dating profiles online, and it‰Ûªs one of the questions. And thank you, I‰Ûªd kill for that woman‰Ûªs bone structure.",7
32113,Leonard,4, Why are you reading Pride and Prejudice?,7
32114,Sheldon,4," I‰Ûªll tell you why. Amy ruined Raiders of the Lost Ark for me, so now I‰Ûªm trying to find something beloved to her and ruin that.",7
32115,Howard,4, Because her life wasn‰Ûªt enough?,7
32116,Raj,4," Wait, how can, how can anyone ruin Raiders? It‰Ûªs perfect.",7
32117,Sheldon,4," Yeah, except for the fact that Indiana Jones is completely irrelevant to the story. With or without him, the Nazis find the ark, open it and die.",7
32118,All,4, Aw!,7
32119,Howard,4," Hey, wait a minute. No, the Nazis were digging in the wrong place. The only reason they got the ark was because Indy found it first.",7
32120,Leonard,4," Actually, they were only digging in the wrong place because Indy had the medallion. Without him, they would have had the medallion and dug in the right place.",7
32121,All,4, Aw!,7
32122,Scene,4, Penny‰Ûªs apartment.,7
32123,Penny,4," Okay, I know you don‰Ûªt want to talk about it, but can I just ask you one question about your mom‰Ûªs book?",7
32124,Leonard,4, No.,7
32125,Penny,4, I just want to know why a five-year-old boy puts on his mom‰Ûªs make-up and wears balloon boobies.,7
32126,Leonard,4," They weren‰Ûªt boobies, they were muscles. And the make-up was green. I was pretending to be The Hulk.",7
32127,Penny,4, You were wearing her bra.,7
32128,Leonard,4, That was to keep my muscles from sagging. Can we please stop talking about this?,7
32129,Penny,4," Okay, okay. But you know, as a student of psychology who got a check-plus on her first homework assignment, I think, sometimes, it‰Ûªs good to open up about these things.",7
32130,Leonard,4," Okay, fine. Do you want to know why I dressed like The Hulk? Because I was always mad at my mom and I wanted to smash my way out of that house.",7
32131,Penny,4," Well, why were you so angry?",7
32132,Leonard,4," Gee, I don‰Ûªt know. Maybe it‰Ûªs because I was always the subject of her little experiments. Did you get to the chapter where she staged the Easter egg hunt with no eggs to see how long I‰Ûªd keep looking? The answer, by the way, June.",7
32133,Penny,4," Sweetie, I‰Ûªm so sorry. I wish there was something I could do to make you feel better.",7
32134,Leonard,4," I do, too, but there‰Ûªs not.",7
32135,Penny,4, Really? Are you sure about that?,7
32136,Leonard,4," Of course, who am I to argue with a check-plus student? Just warning you, I‰Ûªm gonna go right. Don‰Ûªt make a big deal out of it.",7
32137,Scene,4, Raj‰Ûªs apartment.,7
32138,Stuart,4, Is make-up really necessary?,7
32139,Raj,4," Well, when someone looks at your dating profile, the first thing they see is your picture. I just want to make sure you look fun and full of life and not like a body they just pulled out of the river. All right, here we go, and smile. Okay, uh-uh, that one‰Ûªs in the bank. How about this? Turn away, and then turn back into it. But when you do, imagine the camera is the girl you want to meet.",7
32140,Stuart,4, You got it.,7
32141,Raj,4," Okay, uh, let‰Ûªs try it again. Uh, but this time, pretend the girl you want to meet doesn‰Ûªt want to hurt you.",7
32142,Stuart,4, I don‰Ûªt think I can give you that.,7
32143,Raj,4," Come on. One more time. Yeah, it‰Ûªs, it‰Ûªs a little blurry, but I think that works in your favour. Do you want a beer?",7
32144,Stuart,4," Sure. Hey, have you finished writing your profile yet?",7
32145,Raj,4," Almost. Oh, what did you put as the one-word description of yourself?",7
32146,Stuart,4," I put unobjectionable. But now that I hear it out loud, it just seems like I‰Ûªm being cocky. What did you put for your best feature?",7
32147,Raj,4," My parents‰Ûª money. Uh, what did you put for your best feature?",7
32148,Raj,4," Come on, dude, you‰Ûªre being too hard on yourself. You‰Ûªve got a lot of good stuff going on.",7
32149,Stuart,4, Really? Like what?,7
32150,Raj,4," Well, okay, you‰Ûªre a, you‰Ûªre a talented artist, you own your own business.",7
32151,Stuart,4, Neither of those things have ever helped me meet a woman.,7
32152,Raj,4," Okay, well, can we imply that you‰Ûªre well-endowed?",7
32153,Stuart,4, I do have one oddly long testicle.,7
32154,Raj,4," Okay, now you‰Ûªre talking like a winner!",7
32155,Scene,4, The apartment.,7
32156,Leonard,4, Whatcha doin‰Ûª?,7
32157,Sheldon,4," Oh, it turns out Amy‰Ûªs beloved Pride and Prejudice is a flawless masterpiece. He‰Ûªs got too much pride, she‰Ûªs got too much prejudice, it just works.",7
32158,Leonard,4, So you‰Ûªre looking to ruin something for her in the funny pages?,7
32159,Sheldon,4, Amy has a fondness for the comic strip Marmaduke.,7
32160,Leonard,4, Mm-hmm. And?,7
32161,Sheldon,4," And I think I‰Ûªve got it. Consider, a family possesses a dog that is so large and poorly disciplined, he causes nothing but problems. Why do they keep him?",7
32162,Leonard,4, Maybe they fell in love with him as a puppy and didn‰Ûªt know how big he was gonna be.,7
32163,Sheldon,4," Of course. You know, why couldn‰Ûªt she just like Ziggy? Yeah? That thing‰Ûªs riddled with plot holes.",7
32164,Leonard,4," Sorry, buddy.",7
32165,Sheldon,4," Ooh, I think she‰Ûªs a fan of Garfield as well. Oh, darn it, now so am I.",7
32166,Leonard,4, I‰Ûªll see you later. I gotta go watch a stupid football game with Penny.,7
32167,Sheldon,4," Wait, hang on. You‰Ûªve spent time with Amy. Can you think of anything she‰Ûªs fond of that has a bunch of flaws she hasn‰Ûªt noticed?",7
32168,Leonard,4, I gotta go.,7
32169,Scene,4, Penny‰Ûªs apartment. ,7
32170,Leonard,4, You ready to go?,7
32171,Penny,4," Yep. Hey, and maybe this time you don‰Ûªt try and talk sports with the guys.",7
32172,Leonard,4, Some sports bar. It‰Ûªs like they never even heard of Quidditch. Do we really have to go?,7
32173,Penny,4," Oh, come on. Every time we‰Ûªre about to hang out with my friends, you don‰Ûªt want to. It‰Ûªs like, It‰Ûªs too loud, or the bathroom‰Ûªs too dirty, or they put a chicken wing in my ear. I mean‰Û_",7
32174,Leonard,4," Well, you‰Ûªre, you‰Ûªre right. Let‰Ûªs just go.",7
32175,Penny,4," Hey, what‰Ûªs going on with you?",7
32176,Leonard,4," Nothing, I‰Ûªm fine.",7
32177,Penny,4," All right, hang on. is this still about your mom‰Ûªs book?",7
32178,Leonard,4, No. Not everything is about my mom. ,7
32179,Penny,4," ‰Û÷Cause if you‰Ûªre still upset about that, we don‰Ûªt have to go.",7
32180,Leonard,4, Except this is totally about my mom.,7
32181,Penny,4, I‰Ûªm so sorry. I never should have read that book. You know what? You want to just get dinner and watch the game here?,7
32182,Leonard,4, That sounds nice. Yeah.,7
32183,Penny,4, Okay.,7
32184,Leonard,4," Or, you know, we could get take-out and watch the Blu-ray extended version of The Hobbit movie with commentary track. On account of how sad I am about my mom.",7
32185,Scene,4, Leonard‰Ûªs lab.,7
32186,Howard,4," Leonard, you ready for lunch?",7
32187,Leonard,4, One sec. Hey. Sorry.,7
32188,Howard,4," Hi, Penny.",7
32189,Penny,4," Hi. All right, sweetie. You hang in there today.",7
32190,Leonard,4," I‰Ûªll try, but I might be sad again tonight.",7
32191,Penny,4, Okay.,7
32192,Howard,4, Wow. Sex at work?,7
32193,Leonard,4, Leave it alone. That‰Ûªs my girlfriend.,7
32194,Howard,4, Sorry. ,7
32195,Leonard,4, Who just had sex with me at work.,7
32196,Howard,4, Damn. How‰Ûªd you swing that?,7
32197,Leonard,4," Well, whenever I talk about how awful my mom was, Penny will do anything to make me feel better.",7
32198,Howard,4, Seriously?,7
32199,Leonard,4," Look, I mean, I‰Ûªm not proud of it, but it does work. I got her to watch a six-part documentary on Monty Python. Even I was bored, I just wanted to see if she‰Ûªd make it to the end.",7
32200,Howard,4, You sound kind of proud of it.,7
32201,Leonard,4," I am, I‰Ûªm really proud.",7
32202,Scene,4, The apartment.,7
32203,Amy (on webcam),4," Hello, Sheldon. Is everything okay?",7
32204,Sheldon,4, Yes. Why?,7
32205,Amy,4," Well, the last time you made an unscheduled video-chat, there was a curly fry in your regular fries and you thought someone might be trying to slip you a mickey.",7
32206,Sheldon,4," April 13, a dark night, indeed.",7
32207,Amy,4, So what can I do for you?,7
32208,Sheldon,4, I‰Ûªm calling to invite you to a spontaneous date night tomorrow evening.,7
32209,Amy,4, Really?,7
32210,Sheldon,4," Yes. You were kind enough to watch Raiders of the Lost Ark with me. So I‰Ûªd like to return the favour by inviting you to watch an episode of your favourite childhood television series, Little House on the Prairie.",7
32211,Amy,4, That sounds lovely. Why are you rubbing your hands together?,7
32212,Sheldon,4," Um, I‰Ûªm putting on lotion. Are you in or not?",7
32213,Amy,4, Of course I‰Ûªm in.,7
32214,Sheldon,4," Excellent. Then I shall see you tomorrow. Good night, Dr. Fowler.",7
32215,Amy,4," Good night, Dr. Cooper.",7
32216,Sheldon,4," Good night, indeed. What a rube. Why would I put on lotion when I have such soft hands?",7
32217,Scene,4, Howard and Bernadette‰Ûªs apartment.,7
32218,Bernadette,4, You were really quiet during dinner. Is everything okay?,7
32219,Howard,4," Yeah. I guess I was just thinking about my mom, and how sad my childhood was.",7
32220,Bernadette,4," Yeah, I bet it sucked. I‰Ûªm gonna take a bath, you do the dishes.",7
32221,Howard,4, How about I take a bath with you and see what happens.,7
32222,Bernadette,4," Here‰Ûªs what‰Ûªs gonna happen. I‰Ûªm gonna take a bath, and you‰Ûªre gonna do the dishes.",7
32223,Howard,4, That‰Ûªs it? No compassion?,7
32224,Bernadette,4," Aw, poor Howie. We good? I‰Ûªm gonna take a bath.",7
32225,Howard,4, Bernie‰Û_,7
32226,Bernadette,4," God, what is going on with you? ",7
32227,Howard,4, I‰Ûªm sharing my pain.,7
32228,Bernadette,4, And I‰Ûªm not buying it. Try again.,7
32229,Howard,4, I‰Ûªm learning to be a man in a culture where it‰Ûªs increasingly difficult to know how?,7
32230,Bermadette,4, Strike two.,7
32231,Howard,4," I‰Ûªm copying Leonard. When he does this to Penny, they have sex and watch Monty Python.",7
32232,Bernadette,4, Howard.,7
32233,Howard,4," I know. It was dumb, I shouldn‰Ûªt have done it. And it‰Ûªs making me feel sad. So sad. You know, why don‰Ûªt you take a bath? I‰Ûªll do the dishes.",7
32234,Scene,4, Raj‰Ûªs apartment.,7
32235,Raj,4," Three, two, one. ",7
32236,Stuart,4, That‰Ûªs it. Our dating profiles are live on the Internet.,7
32237,Raj,4," Attention all shoppers, my business is open for business!",7
32238,Stuart,4," That‰Ûªs right, ladies. For all you know, I‰Ûªm confident and fun to be around.",7
32239,Raj,4," Oh, cool, it tells you when someone‰Ûªs reading your profile. Jenny309. I hope that‰Ûªs not her weight. ",7
32240,Stuart,4," If it is, I‰Ûªll take her. Ooh, I got one, too. The ladies are coming to us. Oh, man, if I‰Ûªd started this years ago, I‰Ûªd be divorced two or three times by now.",7
32241,Raj,4," What? Another one. You know, it, it‰Ûªs weird. When they‰Ûªre reading your profile, does it, does it make you feel exposed? Like they see you naked?",7
32242,Stuart,4," Well, they‰Ûªre not running away screaming, so, no.",7
32243,Scene,4, The apartment. ,7
32244,Amy,4, I love Little House. It made me want to live on a farm so much I tried to milk my cat. That tangy bowl of Cheerios was not worth the stitches.,7
32245,Sheldon,4," Well, you sit back, relax and enjoy a beloved childhood memory. You see that cabin there? I read they were illegally squatting on Indian land. Yeah. Personally, I think what we did to the Native Americans was wrong, but this is your favourite show, not mine. Oh, look at little Laura Ingalls, eating that peanut butter sandwich. Peanut butter? Huh? That‰Ûªs strange, since peanut butter wasn‰Ûªt introduced until the early 1900s. If I knew this show was about time travel, I would have watched it much sooner.",7
32246,Amy,4, You‰Ûªre trying to get back at me for what I said about Raiders of the Lost Ark.,7
32247,Sheldon,4," That‰Ûªs silly. Almost as silly as Dr. Baker having a telephone, since telephones only existed in large cities at that time. This is more like Little House on the Preposterous.",7
32248,Amy,4," Sheldon, we‰Ûªre in a relationship. When you get angry, just tell me. You don‰Ûªt need to seek revenge.",7
32249,Sheldon,4," Are you sure? Every time my dad stayed out all night, my mom would put hamster poop in his chewing tobacco.",7
32250,Amy,4," Well, that‰Ûªs not how we‰Ûªre going to do it.",7
32251,Sheldon,4," Fine. I‰Ûªm mad at you. Not only did you ruin Raiders for me, you may have ruined the whole franchise. Except for the fourth one, which was bad before you got your mitts on it.",7
32252,Amy,4, I shouldn‰Ûªt have said it. I‰Ûªm sorry.,7
32253,Sheldon,4, Thank you.,7
32254,Amy,4, Do you feel better?,7
32255,Sheldon,4, Yes. But not as good as I‰Ûªm going to when I tell you that your precious Garfield has no reason to hate Mondays. He‰Ûªs a cat. He doesn‰Ûªt have a job.,7
32256,Scene,4, Penny‰Ûªs apartment.,7
32257,Leonard,4," Hey, I was just‰Û_ what is happening?",7
32258,Penny,4," Oh, just a little treat. I know you‰Ûªve been feeling really bad about your mom lately.",7
32259,Leonard,4," Oh, oh, I have. So bad.",7
32260,Penny,4," And I wanted to make you feel better, so I planned something very special for you.",7
32261,Leonard,4," Uh-huh, I can already feel it working.",7
32262,Mrs Hofstadter (on webcam),4," Hello, Leonard.",7
32263,Leonard,4, Mom?,7
32264,Mrs Hofstadter,4, I understand you have been whining about my parenting in order to emotionally manipulate your girlfriend. ,7
32265,Leonard,4, I‰Û_ uh‰Û_,7
32266,Penny,4, Bernadette told me everything. Now you don‰Ûªt get the left or the right.,7
32267,Mrs Hofstadter,4, Let‰Ûªs discuss why you continue to involve me in your sex life.,7
32268,Leonard,4," Oh, please, Mommy. No, Mommy.",7
32269,Mrs Hofstadter,4," When you were six years old, you walked in on me and your father naked. I was swatting his bottom with your brand new Ping Pong paddle.",7
32270,Leonard,4, I didn‰Ûªt dream that?,7
32271,Mrs Hofstadter,4, How did that make you feel?,7
32272,Leonard,4," Penny, come back. I‰Ûªm sad for real now.",7
32273,Scene,4, Raj‰Ûªs apartment. ,7
32274,Raj,4," In the last two hours, 162 women have read our profiles. How many of them have sent us messages?",7
32275,Stuart,4, Combined?,7
32276,Raj,4, Yes.,7
32277,Stuart,4, Zero.,7
32278,Raj,4," Dude, this is, this is brutal. ",7
32279,Stuart,4, I don‰Ûªt think I‰Ûªve ever felt so rejected. And I had a rescue dog who ran back to the pound.,7
32280,Raj,4," This is the worst. If we‰Ûªre gonna get shot down, we might as well just go to a bar and do it old school.",7
32281,Stuart,4, And make them look us in the eye.,7
32282,Raj,4," Yeah, anything is better than this.",7
32283,Scene,4, A bar. ,7
32284,Raj,4, Hello.,7
32285,Girl,4, Not interested.,7
32286,Raj,4, I was wrong. This is worse.,7
32287,Scene,4, The apartment. ,7
32288,Howard,4," Wait, wait, if it wasn‰Ûªt for Indiana Jones, the ark would never have ended up at the warehouse. ",7
32289,Sheldon,4, That‰Ûªs true. He collected and delivered the ark to the proper authorities for filing.,7
32290,Raj,4, Like a hero.,7
32291,All,4, Yeah!,7
32292,Leonard,4," Although, technically, Indy was supposed to take the ark to a museum to be studied. He couldn‰Ûªt even get that done.",7
32293,All,4, Aw!,7
32294,Scene,5, The Cheesecake Factory,7
32295,Penny,5," Awkward silence, Sheldon on his phone, no touching. Somebody‰Ûªs having date night.",7
32296,Amy,5, It‰Ûªs actually steamier than it looks. Sheldon‰Ûªs looking up the phallic symbolism of root vegetables in Renaissance paintings.,7
32297,Sheldon,5," Oh, no, I got bored with that. I‰Ûªm just browsing cuticle scissors on Amazon.",7
32298,Penny,5, How do you not tear off his clothes and take him right here on this table?,7
32299,Sheldon,5," If you do that, I‰Ûªll scream.",7
32300,Amy,5," Sheldon, I have some exciting news to tell you.",7
32301,Sheldon,5," That makes two of us. My new cuticle scissors will be here in one to two business days. Come on, one.",7
32302,Amy,5, I‰Ûªve been invited to consult on an experiment at your university for a few months. Isn‰Ûªt that great? We could have lunch together. We could carpool. ,7
32303,Sheldon,5," You know, riding with Leonard has gotten a little tedious lately. The only car game he ever wants to play is the Quiet Game. And he‰Ûªs terrible at it, I always win.",7
32304,Amy,5," So, you‰Ûªre okay with this?",7
32305,Sheldon,5," Well, why wouldn‰Ûªt I be?",7
32306,Amy,5," Well, this project would have us working in close proximity to one another. And there‰Ûªs the vulgar adage that one should not defecate where one eats.",7
32307,Sheldon,5," My father used to say that all the time. That and, um, who does one have to orally gratify to get a drink around here? But what does that have to do with you working at the university?",7
32308,Amy,5," Sheldon, don‰Ûªt defecate where you eat means don‰Ûªt have a romantic relationship in the workplace.",7
32309,Sheldon,5, Really?,7
32310,Amy,5, Yes.,7
32311,Sheldon,5," Huh. Yeah, I always took it literally. That‰Ûªs why I have never once moved my bowels in this or any restaurant. Hmm.",7
32312,Amy,5, I‰Ûªm relieved that you don‰Ûªt have a problem with us working together.,7
32313,Sheldon,5," Not as relieved as I‰Ûªm about to be. It‰Ûªs a brave new world, little lady.",7
32314,Scene,5, The apartment. ,7
32315,Howard,5, Are you crazy? You don‰Ûªt want your girlfriend at work with you. Hell Clam.,7
32316,Sheldon,5, Why not? Hairy Fairy.,7
32317,Raj,5," I think it could be romantic. You know, my parents met at his place of work. ",7
32318,Leonard,5, Your father‰Ûªs a gynaecologist.,7
32319,Raj,5," I know. What started as a pap smear turned into a date. Which turned into her working there, which turned into marriage, which then turned into hatred, which continues to this day. Two-Eyed Cyclops.",7
32320,Howard,5, Would you please tell him this isn‰Ûªt a good idea?,7
32321,Leonard,5," No, no, I think it‰Ûªll be great. Maybe next time he gets conjunctivitis at work, she can hold his head and try to put the drops in his eyes. Giant baby.",7
32322,Sheldon,5, That‰Ûªs a Raging Ogre.,7
32323,Leonard,5," Yeah, I know.",7
32324,Howard,5," I‰Ûªm just saying, I‰Ûªd never want to work with Bernadette. Can you imagine seeing someone all day long and then you‰Ûªre supposed to hang out with them after work, too?",7
32325,Raj,5, Hold on. We do that all the time. You and I work together and play together.,7
32326,Howard,5," Yeah, I know, and it drove me into the arms of another woman. Bipolar Bear.",7
32327,Sheldon,5," Well, I appreciate your concern, but I won‰Ûªt be seeing any more of Amy than I already do. I assume we‰Ûªll deduct any extra time we spend together at work from our weekly quota.",7
32328,Leonard,5, Please let me be there when you tell her that.,7
32329,Sheldon,5, Why? So you can see the look on Amy‰Ûªs face when she hears my top-notch idea?,7
32330,Leonard,5," Please, oh, please, just let me be there.",7
32331,Scene,5, Penny‰Ûªs apartment.,7
32332,Bernadette,5," So, Amy, what are you gonna be working on at Caltech?",7
32333,Amy,5, I‰Ûªm leading a study to see if deficiency of the monoamine oxidase enzyme leads to paralyzing fear in monkeys.,7
32334,Bernadette,5," If they‰Ûªre anything like humans, the answer‰Ûªs yes.",7
32335,Amy,5," Wait, you‰Ûªve, you‰Ûªve done this experiment on humans?",7
32336,Bernadette,5," You mean like death row inmates with nothing to lose? No, that would be unethical.",7
32337,Penny,5," You know, not a lot of people know this, but the monoamine oxidase enzyme was discovered by a woman, Mary Bernheim. That‰Ûªs right, my phone is just as smart as you guys.",7
32338,Sheldon (off),5," (Knock, knock, knock) Amy, Bernadette, Penny. (Knock, knock, knock) Amy, Bernadette, Penny. (Knock, knock, knock) Amy, Bernadette, Penny.",7
32339,Bernadette,5," He‰Ûªs never gonna stop doing that, is he?",7
32340,Amy,5, I don‰Ûªt mind. I‰Ûªm hoping to put his love of repetition to good use someday.,7
32341,Sheldon,5," Hi. Um, I‰Ûªve reconsidered. Uh, you can‰Ûªt work where I work. Enjoy the rest of your evening.",7
32342,Amy,5, Sheldon. I already signed the contract. I cashed a cheque. ,7
32343,Sheldon,5," Mmm, you are not going to come out of this looking good.",7
32344,Penny,5," Sheldon, I don‰Ûªt understand. I thought you said you were fine with it.",7
32345,Sheldon,5," Well, I was. But that was before Howard explained to me how awful it would be if he had to work with his significant other.",7
32346,Bernadette,5, He said what?,7
32347,Sheldon,5," Now, don‰Ûªt be insulted. He just thinks too much of you would be mind-numbingly tedious. ",7
32348,Bernadette,5," Excuse me, I need to have a chat with my husband.",7
32349,Sheldon,5," Yeah, well, now, well, keep it short. From what I gather, brevity is your friend. So, are we good here?",7
32350,Amy,5," No, we‰Ûªre not good here. I am working on this project.",7
32351,Penny,5," Yeah, and you can‰Ûªt tell her what she can and cannot do.",7
32352,Sheldon,5," Last week, you told Leonard he couldn‰Ûªt wear his Wookie jacket out in public.",7
32353,Penny,5, That‰Ûªs different. I‰Ûªm not going to the mall with someone dressed like a dumb space bear.,7
32354,Amy,5," Sheldon, you don‰Ûªt have to worry about me bothering you. I‰Ûªll be in a different building. And we don‰Ûªt even have to have lunch together.",7
32355,Sheldon,5, Really?,7
32356,Amy,5," Yes. Before all things, I‰Ûªm a scientist. I‰Ûªm just there to do my work and, with a little luck, scare the living crap out of some monkeys.",7
32357,Sheldon,5, Hmm. You sure your mothlike personality won‰Ûªt be drawn to this blazing fire that is myself?,7
32358,Amy,5, More and more sure.,7
32359,Sheldon,5," Well, then, you have my permission.",7
32360,Amy,5, I didn‰Ûªt ask for your permission.,7
32361,Sheldon,5, Too late. No backsies.,7
32362,Howard,5," No, no, listen to me. Sheldon misunderstood. What I meant was, if we worked together, there‰Ûªd be too much of me for you, not the other way around.",7
32363,Sheldon,5," Howard, if you‰Ûªre going to lie to your wife, don‰Ûªt start the sentence with Sheldon misunderstood. That‰Ûªs a dead giveaway.",7
32364,Bernadette,5, Well?,7
32365,Howard,5," Okay, fine. I did say that, and I think it‰Ûªs true. I think if we worked together and lived together, we‰Ûªd get sick of each other.",7
32366,Sheldon,5," Yeah, but to be fair, he only said the part about him getting sick of you.",7
32367,Howard,5," For the love of God, why?",7
32368,Bernadette,5, What exactly do you think you‰Ûªd get sick of?,7
32369,Raj,5, His only options here are to fake a heart attack or have a real one.,7
32370,Howard,5, It‰Ûªs nothing in particular. I‰Û_,7
32371,Bernadette,5, Is it my voice? Am I too bossy? What?,7
32372,Howard,5, My arm is feeling numb.,7
32373,Leonard,5, Nailed it.,7
32374,Bernadette,5," That‰Ûªs the wrong arm for a heart attack, doofus. ",7
32375,Howard,5," My point is, I‰Ûªm sure there are things about me that would drive you crazy if you had to deal with them all day long.",7
32376,Bernadette,5, Like looking me in the eye and lying to me?,7
32377,Howard,5," Oh, well, come on, where am I supposed to look when I lie to you?",7
32378,Bernadette,5, Find somewhere else to sleep tonight.,7
32379,Howard,5, Bernie‰Û_,7
32380,Sheldon,5," If it makes you feel any better, Amy and I are fine. I mean, really good.",7
32381,Scene,5, The cafeteria.,7
32382,Leonard,5," So, boys, how was the pyjama party? You guys jump on the bed and sing into hair brushes?",7
32383,Raj,5," It wasn‰Ûªt a pyjama party. It was just a couple of bros hanging out, giggling, eating cookie dough and watching Princess Bride.",7
32384,Howard,5," Please, stop talking.",7
32385,Raj,5, As you wish.,7
32386,Howard,5," I mean, you know, Sheldon, none of this would‰Ûªve happened if I hadn‰Ûªt tried to help you.",7
32387,Sheldon,5," Uh, it also wouldn‰Ûªt have happened if, in the early universe, hydrogen was a little more common or a little less common. This is fun. Your turn.",7
32388,Amy,5, Gentlemen.,7
32389,Raj,5, Amy.,7
32390,Leonard,5, Hey.,7
32391,Sheldon,5, Hello.,7
32392,Leonard,5, That was kind of icy. You two okay?,7
32393,Sheldon,5," Oh, we‰Ûªre fine. As Howard advised, she‰Ûªs merely respecting our professional boundaries.",7
32394,Leonard,5, Smart. Take relationship advice from a man who spent last night braiding Raj‰Ûªs hair.,7
32395,Sheldon,5," Yeah, you make a good point. It would appear I was worried for nothing. Look at her, desperately wishing she was over here at the cool table. Don‰Ûªt worry, little moth. The flame will come to you.",7
32396,Raj,5," Oh, uh, on the off chance that Bernadette doesn‰Ûªt call back and apologize, how do you feel about Mexican food for dinner tonight?",7
32397,Howard,5, I don‰Ûªt know. Sounds kind of heavy.,7
32398,Raj,5, That‰Ûªs ‰Ûªcause you always fill up on chips.,7
32399,Amy,5, And this is Dr. Gunderson from Stockholm.,7
32400,Sheldon,5," Ah, Sweden. Yeah, home of my favourite Muppet and, uh, second favourite meatball. Okay, the Nordic reputation for lack of humour is well-founded. Boy, is his name Gunderson or No-Funderson?",7
32401,Amy,5," Where are we going with this, Dr. Cooper?",7
32402,Sheldon,5," Oh, please, I‰Ûªm your boyfriend. You call me Sheldon. That‰Ûªs right, I am in a boy-girl relationship with this cute little lump of wool.",7
32403,Amy,5, Sheldon.,7
32404,Sheldon,5," It‰Ûªs a physical relationship, too. Hand-holding, hugging, even on hot days. Ow. Okay, here‰Ûªs a new one. Apparently now we kick each other in the shin under the table. How do you like it when I do it to you? Not so much, huh?",7
32405,Scene,5, Amy‰Ûªs lab.,7
32406,Amy,5," Test subject D7, aka Betsy, fear response study. Image number one, Frenchman on bicycle carrying baguettes. No visible reaction. Image number two, sousaphone. Still no reaction. Okay. Let‰Ûªs kick things up a notch. Image number three, crocodile with a mouthful of monkeys. Okay, now we‰Ûªre talking.",7
32407,Sheldon,5, Dr. Fowler?,7
32408,Amy,5," What do you want, Sheldon?",7
32409,Sheldon,5," Well, I‰Ûªm done with work, so‰Û_ ugh!",7
32410,Amy,5," Oh, sorry, sorry, sorry. Sorry, uh, better?",7
32411,Sheldon,5," Oh, baguettes. Yes, I like baguettes. What exactly are you doing?",7
32412,Amy,5, Determining baseline fear levels in capuchin monkeys by measuring their response to visual stimuli.,7
32413,Sheldon,5," So, goofing off. As I was saying, I‰Ûªm done with work and Leonard‰Ûªs not. So good news, you get to take me home. Play your cards right, I‰Ûªll let you drive me past the lot where the buses park at night.",7
32414,Amy,5," I can‰Ûªt leave now, Sheldon. I‰Ûªm very busy. Besides, why would I want to do you a favour after the way you treated me in the cafeteria? Image number four, boa constrictor. ",7
32415,Sheldon,5, What on earth are you talking about? My behaviour in the cafeteria was delightful. Maybe your friend Gunderson needs to head over to IKEA and assemble a sense of humour.,7
32416,Amy,5," You embarrassed me in front of my colleagues on my first day here. Image number five, kitten in a teacup.",7
32417,Sheldon,5, Aw. Embarrassed you?,7
32418,Amy,5, You know what? I don‰Ûªt have time for this. Find another way home.,7
32419,Sheldon,5, I‰Ûªm starting to get the sense that you‰Ûªre angry with me.,7
32420,Amy,5, Really? What tipped you off?,7
32421,Sheldon,5," Couple things, actually. Your tone of voice, your body language‰Û_",7
32422,Amy,5, Get out.,7
32423,Sheldon,5," Well, now, that.",7
32424,Amy,5," Image number six, woman giving birth.",7
32425,Sheldon,5, Bleugh!,7
32426,Scene,5, The apartment.,7
32427,Leonard,5," It‰Ûªs nine o‰Ûªclock, where you been?",7
32428,Sheldon,5," Oh, I had to take the bus home. Fell asleep and missed my stop.",7
32429,Penny,5," Oh, no.",7
32430,Sheldon,5, Did you know that Los Angeles has a Little Sri Lanka?,7
32431,Leonard,5, I did not.,7
32432,Sheldon,5," Well, I do now. They‰Ûªre a lovely people. Although terrifying when you wake up face-to-face with them. If you‰Ûªre hungry, I brought home some mutton and coconut milk.",7
32433,Penny,5, Why‰Ûªd you get that? You hate lamb.,7
32434,Sheldon,5," I was asking for directions. Apparently, there was a communication problem.",7
32435,Leonard,5, I thought Amy was gonna drive you home.,7
32436,Sheldon,5," Yeah, I thought so, too, but she‰Ûªs acting very strangely. I was discussing it with a Sri Lankan fellow on the bus, and he hypothesized that a tiger may have recently run across her shadow. Although he may have just been trying to drum up business for his brother-in-law‰Ûªs witch doctor practice.",7
32437,Penny,5," Okay, Sheldon, what happened between you and Amy?",7
32438,Sheldon,5," Well, can you believe she said I embarrassed her?",7
32439,Penny,5, Yeah.,7
32440,Sheldon,5, But you didn‰Ûªt even hear the details.,7
32441,Leonard,5," Sheldon, I‰Ûªve known you a long time, and I‰Ûªm going to tell you this with all the love I can possibly muster. Amy‰Ûªs right. You‰Ûªre wrong.",7
32442,Sheldon,5, But you don‰Ûªt even know‰Û_,7
32443,Leonard,5, Doesn‰Ûªt matter.,7
32444,Sheldon,5," But, now, but in my defence‰Û_",7
32445,Leonard,5, Doesn‰Ûªt matter.,7
32446,Sheldon,5, You‰Ûªre not listening to my side of it.,7
32447,Penny,5," Okay, fine, Sheldon. What is your side?",7
32448,Sheldon,5, Well‰Û_,7
32449,Penny,5," Nope, got to go with Amy on this one.",7
32450,Scene,5, Raj‰Ûªs apartment.,7
32451,Howard,5," Ooh, shrimp was spicy.",7
32452,Raj,5, You want a TUMS?,7
32453,Howard,5, You got the tropical fruit kind?,7
32454,Raj,5," No, if I buy those, I just go through them like candy.",7
32455,Howard,5," Tell me about it. One time, I swear I pooped out a stick of chalk. (Knock on door) I‰Ûªll get it.",7
32456,Raj,5, Thanks.,7
32457,Bernadette,5, Hi.,7
32458,Howard,5," Oh, hi.",7
32459,Bernadette,5, I may have overreacted.,7
32460,Howard,5," Yeah, well, I didn‰Ûªt handle it so great, either.",7
32461,Bernadette,5, It‰Ûªs just sometimes I feel like you enjoy spending time with your friends more than with me.,7
32462,Howard,5, That‰Ûªs not true.,7
32463,Bernadette,5," It‰Ûªs not? You spend all day together at work, and then you all hang out at night playing games, going to the comic book store. Last week, you two got a couples massage. So, when you said you wouldn‰Ûªt want to spend that much time with me, it really hurt my feelings.",7
32464,Howard,5," Oh, wow. Yeah, no, I get that. I‰Ûªm so sorry. Starting tomorrow, I am turning over a new leaf. Time with you is my number one priority.",7
32465,Bernadette,5, Why tomorrow?,7
32466,Howard,5," Well, we‰Ûªre real close to finishing off the new Batman game.",7
32467,Raj,5," It is awesome. Uh, you should probably go after her.",7
32468,Howard,5, Should I go after you?,7
32469,Bernadette (off),5, No!,7
32470,Howard,5, Thanks for getting me in trouble.,7
32471,Scene,5, Amy‰Ûªs apartment.,7
32472,Sheldon,5," (Knock, knock, knock) Amy. (Knock, knock, knock) Amy. (Knock, knock, knock) Amy.",7
32473,Amy,5," Sheldon, what are you doing here so late?",7
32474,Sheldon,5," I couldn‰Ûªt sleep because I kept thinking about what happened earlier between us. Also, I had one heck of a bus nap. Oh, speaking of which, do you want some mutton and coconut milk?",7
32475,Amy,5, No.,7
32476,Sheldon,5," Well, I cannot give this stuff away.",7
32477,Amy,5, What do you want?,7
32478,Sheldon,5," Amy, this isn‰Ûªt easy to say. All relationships are difficult, but even more so when you‰Ûªre in one with a person who struggles with everyday social interactions. And frankly, who can strike some people as being kind of a weirdo.",7
32479,Amy,5," Sheldon, you‰Ûªre not a weirdo.",7
32480,Sheldon,5," I wasn‰Ûªt speaking about me. I mean, honestly, there‰Ûªs no telling what will set you off. You know, introducing myself as your boyfriend. Giving you the opportunity to drive me home. Breaking the ice with your colleagues using ethnic humour, the funniest kind of humour.",7
32481,Amy,5, What‰Ûªs your point?,7
32482,Sheldon,5," My point is, we‰Ûªre a couple, and I like you for who you are, quirks and all.",7
32483,Amy,5," I like you, too.",7
32484,Sheldon,5," Well, I should hope so. I don‰Ûªt see anyone else banging on this door to put up with your nonsense. Not even a good-bye? You see, that‰Ûªs the kind of thing that makes people think you‰Ûªre weird. Poor kid. She just doesn‰Ûªt see it.",7
32485,Scene,5, The Cheesecake Factory Bar.,7
32486,Bernadette,5, I‰Ûªm not apologizing to Howard. He can come beg me on his knees.,7
32487,Amy,5," Sheldon, too. If I see him at work, I‰Ûªm just going to ignore him.",7
32488,Penny,5," All right, don‰Ûªt worry. I talked to Leonard. He is gonna sit the guys down and set them straight.",7
32489,Scene,5, The apartment. ,7
32490,Leonard,5, Laser‰Ûªs warmed up.,7
32491,Howard,5, Pull.,7
32492,All,5, Yeah!,7
32493,Scene,6, The Cheesecake Factory,7
32494,Penny,6, What are you working on?,7
32495,Sheldon,6, Can‰Ûªt talk. In the zone.,7
32496,Penny,6, Do you know what he‰Ûªs doing?,7
32497,Amy,6," Could be anything. Last time he was like this, he figured out electron transport in graphene. The time before that, he was making a list of who‰Ûªs allowed in his tree fort if fe ever gets one. Still can‰Ûªt believe I didn‰Ûªt make the cut.",7
32498,Penny,6," Uh, Sheldon, you want to take a break? Your food‰Ûªs ready.",7
32499,Leonard,6," No, no, what are you doing? He‰Ûªs both happy and quiet. It‰Ûªs like seeing a unicorn and Bigfoot at the same time.",7
32500,Howard,6, Sorry we‰Ûªre so late. Bernadette got stuck at work.,7
32501,Bernadette,6, Great news. A raccoon virus just crossed the species barrier and now can infect humans.,7
32502,Raj,6, Why is that great news?,7
32503,Bernadette,6," In the pharmaceutical business we have a saying, mo‰Ûª infections, mo‰Ûª money.",7
32504,Howard,6," Wait, Maybe you want to wash your little raccoon hands first.",7
32505,Bernadette,6," Oh, calm down. If I had it, I‰Ûªd be dead already.",7
32506,Howard,6," Guys, listen up. ",7
32507,Sheldon,6," Can‰Ûªt listen, zone. Also don‰Ûªt care.",7
32508,Howard,6, Next week is the anniversary of my first date with Bernadette.,7
32509,Sheldon,6, Really don‰Ûªt care.,7
32510,Howard,6," I want to do something special, and I was hoping you guys could be a part of it.",7
32511,Penny,6," Aw, what horrible thing are you trying to make up for?",7
32512,Howard,6, Just putting something in the bank for what horrible thing I do next.,7
32513,Penny,6, Ah.,7
32514,Howard,6," Look, she‰Ûªs gonna be back any second, so here‰Ûªs the deal. I‰Ûªm writing a song, and I was hoping we could all play it for her together.",7
32515,Leonard,6, Aw.,7
32516,Amy,6," Oh, I love that.",7
32517,Raj,6, That is so beautiful.,7
32518,Howard,6, Sheldon?,7
32519,Sheldon,6, When did we get to the Cheesecake Factory?,7
32520,Scene,6, The stairwell,7
32521,Leonard,6, It‰Ûªs really sweet what Howard wants to do for Bernadette.,7
32522,Penny,6," Yeah. Hey, how come you‰Ûªve never done anything romantic to celebrate our first date?",7
32523,Leonard,6," Well, for starters, you‰Ûªve broken up with me so many times, which first date are we talking about?",7
32524,Sheldon,6," Ooh, somebody call the burn ward. And back to the zone.",7
32525,Leonard,6," And besides, I do romantic things for you all the time. Can you even name one romantic thing you‰Ûªve done for me?",7
32526,Penny,6, I can name tons.,7
32527,Leonard,6, Sex doesn‰Ûªt count.,7
32528,Penny,6," Oh. I know, what about that bed-and-breakfast?",7
32529,Leonard,6," Well, I took you there. All you did was‰Û_",7
32530,Penny,6," I know what I did. I bet they had to throw out that rocking chair. You know, I can be romantic if I want to.",7
32531,Leonard,6, It‰Ûªs fine. And also not true.,7
32532,Penny,6," Okay, just you wait and see. I‰Ûªm gonna romance your freakin‰Ûª ass off.",7
32533,Leonard,6, That‰Ûªs beautiful. Is that Shakespeare?,7
32534,Penny,6, Sheldon?,7
32535,Sheldon,6, Zone.,7
32536,Leonard,6, He‰Ûªll figure it out when he falls off the roof.,7
32537,Scene,6, The apartment. ,7
32538,Leonard,6," Sheldon, I know you‰Ûªre in the zone, but do you want some tea? All right, I can‰Ûªt believe I‰Ûªm gonna say this, but you haven‰Ûªt spoken in hours and I‰Ûªm starting to get worried. Please say something.",7
32539,Sheldon,6," Leonard, prepare to be humbled and weep at the glory of my genius.",7
32540,Leonard,6," Nope, it was better before.",7
32541,Sheldon,6," Look at it. I feel like my mind just made a baby. And it‰Ûªs beautiful. It‰Ûªs not like human babies, which are loud and covered in goop.",7
32542,Leonard,6," Holy crap, Sheldon, did you just figure out a method for synthesizing a new stable super-heavy element?",7
32543,Sheldon,6," Did I? Well, that can‰Ûªt be right. No one‰Ûªs ever done that before. Except me, because I just did it. Sheldon and his brain, yeah. Sheldon and his brain, yeah. Sheldon and his brain, yeah. Sheldon and his brain, yeah. Sheldon and his brain‰Û_",7
32544,Leonard,6," Yeah, definitely better before.",7
32545,Scene,6, The cafeteria.,7
32546,Howard,6, So I‰Ûªm almost done writing the song for Bernadette. Are you cool playing the cello?,7
32547,Leonard,6," If by cool you mean willing to, yes. If by cool you mean cool, clearly you‰Ûªve never seen me play the cello.",7
32548,Howard,6, Great. Will you play the ukulele?,7
32549,Raj,6, Of course. I‰Ûªd be happy to shred it on my ax.,7
32550,Howard,6," Or you could just play your tiny, ridiculous guitar.",7
32551,Raj,6, Fine. I will melt her heart. And her face.,7
32552,Sheldon,6," Gentlemen. Uh, no doubt you heard about my little breakthrough. Now, if your plan is to hoist me on your shoulders and carry me around the cafeteria, please refrain. I don‰Ûªt care for heights, motion sickness or the thought of your necks touching my buttocks. ",7
32553,Howard,6," Seriously, congratulations, Sheldon.",7
32554,Raj,6," Yeah, I read your paper online. That technique for creating a new heavy element is inspired.",7
32555,Sheldon,6," Oh, well, thank you. Believe it or not, I just learned a Chinese research team at the Hubei Institute for Nuclear Physics ran a test on a cyclotron, and the results were extremely promising.",7
32556,Leonard,6," Sheldon, that‰Ûªs incredible.",7
32557,Sheldon,6," Yeah, I know. They called it the greatest thing since the Communist party. Although I‰Ûªm pretty sure that the Communist party made them say that. I like China. See, they know how to keep people in line.",7
32558,Howard,6," So, what happens next?",7
32559,Sheldon,6," Oh, more testing, more success, more fame. Yeah, but don‰Ûªt worry, I will remain the same down-to-earth humble Joe I‰Ûªve always been.",7
32560,Leonard,6, Good to know.,7
32561,Sheldon,6," Now give me that cookie, I discovered an element.",7
32562,Scene,6, Penny‰Ûªs apartment. ,7
32563,Penny,6, Thank you so much for coming.,7
32564,Raj,6, You called the right person. I believe I have the perfect romantic evening for you to give Leonard.,7
32565,Penny,6," Okay, good, ‰Ûªcause I‰Ûªve been really struggling with this.",7
32566,Raj,6," As I‰Ûªm sure you‰Ûªre aware, the quickest way to a man‰Ûªs heart is through his‰Û_",7
32567,Penny,6," Pants, but Leonard says sex doesn‰Ûªt count.",7
32568,Raj,6," Oh. You poor thing. You have one arrow in your quiver, and you just can‰Ûªt use it. Fortunately, another pathway to a man‰Ûªs heart is through his stomach. ",7
32569,Penny,6," I don‰Ûªt know if I want to cook for him. He‰Ûªs kind of a picky eater. I mean, it‰Ûªs too salty, it‰Ûªs too dry, it‰Ûªs too burnt and frozen at the same time. Okay, come on, what else would sweep you off your feet?",7
32570,Raj,6," Well, I‰Ûªve always had this fantasy that involves dancing. The sexual chemistry between my partner and me is electric. But boy, oh, boy, does my father not approve until he sees us in the big dance competition.",7
32571,Penny,6," Okay, that‰Ûªs just the plot for Dirty Dancing. What else would you love? Other than being lifted over Patrick Swayze‰Ûªs head.",7
32572,Raj,6," Oh, oh, uh, you could, uh, stand outside his window with a boom box in the air.",7
32573,Penny,6, That‰Ûªs from Say Anything.,7
32574,Raj,6," Look, I‰Ûªm a lonely guy, I watch a lot of movies. Look, Penny, if you truly want to be romantic, it needs to come from you.",7
32575,Penny,6," I get that, but why is this so hard?",7
32576,Raj,6," Well, you‰Ûªve probably never had to do this stuff ‰Ûªcause you‰Ûªre young and beautiful and men have always thrown themselves at you.",7
32577,Penny,6," Yeah, I‰Ûªm trying to be sad about that. I can‰Ûªt.",7
32578,Scene,6, The apartment.,7
32579,Sheldon,6," Let‰Ûªs see, what‰Ûªs next? Okay, here. This is the Magic Marker I was using when I made the discovery.",7
32580,Amy,6, I don‰Ûªt think the Smithsonian‰Ûªs gonna want your marker. ,7
32581,Sheldon,6," And that‰Ûªs why you‰Ûªre not on a list for my tree fort. Ooh, guess who‰Ûªs getting an article written about him in Physics Today? I‰Ûªll give you a hint. You measured the diameter of his suspicious mole yesterday.",7
32582,Amy,6," Sheldon, I‰Ûªm so proud of you.",7
32583,Sheldon,6," Well, you should be. My discovery is spreading like wildfire. Unlike my mole, which is holding steady at the size of a navy bean.",7
32584,Amy,6, What‰Ûªs next?,7
32585,Sheldon,6, This is the very copy of The Handbook of Chemistry and Physics in which I looked up the reaction rates of mendelevium and‰Û_,7
32586,Amy,6, And what?,7
32587,Sheldon,6," No. No, no, no, no.",7
32588,Amy,6, What‰Ûªs wrong?,7
32589,Sheldon,6, I‰Ûªve made a horrible mistake.,7
32590,Amy,6, What are you talking about?,7
32591,Sheldon,6," This table, it‰Ûªs in square centimetres. I read it as square metres. You know what that means?",7
32592,Amy,6, That Americans can‰Ûªt handle the metric system?,7
32593,Sheldon,6," Amy, I was off by a factor of 10,000. ",7
32594,Amy,6, But the Chinese team found the element.,7
32595,Sheldon,6," Yeah, well, they shouldn‰Ûªt have. My calculations were wrong. There must be some resonance between the elements I didn‰Ûªt know about.",7
32596,Amy,6, So you just got lucky?,7
32597,Sheldon,6, Sheldon Cooper does not get lucky.,7
32598,Amy,6," You and me both, brother. It doesn‰Ûªt matter. The element was found because of you, and that‰Ûªs groundbreaking.",7
32599,Sheldon,6," What matters is the greatest scientific achievement of my life is based on a blunder. I‰Ûªm not a genius, I‰Ûªm a fraud.",7
32600,Amy,6," You know, Sheldon, in neuroscience, we‰Ûªre forever finding something in one part of the brain that we thought was someplace else.",7
32601,Sheldon,6," Oh, great. Now I‰Ûªm worse than a fraud. I‰Ûªm practically a biologist.",7
32602,Scene,6, Leonard‰Ûªs car.,7
32603,Sheldon,6, There‰Ûªs nothing happy about it. I‰Ûªm being given credit that I don‰Ûªt deserve. ,7
32604,Leonard,6," Oh, people get things they don‰Ûªt deserve all the time. Look at me with you. ",7
32605,Sheldon,6," No, Leonard, this is going to haunt me for the rest of my life. Every science classroom, every periodic table, every textbook, this mistake will be staring back at me. Like that time you let Koothrappali wax your eyebrows. I‰Ûªve got to find a way to stop this thing.",7
32606,Leonard,6," Buddy, I don‰Ûªt think you can. I mean, once it‰Ûªs out there, it‰Ûªs out there. This thing is like the science equivalent of a sex tape.",7
32607,Sheldon,6," You know, frankly, I‰Ûªd prefer a sex tape.",7
32608,Leonard,6," You don‰Ûªt know what a sex tape is, do you?",7
32609,Sheldon,6, No.,7
32610,Scene,6, The cafeteria.,7
32611,Howard,6, Make sure you guys get to the restaurant by eight. Bernadette‰Ûªs meeting me there at eight thirty and I don‰Ûªt want to blow the surprise.,7
32612,Leonard,6, We‰Ûªll be there.,7
32613,Raj,6," Got it. Now, uh, I have a question about the song. I was thinking at some point I could bust out a little rap.",7
32614,Howard,6, E-Ni-Ni-Ni-Ni-No.,7
32615,Raj,6," Come on, come on, you haven‰Ûªt even heard it yet. Leonard, give me a beat.",7
32616,Leonard,6, I will not.,7
32617,Raj,6," Oh, please?",7
32618,Howard,6," No, I want this to be romantic.",7
32619,Raj,6," It will be. I don‰Ûªt call anyone a ho, and the only time I use the phrase my bitch, I‰Ûªm referring to you.",7
32620,Voice,6, There he is. (General applause) ,7
32621,Sheldon,6, Stop it. Stop celebrating me.,7
32622,Voice,6, Woo!,7
32623,Sheldon,6," And no woos. Oh, not you, Dr. Woo. You‰Ûªre fine. I want you all to know that you have no reason to applaud me. My so-called breakthrough wasn‰Ûªt the result of my genius. It was nothing more than a boneheaded mistake. So please refrain from praising me for it in the future.",7
32624,Raj,6," Wait, I don‰Ûªt understand. They didn‰Ûªt find the element?",7
32625,Sheldon,6," Oh, no, they found the element. (More applause) No, no, stop it. I don‰Ûªt need to take this admiration from the likes of you people. How do I make them stop loving me?",7
32626,Leonard,6, Invite them to live with us.,7
32627,Scene,6, A restaurant.,7
32628,Penny,6," Boy, Bernadette is gonna love this.",7
32629,Leonard,6, Yeah. It must be nice to have someone do something so romantic.,7
32630,Penny,6," Okay, you know what‰Ûªs not romantic? Rubbing it in someone‰Ûªs face.",7
32631,Leonard,6," Actually, it can be, but I told you sex doesn‰Ûªt count.",7
32632,Howard,6, I‰Ûªm getting worried about Bernadette. I‰Ûªm gonna call and check on her.,7
32633,Sheldon,6, The National Science Foundation wants to give me a substantial grant.,7
32634,Raj,6," Oh, that‰Ûªs a big deal.",7
32635,Sheldon,6, I know. When will this nightmare end?,7
32636,Leonard,6," Hey, I get that you feel bad about all the attention, but still, what you did is amazing. We‰Ûªre really proud of you.",7
32637,Amy,6, I‰Ûªm not.,7
32638,Sheldon,6, You‰Ûªre not?,7
32639,Amy,6," Sheldon, I‰Ûªve been thinking about it, and you‰Ûªre right. You don‰Ûªt deserve any credit. All you did was misread some numbers on a table. A very easy table, too. Honestly, I‰Ûªm embarrassed for you.",7
32640,Sheldon,6, That‰Ûªs the most romantic thing I‰Ûªve ever heard.,7
32641,Penny,6," Damn it, everyone‰Ûªs better at this than me.",7
32642,Sheldon,6," Congratulations, Dr. Fowler. You just made the fort.",7
32643,Howard,6," Guys, there was an accident at Bernie‰Ûªs lab.",7
32644,Leonard,6," Oh, my God, is she okay?",7
32645,Howard,6," Yeah, but she‰Ûªs at the hospital in quarantine.",7
32646,Penny,6, What?,7
32647,Amy,6, Poor Bernadette.,7
32648,Leonard,6," Oh, no.",7
32649,Sheldon,6," I hate to pile on the bad news, but I just got a raise.",7
32650,Scene,6, The hospital. ,7
32651,Howard,6," Oh, my God, Bernie, what happened?",7
32652,Bernadette,6," Well, let‰Ûªs just say the next time you move a dozen vials of raccoon virus to the fridge, make two trips. ",7
32653,Howard,6, You‰Ûªre sure you‰Ûªre okay?,7
32654,Bernadette,6," Yeah, it‰Ûªs just a precaution. If there was a problem, I‰Ûªd be throwing up out of my eyeballs by now. Sorry I messed up our date.",7
32655,Howard,6," Oh, don‰Ûªt worry about it. I brought the date here. Guys, come on in.",7
32656,Bernadette,6, What‰Ûªs all this?,7
32657,Howard,6," Well, tonight is the anniversary of our first date, and I wanted to celebrate it by writing a song for you.",7
32658,Bernadette,6, Howie.,7
32659,Amy,6," Sheldon, get over here.",7
32660,Sheldon,6, She might be contagious. Don‰Ûªt you think I‰Ûªm having a rough enough day?,7
32661,Amy,6, Sheldon.,7
32662,Howard (singing),6," If I didn‰Ûªt have you, life would be blue, I‰Ûªd be Dr. Who without the TARDIS.",7
32663,Sheldon,6," Is it me, or does she not look so good?",7
32664,Amy,6, Shh.,7
32665,Howard,6," A candle without a wick, a Watson without a Crick, I‰Ûªd be one of my outfits without a dick-ie. I‰Ûªd be cheese without the mac, Jobs without the Wozniak, I‰Ûªd be solving exponential equations that use bases not found on your calculator making it much harder to crack. I‰Ûªd be an atom without a bomb, a dot without the com, and I‰Ûªd probably still live with my mom.",7
32666,All,6, And he‰Ûªd probably still live with his mom.,7
32667,Howard,6," Ever since I met you, you turned my world around. You supported all my dreams and all my hopes. You‰Ûªre like uranium-235 and I‰Ûªm uranium-238, almost inseparable isotopes. I couldn‰Ûªt have imagined how good my life would get from the moment that I met you Bernadette.",7
32668,Bernadette,6," Oh, Howie.",7
32669,Howard,6," If I didn‰Ûªt have you life would be dreary, I‰Ûªd be string theory without any string. I‰Ûªd be binary code without a one, a cathode ray tube without an electron gun. I‰Ûªd be Firefly, Buffy and Avengers without Joss Whedon. I‰Ûªd speak a lot more Klingon, Heghlu‰ÛªmeH QaQ jajvam. ",7
32670,All,6, And he‰Ûªd definitely still live with his mom.,7
32671,Howard,6," Ever since I met you, you turned my world around. You‰Ûªre my best friend and my lover. We‰Ûªre like changing electric and magnetic fields. You can‰Ûªt have one without the other. I couldn‰Ûªt have imagined how good my life would get from the moment that I met you, Bernadette.",7
32672,All,6," Oh, we couldn‰Ûªt have imagined how good our lives would get from the moment that we met you, Bernadette.",7
32673,Bernadette,6," Howie, that was amazing. Look, I‰Ûªm shaking.",7
32674,Sheldon,6," She‰Ûªs sick, I knew it. Bye.",7
32675,Scene,6, Penny‰Ûªs apartment. ,7
32676,Leonard,6," I have to say, this is the best Top Ramen you‰Ûªve ever made.",7
32677,Penny,6," I discovered a secret ingredient. The flavour packet. That sucker is well named. All right, lover boy, get ready, ‰Ûªcause there is a crap storm of romance coming your way.",7
32678,Leonard,6," Stop it, you‰Ûªre gonna make me cry. All right. You seem pretty confident.",7
32679,Penny,6," Oh, I am. Maybe if you follow this trail, you‰Ûªll see why.",7
32680,Leonard,6," Oh, rose petals.",7
32681,Penny,6, Yes. The most beautiful and shockingly expensive of all the flowers.,7
32682,Leonard,6, You made the bed? You really are pulling out all the stops.,7
32683,Penny,6," Okay, I gave this a lot of thought, and I finally found something to show you how much I love you.",7
32684,Leonard,6," Oh, wow.",7
32685,Penny,6, It‰Ûªs a first edition of Hitchhiker‰Ûªs Guide to the Galaxy. I remember it was your favourite book growing up.,7
32686,Leonard,6," This is great. It, thank you, it‰Ûªs, so much.",7
32687,Penny,6, What?,7
32688,Leonard,6, Nothing. I love it.,7
32689,Penny,6, No. Something‰Ûªs going on. What‰Ûªs wrong with it? I remember you saying how great it would be to have a first edition.,7
32690,Leonard,6," It‰Ûªs true, I did. I did say that. When we were at the used bookstore together and I saw the first edition and I bought it.",7
32691,Penny,6," Oh, my God, I am the worst.",7
32692,Leonard,6," No, no, it‰Ûªs okay. It‰Ûªs really thoughtful.",7
32693,Penny,6," No, it‰Ûªs not. I mean, what‰Ûªs thoughtful is everything you do. Here, you know what? Look at this. Look, here‰Ûªs the, the plane ticket you bought me when I was too poor to go home for the holidays. And the rose you left on my windshield just because. Here‰Ûªs the, the thank-you letter you wrote me after the first time I slept with you. All 11 pages of it.",7
32694,Leonard,6, I can‰Ûªt believe you saved all this stuff.,7
32695,Penny,6, Of course I did. It‰Ûªs you.,7
32696,Leonard,6, Come here.,7
32697,Penny,6, Oh.,7
32698,Leonard,6, Is that a pregnancy test?,7
32699,Penny,6," Oh, yeah, just the first one. I didn‰Ûªt save them all.",7
32700,Scene,6, The apartment.,7
32701,Sheldon,6, I can‰Ûªt believe I read this table wrong. I blame you.,7
32702,Amy,6, Me? What did I do?,7
32703,Sheldon,6, You distract me. I‰Ûªve been distracted since the moment I met you. ,7
32704,Amy,6, Sorry.,7
32705,Sheldon,6," Well, you should be. Because all I can think about is how much I want to kiss you. And not just on the cheek, but on the mouth. Like mommies and daddies do.",7
32706,Amy,6," Oh, Sheldon.",7
32707,"Sheldon (not in Amy‰Ûªs daydream, now in the Cheesecake Factory)",6, Amy? Amy? Did you hear what I said?,7
32708,Amy,6," Can‰Ûªt talk, in the zone.",7
32709,Scene,7, A supermarket,7
32710,Amy,7, I‰Ûªve never seen him this happy before.,7
32711,Leonard,7, That‰Ûªs because you‰Ûªve never seen him on restock the medicine cabinet day.,7
32712,Sheldon,7, Look. A new topical antihistamine with lidocaine. Wow. I can‰Ûªt wait until I get a rash. ,7
32713,Leonard,7," Oh, Gas-X has a new ultra strength. I guess they really do read their mail.",7
32714,Sheldon,7," Hey, isn‰Ûªt that Professor Proton?",7
32715,Leonard,7," Oh, yeah.",7
32716,Sheldon,7," Look at him, just standing in line like he wasn‰Ûªt moderately famous 30 years ago. Let‰Ûªs go say hello.",7
32717,Leonard,7," Oh, maybe we shouldn‰Ûªt bother him.",7
32718,Sheldon,7," I‰Ûªm not going to bother him, I‰Ûªm going to talk to him.",7
32719,Leonard,7, He thinks there‰Ûªs a difference.,7
32720,Sheldon,7," Arthur? Arthur, it‰Ûªs me, Sheldon Cooper. You may not remember because of your advanced age.",7
32721,Arthur,7," Trust me, I, I remember.",7
32722,Sheldon,7," This is my girlfriend, Amy. Amy, this is television legend Arthur Jeffries. His science show inspired millions of children.",7
32723,Arthur,7," Hold, hold, hold on. You, you have a girlfriend?",7
32724,Amy,7," Yes, and I‰Ûªve heard so much about you. Hey look, we‰Ûªre wearing the same orthopaedic shoes. I can‰Ûªt believe I dress like a celebrity.",7
32725,Arthur,7," Oh, okay, I get it now.",7
32726,Leonard,7," Dr. Jeffries, hello again. Leonard Hofstadter.",7
32727,Arthur,7," Oh, oh, right, I remember your, your girlfriend. Is, is she, is she here?",7
32728,Leonard,7," No, she‰Ûªs not.",7
32729,Sheldon,7," So, what prescription are you getting filled?",7
32730,Leonard,7, Sheldon.,7
32731,Sheldon,7," No. Wait, I want to guess. Don‰Ûªt tell me.",7
32732,Arthur,7, I wasn‰Ûªt going to tell you.,7
32733,Amy,7," Sheldon, come on.",7
32734,Sheldon,7," No, no, no. I‰Ûªm really good at this. All right, give me a hint. Does it involve difficulty initiating a stream of anything?",7
32735,Arthur,7," Well, given my age, that‰Ûªs more than just a lucky guess.",7
32736,Leonard,7," Hey, Sheldon, let‰Ûªs go mock the people buying homeopathic medicine, you love that.",7
32737,Sheldon,7," But I‰Ûªm hanging out with my friend, and we‰Ûªre having fun. Look how happy he is.",7
32738,Howard,7, Bernie‰Ûªs having a girls‰Ûª night on Friday at our place. You want to do something?,7
32739,Raj,7," Actually, I‰Ûªm busy.",7
32740,Howard,7, Doing what?,7
32741,Raj,7, There‰Ûªs a new sports bar over on Colorado Ave‰Û_,7
32742,Howard,7, You‰Ûªre going to girls‰Ûª night.,7
32743,Raj,7, Yeah.,7
32744,Howard,7, You know they‰Ûªre making jewellery right?,7
32745,Raj,7, You think they came up with that? They were going to drink beer and play darts.,7
32746,Leonard,7, What‰Ûªs up?,7
32747,Howard,7, Not his testosterone levels.,7
32748,Raj,7, Excuse me. I happen to be very comfortable with my masculinity.,7
32749,Howard,7, How is that possible?,7
32750,Leonard,7," Hey, I got an email from Professor Proton.",7
32751,Sheldon,7, Goody. What‰Ûªs it say?,7
32752,Leonard,7," He‰Ûªs working on a paper about nano vacuum tubes, and wants to know if I‰Ûªd take a look at it.",7
32753,Sheldon,7," That‰Ûªs strange. That he would come to you for that and not me. Oh, I got two emails from him. Do you have Leonard‰Ûªs email address? And. Never mind, I found it. I can‰Ûªt believe he picked you over me.",7
32754,Howard,7, You don‰Ûªt want to read a paper by some old has-been who hasn‰Ûªt done any real science in decades.,7
32755,Raj,7," Yeah, it‰Ûªs nothing to cry about.",7
32756,Sheldon,7, Sheldon Cooper does not cry.,7
32757,Howard,7," It‰Ûªs true, you‰Ûªd rust.",7
32758,Scene,7, The apartment.,7
32759,Sheldon,7, And to think I idolized that man. And why? At the end of the day he‰Ûªs just another Hollywood phony.,7
32760,Amy,7, Is it really worth getting upset about?,7
32761,Sheldon,7," Yeah, they say don‰Ûªt meet your heroes. Don‰Ûªt peek behind that curtain of fame and celebrity, because if you do, you‰Ûªll see them as they really are, degenerate carnival folk.",7
32762,Amy,7," Come on, he‰Ûªs a retired kids show host.",7
32763,Sheldon,7, That‰Ûªs even worse. Using the sweet candy of science to trick children into loving him. Pervert.,7
32764,Amy,7, Have you ever thought about why Arthur didn‰Ûªt want you to read his paper?,7
32765,Sheldon,7," Yes, I have. And my only conclusion is the prescription he was picking up the other day was for cuckoo pills.",7
32766,Amy,7," Maybe he found you, um, a bit much.",7
32767,Sheldon,7," That‰Ûªs kind of a stretch. Look, when it comes to social skills, I‰Ûªve mastered the big three. There‰Ûªs the coy smile. There‰Ûªs the friendly chuckle. There‰Ûªs the vocalization of sympathy. Aw. That last one‰Ûªs tricky, I‰Ûªm still working on it.",7
32768,Amy,7," From what I saw the other day, I could understand why he and some people might find you‰Û_",7
32769,Sheldon,7, What?,7
32770,Amy,7, Doesn‰Ûªt matter.,7
32771,Sheldon,7," No, go ahead, say it. I know what it is. I‰Ûªve heard it my whole life. The word‰Ûªs annoying. Go ahead, say it. Say it. Say I‰Ûªm annoying.",7
32772,Amy,7, Sheldon.,7
32773,Sheldon,7," Oh, it won‰Ûªt hurt my feelings. Go ahead, Amy, say I‰Ûªm annoying. I‰Ûªm annoying. I‰Ûªm annoying. I‰Ûªm annoying. Yeah, now, uh, now where are you going? Look, you know you want to say it, say it. Say I‰Ûªm annoying. Go ahead, say it. Say it. Say it. Amy, say it. Well, she can‰Ûªt stand it when I‰Ûªm right.",7
32774,Scene,7, Howard and Bernadette‰Ûªs apartment. ,7
32775,Amy,7, This is fun. I‰Ûªm going to feel like such a vixen wearing jewellery that doesn‰Ûªt have a list of medications I‰Ûªm allergic to.,7
32776,Raj,7," Penny, how‰Ûªs it going over there?",7
32777,Penny,7," Good, I‰Ûªm just having little trouble with the glue.",7
32778,Amy,7, How do you not know how to use glue? Did you ditch pre-school?,7
32779,Penny,7," Yeah, but only because I was dating a second grader.",7
32780,Howard,7," Hello, everyone.",7
32781,Raj,7," Okay, let me have it. Let‰Ûªs hear all the Raj is a girl jokes.",7
32782,Howard,7, Nope. Bernadette told me it isn‰Ûªt nice and I‰Ûªm not allowed.,7
32783,Raj,7, Thank you.,7
32784,Howard,7," So I won‰Ûªt be making fun of you, or the things you like, or the fact that you just want to have fu-un.",7
32785,Bernadette,7," Howie, stop. Come on, look at what I‰Ûªm making.",7
32786,Howard,7," Oh, that‰Ûªs actually pretty nice.",7
32787,Amy,7, I‰Ûªm making a bracelet.,7
32788,Penny,7," Yeah, I‰Ûªm just making a mess.",7
32789,Howard,7," You know, instead of beads and glue, you guys can use my soldering iron. You‰Ûªd be able to make much cooler stuff.",7
32790,Raj,7," Oh, I think we‰Ûªre doing just fine, thank you.",7
32791,Amy,7," Actually, I‰Ûªd kind of like to try that.",7
32792,Bernadette,7," Me, too.",7
32793,Howard,7, Be right back.,7
32794,Penny,7, When did I have pistachios?,7
32795,Scene,7, Professor Proton‰Ûªs house. ,7
32796,Sheldon,7," (Knock, knock, knock) Arthur. (Knock, knock, knock) Arthur. (Knock, knock, knock) Arthur. Door knocker. That‰Ûªs TV money.",7
32797,Arthur,7," Sheldon, what are you doing here?",7
32798,Sheldon,7," I‰Ûªm sorry, did I wake you?",7
32799,Arthur,7," Of course you woke me, it‰Ûªs seven thirty.",7
32800,Sheldon,7," Well, I would have been here sooner, but for some reason your home isn‰Ûªt on this map of Hollywood stars.",7
32801,Arthur,7," What do you want, Sheldon?",7
32802,Sheldon,7, It‰Ûªs been pointed out by my girlfriend that I may have been annoying to you.,7
32803,Arthur,7, She sounds like a keeper.,7
32804,Sheldon,7," Anyway, I wanted to apologize. I am truly sorry.",7
32805,Arthur,7," All right, apology accepted. Have a nice night.",7
32806,Sheldon,7," No, no, now that we‰Ûªve cleared the air, I wanted to discuss another matter with you.",7
32807,Arthur,7," Sheldon, in a couple hours I have to get up, pee and then wander around the house.",7
32808,Sheldon,7," Well, then, I‰Ûªll make this quick. Um, I want to talk about the paper you sent Leonard. Now, I know he said it‰Ûªs promising and he‰Ûªs going to collaborate on it, but now that you and I are friends again, I am at your disposal. And, um, frankly, lending my name and reputation to it will help, because a lot of people think that you‰Ûªre a washed-up has-been. Or dead.",7
32809,Arthur,7, I should be so lucky.,7
32810,Sheldon,7," So, uh, what do you say?",7
32811,Arthur,7," You know, if it‰Ûªs all the same with you, I, I think I‰Ûªll, I‰Ûªll stick with Leonard.",7
32812,Sheldon,7," It‰Ûªs because I‰Ûªm annoying, right? I know it is. Say it. Say it. Say I‰Ûªm annoying. ",7
32813,Arthur,7, Good night.,7
32814,Sheldon,7," Say it. Arthur, say it. Say I‰Ûªm annoying. Say it. Say it. I‰Ûªm annoying. Say it. ",7
32815,Arthur,7, You‰Ûªre annoying.,7
32816,Sheldon,7," Well, that really hurt. ",7
32817,Scene,7, Leonard‰Ûªs laboratory. ,7
32818,Leonard,7," If you would have told me when I was a kid that someday I would be doing science next to Professor Proton, I would not have believed you.",7
32819,Arthur,7," If someone had told me that people would still call me Professor Proton when I was 83 years old, I never would have quit smoking.",7
32820,Leonard,7," I‰Ûªm sorry, Dr. Jeffries, I‰Ûªm just excited. This nano vacuum tube idea of yours is, it‰Ûªs really interesting.",7
32821,Sheldon,7," Hello, Leonard. Oh, hello, Arthur. What an odd coincidence that you‰Ûªre both here.",7
32822,Leonard,7, Why is it odd?,7
32823,Sheldon,7," Because as it just so happens, I‰Ûªm also spending the day with a beloved children‰Ûªs television science personality. Isn‰Ûªt that right, new friend and colleague Bill Nye the Science Guy. Sorry, I replaced you with a newer model.",7
32824,Bill Nye,7," Wow, Arthur Jeffries. It‰Ûªs an honour to meet you. My show never would have happened without yours.",7
32825,Arthur,7, That‰Ûªs what I told my lawyers.,7
32826,Leonard,7," Mr. Nye, hello. I‰Ûªm sorry he got you involved in this nonsense.",7
32827,Bill,7, He said I‰Ûªd be speaking to a class.,7
32828,Sheldon,7," No, I said you were teaching someone a lesson. Now let‰Ûªs go.",7
32829,Bill,7, What are you guys working on?,7
32830,Leonard,7," Oh, uh, we‰Ûªre making nano vacuum tubes.",7
32831,Bill,7," Oh, that‰Ûªs interesting.",7
32832,Arthur,7," Haven‰Ûªt you stolen enough from me? Back off, bow tie.",7
32833,Scene,7, Penny‰Ûªs apartment. ,7
32834,Penny,7," Hey, guys, what do you think?",7
32835,Amy,7," Wow, Penny, good job.",7
32836,Penny,7," Thanks. Target, four ninety-nine. I‰Ûªm getting a drink.",7
32837,Amy,7, What are you working on?,7
32838,Raj,7," Ah, I‰Ûªm making a necklace for my mom. ",7
32839,Amy,7, That‰Ûªs sweet.,7
32840,Raj,7," Yeah, she and my dad are going through a bit of a rough patch, so I wanted to do something to let her know I was thinking about her.",7
32841,Penny,7, What‰Ûªs going on with them?,7
32842,Raj,7, They‰Ûªre just having a little trouble communicating. My dad says it‰Ûªs because the sound of my mom‰Ûªs voice makes him want to tear his ears off and sew them over his eyes so he never has to look at her again.,7
32843,Bernadette,7, Hi.,7
32844,Penny,7," Hey, guys.",7
32845,Amy,7, Hello.,7
32846,Howard,7, Look who‰Ûªs here to put the Jew in jewellery night.,7
32847,Bernadette,7," Oh, sure, so it‰Ûªs fine when you say it.",7
32848,Howard,7, Sorry we‰Ûªre late. I wanted to swing by the lab and pick up some even cooler tools for us to use.,7
32849,Raj,7, I didn‰Ûªt know you were coming again.,7
32850,Howard,7," Well, last week was a blast. Plus, I thought you might like having a guy here. ",7
32851,Penny (laughing),7, It was not funny.,7
32852,Amy,7," So, what tools did you bring?",7
32853,Howard,7," Everything we need to make jewellery moulds. Here‰Ûªs some silver, a crucible and an acetylene torch to melt it down.",7
32854,Penny,7," Ooh, that looks like fun.",7
32855,Bernadette,7, Maybe you should master glue before you move on to fire.,7
32856,Howard,7," Okay, who‰Ûªs up first?",7
32857,Amy,7," Rajesh, do you want to make a bracelet for your mom to go with the necklace?",7
32858,Raj,7," No, thanks.",7
32859,Howard,7," I was gonna make a necklace for my mom, but unfortunately she doesn‰Ûªt have a neck. She‰Ûªs just chins and fat and feet.",7
32860,Scene,7, Leonard‰Ûªs laboratory.,7
32861,Leonard,7," Okay, we‰Ûªre almost ready to go. Once we bond the wires, we can test the tubes.",7
32862,Arthur,7," This is so exciting, I, I feel like I‰Ûªm 75 again.",7
32863,Leonard,7," Oh, God.",7
32864,Arthur,7," What, what is it?",7
32865,Leonard,7, Sheldon just sent me a picture of him and Bill Nye getting smoothies.,7
32866,Arthur,7," Can, can I ask you a question?",7
32867,Leonard,7," Yeah, sure.",7
32868,Arthur,7, Why do you put up with Sheldon?,7
32869,Leonard,7," Oh, uh, you know, because we‰Ûªre friends.",7
32870,Arthur,7, Why?,7
32871,Leonard,7," Wow, you ask really hard questions.",7
32872,Arthur,7, Yeah.,7
32873,Leonard,7," Look, I know he can be aggravating, but what you have to remember is that he‰Ûªs not doing it on purpose. It‰Ûªs just how he is. But he‰Ûªs also loyal and trustworthy and we have fun together.",7
32874,Arthur,7," You, you know you‰Ûªre describing a dog.",7
32875,Leonard,7," He did bite me once. But in his defence, I came up behind him while he was eating, so‰Û_",7
32876,Arthur,7," Yeah, they, they hate that.",7
32877,Leonard,7," You know what, Sheldon is the smartest person I have ever met. And he‰Ûªs a little broken and he needs me. I guess I need him, too.",7
32878,Arthur,7," Why, why is that?",7
32879,Leonard,7," Boy, you will not let this go, will you? Oh, jeez.",7
32880,Arthur,7, Another photo from Sheldon?,7
32881,Leonard,7," No, I have to go pick him up. Bill Nye ditched him at the smoothie place.",7
32882,Arthur,7," He probably stole his wallet, too.",7
32883,Scene,7, Penny‰Ûªs apartment. ,7
32884,Howard,7," You know, if you guys are interested, there‰Ûªs a technique where I can take a lock of your hair, refine it into carbon dust and use the hydraulic press at work to turn it into a tiny little diamond with your DNA in it.",7
32885,Penny,7," Oh, that‰Ûªs amazing,",7
32886,Howard,7, Yeah. See Bernie‰Ûªs engagement ring? That came right off my mom‰Ûªs back.,7
32887,Bernadette,7," He‰Ûªs kidding. If that were true, it‰Ûªd be so much bigger.",7
32888,Raj,7, My name is Howard. I can make your hair into diamonds. My mom is morbidly obese. Everybody love me.,7
32889,Howard,7," Whoa, where is that coming from?",7
32890,Raj,7, I‰Ûªll tell you where it‰Ûªs coming from. All you do is make fun of me for coming to girls‰Ûª night and now you‰Ûªre here ruining it for everyone.,7
32891,Penny,7," Raj, cool it, he‰Ûªs gonna make us hair diamonds.",7
32892,Howard,7, How am I ruining anything? I‰Ûªm just trying to help you make better jewellery.,7
32893,Raj,7, But this isn‰Ûªt about the jewellery. This is about me having a place where I can open up about my feelings.,7
32894,Howard,7, Since when can‰Ûªt you open up with me?,7
32895,Raj,7," There are just some things that I feel more comfortable sharing with the girls, because they won‰Ûªt make fun of me or and call me names, or ask me if my Koothrapanties are in a bunch.",7
32896,Howard,7," Buddy, I was just joking around. ",7
32897,Raj,7," Yeah, well, sometimes your jokes hurt. ",7
32898,Howard,7, You‰Ûªre right. I didn‰Ûªt realize I was making you feel that way. It was very brave of you to tell me.,7
32899,Raj,7, Thank you. It wasn‰Ûªt easy.,7
32900,Amy,7," They‰Ûªre gonna have sex before Sheldon and I do, I know it.",7
32901,Scene,7, The apartment.,7
32902,Sheldon,7, Arthur?,7
32903,Arthur,7," Hi, Sheldon.",7
32904,Sheldon,7, I‰Ûªm surprised to see you here.,7
32905,Arthur,7," Yeah, me, too. Somewhere around the third floor I began to see a, a white light.",7
32906,Sheldon,7, I‰Ûªll get Leonard.,7
32907,Arthur,7," No, no, no, I‰Ûªm, I‰Ûªm here, I‰Ûªm here to see you.",7
32908,Sheldon,7," If you‰Ûªre hoping to get in touch with Bill Nye, I can‰Ûªt help you. I‰Ûªve been informed that he‰Ûªs now Bill Nye the Restraining Order Guy.",7
32909,Arthur,7," No, I, I, I was thinking, if it isn‰Ûªt too much trouble, I‰Ûªd like to get your opinion about my, my paper.",7
32910,Sheldon,7, Thank you. It would be an honour.,7
32911,Arthur,7," Oh. Uh, great.",7
32912,Sheldon,7," Actually, I don‰Ûªt need that. I hacked into your e-mail account and read it.",7
32913,Arthur,7," And, what did you think?",7
32914,Sheldon,7," Well, first, I think the fact that you use your birthday as a password is embarrassing. ",7
32915,Arthur,7, Mmm. Thank you.,7
32916,Sheldon,7," Second, um, I thought your paper was inspired. ",7
32917,Arthur,7," Oh, well, that, that means a lot to me.",7
32918,Sheldon,7, Can I invite you in for tea?,7
32919,Arthur,7," Uh, no, no. I, I really, I have, I have to run.",7
32920,Penny,7," Hey, Arthur. How are you?",7
32921,Arthur,7," Well, I guess one cup wouldn‰Ûªt hurt.",7
32922,Scene,7, Howard and Bernadette‰Ûªs apartment.,7
32923,Howard,7," Oh, hey, buddy, what‰Ûªs up?",7
32924,Raj,7," Well, I was feeling bad about how I acted the other night so I made you a little something.",7
32925,Howard,7, You didn‰Ûªt have to do that.,7
32926,Raj,7," Well, it was fun. I used some of the jewellery techniques you taught us. It‰Ûªs a lightsabre belt buckle.",7
32927,Howard,7," Wow, this is so cool. Thanks.",7
32928,Raj,7, Oh gets better.,7
32929,Howard,7, Wow.,7
32930,Raj,7," And that‰Ûªs not even the best part. See? I have one, too. Check it out. You can wear yours and we can have little sword fights whenever we want.",7
32931,Scene,7, The apartment.,7
32932,Sheldon,7," Yeah, and my eighth favourite episode of Professor Proton was Alka-Seltzer rocket. You said, plop, plop, fizz, fizz, oh, what a blast-off it is. Remember? Remember that? Remember?",7
32933,Leonard,7, He can‰Ûªt help it. He can‰Ûªt. He really can‰Ûªt.,7
32934,Sheldon,7," Oh, wait here. I‰Ûªll get some Alka-Seltzer, we can build that rocket, and we can shoot it at Bill Nye‰Ûªs house. As long as I‰Ûªm not within 500 feet of it.",7
32935,Arthur,7," So, you, uh, you have, you have any, single grandmothers?",7
32936,Penny,7," Sorry, they‰Ûªre both married.",7
32937,Arthur,7, Good.,7
32938,Penny,7, Mmm.,7
32939,Arthur,7," Hap, hap, happily?",7
32940,Scene,8, The apartment,7
32941,Penny,8," Hey, can I ask you a question?",7
32942,Leonard,8, Sure.,7
32943,Penny,8," You‰Ûªve had this dart board since I‰Ûªve known you, but I‰Ûªve never seen you play.",7
32944,Leonard,8," Oh, uh, we played, once. I broke a window.",7
32945,Penny,8, What window?,7
32946,Leonard,8, That one over there.,7
32947,Sheldon,8," Leonard, where are the Skee-Ball tickets?",7
32948,Leonard,8, Skee-Ball tickets?,7
32949,Sheldon,8," Yeah, from when we went to the arcade three years ago? I finally decided what prize I want. Hurry up.",7
32950,Leonard,8," Uh, if I still have them, they‰Ûªre probably in the junk box.",7
32951,Penny,8," Ooh, what are you gonna get?",7
32952,Sheldon,8," None of your business. But when you see me wearing a flower in my lapel later, you are most welcome to sniff it.",7
32953,Leonard,8," Yup, oh, here you go.",7
32954,Sheldon,8," Oh, thank you. Here, get yourself an eraser for your troubles.",7
32955,Leonard,8, Oh. I forgot about this. My aunt made it for me when I started college.,7
32956,Penny,8," Aw, did she hate you?",7
32957,Leonard,8," Why? Because I got an ugly, itchy sweater, and my brother got a car? No, I was her favorite.",7
32958,Sheldon,8, I seem to be a few tickets short. Are there more in the box?,7
32959,Leonard,8," Hmm, I think I got them all. Nope, they‰Ûªre not in there.",7
32960,Sheldon,8," Well, you barely looked. Let me see.",7
32961,Leonard,8," No, no, no, I, I looked, and there‰Ûªs, there‰Ûªs, there‰Ûªs no more tickets.",7
32962,Sheldon,8," Leonard, let me look in the box.",7
32963,Leonard,8," Okay, okay. I‰Ûªm gonna show you what‰Ûªs in the box. But just promise not to flip out.",7
32964,Sheldon,8, Why would I flip out? Is it a spider? It‰Ûªs a spider.,7
32965,Penny,8," No, if it was a spider, Lenny would‰Ûªve flipped out.",7
32966,Leonard,8," Okay, Sheldon, I know I was supposed to return this DVD a long time ago, and I know we rented it on your card. But it‰Ûªs been, like, seven years and clearly nothing bad has happened. So in-in-in-instead of being a giant pain in the ass like you always are, what if this one time you just tried staying calm?",7
32967,Sheldon,8," That seems like a reasonable request. Although so did, hey, Leonard, would you mind returning that DVD?",7
32968,Leonard,8," I‰Ûªm sorry. I‰Ûªll, I‰Ûªll take care of it.",7
32969,Sheldon,8, Okay.,7
32970,Leonard,8," I mean it, I‰Ûªm going to.",7
32971,Sheldon,8, I believe you.,7
32972,Leonard,8, And you‰Ûªre going to stay calm?,7
32973,Sheldon,8, I said I would.,7
32974,Leonard,8, How about that? Sheldon‰Ûªs being reasonable.,7
32975,Penny,8," Yeah, it‰Ûªs freaking me out. I‰Ûªm gonna go.",7
32976,Scene,8, The apartment.,7
32977,Leonard,8," So, when you say you‰Ûªre not going to freak out about the DVD, here‰Ûªs what that means. Don‰Ûªt fixate on it. Don‰Ûªt wake me up in the middle of the night. Or nag me through the door while I‰Ûªm on the toilet.",7
32978,Sheldon,8," Okay, first, talking to you while you‰Ûªre on the toilet isn‰Ûªt exactly a picnic for me either, okay? Remember, when you can hear me, I can hear you. And second, you completely disregard how uncomfortable unresolved issues are for me. It‰Ûªs, it‰Ûªs like, a, an itch in my brain I can‰Ûªt scratch.",7
32979,Leonard,8, When I broke my arm I used to stick a coat hanger down there. You ever try that? Maybe go in through the ear?,7
32980,Sheldon,8, You wouldn‰Ûªt make jokes if you could feel the way I feel.,7
32981,Leonard,8," Well, I don‰Ûªt know how to do that.",7
32982,Sheldon,8," How about this? I promise I won‰Ûªt pester you about the DVD. You can defecate in peace. That‰Ûªs a win for both of us. But, until this matter is resolved, I would like you to wear this sweater. With nothing underneath it.",7
32983,Leonard,8, That‰Ûªs stupid. Why?,7
32984,Sheldon,8, You say it‰Ûªs itchy and uncomfortable. I say situations like this make me feel the same way. ,7
32985,Leonard,8," I‰Ûªm telling you, try the hanger.",7
32986,Sheldon,8, Put it on. Let‰Ûªs share the experience.,7
32987,Leonard,8," You got it. If this sweater shuts you up, I‰Ûªm gonna make a fortune selling them to everyone we know. Now all I need to do is head down to the video store and return the DVD.",7
32988,Sheldon,8," Oh, did I forget to tell you? That store went out of business years ago.",7
32989,Leonard,8, Really?,7
32990,Sheldon,8," How those nipples feeling, chief?",7
32991,Scene,8, The cheesecake factory bar.,7
32992,Bernadette,8," Penny, can we please get our drinks?",7
32993,Penny,8," Yeah, hang on, just give me sec.",7
32994,Amy,8," At work today, I did an in vivo stereotaxic surgery.",7
32995,Bernadette,8," Cool. At my lab, I performed ten laser capture micro-dissections.",7
32996,Penny,8, I scraped gum off the bottom of that table. Only ‰Ûªcause my manager saw me put it there.,7
32997,Amy,8," Oh, my gosh. That‰Ûªs the girl that broke Rajesh‰Ûªs heart.",7
32998,Bernadette,8, That‰Ûªs Lucy?,7
32999,Penny,8, I don‰Ûªt know why but I always pictured her as Indian.,7
33000,Bernadette,8, I think that reason‰Ûªs called racism.,7
33001,Penny,8, I‰Ûªm gonna go talk to her.,7
33002,Bernadette,8, Why? What are you gonna say?,7
33003,Penny,8, I‰Ûªm not gonna say anything. I just want to check her out. Because she hurt my friend. My Indian friend. Who‰Ûªs racist now?,7
33004,Bernadette,8, You because you just called him your Indian friend.,7
33005,Penny,8," Yeah, well, you‰Ûªre short.",7
33006,Amy,8, We‰Ûªre never getting our drinks.,7
33007,Bernadette,8," No, but we knew that.",7
33008,Penny,8," Hey, can I start you off with something to drink?",7
33009,Lucy,8," Oh, water would be great.",7
33010,Penny,8," Okay. Um, you‰Ûªre Lucy, right? I‰Ûªm a friend of Raj Koothrappali‰Ûªs. Actually Amy recognized you.",7
33011,Lucy,8, Wow. How‰Ûªs he doing?,7
33012,Penny,8," Oh, you know, he‰Ûªs good.",7
33013,Lucy,8, Great.,7
33014,Penny,8," Yeah, this is none of my business. But why did you break up with him in an e-mail?",7
33015,Lucy,8," Oh, I don‰Ûªt know. I guess I thought it would be easier.",7
33016,Penny,8," Yeah, I get that. I‰Ûªll go get you your water. When you say easier, you mean easier for you, right? ‰Û÷Cause it certainly didn‰Ûªt make it easier for him.",7
33017,Lucy,8, Any chance I can get a different waitress?,7
33018,Penny,8," I‰Ûªm sorry, this is rude of me. I will go get that water. See, see, see, see. Just now you expressed your feelings to my face. How come you could do that with me, but not Raj?",7
33019,Lucy,8, I don‰Ûªt know your e-mail.,7
33020,Penny,8," You know what the worst part is? You‰Ûªre sitting here, perfectly happy and he‰Ûªs at home, a blubbering mess.",7
33021,Lucy,8," Oh, I thought you said he was okay.",7
33022,Penny,8," Well, I also said I was getting you water, but look at me still standing here. You know, I may be a bad waitress, but you are a bad person. Now, you want to hear the specials?",7
33023,Scene,8, The apartment.,7
33024,Howard,8," So, you can never take it off?",7
33025,Leonard,8, No.,7
33026,Raj,8, Not even to sleep?,7
33027,Leonard,8, No.,7
33028,Howard,8," So, you‰Ûªre just an idiot?",7
33029,Leonard,8, It‰Ûªs called proving a point.,7
33030,Howard,8, Is the point that you‰Ûªre an idiot?,7
33031,Sheldon,8," Gentlemen, please. Leonard is trying to walk a mile in my metaphorical shoes. He can‰Ûªt walk in my actual shoes. He has the feet of a toddler.",7
33032,Raj,8," So, how are you gonna return the DVD if the store went out of business?",7
33033,Leonard,8," Monday morning I‰Ûªll go downtown, look up the owner‰Ûªs information and send him the DVD. Pay the late fee, and prove to Sheldon that you can have a problem and solve it without acting like a complete lunatic. Ah!",7
33034,Howard,8, And the man impersonating a bear would like everyone to know that only you can prevent forest fires.,7
33035,Raj,8, I don‰Ûªt get it.,7
33036,Howard,8, You didn‰Ûªt have Smokey the Bear in India?,7
33037,Raj,8," No. Oh, is he anything like, uh, Mun-Mun the Mongoose? He taught us not to play with cobras.",7
33038,Howard,8, You had to be taught not to play with cobras?,7
33039,Raj,8, You had to be taught not to burn down the forest?,7
33040,Scene,8, Penny‰Ûªs apartment.,7
33041,Penny,8," Hey, if you guys were hungry, why didn‰Ûªt you order something at the restaurant?",7
33042,Bernadette,8," We did, you never brought it.",7
33043,Penny,8," Oh, that‰Ûªs right. Nachos and a turkey club.",7
33044,Amy,8, Not even close.,7
33045,Penny,8," Well, I was too busy standing up for my friend to worry about your, I want to say salmon.",7
33046,Amy,8, You want to say sorry.,7
33047,Bernadette,8," So, how are you gonna tell Raj abut what you did?",7
33048,Penny,8, What do you mean how? What‰Ûªs the big deal?,7
33049,Amy,8, You told Lucy he was a pathetic mess.,7
33050,Bernadette,8, Then you made her cry and leave.,7
33051,Penny,8," Okay, you guys are overreacting. Raj is gonna appreciate how I had his back.",7
33052,Scene,8," The same, later.",7
33053,Raj,8," What is wrong with you, Penny? You ruined any chance I had of getting back with Lucy. Now she knows I‰Ûªm a desperate mess instead of just being pretty sure. (Phone text sound) It‰Ûªs Lucy. She wants to meet for coffee. I love you, Penny.",7
33054,Scene,8, Sheldon‰Ûªs office.,7
33055,Howard,8," Hey, what‰Ûªre you working on?",7
33056,Sheldon,8, I‰Ûªm thinking about how one could use the fact that a rapidly rotating mirror turns virtual photons into real ones as a method of observing dark energy.,7
33057,Howard,8, That‰Ûªs a pretty cool idea.,7
33058,Sheldon,8, Yeah. It‰Ûªs great you‰Ûªre here. I‰Ûªd love to get an engineer‰Ûªs opinion.,7
33059,Howard,8, Sure.,7
33060,Sheldon,8," This chair is squeaky. Now, do I fix it or get a new one?",7
33061,Leonard,8," Well, Sheldon, it took me all morning, but I found the owner of the video store. And I am happy to report that he died peacefully in his sleep, drunk at the bottom of a pool. Anyway, there is no one to return the DVD to, so this issue is resolved. Ah! And I‰Ûªd just like to point out that even though the sweater was uncomfortable, I didn‰Ûªt use it as an excuse to antagonize everyone around me.",7
33062,Howard,8," You know, you could reimburse the video store owner‰Ûªs next of kin.",7
33063,Leonard,8, Or it‰Ûªs resolved.,7
33064,Sheldon,8," Hey, that next of kin thing sounds pretty good.",7
33065,Howard,8, I believe this is yours.,7
33066,Scene,8, Howard and Bernadette‰Ûªs apartment.,7
33067,Raj,8," Can I ask you guys a question? So, I‰Ûªm seeing Lucy tomorrow night, and I‰Ûªve never hung out with someone who broke up with me. How do you do it?",7
33068,Howard,8," You can‰Ûªt let her know you‰Ûªre hurting. You know, the key is confidence.",7
33069,Raj,8, Why is the key always confidence? How come it‰Ûªs never love handles and flop sweat?,7
33070,Bernadette,8," If this girl hurt you so much, are you sure you want to see her again?",7
33071,Howard,8," Well, if I may, he has so little self-respect and is so desperate for the smallest crumb of affection, she could literally sleep with his own father in his own bed and post the video to YouTube, and he‰Ûªd still buy her flowers and ask her to be his bride.",7
33072,Raj,8," He‰Ûªs right. But in my defence, if we could survive that, we could survive anything.",7
33073,Bernadette,8," Well, if you‰Ûªre sure you want to do this, it‰Ûªs only coffee, just relax and see what happens.",7
33074,Raj,8," Well, can I say she looks nice?",7
33075,Bernadette,8, Sure.,7
33076,Raj,8, Can I tell her I miss her?,7
33077,Bernadette,8," Maybe, if she asks.",7
33078,Raj,8," Oh, can I show her an oil painting I made of us surrounded by our children and grandchildren?",7
33079,Bernadette,8, I‰Ûªd save that for the second date.,7
33080,Raj,8," Good, good. ‰Û÷Cause no matter how hard I try, I cannot get the twins to look alike.",7
33081,Scene,8, Penny‰Ûªs apartment.,7
33082,Penny,8, What are you doing?,7
33083,Leonard,8," Oh, I‰Ûªm just trying to find the stupid next of kin to this stupid video store owner so I can return the DVD and see the look on Sheldon‰Ûªs stupid face when he sees that I didn‰Ûªt let this get to me.",7
33084,Penny,8, Sheldon‰Ûªs not here. Why don‰Ûªt you take the sweater off?,7
33085,Leonard,8, There‰Ûªs a principle at stake.,7
33086,Penny,8, Which is?,7
33087,Leonard,8," Oh, I don‰Ûªt know. Who cares? Look at me.",7
33088,Penny,8," Oh, my God! Is that sweater made of bees? Come on, take it off. I won‰Ûªt tell.",7
33089,Leonard,8," No, no, honey, if I take it off, Sheldon wins.",7
33090,Penny,8," Sweetie, every night you don‰Ûªt kill him in his sleep, he wins.",7
33091,Leonard,8," No, it‰Ûªs, it‰Ûªs almost done. I just, I have to find the next of kin, and send ‰Ûªem the DVD and then just wait for someone with my complexion to die so I can get a skin graft.",7
33092,Penny,8, Smile.,7
33093,Leonard,8, What is that? What is that for?,7
33094,Penny,8, So you can send it to Princeton and get your money back.,7
33095,Scene,8, The apartment.,7
33096,Amy,8," I must say, Sheldon, you‰Ûªre handling this DVD business with an impressive amount of maturity.",7
33097,Sheldon,8, I don‰Ûªt know why that surprises you. I‰Ûªm a grown man. As should be evident by this sport coat and very real flower in my lapel.,7
33098,Amy,8, Is there some kind of new coping mechanism you‰Ûªre employing?,7
33099,Sheldon,8," The more interesting question you should be asking is, what does this flower smell like?",7
33100,Amy,8, I‰Ûªm gonna go with sad. So what‰Ûªs the story with you and this DVD?,7
33101,Sheldon,8," There‰Ûªs nothing to tell. Maybe I purchased a book entitled Don‰Ûªt Sweat the Small Stuff and I followed its wise suggestions, one of which was stop and smell the flowers.",7
33102,Amy,8, Seriously?,7
33103,Sheldon,8," Please. Ha-ha, Oh.",7
33104,Scene,8, A coffee shop.,7
33105,Lucy,8, Hi.,7
33106,Raj,8," Hello. Oh, it‰Ûªs so good to see you.",7
33107,Lucy,8," You, too.",7
33108,Raj,8," Please, sit. I, uh, I got you a cappuccino. I remembered it was your favourite. I also got crumb cake, but I remembered it was my favourite and I ate it. Anyway, uh, how are you?",7
33109,Lucy,8," I‰Ûªm pretty good. Listen, I just wanted to apologize for breaking up with you in an e-mail.",7
33110,Raj,8," Well, and I ate all the crumb cake. We both made mistakes.",7
33111,Lucy,8, Okay.,7
33112,Raj,8," I‰Ûªm so happy you asked me here, and I hope we can hang out again sometime. You know, as friends, lovemaking partners, whatever.",7
33113,Lucy,8," Oh, uh, I‰Ûªm kind of seeing someone.",7
33114,Raj,8," I think I know the answer to this, but just to be clear, it‰Ûªs not me, right?",7
33115,Scene,8, Penny‰Ûªs apartment. ,7
33116,Raj,8," This is all your fault, I should‰Ûªve listened to Mun-Mun because I‰Ûªve been playing with a cobra and her name is Penny. Why are you so cruel? Do you enjoy my pain?",7
33117,Penny,8, There‰Ûªs a girl at the Cheesecake Factory I can set you up with.,7
33118,Raj,8," I love you, Penny.",7
33119,Scene,8, The apartment.,7
33120,Sheldon,8, How is it I can conceptualize a methodology of examining dark matter in the universe but can‰Ûªt figure out how to fix a novelty squirt flower?,7
33121,Amy,8," I think the real question is, why do you waste your time with cheap, childish pranks?",7
33122,Sheldon,8, There‰Ûªs probably a deep reason. Which I‰Ûªd be happy to discuss with you over some peanut brittle in a can.,7
33123,Leonard,8," Okay, Sheldon, I am out of options. Video store owner, Nursis Manookian, has no next of kin.",7
33124,Sheldon,8," Well, you seem hot under the collar, or is that the sweater?",7
33125,Leonard,8," Oh, oh, no, no. It‰Ûªs because I spent all afternoon at the Armenian church where his funeral mass was held. According to Father Solakian, no one attended. Luckily, my trip wasn‰Ûªt a complete waste. I lit a candle and prayed for your death but I‰Ûªm not Armenian, so it probably won‰Ûªt work. This is over, right?",7
33126,Sheldon,8," Oh, not necessarily. I suggest you look for long-lost relatives either in Armenia or Lebanon.",7
33127,Leonard,8," Listen to me, Sheldon. I am not going to Lebanon to return Super Mario Brothers the movie.",7
33128,Sheldon,8," You know, it might be fun. You love hummus.",7
33129,Leonard,8, Why isn‰Ûªt this bothering you? Isn‰Ûªt your brain getting itchy? This is on your card. This could be ruining your credit score. Why isn‰Ûªt this making you crazy?,7
33130,Sheldon,8," Leonard, I have something to tell you, but I want you to promise not to flip out.",7
33131,Leonard,8, What?,7
33132,Sheldon,8," Seven years ago, I found out the DVD was late and I paid for it.",7
33133,Leonard,8, What?,7
33134,Sheldon,8," I was going to mention it at the time, but then I thought, some day, this might be a teachable moment.",7
33135,Leonard,8," Aaaah! I, you, how can, what!",7
33136,Amy,8," Sheldon, that was diabolical.",7
33137,Sheldon,8, I know. And it wasn‰Ûªt easy. Do you have any idea what it‰Ûªs like to wait for years and never know if you‰Ûªre going to finally get satisfaction?,7
33138,Scene,8, A coffee shop.,7
33139,Raj,8, Wow. You‰Ûªre even prettier than Penny said. I can‰Ûªt believe a girl like you doesn‰Ûªt have a boyfriend.,7
33140,Girl,8," Well, I don‰Ûªt.",7
33141,Raj,8," I don‰Ûªt believe you, you‰Ûªre lying to me. ",7
33142,Girl,8, What?,7
33143,Raj,8," Oh, it‰Ûªs okay. I have no morals and I‰Ûªm desperately lonely. I‰Ûªll be the other man if you want a little something-something on the side.",7
33144,Scene,8, The cheesecake factory.,7
33145,Girl (to Penny),8, What is wrong with you?,7
33146,Scene,8, Penny‰Ûªs apartment.,7
33147,Penny (to Raj),8, What is wrong with you?,7
33148,Scene,8, Raj‰Ûªs apartment.,7
33149,Raj (to a mirror),8, What is wrong with you?,7
33150,Scene,9, The apartment.,7
33151,Leonard,9, The math is all there. It‰Ûªs not real.,7
33152,Penny,9," Yes, it is.",7
33153,Sheldon,9," Yeah,uh, look, it is scientifically impossible for a person to tip a cow. Even you, with your stocky build and lumberjack shoulders, you couldn‰Ûªt do it.",7
33154,Raj,9, It‰Ûªs horrible. Why would you push a cow over? They‰Ûªre sacred.,7
33155,Penny,9," Oh, stop it. I‰Ûªve seen you eat, like, a million hamburgers.",7
33156,Raj,9," Hey, an animal can be both sacred and delicious.",7
33157,Penny,9," Look, I‰Ûªm telling you I‰Ûªve done it, okay? I clearly remember the cow standing up and then the cow on its side.",7
33158,Leonard,9, Were you drunk?,7
33159,Penny,9, I was 16 in Nebraska. What do you think?,7
33160,Leonard,9, I think you‰Ûªre the one who fell over.,7
33161,Penny,9, That would explain why the sky was also on its side.,7
33162,Howard,9, Hey.,7
33163,Penny,9, Howard. Cow tipping. Real or not?,7
33164,Howard,9," Mmm. I‰Ûªm gonna say not. That‰Ûªs just based on me trying to roll my mom over when she‰Ûªs snoring. Speaking of that big side of beef, uh, she‰Ûªs invited all of you to Thanksgiving at her house.",7
33165,Sheldon,9," Mmm. You know, I‰Ûªve been told that a bald refusal of an invitation is rude and one must instead offer up a polite excuse, so I‰Ûªd love to go, but, unfortunately, that sounds awful.",7
33166,Howard,9," Come on, it‰Ûªll be fun.",7
33167,Penny,9," Uh, we were actually gonna do it here.",7
33168,Howard,9," Please? Bernadette‰Ûªs bringing her dad ‰Ûªcause her mom‰Ûªs out of town, and I never have anything to say to that guy.",7
33169,Sheldon,9," Oh, since you put it that way, I‰Ûªd love to go, but that sounds even more awful.",7
33170,Leonard,9, It‰Ûªd actually be nice to not hear Sheldon complain about my cooking all day.,7
33171,Sheldon,9," Uh, excuse me, but every year you prepare a terrible meal and every year I criticize it. Do our traditions mean nothing to you?",7
33172,Leonard,9, I want to go.,7
33173,Penny,9," Yeah, me, too.",7
33174,Raj,9, I‰Ûªm in.,7
33175,Howard,9, Sheldon.,7
33176,Sheldon,9," Ugh, fine, I‰Ûªll go. But if her food is delicious, Thanksgiving is ruined, and it‰Ûªs on you.",7
33177,Scene,9, The apartment.,7
33178,Sheldon,9, Do we really have to go to Mrs. Wolowitz‰Ûªs house?,7
33179,Amy,9, We do. And I expect you to be on your best behaviour.,7
33180,Sheldon,9, Now I know how the African slaves felt. Being dragged from their homes to labour under the yoke of the white man.,7
33181,Amy,9, Are you honestly comparing Thanksgiving dinner at Wolowitz‰Ûªs mom‰Ûªs with one of the greatest tragedies in the history of mankind?,7
33182,Sheldon,9, Yes.,7
33183,Penny,9," Sheldon, you can have a nice Thanksgiving anywhere. I spent one in Vegas.",7
33184,Leonard,9, You did?,7
33185,Penny,9," Yeah, back when I was dating Zack. It was actually more fun than I thought. We gambled, we went to one of those cheesy wedding chapels, we had a really good turkey dinner. Which was surprising, since we were at a strip club.",7
33186,Leonard,9," Wait, you went to a chapel?",7
33187,Penny,9, Yeah. ,7
33188,Leonard,9, Why? ,7
33189,Penny,9, We had one of those silly fake weddings.,7
33190,Leonard,9," Penny, you know those are real, right?",7
33191,Penny,9," No, they‰Ûªre not.",7
33192,Leonard,9," Yeah, they are.",7
33193,Penny,9," No, they‰Ûªre not.",7
33194,Leonard,9," Yeah, they are.",7
33195,Sheldon,9, He‰Ûªs right.,7
33196,Amy,9, They‰Ûªre real.,7
33197,Penny,9, But it didn‰Ûªt seem real.,7
33198,Sheldon,9," Let me ask you a question. At any point, was Las Vegas on its side?",7
33199,Scene,9, Mrs Wolowitz‰Ûªs house.,7
33200,Bernadette,9," Hi, Dad.",7
33201,Mike,9," Hi, honey.",7
33202,Bernadette,9," Oh, you brought beer for everybody.",7
33203,Mike,9," Uh, okay, yeah, it‰Ûªs for everybody. I really just wanted to have a nice, quiet day at home and watch the game.",7
33204,Bernadette,9, You can have a quiet day and watch the game here.,7
33205,Mrs Wolowitz (off),9," Howard, the medicine‰Ûªs not working.",7
33206,Howard (off),9," You just took it. At least let it reach your first stomach. (entering) Hey, Mike. Let me help you out, there.",7
33207,Mike,9, Thanks. What‰Ûªs wrong with your mom?,7
33208,Howard,9," Oh, her gout‰Ûªs flaring up. Turns out an apple pie a day does not keep the doctor away.",7
33209,Mrs Wolowitz (off),9, How can one little toe hurt so bad? ,7
33210,Howard,9," Maybe because that little piggy is being crushed by the barn. She should quiet down soon. I gave her enough pain meds to choke a, well, her.",7
33211,Bernadette,9, I guess we‰Ûªre gonna have to do all the cooking.,7
33212,Howard,9, I have a better idea.,7
33213,Bernadette,9," If you think you‰Ûªre gonna make me do all this by myself, you‰Ûªre crazy.",7
33214,Howard,9, I was gonna make Raj do it all by himself.,7
33215,Bernadette,9," Oh, well, that‰Ûªs a great idea.",7
33216,Scene,9, Leonard‰Ûªs car. ,7
33217,Amy,9," No traffic, we‰Ûªre sailing.",7
33218,Sheldon,9, Yes. Like we‰Ûªre on a ship. Coming from Africa to America.,7
33219,Amy,9," Sheldon, that‰Ûªs completely inappropriate. You can‰Ûªt keep comparing yourself to a slave.",7
33220,Sheldon,9," Yes, Miss Amy.",7
33221,Leonard,9, I can‰Ûªt believe you‰Ûªre married to that idiot.,7
33222,Penny,9," Ugh, would you stop? We just did it as a goof.",7
33223,Leonard,9," Well, a goof or not, you‰Ûªre actually married. You need to get this taken care of.",7
33224,Penny,9, I will. Why are you making this such a big deal?,7
33225,Sheldon,9," Oh, oh, oh, I have a reason. It could be because you said yes to marrying Zack, but every time Leonard‰Ûªs proposed, he‰Ûªs gotten a resounding no. Yeah, that‰Ûªs just off the top of my head.",7
33226,Penny,9, So how do I undo this?,7
33227,Leonard,9, I‰Ûªm hoping you can get an annulment. It‰Ûªs just like it never happened.,7
33228,Penny,9," Great, well, what do I have to do?",7
33229,Amy,9, It says here you can get an annulment if any of the following conditions are met. Were you unable to consummate the marriage?,7
33230,Sheldon,9, Hah!Penny? Next.,7
33231,Amy,9," Is there any evidence of fraud, bigamy, want of understanding?",7
33232,Penny,9, Want of understanding? What does that even mean?,7
33233,Amy,9," Ding, ding, ding. We have a winner.",7
33234,Scene,9, Mrs Wolowitz‰Ûªs kitchen.,7
33235,Bernadette,9, Thanks for saving the day.,7
33236,Raj,9," Ah, no problem. It wouldn‰Ûªt be Thanksgiving without an Indian providing the food. Uh, now, where does your mom keep the Crisco?",7
33237,Howard,9," Um, I don‰Ûªt know. Probably in a wad in her cheek.",7
33238,Bernadette,9, I‰Ûªll help Raj in here. Why don‰Ûªt you go keep my dad company?,7
33239,Howard,9, He doesn‰Ûªt want me in there. I‰Ûªm the creepy little guy who has sex with his daughter.,7
33240,Bernadette,9," Don‰Ûªt be silly, he loves you.",7
33241,Howard,9, Does he?,7
33242,Bernadette,9," Okay, he cares about you a lot.",7
33243,Howard,9, Really?,7
33244,Scene,9, The living room.,7
33245,Bernadette,9, I do crap for you all the time. Get out there.,7
33246,Howard,9, So your wife‰Ûªs in Arizona with the grandkids?,7
33247,Mike,9, Uh-huh.,7
33248,Howard,9," You know, my mom‰Ûªs been to Arizona. She rode one of those mules down in the Grand Canyon. Long story short, they had to shoot it. ‰Û÷Cause she‰Ûªs so fat. I‰Ûªll get the door while you finish laughing. Hey, guys.",7
33249,Amy,9, Happy Thanksgiving.,7
33250,Sheldon,9," It smells wonderful. Is anyone slaving away in the kitchen? Because I, too, know‰Û_",7
33251,Amy,9, Sheldon.,7
33252,Penny,9, Here. Thank you for having us.,7
33253,Howard,9, What‰Ûªs with you?,7
33254,Leonard,9," Oh, she‰Ûªs mad at me because she just found out she‰Ûªs married to Zack.",7
33255,Howard,9, Really? That dumb-ass she used to date? That‰Ûªs hysterical.,7
33256,Penny,9, I can‰Ûªt believe I felt bad for opening this in the car.,7
33257,Scene,9, The kitchen.,7
33258,Amy,9, You need any help?,7
33259,Raj,9," Uh, yeah, can you, uh, reach that, uh, gravy boat up there?",7
33260,Amy,9," Uh, sure.",7
33261,Raj,9," Great. That makes one of you. Okay, we have a lot to do and not much time to do it. Bernadette, you‰Ûªre on corn, gravy and yam detail. Amy, you‰Ûªre on rolls, cranberries and making sure Bernadette stays away from the marshmallows. That‰Ûªs right, I see you. Okay, if you have any questions, I‰Ûªll be over here basting my ass off. Focus is key.",7
33262,Amy,9, Did you guys know Penny married Zack three years ago?,7
33263,Together,9, What?,7
33264,Scene,9, The living room.,7
33265,Howard,9, You ever play football?,7
33266,Mike,9, A little in college. You?,7
33267,Howard,9, No. But I did get tackled in the hallway once. The whole school cheered.,7
33268,Leonard,9," Okay, I found the, uh, court papers that you and Zack need to fill out. I‰Ûªll print them when we get home.",7
33269,Penny,9, Fine.,7
33270,Leonard,9, And we can just put this whole thing behind us.,7
33271,Penny,9, Are you done?,7
33272,Leonard,9, What?,7
33273,Penny,9," Look, I get it, I screwed up. Is this all we‰Ûªre gonna talk about the rest of the day?",7
33274,Leonard,9, Why are you mad at me? You‰Ûªre the one that did the stupid thing. I‰Ûªm just trying to fix it.,7
33275,Penny,9," Ugh, I need some air.",7
33276,Leonard,9," Wuh, Penny.",7
33277,Sheldon,9," I don‰Ûªt know the first thing about women, but I would not follow her.",7
33278,Mike,9, Listen to Stretch.,7
33279,Leonard,9, How am I the bad guy? She‰Ûªs the one who married someone else. I‰Ûªm the victim.,7
33280,Howard,9, Sounds like Zack‰Ûªs the victim. You‰Ûªre sleeping with his wife.,7
33281,Mike,9, I‰Ûªve kept my marriage together for 35 years. Can I weigh in here?,7
33282,Leonard,9, Sure.,7
33283,Mike,9," I‰Ûªm trying to watch the game. Shut up. Oh, how do you not make a first down there?",7
33284,Sheldon,9, They passed against a nickel defence. They should have run it off-tackle.,7
33285,Mike,9, How the hell do you know that?,7
33286,Sheldon,9, My father loved football. He always made me watch it before I was allowed to do my homework.,7
33287,Penny,9," Well, you‰Ûªll be happy to know I just spoke to Zack and he‰Ûªs willing to sign the court papers. He‰Ûªs on his way here now.",7
33288,Leonard,9," Wait, you invited him here?",7
33289,Penny,9, Yeah. ,7
33290,Mike,9, I‰Ûªm getting ready to weigh in again.,7
33291,Leonard,9, Come on.,7
33292,Mike,9, What do you think they ought to do now?,7
33293,Sheldon,9," I would throw a quick slant to a wideout, given that the defence is showing blitz.",7
33294,Howard,9," Oh, I love a good blitz, especially with sour cream. Get it? ‰Û÷Cause it sounds like blintz.",7
33295,Mrs Wolowitz (off),9, Did someone say blintz?,7
33296,Scene,9, The dining room.,7
33297,Leonard,9, I just don‰Ûªt understand why you invited him here today.,7
33298,Penny,9," Because you wouldn‰Ûªt shut up about it. When I called him, he had nothing to do, so I just thought it would‰Û_",7
33299,Raj,9," Hey, guys, I‰Ûªm trying to cook in here.",7
33300,Penny,9," Oh, sorry. We‰Ûªll keep it down.",7
33301,Raj,9," No, no, speak up. I‰Ûªm about to use the blender, and I don‰Ûªt want to miss anything.",7
33302,Leonard,9," Well, you might have to cook for one more because she invited Zack.",7
33303,Bernadette,9, What?,7
33304,Amy,9, Ooh!,7
33305,Raj,9," My, my. The plot, like my gravy, thickens.",7
33306,Scene,9, The living room.,7
33307,Sheldon,9, I don‰Ûªt care for your mother‰Ûªs bathroom. There‰Ûªs not an angle to do one‰Ûªs business without a clown figurine staring at you.,7
33308,Howard,9, That‰Ûªs why I sit.,7
33309,Mike,9," Yeah, that‰Ûªs why. You remember the Thanksgiving game when it snowed in Dallas?",7
33310,Sheldon,9, 1993. Leon Lett blew the game in the final seconds and the Dolphins emerged victorious. Then I finally got to do my calculus.,7
33311,Mike,9," I was so pissed, I wanted to shoot my TV.",7
33312,Sheldon,9, So was my dad. And then he did.,7
33313,Howard,9, Anyone need a beer?,7
33314,Mike,9, Yeah.,7
33315,Howard,9, Thank God.,7
33316,Mike,9," So, does your dad still live in Texas?",7
33317,Sheldon,9, No. He died when I was 14.,7
33318,Mike,9, I‰Ûªm sorry to hear that.,7
33319,Sheldon,9, So was the man who owned the local liquor store. He cried and cried.,7
33320,Howard,9, Here you go.,7
33321,Mike,9," Oh, thanks. So, if your dad died when you were 14, you were never old enough to have a beer with the man.",7
33322,Sheldon,9," No, sir. He did try to give me one for my high school graduation, but I was 11 and my mom said no.",7
33323,Mike,9," Well, you‰Ûªre having one with me.",7
33324,Sheldon,9, All right.,7
33325,Mike,9, To your dad.,7
33326,Howard,9," I never had a beer with my dad, either.",7
33327,Sheldon,9, Do you mind? We‰Ûªre having a moment here.,7
33328,Scene,9, The kitchen.,7
33329,Amy,9, I can‰Ûªt believe Penny‰Ûªs married to Zack.,7
33330,Raj,9, Wonder what she saw in that guy.,7
33331,Bernadette,9," I don‰Ûªt know. He‰Ûªs sweet, he‰Ûªs tall, handsome. ",7
33332,Amy,9," Broad shoulders, good hair.",7
33333,Raj,9, Hmm. Wonder what she sees in Leonard.,7
33334,Bernadette,9, How‰Ûªs it going out there?,7
33335,Howard,9, Sheldon and your dad are bonding and completely ignoring me.,7
33336,Amy,9, I know how you feel. Sheldon ignored me for a week when he got that Roomba vacuum. I kick it when he‰Ûªs not looking.,7
33337,Bernadette,9, What are they doing?,7
33338,Howard,9, They‰Ûªre drinking beer and watching football. ,7
33339,Bernadette,9, So why don‰Ûªt you do that with them?,7
33340,Howard,9, They don‰Ûªt want me.,7
33341,Bernadette,9, What do you mean?,7
33342,Howard,9," Well, Sheldon started talking about how his dad isn‰Ûªt alive any more, and they were toasting, and I tried to tell them about how sad I was when my dad abandoned‰Û_",7
33343,Amy,9, Zack‰Ûªs here!,7
33344,Raj,9, Stir the gravy. ,7
33345,Bernadette,9," Sorry. I really want to hear how sad you are. I‰Ûªll be back in like five, ten minutes.",7
33346,Scene,9, The dining room.,7
33347,Leonard,9, Sorry she made you come over here on a holiday.,7
33348,Zack,9," It‰Ûªs all right. I didn‰Ûªt have anything going on. Plus, Penny told me we‰Ûªre married, and Thanksgiving‰Ûªs a time to be with family.",7
33349,Penny,9," Yeah, okay, great. Can we just get this over with?",7
33350,Leonard,9," Yeah, uh, you guys have to sign here and here. On Monday, we‰Ûªll file for the annulment, and this marriage will be over.",7
33351,Penny,9, Okay.,7
33352,Zack,9, I don‰Ûªt know if I want to sign it.,7
33353,"Raj, Bernadette and Amy",9, Ooh.,7
33354,Leonard,9, Why won‰Ûªt you sign it?,7
33355,Zack,9, I just think splitting up can be rough on kids.,7
33356,Penny,9, We don‰Ûªt have any kids.,7
33357,Zack,9, Are you sure? ‰Û÷Cause you didn‰Ûªt know we were married until this morning.,7
33358,Penny,9," Okay, look, Zack, come on. You know neither of us thought this was real. I mean, we were married by an Elvis impersonator.",7
33359,Zack,9, Of course it was an impersonator. We could never afford a real Elvis.,7
33360,Leonard,9, You married him instead of me? Good call. Sign the papers.,7
33361,Penny,9," Hang on. You know what? You have been a jerk about this all day. You always do this, whenever I mess up, you‰Ûªre right there to make me feel even worse about it.",7
33362,Leonard,9, That is not true.,7
33363,Penny,9," Yeah, we could‰Ûªve waited till Monday, signed the papers, this all would have been over.",7
33364,Leonard,9, You‰Ûªre the one who invited him here.,7
33365,Penny,9," Oh, there you go again, just another mistake you‰Ûªre throwing in my face.",7
33366,Zack,9," Not cool, bro. I‰Ûªm starting to think you‰Ûªre not the kind of guy I want dating my wife.",7
33367,Leonard,9," Yeah, well, she‰Ûªs not gonna be your wife for long.",7
33368,Zack,9," Oh, no. Are you dying?",7
33369,Penny,9, I‰Ûªm about to. Sign the paper.,7
33370,Zack,9," Know what they say, happy wife, happy life. Let‰Ûªs eat.",7
33371,Scene,9, The living room.,7
33372,Sheldon (burping),9," Two, three, eight, four, six. (Normal) That‰Ûªs all I can do without throwing up.",7
33373,Mike,9, That is not what I expected when you said you were gonna burp pie.,7
33374,Mrs Wolowitz (off),9, Did somebody say pie?,7
33375,Mike,9," I don‰Ûªt know what‰Ûªs scarier, the bathroom clowns or the woman that put them there.",7
33376,Sheldon,9," All I know is you can only fit one of her in a car. And there‰Ûªs the clown that came out of her. I really didn‰Ûªt want to come here, but this is shaping up to be one of the best Thanksgivings I‰Ûªve had in a long time.",7
33377,Mike,9," Me, too.",7
33378,Bernadette,9," Hey. Howie says you‰Ûªve been making fun of him all day. Now, both of you apologize right now.",7
33379,Sheldon,9, She‰Ûªs so tiny. It‰Ûªs funny when she‰Ûªs mad.,7
33380,Amy,9," All right, mister, I think you owe Howard and Bernadette an apology.",7
33381,Sheldon,9," Perhaps you‰Ûªre right. I‰Ûªm sorry for my behaviour. I‰Ûªve had alcohol, and it‰Ûªs caused me to be inappropriate.",7
33382,Bernadette,9, It‰Ûªs okay.,7
33383,Howard,9, Don‰Ûªt worry about it.,7
33384,Amy,9, Thank you.,7
33385,Sheldon,9, Ain‰Ûªt she great? ,7
33386,Mike,9, Mmm.,7
33387,Amy,9, Sheldon.,7
33388,Sheldon,9," Now, how‰Ûªs about you get us a couple of beers?",7
33389,Scene,9, The dining room.,7
33390,Bernadette,9, Thanks again for cooking.,7
33391,Amy,9," Yeah, everything was delicious.",7
33392,Raj,9," Well, I couldn‰Ûªt have done it without my two favourite girls. Martha Stewart and Rachael Ray.",7
33393,Mike,9," Hey, Sheldon, what do you say we go outside and throw around the old pigskin?",7
33394,Sheldon,9, This is a Jewish house. I don‰Ûªt think they have pigskin.,7
33395,Mrs Wolowitz (off),9, Did someone say pigskin?,7
33396,Penny,9," Hey, I‰Ûªm sorry about today. And I promise, next time I get married, it won‰Ûªt be a joke. It‰Ûªll be for love. Or money.",7
33397,Leonard,9," I‰Ûªm sorry, too.",7
33398,Zack,9, Don‰Ûªt be. It‰Ûªs my fault. I was a terrible husband. I was never around.,7
33399,Mike,9," I know I‰Ûªm hard on you, but you‰Ûªre not the worst son-in-law in the world.",7
33400,Howard,9," Mike, that‰Ûªs the nicest thing you‰Ûªve ever said to me.",7
33401,Mike,9," Well, I‰Ûªm drunk.",7
33402,Sheldon,9, I just vomited on a lot of clowns.,7
33403,Scene,10, A radio studio.,7
33404,Ira Flatow,10," This is Science Friday. I‰Ûªm Ira Flatow. My guest today is responsible for the discovery of the first stable super-heavy element. Welcome, Dr. Sheldon Cooper.",7
33405,Sheldon,10," Thank you. Uh, the university made me come here. I didn‰Ûªt want to. Uh, big fan of the show.",7
33406,Ira,10," So, I understand that you actually discovered this element by mistake.",7
33407,Sheldon,10, Yes.,7
33408,Ira,10, And some people in the science community are calling it The Wonder Blunder.,7
33409,Sheldon,10, Who? Give me their names. I bet it‰Ûªs Wolowitz.,7
33410,Ira,10," It‰Ûªs just such a fascinating story. Your calculations are way off, but they find the element anyway. It‰Ûªs like misreading a treasure map and still finding the treasure.",7
33411,Sheldon,10, Can we talk about something else? Do you know that I yodel?,7
33412,Ira,10," That‰Ûªs interesting, but this could be taking you down the path toward a Nobel Prize. And in chemistry, no less. And wouldn‰Ûªt that be unusual? Because you‰Ûªre a physicist.",7
33413,Sheldon,10," Yes, yes, I‰Ûªd be a physicist with a Nobel in chemistry. Everyone laugh at the circus freak. You know, I don‰Ûªt need to sit here and take this, Flatow. It is because of bullies like you, every day more and more Americans are making the switch to television.",7
33414,Scene,10, The apartment. Sheldon is on the phone.,7
33415,Sheldon,10," President Seibert, I don‰Ûªt know why you‰Ûªre yelling. You‰Ûªre the one who made me go on the radio. I was expecting a professional science interview, not an attack by some morning zoo shock jock. Well, if the university needs money so badly, perhaps you should start a swear jar. Whoa, that one‰Ûªs worth a dollar.",7
33416,Amy,10," I know you don‰Ûªt like it, but every time you do an interview, it raises the profile of the university. That translates to funding.",7
33417,Sheldon,10," Yeah, well, I‰Ûªm not just some trained monkey dancing for coins.",7
33418,Leonard,10, Of course you‰Ûªre not. People love trained monkeys.,7
33419,Penny,10," How can you not be happy? You‰Ûªre tall, thin and famous. Oh, my God, I‰Ûªm jealous of Sheldon.",7
33420,Sheldon,10," Look, you‰Ûªre gonna be doing this stuff for a while. You‰Ûªre just gonna have to find a way to get used to it.",7
33421,Sheldon,10, But none of you know what this is like. Being celebrated for something you wish you never did.,7
33422,Penny,10," Mmm, you clearly haven‰Ûªt been with me at Mardi Gras.",7
33423,Scene,10, Howard and Bernadette‰Ûªs apartment.,7
33424,Bernadette,10, Want to pause the video game and help me clean up?,7
33425,Howard,10, I am cleaning up. Look at the mess the Joker made of Gotham City.,7
33426,Bernadette,10," Come on, it‰Ûªs your friend who‰Ûªs coming to stay here.",7
33427,Howard,10," Raj grew up in India. Trust me, he‰Ûªs seen worse.",7
33428,Bernadette,10, Howie. ,7
33429,Howard,10, I promise I‰Ûªll help out the rest of the week.,7
33430,Bernadette,10, The rest of the week? You said it was just gonna be a night or two.,7
33431,Howard,10," Yeah, but if I told you a week, would you have said yes?",7
33432,Bernadette,10, No.,7
33433,Howard,10, Then you left me no choice.,7
33434,Bernadette,10," I love Raj, but that‰Ûªs a long time for a house guest.",7
33435,Howard,10," I know, but they‰Ûªre tenting his building. He can‰Ûªt find a hotel he likes that allows dogs.",7
33436,Bernadette,10, He‰Ûªs bringing Cinnamon?,7
33437,Howard,10," For a whole week, the nerve of some people.",7
33438,Scene,10, Sheldon‰Ûªs bedroom. Sheldon is playing with his train set.,7
33439,Sheldon,10," Here comes the Embarrassment Express. With stops at Fraudville, Wonder Blunderberg, and Kansas City. Because it‰Ûªs a hub.",7
33440,Amy,10," Sheldon, can I come in?",7
33441,Sheldon,10, Do you have cookies?,7
33442,Amy,10, No.,7
33443,Sheldon,10, Good. I don‰Ûªt deserve cookies. Come in. Wil?,7
33444,Wil Wheaton,10," Hey, Sheldon. It‰Ûªs been a while.",7
33445,Sheldon,10, Why are you here?,7
33446,Wil,10," Amy said you were having a rough time, and I thought maybe we could talk. Is that okay?",7
33447,Sheldon,10," Certainly. Although, right now, I‰Ûªm having a rough time because there‰Ûªs three people in my room, and it‰Ûªs starting to feel like a discotheque.",7
33448,Amy,10," Sheldon, you said you were unhappy getting attention for something you wished you never did.",7
33449,Wil,10," Yeah, I know a little something about that.",7
33450,Sheldon,10," Oh, nonsense, Wil. Your endless tweets are not that bad.",7
33451,Wil,10," I remember why it‰Ûªs been a while. Sheldon, I was actually talking about when I was a kid on Star Trek.",7
33452,Sheldon,10, How could you not like getting attention for playing Wesley Crusher? You were wonderful. A know-it-all boy genius with an eidetic memory. Who couldn‰Ûªt relate to that?,7
33453,Wil,10," Well, not everybody felt that way. A lot of people really hated the character, and some of them hated me because of it. I would do interviews, and people would be mean to me.",7
33454,Sheldon,10," That just happened to me. Next time you‰Ûªre stuck for a tweet, feel free to say what a jerk Ira Flatow is.",7
33455,Amy,10," Sheldon, the point is Wil learned to embrace that part of his life and moved on to bigger and better things.",7
33456,Wil,10," Yeah, I‰Ûªm an author now, I do public speaking, and I have my own Web series about board games.",7
33457,Amy,10," Uh, we‰Ûªre trying to cheer him up, so‰Û_ ",7
33458,Wil,10," I‰Ûªm just saying that there was a time when I thought I would never get out of Wesley Crusher‰Ûªs shadow. But now, it‰Ûªs just one small part of a pretty great life, and it‰Ûªs a part that I‰Ûªm happy is there.",7
33459,Sheldon,10, I do see what you‰Ûªre saying. That helps.,7
33460,Wil,10, Good.,7
33461,Sheldon,10, Would you two like to stay and play trains with me?,7
33462,Wil,10, Sure.,7
33463,Amy,10, Okay.,7
33464,Sheldon,10," Oh, great, now, I work the controls, I say all aboard. You sit quietly and watch.",7
33465,Wil,10,Can I blow the whistle?,7
33466,Sheldon,10, You should probably go.,7
33467,Scene,10, Howard and Bernadette‰Ûªs apartment.,7
33468,Howard,10, You‰Ûªre gonna brush your teeth on my couch?,7
33469,Raj,10," No, I‰Ûªm gonna brush Cinnamon‰Ûªs teeth.",7
33470,Howard,10, Why bother? She spends half the time licking her butt.,7
33471,Raj,10, And the other half licking my face. That‰Ûªs why I‰Ûªm brushing her teeth.,7
33472,Bernadette,10," Hey, guys. Sorry I‰Ûªm so late. Did you already have dinner?",7
33473,Howard,10," No, we were waiting for you.",7
33474,Bernadette,10," Aw, that‰Ûªs so sweet.",7
33475,Howard,10, Yeah. So what do you feel like making?,7
33476,Raj,10," Howard, the poor thing just got home from work. Let me get you a glass of wine. I‰Ûªll cook dinner.",7
33477,Bermadette,10," Oh, Raj, you‰Ûªre our guest.",7
33478,Raj,10, Don‰Ûªt be silly. Sit. You look like you‰Ûªve had a long day.,7
33479,Howard,10," No, she always looks like that. Because she married an idiot.",7
33480,Bernadette,10," Thank you, Raj.",7
33481,Raj,10," Please, this is my way of thanking you for letting me stay here. Now, tell us all about your day.",7
33482,Bernadette,10," Okay, um, well, first, I was late to a meeting ‰Ûªcause I was stuck in traffic.",7
33483,Howard,10," Well, I keep telling you to put that traffic app on your phone.",7
33484,Raj,10," Hey, when you got home today complaining that you felt sick from eating too many jelly beans, did I tell you how to fix it? No. I said, aw, that must hurt, and I rubbed your belly.",7
33485,Howard,10, I thought of you the whole time.,7
33486,Raj,10, All I‰Ûªm saying is there‰Ûªs a time to just listen. ,7
33487,Bernadette,10, Thank you.,7
33488,Raj,10, There‰Ûªs also a time to stop eating too many jelly beans. And it‰Ûªs when you‰Ûªre ten.,7
33489,Scene,10, The apartment.,7
33490,Sheldon,10," Hello, President Siebert. Thank you for taking my call. I just wanted you to know that you can now expect enthusiastic participation from me regarding my discovery. Oh, no, no, no, no. No need to thank mNo, thank my friend, Wil Wheaton. For your information, I have nine friends, hmm? Ten if we include you. Nine it is. Ah, it‰Ûªs ten. I‰Ûªll count Wolowitz. Hello, friend Leonard.",7
33491,Leonard,10," Hey, you‰Ûªre in a good mood.",7
33492,Sheldon,10, I‰Ûªm in a great mood.,7
33493,Leonard,10," Well, you‰Ûªre about to be in an even better one. I didn‰Ûªt want to say anything until I knew for sure, but, I‰Ûªve been re-running the tests on your element in my lab and I disproved it. Your element does not exist.",7
33494,Sheldon,10," Yeah, but what about the Chinese research team? They found it.",7
33495,Leonard,10," Yeah, it turns out someone added simulated signals to the data files. They faked the results.",7
33496,Sheldon,10, Really?,7
33497,Leonard,10, Yes. Do you know what that means? That means all of this attention that you hate goes away.,7
33498,Sheldon,10, So no more interviews?,7
33499,Leonard,10," No, it‰Ûªs all over.",7
33500,Sheldon,10, I can‰Ûªt believe it.,7
33501,Leonard,10," Well, you‰Ûªre welcome.",7
33502,Sheldon,10, You robbed me of my greatest achievement.,7
33503,Leonard,10, What?,7
33504,Sheldon,10," I‰Ûªm back down to nine friends. Make it eight, I‰Ûªm sick of Wolowitz, too.",7
33505,Leonard,10," I, I don‰Ûªt understand. All you‰Ûªve done since you discovered this stupid element was complain. I was trying to make you happy.",7
33506,Sheldon,10," By taking away my only claim to fame? Well, if you wanted to make me happy, you could have told me a joke. Or shown me a cute video of a koala and an otter becoming unlikely friends.",7
33507,Leonard,10," Oh, there is no winning with you. And koalas and otters don‰Ûªt even live near each other.",7
33508,Sheldon,10," That‰Ûªs what makes their friendship unlikely,",7
33509,Penny,10," Hey, what‰Ûªs with all the yelling?",7
33510,Sheldon,10, Leonard disproved my element. Now all the attention is going to go away.,7
33511,Penny,10," Oh, that‰Ûªs great. You must be thrilled, ",7
33512,Sheldon,10," That‰Ûªs it, I‰Ûªm down to seven friends.",7
33513,Penny,10," He‰Ûªs counting hobbits and superheroes, right?",7
33514,Sheldon,10," When I thought the element was real, I didn‰Ûªt want it. But now that Leonard made it not exist, I want it more than anything in the world.",7
33515,Leonard,10," The, the element never existed. I didn‰Ûªt take it away, science took it away. Be mad at science.",7
33516,Sheldon,10," Don‰Ûªt you dare use science against me. Science is my best friend. Oh, good, I‰Ûªm back up to eight.",7
33517,Leonard,10, Will you tell him he‰Ûªs out of his mind.,7
33518,Penny,10," Actually, I get what he‰Ûªs saying.",7
33519,Sheldon,10," Oh, yes, nine. Welcome back, buddy.",7
33520,Penny,10," It‰Ûªs like if you‰Ûªre dating someone you‰Ûªre not that into, and then they break up with you and then you want them more than ever.",7
33521,Sheldon,10," I have no idea what she‰Ûªs talking about, but we‰Ûªre ganging up on you so I agree.",7
33522,Leonard,10," Okay, Sheldon, what do you want me to do, hide the information? If I don‰Ûªt publish it, it‰Ûªs just a matter of time before someone else does.",7
33523,Sheldon,10," No, no, of course you have to publish. That‰Ûªs your responsibility as a scientist. Doing otherwise would be unethical. You have no choice.",7
33524,Leonard,10," Fine, I‰Ûªll publish.",7
33525,Sheldon,10, Can you believe this guy?,7
33526,Scene,10, Howard and Bernadette‰Ûªs apartment.,7
33527,Bernadette,10, Aw! Raj did the dishes.,7
33528,Howard,10, How do you know I didn‰Ûªt do them?,7
33529,Bernadette,10," Because once, when all the knives were dirty, you cut a bagel with your keys.",7
33530,Raj,10," Good morning, everybody. I picked up coffee while I was out. Bernadette, here‰Ûªs your soy peppermint mocha.",7
33531,Bernadette,10," Aw, you didn‰Ûªt have to do that.",7
33532,Raj,10," Oh, my pleasure, and don‰Ûªt worry about your presentation today. You‰Ûªre gonna be great.",7
33533,Howard,10," Yeah, you‰Ûªre gonna knock it out of the park.",7
33534,Bernadette,10, What presentation do I have today?,7
33535,Howard,10, Just go.,7
33536,Raj,10, He loves you.,7
33537,Howard,10, What are you doing? Are you trying to make me look bad?,7
33538,Raj,10, I‰Ûªm just being a good house guest.,7
33539,Howard,10," No, you‰Ûªre being a better husband than I am. Doing the dishes, getting coffee, knowing about her life, who does that?",7
33540,Raj,10," Oh, come on, I brought you one, too.",7
33541,Howard,10, I don‰Ûªt want coffee.,7
33542,Raj,10, That‰Ûªs why I got you hot chocolate.,7
33543,Howard,10, Give me that. Just stop showing me up.,7
33544,Raj,10," Howard, listen to me. You‰Ûªre a great husband. Yes, your listening skills could use some work. But it‰Ûªs amazing how far you‰Ûªve come given that you‰Ûªre an only child raised by an over-protective mom.",7
33545,Howard,10," Um, is this getting weird?",7
33546,Raj,10, Hang on.,7
33547,Howard,10," So, yes.",7
33548,Scene,10, Sheldon‰Ûªs office.,7
33549,Leonard,10," Hey. I just wanted to let you know that I, I posted my findings.",7
33550,Sheldon,10, I saw. And I just posted a retraction of my paper. Now the whole scientific community knows I was wrong.,7
33551,Leonard,10," These things happen all the time, Sheldon.",7
33552,Sheldon,10, Not to me. The only other retraction I ever had to issue was when I was seven and I conceded that my brother was the greatest ninja in East Texas. But that was just a ploy to get my face out of his armpit.,7
33553,Barry,10," Thew he is. It‰Ûªs my favowite superhewo, the Wetwactor.",7
33554,Leonard,10," Come on, don‰Ûªt give him a hard time.",7
33555,Barry,10," I‰Ûªm sowwy, Cooper. I wetwact it. By the way, Hofstadter, nice job dispwoving the Chinese team.",7
33556,Leonard,10, It‰Ûªs not a big deal.,7
33557,Barry,10," It‰Ûªs a huge deal. Cooper, maybe physics just isn‰Ûªt your thing. Have you ever considered a caweer in wetail? That way you could take things back for a wiving.",7
33558,Leonard,10," Okay, Barry, that‰Ûªs enough.",7
33559,Sheldon,10," No, no, no, that‰Ûªs okay. I can fight my own battles. Isn‰Ûªt that right, Bawwy.",7
33560,Barry,10," Is? Is that a wefewence to my speech impediment? That‰Ûªs pwetty hurtful. I, I can‰Ûªt contwol it.",7
33561,Sheldon,10," You‰Ûªre right, That was uncalled for. I take it back.",7
33562,Barry,10, Of course you do. Because you‰Ûªre the Wetwactor.,7
33563,Scene,10, Howard and Bernadette‰Ûªs apartment.,7
33564,Bernadette,10," Raj, this dinner was amazing. If you‰Ûªre here much longer, I‰Ûªm gonna have to buy bigger clothes.",7
33565,Raj,10, Nonsense. You need a little fattening up. You‰Ûªve been looking too skinny lately.,7
33566,Bernadette,10," Aw. Howie, how come you never say anything sweet like that?",7
33567,Howard,10," What are you talking about? Remember last week, when I asked you if you were wearing Spanx and you weren‰Ûªt? How‰Ûªs that different?",7
33568,Bernadette,10," Maybe you could try being more thoughtful, like your friend Raj.",7
33569,Howard,10," Yeah, well, maybe you could try being more like Raj. ",7
33570,Bernadette,10," Oh, really?",7
33571,Howard,10," Yeah, yeah. He packed me a lunch this morning. And there was a note inside that said go get ‰Ûªem.",7
33572,Bernadette,10," Like I don‰Ûªt do enough around here. Now I need to pack your lunch? And by the way, why do you need a note telling you to go get ‰Ûªem? You‰Ûªre a grown man, you should know to go get ‰Ûªem.",7
33573,Howard,10," I do know to go get ‰Ûªem, but sometimes it‰Ûªs nice to have emotional support when I‰Ûªm going and getting them.",7
33574,Raj,10," Hey, hey, do you hear yourselves? Let‰Ûªs just, you know, all calm down and take a step back.",7
33575,Bernadette,10, This is stupid. Why are we fighting?,7
33576,Howard,10, I don‰Ûªt know. I guess I was just feeling like I‰Ûªm a lousy husband.,7
33577,Bernadette,10, You‰Ûªre not a lousy husband. You‰Ûªre a great husband. I was the one feeling like a lousy wife.,7
33578,Howard,10, Are you kidding? You‰Ûªre the best. I know what the problem is. It‰Ûªs him.,7
33579,Raj,10," Oh, what did I do?",7
33580,Howard,10, You made us feel like we‰Ûªre not trying hard enough.,7
33581,Bernadette,10," Yeah, we were totally fine half-assing our marriage till you showed up.",7
33582,Raj,10," Look, I‰Ûªm sorry you‰Ûªre upset with me, but I just have to say it‰Ûªs nice to see the two of you on the same page.",7
33583,Howard,10," Oh, it does feel good to have you backing me up for once.",7
33584,Bernadette,10, I back you up all the time.,7
33585,Howard,10, That is not‰Û_ he‰Ûªs doing it again. ,7
33586,Bernadette,10, What is wrong with you?,7
33587,Scene,10, The apartment.,7
33588,Leonard,10, I can‰Ûªt believe they kicked you out. ,7
33589,Raj,10," I can‰Ûªt believe they‰Ûªre still married. Oh, no, I forgot Cinnamon‰Ûªs toothbrush at Howard‰Ûªs. I guess you‰Ûªre sharing with Daddy again. ",7
33590,Penny,10, Bark once if you need me to call PETA.,7
33591,Sheldon,10, What‰Ûªs that animal doing in our apartment?,7
33592,Leonard,10," Oh, relax, she‰Ûªs in her crate. She can‰Ûªt get out.",7
33593,Sheldon,10," I have two words for you, Jurassic Park. This day just keeps getting worse and worse.",7
33594,Penny,10," You know, if it makes you feel any better‰Û_",7
33595,Sheldon,10, It probably won‰Ûªt.,7
33596,Penny,10, You‰Ûªre probably right.,7
33597,Amy,10," Sheldon, it‰Ûªs a beautiful night. Why don‰Ûªt you and I go for a nice walk together?",7
33598,Sheldon,10," Oh, everything is just sex with you isn‰Ûªt it?",7
33599,Raj,10," Sheldon, I think you might find the support you‰Ûªre looking for if you realize that relationships are a give and take. She can only be there for you as much as you are for her.",7
33600,Amy,10," Thank you, Rajesh.",7
33601,Raj,10," And, Amy, you need to be patient with Sheldon, instead of pressuring him to accept intimacy on your terms.",7
33602,Amy,10, You should probably go.,7
33603,Scene,10, The radio studio.,7
33604,Ira,10," I‰Ûªm Ira Flatow, and this is Science Friday. I‰Ûªd like to welcome back Dr. Sheldon Cooper, who thought he had discovered a new super-heavy element only to have it disproved by my next guest, Dr. Leonard Hofstadter. Welcome to Science< Friday, gentlemen.",7
33605,Leonard,10, Thanks.,7
33606,Sheldon,10," Thank you. Ira, if I may, I‰Ûªd like to apologize for my behaviour last week.",7
33607,Ira,10, It‰Ûªs all right.,7
33608,Sheldon,10," Now, isn‰Ûªt there something you‰Ûªd like to say to me?",7
33609,Ira,10," No. Now, Dr. Hofstadter. Can you walk us through the process you used to disprove his theory?",7
33610,Leonard,10, Well‰Û_,7
33611,Sheldon,10, I believe I can answer that.,7
33612,Leonard,10, He asked me.,7
33613,Sheldon,10, Fine.,7
33614,Leonard,10, As I was saying‰Û_,7
33615,Sheldon,10," You‰Ûªre telling it wrong. Ira, to really understand the story here, you have to start at the very beginning. A small town in East Texas, where a young genius named‰Û_",7
33616,Leonard,10, Sheldon.,7
33617,Sheldon,10," That‰Ûªs right, Sheldon Cooper. He was bitten by his neighbour‰Ûªs dog, leading to his first scientific breakthrough, the doggie death-ray. Which, sadly, he couldn‰Ûªt build because Santa wouldn‰Ûªt bring him enriched uranium.",7
33618,Ira,10," You know, I‰Ûªd really like to hear it from Dr. Hofstadter, if it‰Ûªs okay with you.",7
33619,Sheldon,10, What a surprise. Did you invite me back just so you could ignore me?,7
33620,Ira,10," Actually, I didn‰Ûªt invite you. You came in, you took a seat, and I‰Ûªm not comfortable with confrontation.",7
33621,Leonard,10," Sheldon, this interview is supposed to be about me.",7
33622,Sheldon,10," Well, that seems like a snooze. Even for public radio.",7
33623,Penny (listening in her apartment),10," You know, if we did a shot every time they said something embarrassing, this would be one hell of a drinking game.",7
33624,Amy,10," A little early for alcohol, isn‰Ûªt it?",7
33625,Sheldon,10," You know, I don‰Ûªt just say smart things about science. I also yodel. (Does)",7
33626,Amy,10, I‰Ûªll get the vodka.,7
33627,Scene,11, The apartment. Penny and Amy are playing a ski-ing game.,7
33628,Penny,11," Wow, you‰Ûªre really good at this.",7
33629,Amy,11," Well, I have an extremely low centre of gravity. I‰Ûªm like a pyramid.",7
33630,Penny,11, How you doing over there?,7
33631,Leonard,11," Oh, I hope it‰Ûªs just a sprain. I cannot walk into that E.R. with another video game injury.",7
33632,Penny,11," Hey, Sheldon, you want to play next?",7
33633,Sheldon,11," Oh, I would, but I‰Ûªm on my way out.",7
33634,Leonard,11, Where?,7
33635,Sheldon,11, Texas.,7
33636,Amy,11, Right now? Why?,7
33637,Leonard,11, Is someone sick?,7
33638,Sheldon,11, Yes. My sister‰Ûªs uterus came down with a baby.,7
33639,Penny,11," Oh, she‰Ûªs pregnant? That‰Ûªs great. You‰Ûªre gone an uncle. Uncle Sheldon.",7
33640,Sheldon,11," No, I will be Uncle Dr. Cooper.",7
33641,Amy,11, How come you never said she was pregnant?,7
33642,Sheldon,11," Well, I never told you about my brother‰Ûªs kidney stone. You want to hear about everything that comes out of my family‰Ûªs genitals?",7
33643,Leonard,11," Well, congrats, and it‰Ûªs nice you‰Ûªre gonna be there for your sister.",7
33644,Sheldon,11, Yes. I‰Ûªm filling in for her husband who‰Ûªs recovering from a horrible motorcycle accident. Lucky duck.,7
33645,Penny,11," Wow, so, how long will you be gone?",7
33646,Sheldon,11," Well, she‰Ûªs due tomorrow. Although it did take her six years to finish high school, so who knows?",7
33647,Amy,11, Can I give you a ride to the airport?,7
33648,Sheldon,11," Oh, no, thank you, I don‰Ûªt want to be an inconvenience. Chop-chop, Leonard. We leave in ten minutes.",7
33649,Scene,11, The apartment.,7
33650,Leonard,11," All right, here‰Ûªs the deal. Sheldon is gone, so the tree decorating rules are out the window.",7
33651,Penny,11," Yeah, which means we don‰Ûªt have to use his ridiculous ornament-spacing template.",7
33652,Leonard,11, And I‰Ûªm happy to report its kickstarter campaign is holding strong at zero dollars.,7
33653,Penny,11, Ah.,7
33654,Raj,11," Wait, so Star Wars and Star Trek characters can go on the same branch?",7
33655,Leonard,11," I know, it‰Ûªs crazy. Welcome to the Thunderdome, people. (All whoop)",7
33656,Howard,11, I‰Ûªve never done this before. It‰Ûªs kind of fun.,7
33657,Raj,11," Yeah, if your mom could see her little Bar Mitzvah boy right now, she‰Ûªd have a heart attack.",7
33658,Bernadette,11," Good idea, I‰Ûªll take a picture.",7
33659,Penny,11," Honey, I‰Ûªm a little strapped for cash this year, so for Christmas I was thinking of giving you this.",7
33660,Leonard,11, I love it.,7
33661,Penny,11, Okay.,7
33662,Leonard,11, But it is what you got me last year.,7
33663,Penny,11, Yeah.,7
33664,Leonard,11, And last night.,7
33665,Stuart,11, Hello.,7
33666,Various,11," Hey, Hi, Stuart. etc",7
33667,Stuart,11," Oh, good, I‰Ûªm glad you guys didn‰Ûªt wait for me to start. Although you said seven and it‰Ûªs, it‰Ûªs seven, but that‰Ûªs fine.",7
33668,Amy (ringing from tablet),11," Oh, it‰Ûªs probably Sheldon. Hi, Sheldon. Everybody‰Ûªs here, say hi.",7
33669,Penny,11, Hi. ,7
33670,Leonard,11," Hey, buddy.",7
33671,Raj,11, Hey.,7
33672,Howard,11, Howdy.,7
33673,Bernadette,11, Hi.,7
33674,Stuart,11, Hello.,7
33675,Sheldon,11, The second I go out of town you throw a Christmas party without me? ,7
33676,Amy,11," Yeah, kinda.",7
33677,Sheldon,11, That‰Ûªs so thoughtful. You guys are the best.,7
33678,Penny,11," Hey, how‰Ûªs your sister?",7
33679,Sheldon,11, <i>She went into labor an hour ago.,7
33680,Amy,11, That‰Ûªs wonderful. So you‰Ûªre at the hospital?,7
33681,Sheldon,11," No, she chose to have a home birth because she wants to live in the Stone Age and a cave wasn‰Ûªt available.",7
33682,Raj,11," You know, many people believe that home births are better because the mother is in a warm, comfortable environment where she can be nurtured by loved ones.",7
33683,Sheldon,11, And turn the bedroom floor into an amniotic Slip ‰Û÷n Slide.,7
33684,Mrs Cooper (off),11," Shelly, come on. Your sister‰Ûªs fully dilated and she wants a nice family picture before there‰Ûªs blood everywhere.",7
33685,Sheldon,11," Oh, boy. I picked the wrong day to wear my good robot T-shirt.",7
33686,Raj,11, If you were having Sheldon‰Ûªs baby would you really want him in the room?,7
33687,Penny,11," Yeah, if he‰Ûªs in the room when they‰Ûªre making the baby, I‰Ûªll give you ten dollars.",7
33688,Bernadette,11," Hey, I brought over It‰Ûªs a Wonderful Life if you guys want to watch it later.",7
33689,Amy,11," Oh, I love that movie.",7
33690,Raj,11, I‰Ûªve never seen it.,7
33691,Stuart,11, Me neither.,7
33692,Amy,11, It‰Ûªs great. It‰Ûªs Christmastime and Jimmy Stewart‰Ûªs really depressed and he‰Ûªs gonna jump off a bridge and kill himself.,7
33693,Stuart,11, Don‰Ûªt need to see it. Living it.,7
33694,Bernadette,11, But then he gets to see what the world would be like if he‰Ûªd never been born.,7
33695,Penny,11," Hey, you ever imagine what that would be like? Not being born?",7
33696,Leonard,11," (Knock, knock, knock) What do you think? (Knock, knock, knock) What do you think? (Knock, knock, knock) What do you think?",7
33697,Amy,11," You make jokes about Sheldon, but if it weren‰Ûªt for him, I don‰Ûªt think any of us would be sitting in this room right now.",7
33698,Howard,11, Really? Sheldon not being here is the main reason I‰Ûªm in this room.,7
33699,Amy,11, It‰Ûªs true. None of you would know me. You wouldn‰Ûªt know Bernadette. You wouldn‰Ûªt be dating Penny.,7
33700,Leonard,11, You don‰Ûªt know that. I‰Ûªve been going to the Cheesecake Factory for years. I could have picked her up. (General laughter) ,7
33701,Penny,11," Oh, you weren‰Ûªt joking.",7
33702,Leonard,11, No.,7
33703,Penny,11," Okay, sweetie, let me tell you exactly how that would have gone down.",7
33704,Leonard,11, I‰Ûªm gonna do it. I‰Ûªm gonna ask her out.,7
33705,Howard,11," I‰Ûªm gonna squirt chocolate milk out of my nipples. Sorry, I thought we‰Ûªre saying things that are never gonna happen.",7
33706,Raj,11, Maybe this time he‰Ûªs going to do it.,7
33707,Howard,11," Hope you‰Ûªre thirsty, here it comes.",7
33708,Leonard,11, Watch me.,7
33709,Penny,11," Hey, you guys ready to order or you need a few minutes?",7
33710,Leonard,11," I, uh, ah, um, I‰Û_",7
33711,Penny,11, A few minutes it is.,7
33712,Raj,11," You didn‰Ûªt ask her out, but that was a lot of sounds.",7
33713,Leonard,11, You guys are making me nervous.,7
33714,Howard,11," Fine, then go talk to her on your own.",7
33715,Leonard,11, I will. Excuse me.,7
33716,Penny,11, Yeah?,7
33717,Leonard,11," Hi, uh, um, I‰Ûªm Leonard?",7
33718,Penny,11, Really? You don‰Ûªt sound so sure.,7
33719,Leonard,11," No, I am he. Uh, any, anyway, um, there‰Ûªs been something I‰Ûªve wanted to ask you for a long time. Um.",7
33720,Penny,11, What‰Ûªs that?,7
33721,Leonard,11," Eh, uh, well, I was wondering, if you‰Ûªre not too busy, um, uh, if, if you‰Ûªd be interested in telling me where the restroom is?",7
33722,Penny,11, I think you‰Ûªre too late.,7
33723,Leonard,11," Come on, I would not have peed my pants.",7
33724,Howard,11, She nailed it.,7
33725,Raj,11, Sounds about right.,7
33726,Leonard,11," But, you forget, I did ask you out in real life.",7
33727,Amy,11," Which couldn‰Ûªt have happened if you didn‰Ûªt live across the hall from her, which couldn‰Ûªt have happened without Sheldon. Same goes with you guys. If Leonard wasn‰Ûªt with Penny, she never would have set you up.",7
33728,Howard,11," Doesn‰Ûªt matter. Bernadette still would‰Ûªve been working at The Cheesecake Factory, and I still would‰Ûªve been working this beefcake factory. You would‰Ûªve been all over me.",7
33729,Bernadette,11, Well‰Û_,7
33730,Bernadette,11," Hey, Penny, can I take that table?",7
33731,Penny,11," Sure, why?",7
33732,Bernadette,11, The one in the turtleneck is cute.,7
33733,Raj,11," Open wide, here comes the happy train.",7
33734,Howard,11," Mm-hmm, chug-a-chug-a, yum, yum.",7
33735,Raj,11," Oh. Hang on. You got a, you got a little something. Ah.",7
33736,Bernadette,11, Never mind.,7
33737,Raj,11," Oh, man, that is so us.",7
33738,Leonard,11," You know, maybe you and I wouldn‰Ûªt be together, but you wouldn‰Ûªt have done so great yourself.",7
33739,Penny,11, Why? ,7
33740,Leonard,11, Because I know exactly the kind of guy you would‰Ûªve ended up with.,7
33741,Zack,11," Hey, babe.",7
33742,Penny,11, Hey. Did you remember to pay the rent?,7
33743,Zack,11, Better. I used the money to buy these magic beans.,7
33744,Penny,11," Hey, he may be an idiot, but at least he didn‰Ûªt pee himself.",7
33745,Leonard,11," Oh, hold on.",7
33746,Zack,11," Aw, babe, I peed myself.",7
33747,Penny,11," Me, too.",7
33748,Leonard,11, The end.,7
33749,Amy (Tablet ringing),11," Hi, Sheldon. Everything okay?",7
33750,Sheldon,11," No, it‰Ûªs not. I‰Ûªve seen things. Lady things.",7
33751,Amy,11, Listen to me. That is not the way they usually look.,7
33752,Sheldon,11, Doesn‰Ûªt matter. This is no way to make new humans. People coming out of people. It‰Ûªs some kind of dirty magic show.,7
33753,Mrs Cooper (off),11, Sheldon Lee Cooper. You get back in this room right now. And bring a mop.,7
33754,Sheldon,11, Did you hear that? A mop. I have two PhDs yet somehow I‰Ûªm the janitor of my sister‰Ûªs birth canal.,7
33755,Leonard,11," Hey, Sheldon sent us all an e-mail. Happy holidays from Texas. And there‰Ûªs pictures. Aah! Don‰Ûªt open them. Do not open them.",7
33756,Penny,11," Oh, come on. Childbirth is a natural, beautiful, uuurgh, it‰Ûªs like someone sawed a cow in half.",7
33757,Raj,11," My father‰Ûªs a gynaecologist, I think I can handle it. And, now, I‰Ûªm gay.",7
33758,Bernadette,11," You know, I was thinking. Without Sheldon, most of us would have never met, but Penny would still live across from him. ",7
33759,Amy,11," And with Leonard out of the picture, we all know what that would mean.",7
33760,Penny,11, We do?,7
33761,Penny,11," Hey, Sheldon.",7
33762,Sheldon,11, Hello.,7
33763,Penny,11, Doing laundry?,7
33764,Sheldon,11," Of course I‰Ûªm doing laundry. Saturday night is laundry night, and I‰Ûªm in a laundry room, so, I believe your inference is justified.",7
33765,Penny,11," Oh, my inference is justified. Sheldon, you are so funny. Anyway, I need to do my laundry, too, because these clothes are so dirty. Almost as dirty as the dirty girl who‰Ûªs wearing them.",7
33766,Penny,11," Okay, that‰Ûªs enough.",7
33767,Leonard,11, Disagree.,7
33768,Raj,11, Keep going. ,7
33769,Howard,11, More.,7
33770,Penny,11," So, what do you think?",7
33771,Sheldon,11," A tad asymmetrical, but nothing to be concerned about.",7
33772,Penny,11," Please, Sheldon. I need you.",7
33773,Sheldon,11, To what?,7
33774,Penny,11, To take me.,7
33775,Sheldon,11, I‰Ûªm not taking you anywhere till you put on a shirt.,7
33776,Penny,11," Come on, Sheldon. You and me right here.",7
33777,Sheldon,11," Penny, for the thousandth time, I‰Ûªm saving myself for someone special. Perhaps a cute bespectacled neuroscientist with hair the color of mud. ",7
33778,Penny,11, I think I know how to change your mind.,7
33779,Leonard,11, That‰Ûªs enough.,7
33780,Raj,11, Ew.,7
33781,Stuart,11, I was okay with it.,7
33782,Amy (tablet ringing),11," How‰Ûªs it going, Sheldon?",7
33783,Sheldon,11," Actually, much better.",7
33784,Leonard,11," Oh, good. Is the baby born yet?",7
33785,Sheldon,11, I don‰Ûªt know. I just got back. ,7
33786,Amy,11, Where‰Ûªd you go?,7
33787,Sheldon,11," My mother asked me to get some towels. I took advantage of the vague request and went to Bed, Bath & Beyond. (Scream from other room) Excuse me, I‰Ûªm on the phone. So rude.",7
33788,Amy,11," Here‰Ûªs another one. Penny, if it weren‰Ûªt for Sheldon you never would have met comic book legend Stan Lee.",7
33789,Penny,11, Great.,7
33790,Raj,11," At least Leonard, Howard and I would have always been friends.",7
33791,Bernadette,11," Hey, how come you three never got an apartment together?",7
33792,Leonard,11," We talked about it, but Howard was in a pretty serious relationship with his mom.",7
33793,Howard,11, I lived with her to save money.,7
33794,Raj,11," Yeah, you didn‰Ûªt have to buy groceries ‰Ûªcause you were breast-feeding.",7
33795,Bernadette,11," Aw, so I guess if it weren‰Ûªt for me, you‰Ûªd still be living with her, huh?",7
33796,Howard,11, Not exactly.,7
33797,Penny,11," What do you mean, not exactly?",7
33798,Howard,11," Well, things would be a little different.",7
33799,Mrs Wolowitz (off),11," Howard, where‰Ûªs my lunch? I‰Ûªm starving.",7
33800,Howard,11, I know you‰Ûªre starving. The neighbours know you‰Ûªre starving. There‰Ûªs starving people in Africa who know you‰Ûªre starving.,7
33801,Mrs Wolowitz (off),11, That‰Ûªs it? There‰Ûªs not enough food.,7
33802,Howard,11,"Well, you cleaned out Earth. I don‰Ûªt know what else to do.",7
33803,Bernadette,11, How is this any different?,7
33804,Howard,11," You didn‰Ûªt let me finish. Here you go, Mother.",7
33805,Dead Mrs Wolowitz,11," You‰Ûªre a good boy, Howard, such a good boy.",7
33806,Amy,11," Wait, did she die or did you kill her?",7
33807,Howard,11," Eh, tomato, tomahto. The important thing is she‰Ûªs dead.",7
33808,Bernadette,11," Hey, so how come you two didn‰Ûªt move in together?",7
33809,Leonard,11," Oh, this guy wanted a place of his own because he was sure he was gonna be a ladies‰Ûª man.",7
33810,Raj,11," Yeah, I was wrong. But I do think you and I would have had a great time.",7
33811,Raj,11," Come on, Leonard, dinner.",7
33812,Fat Leonard,11, Coming.,7
33813,Leonard,11, Hang on. Why would I be fat?,7
33814,Raj,11," You‰Ûªd have no girlfriend to see you naked, you‰Ûªd try to fill the void with food, and I‰Ûªm an enabler who once deep-fried a pancake.",7
33815,Leonard,11," Why can‰Ûªt you be fat, too?",7
33816,Fat Leonard,11, What do you want to do for dessert?,7
33817,Fat Raj,11, I think there‰Ûªs still half a cake from breakfast.,7
33818,Fat Leonard,11," No, there‰Ûªs not.",7
33819,Fat Stuart,11," Hey, guys.",7
33820,Fat Leonard and Raj,11, Stuart!,7
33821,Raj,11, What are you doing?,7
33822,Stuart,11, I just wanted to be in anyone‰Ûªs story.,7
33823,Raj,11," Yeah, but why are you fat?",7
33824,Stuart,11, ‰Û÷Cause Leonard was fat.,7
33825,Penny,11," Amy, what about you? What do you think you‰Ûªd be doing if you never met Sheldon?",7
33826,Amy,11," It‰Ûªs hard to say, my life would be so different.",7
33827,Howard,11, You can say better. Sheldon can‰Ûªt hear you.,7
33828,Amy,11, I don‰Ûªt know.,7
33829,Amy,11," Happy birthday to me, happy birthday to me, there‰Ûªs tears in the frosting, happy birthday to me. (Stuart honks a party hooter at her.)",7
33830,Stuart,11, I‰Ûªll stop now.,7
33831,Amy (tablet ringing),11," How‰Ûªs it going, Sheldon?",7
33832,Sheldon,11, That‰Ûªs it. The baby‰Ûªs here. It‰Ûªs a boy.,7
33833,Penny,11, Aw.,7
33834,Amy,11, Yay.,7
33835,Raj,11, Congrats.,7
33836,Sheldon,11," Oh, thank you. I wasn‰Ûªt sure I was gonna to make it. But my mother gave me some ice chips, my sister told me to breathe, and I just thought to myself, Sheldon, if you can make it through the Green Lantern movie, you can make it through this.",7
33837,Leonard,11," Well, good for you, buddy. We‰Ûªll let you get back in there.",7
33838,Sheldon,11," Oh no, no, I‰Ûªm not going back in there. That baby is so irritating. He has literally been crying his entire life.",7
33839,Howard,11," Aw, he‰Ûªs already taking after Uncle Shelly.",7
33840,Amy,11," Come on, Sheldon, you should go.",7
33841,Sheldon,11, Why?,7
33842,Amy,11," Well, you always complain that you never had an intelligent role model growing up, and now you can be one for your nephew.",7
33843,Sheldon,11," Ugh, all right, I‰Ûªll go. But from what I‰Ûªve seen, his attention span is as limited as his bladder control.",7
33844,Bernadette,11, You actually got him to do it.,7
33845,Rajj,11," Yeah, you keep saying how much Sheldon has affected all of us, but you‰Ûªve clearly had an impact on him.",7
33846,Amy,11," If that were true, I wouldn‰Ûªt still be living alone. Well, not exactly alone. I do have a 50 pound sack of rice with one of Sheldon‰Ûªs T-shirts on it.",7
33847,Leonard,11," I‰Ûªm telling you, Sheldon cares for you more than you think.",7
33848,Amy,11, I wish I could believe you. I also wish there wasn‰Ûªt a mouse living in Rice Sheldon.,7
33849,Leonard,11," Hang on, I‰Ûªm gonna give you a little early Christmas present. I‰Ûªm gonna show you something, but if you ever told Sheldon he‰Ûªd probably never speak to me again. So, if you want to tell him, that‰Ûªs fine. Look.",7
33850,Amy,11, I don‰Ûªt understand.,7
33851,Leonard,11, He made you his screensaver.,7
33852,Amy,11," Oh. Wow. I had no idea. He is so into me. Wait, wait, where‰Ûªd I go?",7
33853,Leonard,11," Oh, well, it‰Ûªs you, Swamp Thing, Stephen Hawking, Spider-Man, but, look, you‰Ûªre in the mix.",7
33854,Amy,11, I am in the mix. And I‰Ûªm the hottest one.,7
33855,Penny,11, Who‰Ûªs that?,7
33856,Leonard,11," Oh, Madame Curie.",7
33857,Amy,11," That‰Ûªs fine, she‰Ûªs dead.",7
33858,Scene,11, The stairwell.,7
33859,Sheldon,11, You okay?,7
33860,Amy,11, Just really glad you‰Ûªre back.,7
33861,Sheldon,11," Me, too. I got a lot of TV to catch up on.",7
33862,Amy,11, I missed you.,7
33863,Sheldon,11," To quote Han Solo, I know.",7
33864,Amy,11, Did you miss me?,7
33865,Sheldon,11, I would‰Ûªve preferred to have you there with me.,7
33866,Amy,11, Oh.,7
33867,Sheldon,11, Or instead of me.,7
33868,Amy,11, Did you hold the baby?,7
33869,Sheldon,11, I did. ,7
33870,Amy,11, And? How did it make you feel?,7
33871,Sheldon,11," Looking into the blank, innocent eyes of a creature that couldn‰Ûªt begin to comprehend anything I was saying? Basically just another day at the office.",7
33872,Fat Leonard,11, I‰Ûªm gonna do it. I‰Ûªm gonna ask her out.,7
33873,Howard,11, And chocolate milk is gonna squirt out of my nipples.,7
33874,Fat Raj,11," Put up or shut up. You make it, I‰Ûªll drink it.",7
33875,Penny,11, You guys need anything else?,7
33876,Fat Leonard,11," Uh, your phone number and one more cheesecake.",7
33877,Penny,11," I‰Ûªm sorry, I have a boyfriend. In fact, there he is now. Ready to go, sweetheart?",7
33878,Stuart,11, Not until I get my kiss.,7
33879,Scene,12, The apartment.,7
33880,Amy,12," This is nice, that we all get to eat together.",7
33881,Leonard,12, Absolutely.,7
33882,Amy,12, Hmm. Can we maybe put the phones down and have an actualhuman conversation?,7
33883,Sheldon,12," We can, but thanks to Steve Jobs, we don‰Ûªt have to.",7
33884,Penny,12," Guys, guys, you‰Ûªre never gonna believe this.",7
33885,Leonard,12, What happened?,7
33886,Penny,12, I just got a part on a TV show.,7
33887,Amy,12, Congratulations.,7
33888,Leonard,12, What? That‰Ûªs great. Guys.,7
33889,Howard,12," Oh, yeah",7
33890,Sheldon,12," Yay, Penny.",7
33891,Amy,12, What‰Ûªs the show?,7
33892,Penny,12," Um, NC‰Û_ II‰Û_ or, you know, NCSTD‰Û_ I don‰Ûªt know, it‰Ûªs, it‰Ûªs, you know, it‰Ûªs the one with the letters and I‰Ûªm gonna be on it!",7
33893,Leonard,12, That‰Ûªs amazing.,7
33894,Penny,12, Yeah.,7
33895,Howard,12, What‰Ûªs your part?,7
33896,Penny,12," Um, I play a customer in a diner and I flirt with Mark Harmon.",7
33897,Raj,12," Ooh, Mark Harmon, he‰Ûªs a dreamboat.",7
33898,Leonard,12," So it, it‰Ûªs just flirting?",7
33899,Penny,12," Well, yeah. Why?",7
33900,Leonard,12," Uh, no reason. I just think it‰Ûªs sexier when things are left to the imagination.",7
33901,Amy,12, He‰Ûªs wrong.,7
33902,Scene,12, The Cheesecake Factory.,7
33903,Raj,12, So I read a study that says a man with a dog is three times more likely to get a woman‰Ûªs phone number.,7
33904,Leonard,12, Is it true even when the man lets his dog lick peanut butter off his tongue?,7
33905,Raj,12, I don‰Ûªt see why not. ,7
33906,Howard,12," If you‰Ûªre really desperate to meet women and like having food eaten out of your mouth, I could set you up with my mom.",7
33907,Sheldon,12, Why is that funny? That‰Ûªs just unhygienic.,7
33908,Leonard,12, It‰Ûªs a joke.,7
33909,Sheldon,12," I don‰Ûªt think so. I believe that a joke is a brief oral narrative with a climactic humorous twist. For example, uh, Wolowitz‰Ûªs mother is so fat that she decided to go on a diet, or exercise, or both. See? The twist is that people don‰Ûªt usually change. Well, they don‰Ûªt.",7
33910,Penny,12," Hey, guys, don‰Ûªt forget, my episode‰Ûªs on TV tomorrow night.",7
33911,Howard,12, We‰Ûªll be there.,7
33912,Raj,12, Can we bring anything?,7
33913,Penny,12," Oh, that‰Ûªs so sweet of you, but I was gonna steal food from here. You know, my treat.",7
33914,Sheldon,12," Wait, if Howard‰Ûªs mother is coming, then you should also steal marbles. Because she‰Ûªs obese, and hippos are obese, and in the popular board game Hungry Hungry Hippos, they eat marbles. Maybe I need to dumb these down for you. ",7
33915,Scene,12, The stairwell.,7
33916,Sheldon,12," Leonard, do you think I‰Ûªm funny?",7
33917,Leonard,12, No. Do you?,7
33918,Sheldon,12, I think I‰Ûªm hysterical.,7
33919,Leonard,12, I take it back. That was funny.,7
33920,Sheldon,12, The philosopher Henri Bergson says it‰Ûªs funny when a human being behaves like an object. ,7
33921,Leonard,12, I bet that bit killed at The Chuckle Hut.,7
33922,Sheldon,12," Oh, he didn‰Ûªt perform stand-up comedy, he was a philosopher.",7
33923,Leonard,12," You know, I think we‰Ûªre zeroing in on your problem.",7
33924,Sheldon,12," Perhaps I‰Ûªll spend some time developing a unified theory of comedy, which will allow me to elicit laughter from anyone at any time. Unless they‰Ûªre German, ‰Ûªcause that‰Ûªs a tough crowd.",7
33925,Leonard,12, Are you set on people laughing with you? ‰Û÷Cause if you‰Ûªre cool with at you‰Û_,7
33926,Sheldon,12, I don‰Ûªt get it.,7
33927,Scene,12, Bernadette‰Ûªs car.,7
33928,Bernadette,12," Raj, when you said you were gonna bring a date to watch Penny‰Ûªs thing tonight, I didn‰Ûªt think you meant Stuart.",7
33929,Howard,12, Really? I never for a second thought it‰Ûªd be anything else.,7
33930,Raj,12," I almost met someone last night, but I blew it. I was walking Cinnamon and this girl introduced herself, but she was so cute I panicked and said, wouldn‰Ûªt it be easier if instead of talking we could just sniff each other‰Ûªs butts?",7
33931,Bernadette,12," Well, Stuart‰Ûªs cute in his own way.",7
33932,Stuart,12," When I was a baby, my mother called me her little possum.",7
33933,Raj,12, Are possums cute?,7
33934,Stuart,12, Not at all.,7
33935,Howard,12," If you‰Ûªre so intimidated by talking to attractive girls, maybe you should practice by talking to regular people.",7
33936,Raj,12, You mean like fatties and uggos?,7
33937,Bernadette,12, Or maybe just stop talking.,7
33938,Howard,12," I‰Ûªm serious. Go to the mall, talk to anybody, practice, that way when you eventually do talk to a cute girl, it won‰Ûªt be so scary.",7
33939,Bernadette,12, Or just keep dating the possum.,7
33940,Scene,12, The apartment.,7
33941,Voice on television,12, Parsa doesn‰Ûªt have those kind of resources.,7
33942,Second voice,12," No, and that‰Ûªs why he had Erin Pace rewire it‰Û_",7
33943,Leonard,12, I‰Ûªm so proud of you.,7
33944,Penny,12, We haven‰Ûªt even gotten to my scene yet.,7
33945,Leonard,12," I know, but you‰Ûªre going to be a TV star and you haven‰Ûªt left me yet. That takes guts.",7
33946,Sheldon,12," I don‰Ûªt know about you, but I‰Ûªm very uncomfortable with all this.",7
33947,Amy,12, Why?,7
33948,Sheldon,12, I‰Ûªve never seen this show before and now I‰Ûªm starting with episode 246? It‰Ûªs unnatural.,7
33949,Amy,12, Just think of the first 245 as the prequel.,7
33950,Sheldon,12, All right.,7
33951,Penny,12," Okay, shh, guys, guys, this is it.",7
33952,Man on TV,12," I guess it‰Ûªs you and me, kid.",7
33953,Mark Harmon on TV,12, What are you doing?,7
33954,Woman on TV,12, I‰Ûªm trying to make peace.,7
33955,Mark Harmon on TV,12, We‰Ûªre good.,7
33956,Woman on TV,12, Good.,7
33957,Mark Harmon on TV,12, Really? Because‰Û_,7
33958,Penny,12, Are you kidding me?,7
33959,Leonard,12, What‰Ûªs wrong?,7
33960,Penny,12," Well, the diner scene. Where‰Ûªs my diner scene?",7
33961,Sheldon,12," Well, don‰Ûªt ask me. Until I see the prequel, I‰Ûªm lost.",7
33962,Penny,12," No, there was supposed to be a big scene with me and Mark Harmon, but it‰Ûªs gone.",7
33963,Bernadette,12, What happened?,7
33964,Penny,12, They must‰Ûªve cut it.,7
33965,Leonard,12," Oh, Penny, I‰Ûªm, I‰Ûªm sorry. ",7
33966,Howard,12, That stinks.,7
33967,Raj,12, I‰Ûªm sure you were great.,7
33968,Penny,12," This doesn‰Ûªt make any sense. I mean, I, I thought I did a, a really good job, I‰Û_ Excuse me.",7
33969,Sheldon,12, I‰Ûªve been studying how to make people laugh. They say that comedy is tragedy plus time. Let‰Ûªs tickle some ribs.,7
33970,Scene,12, Penny‰Ûªs apartment.,7
33971,Penny (on phone),12," No, Dad, I don‰Ûªt think they cut me out of the show because I was too pretty. No, I don‰Ûªt need you to come out and kick Mark Harmon‰Ûªs ass. Daddy, I gotta go. I love you. Bye.",7
33972,Leonard,12, How you doing?,7
33973,Penny,12," Ugh, this is such a disaster. My parents had all my relatives over. They got one of those six-foot sandwiches, and got my brother a day pass out of rehab and now he‰Ûªs missing and the sandwich is missing, and they‰Ûªre probably in Mexico by now. So humiliating.",7
33974,Leonard,12, You still got the part. That‰Ûªs a huge accomplishment.,7
33975,Penny,12," Yeah, but this was supposed to be my break, okay? People were gonna see me in this show and it was gonna lead to bigger things. More auditions, more parts. Now none of that‰Ûªs gonna happen.",7
33976,Leonard,12," Honey, you only had, like, three lines. That wasn‰Ûªt gonna happen anyway.",7
33977,Penny,12, Unbelievable.,7
33978,Leonard,12," Oh, come on, no, that‰Ûªs not what I meant.",7
33979,Penny,12, Then what did you mean?,7
33980,Leonard,12," I don‰Ûªt, look, you know, words don‰Ûªt always have to mean things.",7
33981,Penny,12, I think you meant that you don‰Ûªt believe in me.,7
33982,Leonard,12," Nope. Uh, uh, I might not know what I meant, but I know that I didn‰Ûªt mean that. Not this guy. Oh, no way.",7
33983,Penny,12," I want you, right now, to give me your 100% honest opinion.",7
33984,Leonard,12, Right.,7
33985,Penny,12, Do you think I have what it takes to really make it as an actress?,7
33986,Leonard,12, Yes.,7
33987,Penny,12, So you think I‰Ûªll be on TV and in movies and win awards.,7
33988,Leonard,12, Honestly?,7
33989,Penny,12," Yes, honestly.",7
33990,Leonard,12, I don‰Ûªt.,7
33991,Penny,12, How could you say that?,7
33992,Leonard,12," I don‰Ûªt know, I got all confused when you said honestly.",7
33993,Penny,12, Oh.,7
33994,Leonard,12," Look, do I think that you are talented and that you are beautiful? Of course I do. But isn‰Ûªt Los Angeles full of actresses who are just as talented, just as beautiful? All right, look, we‰Ûªll come back to that.",7
33995,Penny,12," No, please. Don‰Ûªt stop, go on. Tell me how I‰Ûªm gonna be a waitress for the rest of my life.",7
33996,Leonard,12," That is not what I said. Look, I think you‰Ûªre really good. I truly do. But this is an incredibly hard thing that you‰Ûªre shooting for. I mean, the odds of anyone becoming a successful actor are like a million to one.",7
33997,Penny,12," Wow, thank you.",7
33998,Leonard,12, Should‰Ûªve let Sheldon come.,7
33999,Scene,12, The apartment.,7
34000,Sheldon,12," This is interesting. Apparently, a key component in some forms of humour is the element of surprise. ",7
34001,Amy,12," Well, that makes sense. The prefrontal cortex is responsible for planning and anticipation, and patients with brain lesions on their‰Û_",7
34002,Sheldon,12, BRAIN LESIONS!,7
34003,Amy,12," Sheldon, you scared me. That wasn‰Ûªt funny.",7
34004,Sheldon,12, Or maybe you have a stick up your prefrontal cortex.,7
34005,Amy,12," Okay, the notion that you can read a few books and come up with a definitive theory of comedy is absurd. I mean, humour is a complex neurological‰Û_ (Sheldon drops his trousers) Okay, that‰Ûªs pretty good.",7
34006,Sheldon,12, Excellent.,7
34007,Scene,12, The mall.,7
34008,Stuart,12, How about her?,7
34009,Raj,12, No. No pretty girls. The point is to talk to regular people and work our way up to pretty girls.,7
34010,Stuart,12, Fine. How about that old lady with the walker?,7
34011,Raj,12," That depends. On any level, do you think she‰Ûªs hot?",7
34012,Stuart,12, We‰Ûªll find somebody else.,7
34013,Scene,12, The apartment. ,7
34014,Sheldon,12, Kumquat?,7
34015,Amy,12, I guess.,7
34016,Sheldon,12, Ointment?,7
34017,Amy,12, Sure.,7
34018,Sheldon,12," Now, would you say ointment is more, equal to, or less funny than kumquat?",7
34019,Amy,12, I don‰Ûªt think I want to go out with you anymore.,7
34020,Sheldon,12, Will you please stop joking around? I‰Ûªm trying to figure this out.,7
34021,Amy,12," Sheldon, how many words are you gonna go through?",7
34022,Sheldon,12, All of them.,7
34023,Scene,12, Penny‰Ûªs apartment. ,7
34024,Penny,12, You didn‰Ûªt get your part cut.,7
34025,Voice on TV,12," All right, baby, here‰Ûªs the deal.",7
34026,Penny,12," And you didn‰Ûªt get your part cut. Yep, bunch of old guys rocking out in a band, all with erectile dysfunction, you didn‰Ûªt get your part cut!",7
34027,Leonard,12, Hey. Can we talk?,7
34028,Penny,12," We can, but the part of Penny might get cut.",7
34029,Leonard,12," That was really crappy of me. What you‰Ûªre trying to do is hard, but people do make it, and I really do believe you could be one of them.",7
34030,Penny,12, Thank you.,7
34031,Leonard,12," And to show you how much I believe in you, I kind of got you an audition.",7
34032,Penny,12, Are you serious? For what?,7
34033,Leonard,12, The new Star Wars movie.,7
34034,Penny,12, What? How did you manage that?,7
34035,Leonard,12," There‰Ûªs this thing online, you put yourself on tape and just send it in, anyone can do it.",7
34036,Penny,12," Come on Leonard, this is just a PR stunt.",7
34037,Leonard,12," So? Even if it is, you have a huge advantage because you‰Ûªre an actual actress. Most of the people doing this are just weirdoes and nerds. Wolowitz sent his in two days ago.",7
34038,Penny,12," Really, let it go.",7
34039,Leonard,12," Look, maybe it is a long shot, but sometimes long shots happen. Luke Skywalker was only given one chance to destroy the Death Star. He had to get a torpedo into an exhaust port that was only two meters wide, but with the help of The Force, he‰Û_ wow, I can feel you hating me right now.",7
34040,Scene,12, The mall. ,7
34041,Stuart,12," How about that lady in the sweat suit, speed-walking?",7
34042,Raj,12," Yeah, she seems friendly and easy to‰Û_ never mind, she‰Ûªs gone. You know, maybe talking to people is too hard.",7
34043,Stuart,12," We could go over to that department store, practice on the mannequins.",7
34044,Raj,12," I don‰Ûªt know. They‰Ûªre dressed very stylishly. They‰Ûªre probably stuck-up. This is ridiculous. The next person that walks by, no matter who it is, they‰Ûªre the one. We‰Ûªre gonna die here.",7
34045,Scene,12, The Cheesecake Factory.,7
34046,Amy,12, Hello.,7
34047,Bernadette,12, Hey.,7
34048,Howard,12, Where‰Ûªs Sheldon?,7
34049,Amy,12, He‰Ûªs home trying to use science to determine the basis of humour.,7
34050,Bernadette,12, That‰Ûªs interesting.,7
34051,Amy,12," It‰Ûªs exhausting. Do you have any idea how hard it is to laugh at a knock-knock joke that starts with knock-knock-knock, Amy, knock-knock-knock, Amy, knock-knock-knock, Amy?",7
34052,Bernadette,12," If you want him to stop, sometimes the easiest thing to do is just fake a laugh.",7
34053,Howard,12, Fake a laugh? Do you ever do that with me?,7
34054,Bernadette,12," No, of course not.",7
34055,Howard,12," Well, I‰Ûªd be able to tell anyway.",7
34056,Bernadette,12, I don‰Ûªt think you would.,7
34057,Howard,12," Please, I‰Ûªve made plenty of girls laugh, sometimes just by asking them out. (Bernadette laughs uncontrollably) Yeah? Well, I fake my orgasms.",7
34058,Scene,12, The apartment. ,7
34059,Leonard (on phone),12," Yes, how much for a hundred long-stemmed red roses? Really? How much for three?",7
34060,Penny,12, Hey.,7
34061,Leonard,12," Yeah, I‰Ûªll call you back.",7
34062,Penny,12," Look, I know you were just trying to help with your Star Wars thing. I didn‰Ûªt mean to call it idiotic.",7
34063,Leonard,12," Well, I don‰Ûªt think you called it idiotic.",7
34064,Penny,12," Oh. Sorry, I meant to. Anyway, um, I was just upset with myself. I wasn‰Ûªt mad at you. I just feel like everything is falling apart.",7
34065,Leonard,12, Come on. It‰Ûªs okay.,7
34066,Penny,12," No, it‰Ûªs not okay. Look at me, okay? I took a temp job as a waitress forever ago, and I‰Ûªm still doing it. I can‰Ûªt quit, because guess what? I can‰Ûªt do anything else. And I finally get my big break, and it goes away. I‰Ûªm such a mess.",7
34067,Leonard,12," No, you‰Ûªre not.",7
34068,Penny,12," Really? ‰Û÷Cause this morning at Starbucks, a pair of old underwear fell out of my pant leg. And it wasn‰Ûªt the only one in there.",7
34069,Leonard,12," Okay, listen to me, this is just a minor setback.",7
34070,Penny,12," No, it‰Ûªs not, okay? I‰Ûªve been out here for, like, ten years. I‰Ûªve nothing to show for it.",7
34071,Leonard,12," Well, you have me.",7
34072,Penny,12, You‰Ûªre right. I do have you. Mm. Let‰Ûªs get married.,7
34073,Leonard,12, What?,7
34074,Penny,12," Ooh. Leonard Hofstadter, will you marry me?",7
34075,Leonard,12, Um‰Û_,7
34076,Penny,12, Did you seriously just say um?,7
34077,Leonard,12," Look, you know I love you but, but you‰Ûªre, you‰Ûªre drunk and sad and feeling lost.",7
34078,Penny,12," Okay, so, so you don‰Ûªt want to marry me?",7
34079,Leonard,12, That is not what I said.,7
34080,Penny,12," No, forget it. I take it back. Offer‰Ûªs off the table.",7
34081,Sheldon,12, Who‰Ûªs in the mood to laugh?,7
34082,Leonard,12, Really not a good time.,7
34083,Sheldon,12, But I used science to construct the perfect joke.,7
34084,Penny,12, I‰Ûªm gonna go.,7
34085,Leonard,12," Penny, don‰Ûªt.",7
34086,Penny,12," No, no, I just need to be alone.",7
34087,Sheldon,12," So, a sandwich, a rabbi and yo mama walk into a bar. Where are you going?",7
34088,Leonard,12, To my room.,7
34089,Sheldon,12, Should I follow you?,7
34090,Leonard,12, No.,7
34091,Sheldon,12," Leonard, wait.",7
34092,Leonard,12, What?,7
34093,Sheldon,12, I forgot to tell you the sandwich is promiscuous.,7
34094,Scene,12, The mall.,7
34095,Stuart,12, How about those guys on that bench over there? They look pathetic. I bet we could talk to them.,7
34096,Raj,12, That‰Ûªs a mirror.,7
34097,Stuart,12," Oh, yeah.",7
34098,Security Guard,12," Hey, fellas, mall‰Ûªs closing.",7
34099,Raj,12, Sorry.,7

34102,Security Guard,12, Yeah?,7
34103,Raj,12," Uh, do, do you like being a mall security guard?",7
34104,Security Guard,12, It‰Ûªs all right.,7

34110,Sheldon,12, Would you like to talk about it?,7
34111,Leonard,12," Penny proposed, and I didn‰Ûªt say yes.",7
34112,Sheldon,12, Why not?,7
34113,Leonard,12, That‰Ûªs a good question.,7
34114,Sheldon,12, Does that mean the relationship is over?,7
34115,Leonard,12, I don‰Ûªt know.,7
34116,Sheldon,12, Why don‰Ûªt you ask her?,7
34117,Leonard,12, Because I‰Ûªm afraid to know the answer.,7
34118,Sheldon,12," Well, I‰Ûªm sorry.",7
34119,Leonard,12, That‰Ûªs it? You‰Ûªre not gonna make some dumb joke or some inappropriate comment?,7
34120,Sheldon,12," No. You‰Ûªre my friend, and, I‰Ûªm sorry.",7
34121,Leonard,12, Did you just put a kick me sign on my back?,7
34122,Sheldon,12, No. That wouldn‰Ûªt be funny at all.,7

34132,Leonard,13," You need to let it go, Sheldon.",7
34133,Sheldon,13," You work tirelessly for someone, and this is what you get.",7
34134,Leonard,13," Oh, my God, they‰Ûªre just making you use your vacation days.",7
34135,Sheldon,13, But I don‰Ûªt want a vacation.,7
34136,Leonard,13," Okay, listen, I don‰Ûªt mean to diminish what you‰Ûªre going through, but I‰Ûªm a little distracted right now.",7
34137,Sheldon,13," Oh, this again? So, Penny proposed, you didn‰Ûªt say yes, and now you think you may have lost her love forever. How does this compare to me being forced to relax for a few days?",7
34138,Leonard,13, It doesn‰Ûªt.,7
34139,Sheldon,13, Thank you.,7
34140,Leonard,13, I‰Ûªm gonna go talk to Penny. ,7

34145,Leonard,13, Okay.,7
34146,Penny,13, Yeah. Come in.,7
34147,Leonard,13," Look, if you want to break up, just say it.",7
34148,Penny,13, Leonard‰Û_,7

34151,Leonard,13," Oh. Oh, okay. Good, good. So, it‰Ûªs cool if I cry a little?",7
34152,Penny,13," Yeah, I probably wouldn‰Ûªt.",7
34153,Leonard,13, Yeah.,7
34154,Penny,13," Look, you did the right thing last night. I was a mess. I was just frustrated because my career is going nowhere.",7
34155,Leonard,13," Look, I get it, and I want you to know that I support whatever you want to do.",7
34156,Penny,13," Great, because I‰Ûªve been thinking, if I really want this acting thing to work, I need to focus all my energy on it. And to do that, I should quit waitressing at The Cheesecake Factory.",7
34157,Leonard,13," Wow. That, that‰Ûªs a big step.",7
34158,Penny,13, I know.,7
34159,Leonard,13," So, well, before making any rash‰Û_",7
34160,Penny,13, I already quit.,7

34164,Leonard,13, No. You‰Ûªre on vacation.,7
34165,Sheldon,13, Please. What if there‰Ûªs a big breakthrough in science today and I‰Ûªm not there to see it?,7
34166,Leonard,13, Do you really think there‰Ûªs gonna be a breakthrough without you there to do it?,7
34167,Sheldon,13, No. I was just tricking you.,7
34168,Leonard,13, Bye.,7
34169,Sheldon,13," Leonard, wait. Take me with you.",7
34170,Leonard,13, No.,7

34178,Bernadette,13, Hey Stuart.,7
34179,Stuart,13, Hey.,7
34180,Bernadette,13, Sorry. Did I startle you?,7
34181,Stuart,13," Yes, but at this point, pretty much any customer does. What can I do for you?",7
34182,Bernadette,13," Well, I need a little help. I accidentally destroyed one of Howard‰Ûªs comic books this morning, and was hoping I could replace it.",7
34183,Stuart,13, Wow. What happened?,7
34184,Bernadette,13, Batman got his ass kicked by my curling iron.,7
34185,Stuart,13," Well, don‰Ûªt let The Riddler know that. It‰Ûªs a comic book joke. Or maybe it‰Ûªs not.",7
34186,Bernadette,13, Do you have this one?,7
34187,Stuart,13," Uh, well, it‰Ûªs, it‰Ûªs pretty rare. Can you give me a few days to track it down?",7
34188,Bernadette,13," Ooh, I was kind of hoping to get it before Howie comes home from work.",7
34189,Stuart,13, Oh. What‰Ûªs the hurry?,7
34190,Bernadette,13," Well, he‰Ûªs always saying I should be more careful with my curling iron, and it seems like a dangerous precedent to let him think he can be right.",7
34191,Stuart,13," Well, I‰Ûªll do what I can, but I can‰Ûªt make any promises.",7
34192,Bernadette,13," You know, I do work at a pharmaceutical company. If you can make this happen today, I can hook you up with anxiety medication, antidepressants. ",7

34198,Raj,13," Well, we were just on our way to lunch and wanted to see if you‰Ûªd like to join.",7
34199,Amy,13," Why? Because Sheldon‰Ûªs not here this week, and you don‰Ûªt think I have any other options? I‰Ûªm just kidding. I‰Ûªll get my purse.",7
34200,Bert,13," Hi, Amy. I, oh, I‰Ûªm sorry. I didn‰Ûªt know you had any company.",7
34201,Amy,13," That‰Ûªs okay. Uh, Bert, this is Howard and Rajesh. Guys, this is Bert.",7
34202,Howard,13, Hi.,7

34214,Raj,13, He brought you a pretty rock.,7

34216,Howard,13," You know, if you‰Ûªd rather skip lunch and hang out with your boyfriend Bert, it‰Ûªs totally okay.",7
34217,Amy,13, He‰Ûªs not my boyfriend.,7
34218,Raj,13," Are you sure? He‰Ûªs tall, pale and awkward. That sounds like your type.",7
34219,Amy,13, Should someone as lonely as you really be making fun of me?,7
34220,Raj,13," Yeah, grow up, Howard. God.",7
34221,Amy,13, What do I do? I don‰Ûªt want to hurt his feelings.,7
34222,Howard,13, Maybe the problem is he thinks you‰Ûªre available. Does he know you‰Ûªre dating Sheldon?,7
34223,Amy,13, I guess it hasn‰Ûªt come up.,7
34224,Howard,13, There you go. ,7
34225,Raj,13, And does Sheldon know you‰Ûªre dating Sheldon?,7
34226,Amy,13, I‰Ûªm sorry. Who are you dating?,7

34233,Penny,13, Why are you sitting in the stairwell?,7

34253,Leonard,13," I don‰Ûªt know. She already thinks I don‰Ûªt support this, so if I call, it might look like I‰Ûªm checking up on her.",7
34254,Raj,13," Well, do you support this?",7
34255,Leonard,13, Of course I do. She‰Ûªs a great actress. I‰Ûªm proud she‰Ûªs taking this risk.,7
34256,Amy,13, That‰Ûªs nice.,7
34257,Leonard,13, You bought that? Great. I got to call her before I forget how I said it. Hey.,7

34274,Sheldon,13," A fitting swan song to your career as a waitress, to forget my order one last time.",7
34275,Penny,13, Do you think quitting my job was a mistake?,7
34276,Sheldon,13, Do you see me drinking lemonade?,7
34277,Penny,13, No. I‰Ûªm serious.,7
34278,Sheldon,13, Why do you ask?,7
34279,Penny,13, Because Leonard just pissed me off. Am I being an idiot or not?,7
34280,Sheldon,13," No, I don‰Ûªt think you are. ",7
34281,Penny,13, Really?,7
34282,Sheldon,13," The best way to achieve a goal is to devote 100% of your time and energy to it. When I decided I was going to be a physicist, I didn‰Ûªt take some other job in case it didn‰Ûªt work out. Which wasn‰Ûªt easy because there was a lot of pressure from Ms. Pearson for me to be chalk monitor that year.",7
34283,Penny,13, Thank you. I needed to hear that. Why can‰Ûªt Leonard understand it?,7
34284,Sheldon,13," Because he‰Ûªs not like us, Penny. We‰Ûªre dreamers.",7

34291,Bert,13, Oh. This is awkward. You thought I was gonna ask you to go with me to the mineral show.,7
34292,Amy,13, Weren‰Ûªt you?,7
34293,Bert,13, Yeah.,7
34294,Amy,13," That‰Ûªs very nice of you, but I do have a boyfriend.",7
34295,Bert,13, That‰Ûªs what you all say. You just don‰Ûªt want to go out with me because I have an off-putting personality.,7
34296,Amy,13," No, that‰Ûªs not true. My boyfriend has an off-putting personality, too. Like, way worse than you.",7
34297,Bert,13," Don‰Ûªt worry. I‰Ûªm used to it. I mean, I‰Ûªm big and weird and funny-looking and no one ever wants to do anything with me.",7

34323,Jesse,13, Sorry. You want the book or not?,7

34338,Raj,13," Oh, who was that girl from our Starbucks?",7
34339,Howard,13, Arlene Russel.,7
34340,Raj,13, Yes. Arlene. She wrote no way on both our cappuccinos.,7
34341,Howard,13, Poor Bert. That guy‰Ûªs got a rough afternoon ahead of him.,7
34342,Amy,13," Well, how would you want a girl to tell you she wasn‰Ûªt interested?",7
34343,Raj,13," I guess, uh, I‰Ûªd like her to sit me down, look me in the eye and say, I was wrong. I love you. And then maybe she could touch me in a special way.",7
34344,Howard,13, That‰Ûªs how you reject a guy.,7
34345,Amy,13," Okay, I don‰Ûªt have time for this. I‰Ûªm just gonna go find him and be brutally honest.",7
34346,Howard,13," No, don‰Ûªt.",7
34347,Raj,13, He‰Ûªll be so upset. He‰Ûªll probably climb up the Empire State Building and start swatting at planes.,7
34348,Howard,13, You want us to talk to him?,7
34349,Amy,13, Really? You would do that?,7
34350,Raj,13, Sure. We‰Ûªve both been in his shoes. We‰Ûªll let him down with compassion and respect.,7
34351,Amy,13, Thank you.,7
34352,Howard,13, Let‰Ûªs go.,7
34353,Raj,13," So we tell him she‰Ûªs a lesbian, right?",7
34354,Howard,13, Of course we tell him she‰Ûªs a lesbian.,7
34355,Scene,13, The apartment. Penny and Sheldon are doing yoga.,7
34356,Penny,13," And hold three, two, one. Very good. Now let‰Ûªs try Warrior 2. And hold.",7
34357,Sheldon,13, I‰Ûªve read that there are great yogis who have such mastery over their bodies they can draw water in through their genitals.,7
34358,Penny,13," Yeah, well, I don‰Ûªt think we‰Ûªre gonna get to do that today.",7
34359,Sheldon,13, Too bad. It seems like a good way to drink a milk shake without getting brain freeze.,7
34360,Leonard,13," Oh, hey.",7
34361,Penny,13, And now we go to Reverse Warrior.,7
34362,Leonard,13, How did she get you to do yoga?,7
34363,Sheldon,13," Well, to be honest, I thought she said Yoda.",7
34364,Penny,13," I‰Ûªm helping him relax because, unlike you, he supports me.",7
34365,Leonard,13," Oh, how many times do I have to say it? I support you.",7
34366,Penny,13," Sheldon, take a break.",7
34367,Sheldon,13, Namaste.,7
34368,Penny,13," Okay, if you support me, what was with that phone call?",7
34369,Leonard,13," Fine. I‰Ûªm not sure you should have quit. But if you care so much what I think, why didn‰Ûªt you ask me before you did it?",7
34370,Penny,13," Oh, so now I need your permission? Would you have asked me before you quit your job?",7
34371,Leonard,13," Yes. I thought we were in the kind of relationship where we make decisions together. If I‰Ûªm wrong, then maybe we need to talk about the kind of relationship we‰Ûªre actually in.",7
34372,Penny,13," Yeah, well, maybe we do.",7
34373,Sheldon,13, I‰Ûªm willing to if you guys are.,7
34374,Leonard,13, Can we please have some privacy?,7
34375,Sheldon,13," Y, No. I‰Ûªm as much a part of this relationship as you two, and I think it‰Ûªs high time we put all our cards on the table. For example, where is this going? Are you two ever getting married? And, if so, where will we all live? Have you thought about that?",7
34376,Leonard,13, No.,7
34377,Sheldon,13, Penny?,7
34378,Penny,13," Okay, wait. What are we doing?",7
34379,Leonard,13," For some reason, we‰Ûªre planning a future where we both live with Sheldon forever.",7
34380,Sheldon,13, Good. Now we‰Ûªre getting somewhere.,7
34381,Penny,13," Look, I know you think I‰Ûªm being reckless, and you might be right, but I need to take this shot.",7
34382,Sheldon,13," Yeah, no kidding. Despite what it says on her rÌ©sumÌ©, she is no longer 22. ",7
34383,Leonard,13," I swear, I am on your side. ",7
34384,Penny,13," You keep saying you‰Ûªre on my side, but you don‰Ûªt act like it.",7
34385,Sheldon,13," He does that to me, too. Why do we put up with it?",7
34386,Leonard,13," Listen, I could never do what you‰Ûªre doing, okay? I would be terrified.",7
34387,Penny,13," Well, it‰Ûªs scary for me, too.",7
34388,Sheldon,13, I‰Ûªm fine with it.,7
34389,Leonard,13," My point is, just because I couldn‰Ûªt do it doesn‰Ûªt mean you shouldn‰Ûªt. And I‰Ûªm proud of you. ",7
34390,Penny,13, Okay. Thank you.,7
34391,Sheldon,13," Well, to celebrate this reconciliation, let‰Ûªs all share a milk shake. Uh, Penny, you‰Ûªll need a straw.",7
34392,Scene,13, Capital Comics.,7
34393,Jesse,13, You‰Ûªre back.,7
34394,Bernadette,13," Yes, I am, there‰Ûªs a few more things I want to say to you. Stuart‰Ûªs store is just fine, and he‰Ûªs a much nicer person than you are, and if you still have that comic, I‰Ûªd like to buy it right now.",7
34395,Jesse,13," No problem. Oh, you want a latte while you wait?",7
34396,Bernadette,13," No, I don‰Ûªt want a latte. I want a cappuccino and a blueberry scone. ",7
34397,Jesse,13, I only have chocolate chip.,7
34398,Bernadette,13," Well, that sounds even better.",7
34399,Scene,13, Bert‰Ûªs car.,7
34400,Bert,13, Thanks for coming to the mineral and rock show with me.,7
34401,Raj,13, We‰Ûªre sorry Amy didn‰Ûªt want to go.,7
34402,Howard,13," Really, really sorry.",7
34403,Bert,13, Eh. Who needs her when I have you guys? Rock show! Rock show! Rock show! Rock show! Rock show! Rock show! Rock sho-o-o-o-o-ow!,7
34404,Scene,14, The apartment.,7
34405,Howard,14, T-minus 60 seconds.,7
34406,Raj,14," Oh, it all comes down to this.",7
34407,Leonard,14," Oh, I‰Ûªve got butterflies.",7
34408,Sheldon,14," Don‰Ûªt get soft on me, Hofstadter. I will slap those glasses right off your face.",7
34409,Penny,14, What‰Ûªs going on?,7
34410,Leonard,14, Hey. We‰Ûªre about to buy tickets for Comic-Con.,7
34411,Penny,14, Oh.,7
34412,Howard,14, T Minus 45 seconds.,7
34413,Leonard,14," They sell out incredibly fast, but as long as one of us gets in, we can buy passes‰Û_",7
34414,Sheldon,14," Good Lord, this is not the time for flirting, keep it in your pants.",7
34415,Penny,14, This is a whole lot of weird before coffee.,7
34416,Howard,14, T-minus 30 seconds.,7
34417,Raj,14," Oh, I have to go to the bathroom so bad.",7
34418,Sheldon,14," Every year. I told you, wear a diaper.",7
34419,Raj,14, And I told you I get diaper rash.,7
34420,Howard,14, 15 seconds.,7
34421,Leonard,14," Well, this is it, this is it. This is it.",7
34422,Howard,14," Five, four, three, two, one. ",7
34423,Sheldon,14," It‰Ûªs live. Go, go, go, go, go.",7
34424,Raj,14, Anyone in?,7
34425,Sheldon,14, No.,7
34426,Leonard,14, Not yet. ,7
34427,Howard,14, Nope.,7
34428,Sheldon,14, Do not stop refreshing your screens.,7
34429,All (repeatedly),14, Refresh. Refresh. Refresh‰Û_.,7
34430,Penny,14," Yeah, this is not gonna be enough coffee.",7
34431,Scene,14," The same, shortly after.",7
34432,All (repeatedly),14, Refresh‰Û_ Refresh‰Û_ Refresh‰Û_,7
34433,Howard,14, It‰Ûªs been ten minutes. We‰Ûªre running out of time.,7
34434,Penny,14, To be cool? Yeah.,7
34435,Leonard,14," I did it, I did it, I‰Ûªm in the queue.",7
34436,Sheldon,14, Yay! And they say firefighters are the real heroes.,7
34437,Raj,14," Uh, what number in line are you?",7
34438,Leonard,14," Uh, fifteen‰Û_",7
34439,Howard,14, Great.,7
34440,Leonard,14, ‰Û_thousand two hundred and eleven.,7
34441,Howard,14, Damn.,7
34442,Raj,14," Oh, they only have Thursday and Sunday passes left.",7
34443,Howard,14, Really?,7
34444,Leonard,14," Oh, Thursday‰Ûªs gone. Just Sunday left.",7
34445,Sheldon,14," Oh, Sunday‰Ûªs the worst. Everybody‰Ûªs leaving, most of the good panels are over, and the only T-shirts they have left are small and XXXXL.",7
34446,Leonard,14, Sunday‰Ûªs gone.,7
34447,Sheldon,14," Not Sunday, I love Sunday.",7
34448,Raj,14, So that‰Ûªs it? Everything‰Ûªs sold out?,7
34449,Leonard,14, Yeah.,7
34450,Howard,14, I can‰Ûªt believe we‰Ûªre not going.,7
34451,Sheldon,14," It‰Ûªs okay. You know, there, there‰Ûªs always WonderCon in Anaheim, you know? That, that‰Ûªs just as good. Excuse me.",7
34452,Penny,14," Oh, guys, this is really sad. And in a different way than it was twenty minutes ago.",7
34453,Sheldon,14, I can‰Ûªt believe we wasted all that time on our Hulk costumes.,7
34454,Penny,14, What? You were all going as the Hulk?,7
34455,Howard,14," Not the same Hulk. Ferrigno, Bana, Norton and Ruffalo.",7
34456,Raj,14, We would have been the angry green belles of the masquerade ball.,7
34457,All,14, Yeah. ,7
34458,Penny,14, And we‰Ûªre back to the first kind of sad.,7
34459,Scene,14, The cafeteria.,7
34460,Sheldon,14," Gentlemen, I have the solution to our Comic-Con problem. We don‰Ûªt need them. I‰Ûªm starting my own convention.",7
34461,Leonard,14," Sheldon, just buy scalped tickets with us.",7
34462,Sheldon,14," I told you. Buying scalped tickets is against the rules. If you get caught, you get banned from Comic-Con for life. Life, Leonard. You‰Ûªre gonna feel pretty silly when we‰Ûªre 80 years old, and you have to drive me down there and then wait in the car for three days.",7
34463,Leonard,14, Do what you want. We‰Ûªre getting scalped tickets.,7
34464,Howard,14, I already found a guy online who‰Ûªs willing to sell.,7
34465,Sheldon,14, How do you know this isn‰Ûªt a sting operation set up by the Comic-Con police?,7
34466,Leonard,14, The same way I know that the people in the TV set can‰Ûªt see me.,7
34467,Howard,14," Sheldon, just come with us. You‰Ûªre not gonna make your own convention.",7
34468,Sheldon,14," You know, there was a time when Comic-Con didn‰Ûªt exist at all until one lone dreamer with a unique vision made it happen. And you mark my words, I‰Ûªm gonna rip that guy off.",7
34469,Scene,14, The apartment. ,7
34470,Sheldon (on phone),14," Yes, I‰Ûªm starting my own comic book convention, and I thought that your client, Robert Downey Jr., would be perfect to appear on our first panel. Oh, well, now, why are you saying no? You haven‰Ûªt even asked him yet. You know, excuse me, but I sat through Iron Man 2. I believe he owes me two hours of his time. They hung up on me.",7
34471,Leonard,14," Did you tell them that you‰Ûªre holding your convention at a Marie Callender‰Ûªs, and that every panellist gets a free slice of pie?",7
34472,Sheldon,14, I didn‰Ûªt even get to that part.,7
34473,Leonard,14," Look, even your friend Wil Wheaton thinks this is a waste of time.",7
34474,Sheldon,14," Not true. Wil thinks this is a great idea. He was just concerned that he wasn‰Ûªt a big enough celebrity to headline such an amazing event. Also, that‰Ûªs the same day that he shampoos his beard.",7
34475,Leonard,14," Sheldon, buddy, I just don‰Ûªt think this is going to come together for you.",7
34476,Sheldon,14, You don‰Ûªt know that. I still have plenty of solid leads on this list.,7
34477,Leonard,14, Good luck.,7
34478,Sheldon,14," No, wait. I need you to call Stan Lee, Leonard Nimoy and Bill Nye the Science Guy, ‰Ûªcause, legally, I‰Ûªm not allowed to. Oh, and, also, Carrie Fisher, you know, ‰Ûªcause I hear he can be pretty nuts.",7
34479,Scene,14, Penny‰Ûªs apartment.,7
34480,Penny,14, I can‰Ûªt believe Leonard is spending hundreds of dollars on scalped tickets. ,7
34481,Amy,14," Last week, you spent that on a little dress. ",7
34482,Penny,14," Yeah, but those tickets only get him into Comic-Con. That dress gets me into anywhere I want.",7
34483,Bernadette,14, Those tickets were pretty expensive. I had to give Howie an advance on his allowance. Now he‰Ûªs never gonna put his toys away.,7
34484,Amy,14," Why can‰Ûªt they do something sensible like Sheldon and start their own comic book convention? Also, who wants to throw me out that window?",7
34485,Bernadette,14," Well, while they‰Ûªre acting like teenagers, we could do something grown-up.",7
34486,Amy,14, Oh. You mean like a museum?,7
34487,Penny,14," Yes, like a museum, but anything else.",7
34488,Bernadette,14," Oh, I know. There‰Ûªs a nice hotel not far from here where they do afternoon tea.",7
34489,Amy,14," Ooh, afternoon tea, how sophisticated of us.",7
34490,Penny,14," Oh, all right, if we‰Ûªre gonna be fancy, I should probably put on clean underwear.",7
34491,Bernadette,14," La-dee-da, look who has clean underwear.",7
34492,Penny,14," No, we‰Ûªre gonna stop at Target on the way.",7
34493,Scene,14, The apartment.,7
34494,Raj,14," Hey, since Sheldon‰Ûªs not going to Comic-Con, maybe we could find a cool trio to dress up as.",7
34495,Leonard,14," Mmm, what if we go as The Fantastic Four, and just tell people that the Invisible Girl is standing there with us.",7
34496,Howard,14," Oh, and I thought our days of pretending to be with women who don‰Ûªt exist were over.",7
34497,Sheldon,14," Gentlemen, I am one step away from securing a huge guest for my convention.",7
34498,Leonard,14, Does that step include chloroform and a roll of duct tape?,7
34499,Sheldon,14," I don‰Ûªt think that will be necessary for Mr. James Earl Jones. You heard me. The voice of Darth Vader, the Lion King‰Ûªs dad, and FYI, the guy who says, This is CNN. Which also sounds like Darth Vader.",7
34500,Raj,14, How are you gonna get James Earl Jones?,7
34501,Sheldon,14," Simple. Earlier today, he tweeted that he‰Ûªs looking forward to going to his favourite sushi restaurant for dinner. I googled an interview from four years ago which was conducted in his favourite sushi restaurant. That‰Ûªs where he‰Ûªll be, and that‰Ûªs where I‰Ûªm going, and‰Û_",7
34502,Howard,14, And that‰Ûªs where Darth Vader‰Ûªs gonna pour soy sauce on your head.,7
34503,Leonard,14," Sheldon, I don‰Ûªt care if you get scalped tickets with us or not, but please don‰Ûªt be creepy and go stalking this poor guy. You‰Ûªre gonna get in trouble.",7
34504,Sheldon,14," You‰Ûªre the ones who are going to get in trouble. You‰Ûªre buying non-transferable tickets. And from a stranger, no less. Not only can you get banned from Comic-Con, if caught, you could be charged with petty theft. You think about that while I‰Ûªm warning James Earl Jones about the danger of posting his location on Twitter. He got lucky this time. There are some weirdoes out there. (To the Imperial March theme) Bom, bom, bom, bom, badum, bom, badum. Bom, bom, bom, bom, badum, bom, badum. Bom, bom, badala, baba, badalum, bom, badala, bom, bom, forgot my keys, bom, bom, bom, bom, badum, bom, badum‰Û_ ",7
34505,Scene,14," The same, later.",7
34506,Howard (on phone),14," Okay, great. Bye. Our friendly neighbourhood scalper says he‰Ûªs running late.",7
34507,Raj,14, Does he sound like a criminal?,7
34508,Howard,14, What do you mean?,7
34509,Raj,14," You know, did he say things like, youse guys, or, listen here, see?",7
34510,Leonard,14," Yes. He, he‰Ûªs late because he‰Ûªs on his way here from 1940.",7
34511,Raj,14," I‰Ûªm just saying, we don‰Ûªt know who this guy is. What if he wants to steal our money or our kidneys, or make a suit outof our skins?",7
34512,Howard,14, Why would someone want to make clothes out of your skin?,7
34513,Raj,14, I don‰Ûªt know. Maybe ‰Ûªcause dark doesn‰Ûªt show the stains?,7
34514,Leonard,14," Well, now you‰Ûªre making me wonder if we should have met him at a neutral location.",7
34515,Howard,14, Why do you think I told him to come to your place?,7
34516,Scene,14, Hotel tea room.,7
34517,Amy,14, There sure are a lot of little kids here.,7
34518,Penny,14, I can‰Ûªt believe we thought this would makes us feel grown up.,7
34519,Bernadette,14, I can‰Ûªt believe the waiter thought I was your daughter.,7
34520,Amy,14," Well, last time I got dressed up and had tea was when I was five. Just me, my teddy bear, Raggedy Ann and my hamster. ",7
34521,Bernadette,14, That‰Ûªs cute.,7
34522,Amy,14, It was. Till my hamster ate all her babies. It got less cute really fast.,7
34523,Bernadette,14, Should we leave?,7
34524,Penny,14," Well, there‰Ûªs a bar in the lobby.",7
34525,Bernadette,14, I could go for a drink.,7
34526,Amy,14," Aw. Drinking in the afternoon, just like her mommy.",7
34527,Scene,14, A sushi restaurant.,7
34528,James Earl Jones,14," Let me guess. You like Star Wars. You know, I‰Ûªve been in other movies. But you don‰Ûªt care about those, do you? I have one thing to say to people like you. I like Star Wars, too. Care to join me?",7
34529,Sheldon,14," Thank you. My friend Leonard said if I bothered you while you were eating, you‰Ûªd think I was a creepy stalker.",7
34530,James Earl Jones,14," Well, your friend Leonard sounds like a real weenie.",7
34531,Sheldon,14," He is, Mr. Earl Jones, he is.",7
34532,Scene,14, The apartment.,7
34533,Raj,14," Okay, so, I‰Ûªm on a Comic-Con message board, and there‰Ûªs a post from a guy where he says he got caught using someone else‰Ûªs badge, and Sheldon was right, he did get charged with petty theft. Guys, if I go to jail dressed as the Human Torch, that might send the wrong message.",7
34534,Leonard,14, Maybe this isn‰Ûªt a good idea.,7
34535,Howard,14, I can text the guy and tell him we changed our minds.,7
34536,Raj,14, Do it.,7
34537,Howard,14, Okay. We‰Ûªre officially not going to Comic-Con.,7
34538,Leonard,14, Hold on. We always do this. ,7
34539,Howard,14, Do what?,7
34540,Leonard,14," Chicken out. We‰Ûªre, we‰Ûªre so afraid of getting into trouble that we never do anything wrong.",7
34541,Raj,14, That‰Ûªs ‰Ûªcause we‰Ûªre the good guys.,7
34542,Leonard,14, Even Batman breaks the rules. ,7
34543,Raj,14, You know I struggle with Batman.,7
34544,Leonard,14," I say, this one time, instead of wimping out, let‰Ûªs be badasses.",7
34545,Raj,14," Okay, I‰Ûªll be a badass, but only if you pinky-swear to be one, too.",7
34546,Leonard,14," Howard, you in on this?",7
34547,Howard,14, No need. I‰Ûªm breaking rules all the time. ,7
34548,Leonard,14, Name one.,7
34549,Howard,14, Last night. Drank my Pepto straight out of the bottle.,7
34550,Raj,14, What about that little cup they give you?,7
34551,Howard,14, Yeah. What about it?,7
34552,Raj,14, Are you impressed by that?,7
34553,Leonard,14, A little.,7
34554,Raj,14," Yeah, me, too.",7
34555,Scene,14, The sushi restaurant.,7
34556,James,14," You know, when I first read the script for Empire Strikes Back and Darth Vader told Luke he was his father, I thought for sure he was lying.",7
34557,Sheldon,14," Me, too. But he wasn‰Ûªt, was he?",7
34558,James,14, He was not. How messed up was that?,7
34559,Sheldon,14, So messed up.,7
34560,James,14," What do you say let‰Ûªs go have some fun? My wife‰Ûªs in New York, and I got a Lion King residual cheque burning a hole in my pocket.",7
34561,Scene,14, The hotel bar.,7
34562,Penny,14," So, afternoon tea was a bust.",7
34563,Amy,14," On the bright side, every six-year-old there was jealous of my tiara. Not gonna lie, it felt good.",7
34564,Penny,14," Let me ask you a question, when did you guys start feeling grown up? ‰Û÷Cause I am not sure I do.",7
34565,Bernadette,14," Honestly, I thought when I got married I would, but I still kind of feel like I‰Ûªm pretending. It doesn‰Ûªt help that most of my clothes come from Gap Kids.",7
34566,Penny,14," Okay, so I‰Ûªm an adult, and the other day I saw an old man slip and fall down, and I laughed. I mean, I laughed hard. Like, like, out loud. If he was conscious, he would‰Ûªve heard me.",7
34567,Amy,14, Gosh.,7
34568,Penny,14," I know. One of the tennis balls came off his walker and bounced right off his head. I mean, I, I almost wet myself. I guess you had to be there.",7
34569,Amy,14, I think I have you both beat. Imagine trying to feel like a grown-up when you‰Ûªve never even been with a man.,7
34570,Penny,14," Okay, sex is not what makes you a grown-up.",7
34571,Bernadette,14, Yeah. Or you‰Ûªd be the oldest one here.,7
34572,Penny,14, Really? Is that how you talk to your mother?,7
34573,Scene,14, The apartment.,7
34574,Howard,14, He just parked. He‰Ûªs on his way up.,7
34575,Leonard,14, Good. This is exciting.,7
34576,Raj,14, It is. I feel alive.,7
34577,Leonard,14," Yeah. What if we do get caught, who cares? So we get banned from Comic-Con.",7
34578,Raj,14, Maybe slapped with a fine.,7
34579,Howard,14," Oh, no. I‰Ûªd be an astronaut and a bad boy, how will women keep their pants on?",7
34580,Raj,14," Uh, maybe it‰Ûªll come up when I apply for citizenship. Oh, crap, what if it comes up when I apply for citizenship? ",7
34581,Leonard,14, I wonder if we‰Ûªd have to disclose something like this when we apply for grants.,7
34582,Raj,14," He‰Ûªs gonna be here any second, what should we do?",7
34583,Howard,14," Okay, you guys are such babies. I‰Ûªll handle this. If he thinks we‰Ûªre not home, he‰Ûªll go away.",7
34584,Raj,14, I thought you were a badass.,7
34585,Howard,14," I lied about the Pepto, I always use the little cup.",7
34586,Scene,14, An ice cream parlour.,7
34587,Sheldon,14," Is it true, as a child, you were a stutterer and were functionally mute for eight years?",7
34588,James,14, It is true.,7
34589,Sheldon,14, Oh. Is it true they used scuba gear to create the sound of Darth Vader breathing?,7
34590,James,14, They sure did.,7
34591,Sheldon,14, Oh. Is it true that you were pre-med in college and you almost became a doctor?,7
34592,James,14, That‰Ûªs right.,7
34593,Sheldon,14," Oh, James, I could listen to your stories all night.",7
34594,Scene,14, The hotel bar.,7
34595,Penny,14," I mean, really, what‰Ûªs so great about being grown up?",7
34596,Bernadette,14," Well, for starters, we‰Ûªd be splitting this check three ways.",7
34597,Penny,14," I‰Ûªm serious. Who wants to do all that stuff? Have insurance, pay mortgages, leave one of those little notes when you hit a parked car.",7
34598,Amy,14, I told you it was Penny.,7
34599,Penny,14," Oh, come on, it wasn‰Ûªt me. Anyone could have knocked your mirror off, or whatever happened.",7
34600,Amy,14," Maybe the guys are right. I mean, we spent the whole night trying to be mature, and it was kind of boring. I‰Ûªm sure they‰Ûªre having more fun than we are.",7
34601,Scene,14, The apartment. Banging on door.,7
34602,Howard,14," Oh, God, I could really use exactly two tablespoons of Pepto right now.",7
34603,Scene,14, A big wheel.,7
34604,Sheldon,14," Hey, Los Angeles. I‰Ûªm on a Ferris Wheel with Darth Vader. And he‰Ûªs nicer than you think.",7
34605,James,14, I am.,7
34606,Scene,14, A karaoke bar.,7
34607,Sheldon,14," In the jungle, the mighty jungle, the lion sleeps tonight‰Û_",7
34608,James,14," Ah-wimoweh, ah-wimoweh‰Û_",7
34609,Sheldon,14," Bring it home, Mufasa. Eee, eee, eee, eee, eee, um, um-a-weh.",7
34610,James,14," Ah-wimoweh, ah-wimoweh‰Û_",7
34611,Sceme,14, Outside a house.,7
34612,Sheldon,14, I don‰Ûªt understand what we‰Ûªre doing.,7
34613,James,14, Shh.,7
34614,Sheldon,14, Whose house is this?,7
34615,James,14," Carrie Fisher. And she‰Ûªs a little crazy, so get ready to run. (Rings doorbell)",7
34616,Carrie Fisher,14," It‰Ûªs not funny anymore, James.",7
34617,James,14, Then why am I laughing?,7
34618,Scene,14, A sauna.,7
34619,James,14," Ah, Sheldon, this is the perfect end to a perfect night.",7
34620,Sheldon,14, Okay. But I think it could have ended with the karaoke.,7
34621,James,14, What were you trying to ask me at the strip club?,7
34622,Sheldon,14, Oh. How much does it cost to get them off my lap?,7
34623,James,14, No. Something about a convention.,7
34624,Sheldon,14," Oh, right. Well, my friends and I couldn‰Ûªt get into Comic-Con this year, and I was trying to start my own convention, and I was going to ask if you would be a panelist.",7
34625,James,14, Why don‰Ûªt you and your friends come to Comic-Con with me?,7
34626,Sheldon,14, Really?,7
34627,James,14," Of course. And San Diego is right across the border from my favorite city on Earth, Tijuana, where I‰Ûªm taking you every night. ",7
34628,Sheldon,14, Ay-yi-yi. ,7
34629,James,14," Ay-yi-yi, bang-bang.",7
34630,Scene,14," The same, later.",7
34631,James,14," So, Beau Bridges is on my shoulders, and Jeff Bridges is on Marlon Brando‰Ûªs shoulders, and remember, we do not have permission to be in the pool‰Û_ hey, Sheldon, wake up. And Angie Dickinson is about to sic the dogs on us, and I go under the water and Marlon goes under the water, and the water raises about two feet and sloshes all over her patio, and the dogs freak out and run like hell, and then we run like hell. Oh, boy, that was a lot of fun.",7
34632,Sheldon,14," I‰Ûªm sorry, who‰Ûªs Angie Dickinson?",7
34633,Scene,15, The apartment.,7
34634,Amy,15," Item 28, your pet name for me. Time‰Ûªs running out on this. You need to make a decision.",7
34635,Sheldon,15, I submitted you a notarised list. ,7
34636,Amy,15," I‰Ûªm sorry, but Gollum and Flakey are not acceptable.",7
34637,Sheldon,15," Well, you don‰Ûªt like Princess Corncob, you don‰Ûªt like Fester, you‰Ûªre just impossible to please.",7
34638,Amy,15," We‰Ûªll come back to that one. This brings us to the final item in our annual State of the Relationship Summit. Item 29, Valentine‰Ûªs Day.",7
34639,Sheldon,15," Ah, the worst for last. Hmm. Classic Flakey.",7
34640,Amy,15," Before you get upset, I believe I‰Ûªve come up with a way for us to celebrate the occasion that we both can enjoy.",7
34641,Sheldon,15," People usually start a meeting with a joke, but you go ahead, end with one.",7
34642,Amy,15, I propose we spend a weekend at a bed-and-breakfast in Napa Valley.,7
34643,Sheldon,15," I hate every word in that sentence. Including in, at, we and a.",7
34644,Amy,15," Come on, Sheldon. Why not?",7
34645,Sheldon,15," For starters, a bed-and-breakfast forces you to eat with strangers at your table.",7
34646,Amy,15," One step ahead of you, Bernadette and Wolowitz are going with us.",7
34647,Sheldon,15," Oh, very well. What are the sleeping arrangements? We‰Ûªve only been dating for three years. If we were to share a room, people might talk.",7
34648,Amy,15, I got you your own room. ,7
34649,Sheldon,15, What if my room has a claw-foot bathtub?,7
34650,Amy,15, It doesn‰Ûªt. I know it makes you feel like you‰Ûªre bathing inside a monster.,7
34651,Sheldon,15," Look, I appreciate the effort, but I‰Ûªm still unclear how this trip is supposed to be enjoyable for me.",7
34652,Amy,15, We‰Ûªre going to have Valentine‰Ûªs Day dinner on a fully functioning vintage train.,7
34653,Sheldon,15, Vintage? Be specific.,7
34654,Amy,15, An Alcoa FA-4 diesel locomotive leading a train of meticulously restored 1915 Pullman first-class coaches.,7
34655,Sheldon,15," Wow. I‰Ûªm feeling the urge to hug you. And one, and two, all right, Gollum, we‰Ûªre good.",7
34656,Scene,15, The apartment.,7
34657,Bernadette,15, Are you sure you guys don‰Ûªt want to come with us to Napa? You could probably still get a room.,7
34658,Penny,15," No, I think we‰Ûªre just gonna have a quiet weekend at home.",7
34659,Leonard,15," Plus, I‰Ûªm not sure it‰Ûªs a great idea to take Penny to where wine comes from. What? It‰Ûªs a joke. Oh, come on. We bust on each other. I wear dorky glasses, you might have a problem, it‰Ûªs all for laughs.",7
34660,Penny,15, That would really piss me off if I didn‰Ûªt have a buzz going on.,7
34661,Sheldon,15," Howard, which pocket watch will you be wearing for dinner on the train?",7
34662,Howard,15," I‰Ûªm sorry, what?",7
34663,Sheldon,15," Oh, I‰Ûªm afraid if we wear the same pocket watch, it will be embarrassing.",7
34664,Howard,15, I don‰Ûªt own a pocket watch.,7
34665,Sheldon,15," Oh, my. Well, then my apologies for bringing up this sore spot.",7
34666,Raj,15," Since you two are gonna be around for Valentine‰Ûªs, would you mind watching Cinnamon?",7
34667,Penny,15," You have Valentine‰Ûªs plans? Which came out sounding way more surprised than I meant. Here, let me try that again. You have Valent‰Û_ See? I can‰Ûªt do it.",7
34668,Raj,15, I don‰Ûªt have plans which is why I booked time on the big telescope that night.,7
34669,Amy,15," Well, an evening looking at the stars, that‰Ûªs still kind of romantic.",7
34670,Raj,15, Except I‰Ûªll be alone.,7
34671,Amy,15, I‰Ûªm trying to put lipstick on a pig here. Work with me.,7
34672,Leonard,15, We‰Ûªd be happy to watch Cinnamon.,7
34673,Penny,15, Yeah.,7
34674,Raj,15," Thank you. Oh, and I‰Ûªd like for at least one of us to see some action, so if you guys happen to have sex, it‰Ûªs cool if she stays in the room.",7
34675,Penny,15," Hey, same goes for the two of you with Amy.",7
34676,Scene,15, The Pullman dining car.,7
34677,Amy,15," What do you think, Sheldon?",7
34678,Sheldon,15, It‰Ûªs magnificent. This is going to be the best Valentine‰Ûªs Day ever.,7
34679,Amy,15, I‰Ûªm so glad you like it.,7
34680,Sheldon,15," I‰Ûªm prepared to say I love it, as soon as I confirm there are no hobos aboard.",7
34681,Scene,15, The apartment. ,7
34682,Leonard (on phone),15," Okay. Raj, I got it. Bye. (To Cinnamon) That was your daddy. He wanted me to say that he misses‰Û_ Why am I doing this?",7
34683,Penny,15, Happy Valentine‰Ûªs Day.,7
34684,Leonard,15," Ooh, flowers and chocolates? Somebody‰Ûªs trying to get me out of my panties.",7
34685,Penny,15, Don‰Ûªt be surprised if you find five chocolates missing and three gross coconut ones with a bite taken out. It came that way when I bought it.,7
34686,Leonard,15," Got you a little something, too.",7
34687,Penny,15," Aw, jewellery. Oh, my God, Lakers tickets?",7
34688,Leonard,15," It gets better. Instead of me, you can take someone who will actually enjoy it.",7
34689,Penny,15, Aw. You are the best boyfriend ever.,7
34690,Leonard,15," Thank you. Seriously, please don‰Ûªt make me go.",7
34691,Penny,15, Should we take this little party to the bedroom?,7
34692,Leonard,15," Mm, don‰Ûªt have to, we have the whole place to ourselves.",7
34693,Penny,15," Oh, that‰Ûªs true. ",7
34694,Leonard,15," In fact, if you want, we can do it right here on Sheldon‰Ûªs spot.",7
34695,Penny,15, That is the least sexy thing anyone‰Ûªs ever said to me.,7
34696,Leonard,15, To the bedroom.,7
34697,Penny,15, Yeah.,7
34698,Scene,15, The dining car.,7
34699,Waiter,15," And for the entrÌ©e, tonight‰Ûªs special is a seafood risotto. Do you have any questions?",7
34700,Sheldon,15," Uh, I do. Uh, does this train car have the original link-and-pin coupler or the Miller Hook and Platform?",7
34701,Waiter,15," I‰Ûªm sorry, I meant questions about the food.",7
34702,Sheldon,15," Oh, of course. Um, is the seafood risotto being served on a train car with the original link-and-pin coupler or the Miller Hook and Platform?",7
34703,Amy,15," Uh, I think we‰Ûªre gonna need a minute.",7
34704,Man in seat behind,15," Fun fact, it‰Ûªs neither. They actually use the AAR type E coupler. If you listen carefully when the locomotive disconnects, you‰Ûªll hear the characteristic click-pshht-thunk of the knuckle.",7
34705,Sheldon,15, Get out of town.,7
34706,Howard,15," Fun fact, I‰Ûªm gonna jump off this train.",7
34707,Scene,15, The apartment.,7
34708,Leonard,15," Hey, Cinnamon, guess who just did it human style.",7
34709,Penny,15," Oh, my God.",7
34710,Leonard,15," It‰Ûªs a little late, but I‰Ûªll take it.",7
34711,Penny,15," No, Cinnamon ate the chocolates. That‰Ûªs really bad for dogs.",7
34712,Leonard,15," Oh, crap. What are we gonna do?",7
34713,Penny,15, We gotta get her to a vet right now.,7
34714,Leonard,15," I don‰Ûªt have a vet. I have a podiatrist, an optometrist, an allergist, a dermatologist, a urologist. You‰Ûªd think I‰Ûªd have a vet.",7
34715,Penny,15, Okay. There‰Ûªs one not far from here. Come on. Let‰Ûªs go.,7
34716,Leonard,15, Okay. Koothrappali was right. We should have let her watch.,7
34717,Scene,15, The dining car.,7
34718,Sheldon,15," Do another one, do another one.",7
34719,Man,15, Okay. Here‰Ûªs my impression of the Amtrak Acela barreling down the Eastern Corridor. Wch-wch-wch-wch-shhhh. Wch-wch-wch-wch-shhhh. Wch-wch-wch-wch-shhhh. ,7
34720,Man,15, I‰Ûªve been on that train. And I just was again.,7
34721,Amy,15, See if you guys can guess this one. Bang. Splat. Thud.,7
34722,Sheldon,15, How many trains have you been on?,7
34723,Man,15, Tons. A box fell on my head at UPS six years ago. Now I just collect disability and ride trains.,7
34724,Sheldon,15, Wow. Your life‰Ûªs amazing.,7
34725,Man,15, Not always. A box fell on my head at UPS six years ago. Now I just collect disability and ride trains.,7
34726,Amy,15, Why do I even try?,7
34727,Bernadette,15, I‰Ûªm gonna fix this right now.,7
34728,Howard,15, Okay. Just make it look like an accident.,7
34729,Bernadette,15, Excuse me. You are at Valentine‰Ûªs dinner with your girlfriend. Now get back over there and be with her.,7
34730,Sheldon,15, You‰Ûªre right. That was insensitive of me. I have to go back to my table now. You should join us.,7
34731,Man,15, All right.,7
34732,Bernadette,15, Great. Now there‰Ûªs two of ‰Ûªem.,7
34733,Scene,15, A vet‰Ûªs surgery.,7
34734,Lady Vet,15, How much chocolate did she eat?,7
34735,Penny,15, A whole box.,7
34736,Leonard,15," Well, to be fair, you ate a lot of it before you gave it to me. ",7
34737,Penny,15, So the point is I may have saved her life.,7
34738,Vet,15," I‰Ûªm sorry, is this a joke to you?",7
34739,Leonard,15, No. Maybe to her.,7
34740,Vet,15, How big a box of chocolate was it?,7
34741,Penny,15," Uh, something like this. I don‰Ûªt know. It came free with a full tank of gas.",7
34742,Leonard,15, Really? Do you know how much those Lakers tickets were?,7
34743,Penny,15, Do you know how much gas is?,7
34744,Vet,15, Hey.,7
34745,Penny,15, Sorry.,7
34746,Leonard,15, Sorry.,7
34747,Raj,15," Oh, my God, Cinnamon, are you okay? I can‰Ûªt believe you two. You do whatever it takes to save her life. If she needs new organs, I‰Ûªll buy any dog necessary and scrap them for parts.",7
34748,Vet,15, You‰Ûªre the owner?,7
34749,Raj,15," Owner, father, soul mate, and if anything happens to her, your worst nightmare.",7
34750,Vet,15," Well, she‰Ûªs not throwing up, which is a good sign. So, I‰Ûªm gonna take her in back, put her on fluids and give her something to absorb the toxins. ",7
34751,Raj,15," Okay. Okay, thank you. Oh, if she‰Ûªs scared, you can sing to her. She likes Katy Perry. Oh, but don‰Ûªt do Firework, that gets her all riled up.",7
34752,Vet,15, Got it. Should have been a dentist.,7
34753,Scene,15, The dining car.,7
34754,Man,15," Okay, what was the best four-ten-four U.S. Locomotive ever built?",7
34755,Sheldon,15, Trick question. There never was one.,7
34756,Man,15, Or was there? ,7
34757,Sheldon,15, What?,7
34758,Man,15," In 1944, the Pacific Railroad built number 6131, which rearranged the drivers and cylinders, solving the problem of the Q-1, creating a duplex-drive four-four-six-four.",7
34759,Sheldon,15, In what world is a four-four-six-four a four-ten-four? ,7
34760,Howard,15," A world I don‰Ûªt want to live in. Seriously, I no longer want to live in this world.",7
34761,Man,15," Hold on to your conductor‰Ûªs hat. You crank the second and third axles, creating a pair of internal connecting rods, and boom, four-ten-four. If you think about it, the Q-2 was like the four-ten-four America never made.",7
34762,Sheldon,15," I may never stop thinking about it. Amy, what are the odds we run into this guy?",7
34763,Waiter,15, Better than you think.,7
34764,Man,15," You know, if you ask nicely, they‰Ûªll let you visit the engine room.",7
34765,Sheldon,15, I never want this day to end.,7
34766,Amy,15, It‰Ûªs feeling like it never will.,7
34767,Sheldon,15, Come on.,7
34768,Man,15," Hey, did I tell you what happened to me at UPS?",7
34769,Scene,15, The vets surgery.,7
34770,Raj,15," As if Valentine‰Ûªs Day wasn‰Ûªt bad enough, you try to kill my dog? And with cheap chocolate, no less?",7
34771,Penny,15, It wasn‰Ûªt cheap. It was free.,7
34772,Leonard,15, We‰Ûªre really sorry. It was an accident.,7
34773,Penny,15," Yeah, we weren‰Ûªt even out of the room that long.",7
34774,Leonard,15," Oh, no, come on. It was a while. It was a while.",7
34775,Raj,15," Oh, is Cinnamon gonna be okay?",7
34776,Vet,15, She‰Ûªs responding well. We just want to keep her a little longer for observation.,7
34777,Raj,15," All right. Uh, would, would it be okay for me to see her? We‰Ûªre usually in bed by now, and I want her to know that I‰Ûªm here. Yes, we sleep together, and sometimes we spoon.",7
34778,Vet,15," It‰Ûªs okay. I sleep with my dog, too. We‰Ûªre not supposed to let people in back, but I think I can make an exception.",7
34779,Raj,15, Thank you.,7
34780,Vet,15," Come on. By the way, I sang her Katy Perry.",7
34781,Raj,15," Oh, yeah?",7
34782,Vet,15, And I don‰Ûªt care what that obnoxious parrot back there says. I crushed it.,7
34783,Penny,15, I think there‰Ûªs something going on between the two of them.,7
34784,Leonard,15," Maybe, but you also think nine minutes isn‰Ûªt a while, so what do you know?",7
34785,Scene,15, The dining car.,7
34786,Howard,15, You okay?,7
34787,Amy,15, Why? Because my boyfriend‰Ûªs off playing choo-choo with some weirdo?,7
34788,Howard,15," Well, to be fair, they‰Ûªre both weirdos.",7
34789,Amy,15, I don‰Ûªt know what made me think tonight would be any different.,7
34790,Bernadette,15," Well, just the fact that you got him up here still says a lot. To be honest, I bet Howie 200",7
34791,Howard,15, I‰Ûªm going to the Lego store to get a big-ass R2-D2.,7
34792,Bernadette,15, See? It‰Ûªs not just Sheldon. They‰Ûªre all idiots.,7
34793,Howard,15, She‰Ûªs right. ,7
34794,Bernadette,15," So, your boyfriend‰Ûªs a fixer-upper. Most of them are. I mean, look at this guy. You think he came like this? When I met him, he was a hot, goofy mess. Now, he‰Ûªs been to space. That‰Ûªs all me.",7
34795,Howard,15, I had a little to do with it.,7
34796,Bernadette,15," Oh, sure you did. Who‰Ûªs Mama‰Ûªs big space man?",7
34797,Howard,15, I am.,7
34798,Scene,15, The vets surgery.,7
34799,Leonard,15," They‰Ûªve been in there, like, half an hour.",7
34800,Penny,15," Yeah, for future reference, that‰Ûªs a while.",7
34801,Leonard,15, How long should we stay?,7
34802,Penny,15, I don‰Ûªt know. I‰Ûªm kind of hungry.,7
34803,Leonard,15, I saw a Thai place next door.,7
34804,Penny,15, Oh. Okay. Oh. Oh. Hey.,7
34805,Leonard,15, How‰Ûªs she doing?,7
34806,Penny,15, How is everything?,7
34807,Leonard,15, Yeah.,7
34808,Raj,15, She‰Ûªs gonna be okay; they‰Ûªre gonna let me take her home.,7
34809,Penny,15," Oh, good.",7
34810,Vet,15," So I want you to keep a close eye on her for the next 24 hours. Here are a few warning signs to look out for, and if you see any of them, don‰Ûªt hesitate to call.",7
34811,Raj,15, Oh. Thank you for taking such good care of my little girl.,7
34812,Vet,15, My pleasure. Have a nice night.,7
34813,Leonard,15," Yes, thank you for all your help.",7
34814,Penny,15, Yeah. I‰Ûªm sorry if you didn‰Ûªt think we were taking it seriously. We love animals.,7
34815,Vet,15," Oh, do you guys own any pets?",7
34816,Penny,15, No.,7
34817,Vet,15, Good.,7
34818,Scene,15, The dining car.,7
34819,Howard,15, I love you so much.,7
34820,Bernadette,15," I love you, too.",7
34821,Howard,15, Sorry.,7
34822,Bernadette,15, Sorry.,7
34823,Man,15, You guys missed a pretty great time. ,7
34824,Sheldon,15, The conductor and I have the same pocket watch. ,7
34825,Man,15, It was crazy. ,7
34826,Sheldon,15," Dare I say loco? Oh, and, Amy, guess what? The conductor said as soon as he gets off work, he can come back to the bed and breakfast and play his banjo for us.",7
34827,Amy,15," Okay. I need to speak to my boyfriend in private, like, right now.",7
34828,Howard,15, There‰Ûªs a car with a glass roof. Want to go look at the stars?,7
34829,Bernadette,15," Oh, that sounds so romantic.",7
34830,Amy,15," Oh, give it a rest.",7
34831,Bernadette,15, Let‰Ûªs go.,7
34832,Amy,15, Why are you still here?,7
34833,Sheldon,15, Excuse me. I think you‰Ûªre being a little rude.,7
34834,Amy,15, I‰Ûªm being rude? You‰Ûªve been rude to me this entire evening.,7
34835,Sheldon,15, How is that possible? I‰Ûªve hardly spoken to you since we got on the train.,7
34836,Man,15," I‰Ûªm detecting a little friction between you two, and I don‰Ûªt want to be a third rail. Get it?",7
34837,Sheldon,15, I get it.,7
34838,Amy,15, Leave.,7
34839,Sheldon,15, What is your problem?,7
34840,Amy,15, It‰Ûªs Valentine‰Ûªs Day. We‰Ûªre supposed to be having a romantic weekend.,7
34841,Sheldon,15," Oh, really? Because I remember you saying that this trip was going to be something we could both enjoy. Did you mean that, or were you just trying to trick me?",7
34842,Amy,15," Fine, it‰Ûªs true. I deserve romance, and I didn‰Ûªt know how else to make it happen.",7
34843,Sheldon,15," Well, if you want romance, then let‰Ûªs have romance. Oh, look, there‰Ûªs wine. Mmm. Grape juice that burns. Uh, now let‰Ûªs gaze into each other‰Ûªs eyes, hmm? You blinked. I win.",7
34844,Amy,15, Sheldon.,7
34845,Sheldon,15," Let‰Ûªs see. What‰Ûªs next? Oh, kissing‰Ûªs romantic.",7
34846,Amy,15, That was nice.,7
34847,Sheldon,15," Good. Um, the conductor said if I come back to the engine room, he‰Ûªd show me how to bring the train through a crossing.",7
34848,Amy,15," Okay, have fun.",7
34849,Sheldon,15, Do you want to come with me?,7
34850,Amy,15, Really? I do.,7
34851,Man,15," Hey, guys, wait up.",7
34852,Scene,15, Raj‰Ûªs apartment.,7
34853,Raj,15," There you go. All cozy wozy. Here, let‰Ûªs see what the doctor says to keep an eye out for. Hmm. Rajesh, I was dreading Valentine‰Ûªs Day. Thank you for spending it with me. Yvette. Cinnamon, she-she gave me her phone number. If I‰Ûªd known it was that easy, I would have considered poisoning you months ago. Oh, what should I say? Oh, I know. I‰Ûªll point out her name‰Ûªs Yvette, and that she‰Ûªs a vet. That‰Ûªs hysterical. She‰Ûªll love it.",7
34854,Scene,15, The apartment.,7
34855,Sheldon,15, Hello.,7
34856,Leonard,15," Oh, hey. You‰Ûªre back. How was your trip?",7
34857,Sheldon,15, It was wonderful. ,7
34858,Leonard,15, Great. What did you do?,7
34859,Sheldon,15," I made a new friend who likes trains as much as I do, uh, I kissed Amy on the lips, and, uh, the conductor played his banjo for me. Good night.",7
34860,Leonard,15," Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. I‰Ûªm gonna need more details.",7
34861,Sheldon,15," Oh, well, my new friend‰Ûªs name was Eric. Um, Amy lips tasted like the brownie we had for dessert. Oh, and the banjo-playing conductor was missing a finger, but he made up for it with his can-do attitude.",7
34862,Leonard,15," No, hang on. Hang on. Are all those things equal to you?",7
34863,Sheldon,15, Hmm. It never occurred to me to pick a favourite.,7
34864,Leonard,15," Well, give it a go.",7
34865,Sheldon,15, I can‰Ûªt answer that without collecting additional data.,7
34866,Leonard,15, Additional data. You dog.,7
34867,Sheldon,15," I‰Ûªm not sure how listening to other nine-fingered banjo players makes me dog, but all right.",7
34868,Scene,16, The apartment,7
34869,Howard,16, I‰Ûªm thinking about growing a goatee.,7
34870,Raj,16," Oh, actually that‰Ûªs a Van Dyke. A goatee is just hair on the chin.",7
34871,Leonard,16," Oh. Wait, then what is it if you just have hair up here?",7
34872,Raj,16, You mean a moo-stache?,7
34873,Leonard,16, Moo-stache.,7
34874,Howard,16, He said it.,7
34875,Raj,16," Ha-ha, very funny. Make fun of the foreign guy. For your information, there are four times as many Indians as there are Americans, so the way we say it is right.",7
34876,Howard,16, Say what?,7
34877,Raj,16, Moo-stache.,7
34878,Leonard,16, Moo-stache.,7
34879,Howard,16, He said it.,7
34880,Bernadette,16," Guys, you‰Ûªre being childish.",7
34881,Sheldon,16," Yeah, she‰Ûªs right. You‰Ûªre grown men, the kind who are perfectly capable of growing your own moo-staches.",7
34882,Amy,16," Hey, you were funny on purpose, good job.",7
34883,Penny,16," Hi. Sorry I‰Ûªm late, I was at an audition.",7
34884,Leonard,16," Oh, I‰Ûªm sorry.",7
34885,Sheldon,16, You‰Ûªll get ‰Ûªem next time.,7
34886,Penny,16," How about instead of assuming I failed, you ask me how it went?",7
34887,Leonard,16, Sorry. How did it go?,7
34888,Penny,16, Just shut up.,7
34889,Raj,16," Here, you can have your seat.",7
34890,Penny,16," No, no, no, stay there. I‰Ûªm fine on the floor.",7
34891,Bernadette,16, Have you guys ever thought about getting a dining room table?,7
34892,Amy,16, Yeah. You actually do have room for one up there.,7
34893,Raj,16," Oh, sure, I sit on the floor for years, no one cares. The pretty white girl‰Ûªs there ten seconds, and suddenly we‰Ûªre all running to IKEA.",7
34894,Sheldon,16, No one is running anywhere. We‰Ûªre not getting a dining room table.,7
34895,Leonard,16," I know you don‰Ûªt like change, but it‰Ûªs not a terrible idea.",7
34896,Penny,16," Yeah, you guys never use that space up there. Why not get a table?",7
34897,Sheldon,16, Do you want the long answer or the short answer?,7
34898,Howard,16," Hey, how come we never get that option?",7
34899,Sheldon,16," Chaos theory suggests that even in a deterministic system, if the equations describing its behaviour are non-linear, a tiny change in the initial conditions can lead to a cataclysmic and unpredictable result.",7
34900,Penny,16, Translation?,7
34901,Leonard,16, Waah. I don‰Ûªt want a table.,7
34902,Scene,16, The apartment.,7
34903,Leonard,16," Hey, Penny and I are gonna go shop for a dining room table. You want to come with us?",7
34904,Sheldon,16," You know, I‰Ûªd love to, but, um, I‰Ûªm too busy falling back in love with Windows 98.",7
34905,Leonard,16," Seriously? You haven‰Ûªt used this desk in years. The second I want to get rid of it, you‰Ûªre up here working?",7
34906,Sheldon,16," I can‰Ûªt talk right now, I have several thousand updates to install.",7
34907,Leonard,16, Are you really gonna sit here all day?,7
34908,Sheldon,16," Think of me as Arthur Dent in Hitchhiker‰Ûªs Guide to the Galaxy, lying in front of the bulldozers to protect his home.",7
34909,Leonard,16," If you‰Ûªll recall, the Vogon fleet blew up the Earth anyway.",7
34910,Sheldon,16," It‰Ûªs a made-up story, Leonard, I don‰Ûªt even know why you‰Ûªre talking about it.",7
34911,Leonard,16, I‰Ûªm putting all this stuff in storage. We don‰Ûªt need any of it.,7
34912,Sheldon,16," You, how can you say that? You show me one thing in here we can live without.",7
34913,Leonard,16," Oh, hang on. Check your in-box.",7
34914,Sheldon,16, Wait. Is this really worth it? We‰Ûªve lived together for years with nary an argument.,7
34915,Leonard,16, Huh?,7
34916,Sheldon,16," But we start talking about a table, and suddenly we‰Ûªre at each other‰Ûªs throats.",7
34917,Leonard,16, Nary an argument? Nary?,7
34918,Sheldon,16," Well, that means not one, or not any. Maybe instead of a table, you should buy a dictionary. Well, I don‰Ûªt know if I won that, but at least he‰Ûªs upset.",7
34919,Scene,16, Howard and Bernadette‰Ûªs apartment.,7
34920,Howard,16, Check it out.,7
34921,Raj,16, Magic wand TV remote?,7
34922,Howard,16," Yeah, I can control all sorts of stuff.",7
34923,Raj,16, Did Bernadette think it was cool?,7
34924,Howard,16, Not when I said mute and pointed it at her face.,7
34925,Raj,16," Oh, uh, let me try. Uh, channelis changeroni. This might be my second favorite brown magic wand.",7
34926,Raj,16," Uh, off. And on. And the Oprah Network. This is so much better than watching TV like a muggle.",7
34927,Howard,16, Okay. Thank you. We‰Ûªll be in touch. You‰Ûªre not gonna believe this.,7
34928,Raj,16, What‰Ûªs going on? Oh. Wait. On. And off. What‰Ûªs going on?,7
34929,Howard,16, That was NASA. They want me to go back up to the space station.,7
34930,Raj,16, Wow. What did you tell them?,7
34931,Howard,16, I told them I‰Ûªd be honoured.,7
34932,Raj,16," A second trip to space, I‰Ûªll miss you.",7
34933,Howard,16," And I‰Ûªm gonna miss you, too.",7
34934,Raj,16," And I just want you to know, I‰Ûªm happy to look in on Bernadette while you‰Ûªre gone.",7
34935,Howard,16, Thank you.,7
34936,Raj,16," And if anything were to happen to you, we will name our first born son Howard. I‰Ûªm just kidding. We‰Ûªll name him Dalib, after my grandfather.",7
34937,Scene,16, A furniture store.,7
34938,Penny,16," Ooh, this one looks nice.",7
34939,Leonard,16, No. Sheldon doesn‰Ûªt like reclaimed wood.,7
34940,Penny,16, Why not?,7
34941,Leonard,16, He‰Ûªs afraid the original owners will come back.,7
34942,Penny,16," Yeah. Well, Sheldon‰Ûªs not here.",7
34943,Leonard,16," Well, he is here. So unless you want to dig him out with a bone saw and a melon baller, there‰Ûªs nothing I can do about it.",7
34944,Penny,16," All right, sweetie, you‰Ûªre paying for this table, and it‰Ûªs your apartment, too.",7
34945,Leonard,16," I know, but‰Û_",7
34946,Penny,16, No buts. You got to stop letting him boss you around.,7
34947,Leonard,16," You‰Ûªre right. I mean, he decides what TV shows we watch, what food we eat, who my favourite hobbit is. I wanted Frodo, but we can‰Ûªt both have Frodo, so guess who‰Ûªs stuck with Samwise Gamgee.",7
34948,Penny,16," See? Right there. You‰Ûªre a grown man, you should be able to pick whichever hobbit you want. Wish you wouldn‰Ûªt, but one problem at a time.",7
34949,Leonard,16," You make a lot of sense. I like this table, and I‰Ûªm getting it.",7
34950,Penny,16, Really? This one?,7
34951,Leonard,16, That one? Damn right I like that one.,7
34952,Scene,16, Howard and Bernadette‰Ûªs apartment.,7
34953,Bernadette,16, Hey.,7
34954,Howard,16, Good news. Someone in this room gets to take a ride on a rocket.,7
34955,Bernadette,16, Fine. Can I at least shower first?,7
34956,Howard,16," No, not that. Although you already agreed to it, so no take-backs.",7
34957,Bernadette,16, What are you talking about?,7
34958,Howard,16," Sit down. NASA called. The telescope mount I installed on the space station got damaged, and they want me to go back up and fix it.",7
34959,Bernadette,16," Wow. Well, what did you say?",7
34960,Howard,16, What do you think I said? I said yes. Why do you look surprised?,7
34961,Bernadette,16," Well, it‰Ûªs just, after last time, I didn‰Ûªt think you‰Ûªd ever want to go back.",7
34962,Howard,16, Are you kidding? It was the greatest experience of my life.,7
34963,Bernadette,16, Really? ‰Û÷Cause I kind of remember a lot of complaining and wishing for it to be over.,7
34964,Howard,16, I think you have me confused with what‰Ûªs gonna happen when you get out of that shower.,7
34965,Scene,16, The apartment.,7
34966,Leonard,16," Hey, all set. What do you think? There‰Ûªs plenty of room for everybody, a view out the window.",7
34967,Sheldon,16, My spot on the couch has a great view of a window. Sometimes I can see space battles through it. It‰Ûªs called a TV.,7
34968,Penny,16," Give it a chance, Sheldon, you might actually like it.",7
34969,Sheldon,16, You‰Ûªre absolutely right. Nope.,7
34970,Penny,16," Well, you can‰Ûªt say he didn‰Ûªt give it a fair shot.",7
34971,Sheldon,16," So, when can we get rid of it?",7
34972,Leonard,16, We‰Ûªre not.,7
34973,Sheldon,16," What about the roommate agreement? It specifically states that any changes in furnishing have to be approved by the Furnishing Committee. Which only sits on alternate years. Yeah, and by the way, it sits over there.",7
34974,Penny,16," Come on, that is ridiculous.",7
34975,Leonard,16," She‰Ûªs right, a committee that important should meet more often.",7
34976,Penny,16, That‰Ûªs not what I‰Ûªm saying.,7
34977,Leonard,16, Oh. This is the thing about me standing up to him and not letting him run my life?,7
34978,Penny,16, Yes.,7
34979,Leonard,16, That.,7
34980,Sheldon,16, Okay. I think we‰Ûªve found the problem here. It‰Ûªs not the table at all. It‰Ûªs you.,7
34981,Penny,16, Me?,7
34982,Leonard,16," Well, it‰Ûªs always me, take one for the team.",7
34983,Sheldon,16," I have spent years turning this lump of clay into an acceptable conduit for my will, and then you came along and reshaped him, with your newfangled ideas and your fancy genitals.",7
34984,Penny,16, Are you gonna let him talk to me like this?,7
34985,Leonard,16, Fancy sounds like a compliment.,7
34986,Penny,16," Okay, I have not tried to change Leonard. That‰Ûªs just what happens in relationships. Look how much Amy‰Ûªs changed you.",7
34987,Sheldon,16, That‰Ûªs not true.,7
34988,Penny,16," Oh, please. When I first met you, you were incapable of touching another human being. Now you‰Ûªre holding hands, you‰Ûªre going on dates, you even made out with her on a train.",7
34989,Sheldon,16, She told you?,7
34990,Penny,16," Of course she told me, it‰Ûªs the most interesting thing that‰Ûªs ever happened to her in her entire life.",7
34991,Leonard,16," You‰Ûªre too close to it, but Amy has had a huge impact on you.",7
34992,Sheldon,16," You‰Ûªre right. Without realizing it, I‰Ûªve allowed that woman to alter my personality.",7
34993,Leonard,16," Mm, Sheldon, you didn‰Ûªt have a personality, you just had some shows you liked.",7
34994,Sheldon,16," No. No, I‰Ûªve changed. Like the frog who‰Ûªs put in a pot of water that‰Ûªs heated so gradually he doesn‰Ûªt realize he‰Ûªs boiling to death.",7
34995,Penny,16, Or you‰Ûªre the frog who‰Ûªs been kissed by a princess and turned into a prince.,7
34996,Leonard,16," Or you‰Ûªre just a tall, annoying frog.",7
34997,Sheldon,16, Excuse me. I have to break up with my girlfriend.,7
34998,Penny,16," Oh, Sheldon, wait.",7
34999,Sheldon,16," No. You‰Ûªve opened my eyes to the truth. Amy has made me a more affectionate, open-minded person. And that stops now.",7
35000,Leonard,16," Well, we should call her.",7
35001,Penny,16," Yeah, mm-hmm. Amy, it‰Ûªs Penny. Hey. Just a little heads-up. Leonard bought a dining room table. Yeah. Sheldon‰Ûªs breaking up with you.",7
35002,Scene,16, Amy‰Ûªs apartment.,7
35003,Sheldon,16," (Knock, knock, knock) Amy? (Knock, knock, knock) Amy? (Knock, knock, knock) Amy? I‰Ûªll get right to the point. I think we need to end this relationship, so just sign this with your finger, and, uh, please don‰Ûªt cry on my iPad, I didn‰Ûªt get AppleCare.",7
35004,Amy,16," I‰Ûªm not surprised you want to end the relationship. I‰Ûªm a little surprised you didn‰Ûªt get AppleCare. Anyway, enjoy your life. Where do I sign?",7
35005,Sheldon,16," At the bottom. I must say, I‰Ûªm relieved you‰Ûªre not making more of a scene out of this.",7
35006,Amy,16," Oh, I‰Ûªve already moved on. Besides, this breakup has nothing to do with me.",7
35007,Sheldon,16, It doesn‰Ûªt?,7
35008,Amy,16, Of course not. This is just Leonard trying to take the focus off that dreadful table by sowing discord in our relationship. He‰Ûªs manipulating you like he always does.,7
35009,Sheldon,16," Wait, wait, now, hang on. You think he manipulates me?",7
35010,Amy,16," All the time. And he knew that, as your girlfriend, I wasn‰Ûªt gonna stand by and let him bring a table into your apartment. I mean, a table? Come on?",7
35011,Sheldon,16, It is hideous.,7
35012,Amy,16," Well, thankfully, I won‰Ûªt have to see it, ‰Ûªcause I won‰Ûªt be your girlfriend anymore. Amy Farrah Fowler. Why, yes, I would like to take a survey.",7
35013,Sheldon,16, Wait. You were really gonna stand by me against the dining room table?,7
35014,Amy,16, Of course I was.,7
35015,Sheldon,16, Wait. How do I know that you‰Ûªre not manipulating me right now?,7
35016,Amy,16," I think if I were manipulating you, you‰Ûªd be smart enough to see it.",7
35017,Sheldon,16, How do I know you‰Ûªre not saying that as part of the manipulation?,7
35018,Amy,16," I think you‰Ûªd be smart enough to see that, too.",7
35019,Sheldon,16," Okay. I‰Ûªm sorry I gave you such a hard time, I just had to be sure.",7
35020,Scene,16, Howard and Bernadette‰Ûªs apartment.,7
35021,Raj,16, It‰Ûªs pretty exciting that NASA wants to send Howard back up.,7
35022,Bermadette,16," Yeah, exciting. Can I ask you something?",7
35023,Raj,16, Course.,7
35024,Bernadette,16, He hated that entire experience. Does it make me an awful wife if I don‰Ûªt think he should do it again?,7
35025,Raj,16, Not at all. He‰Ûªs forgotten how miserable he was the entire time he was up there. It‰Ûªs like me in those moments when I miss India.,7
35026,Bernadette,16, So you‰Ûªll talk to him?,7
35027,Raj,16, Why me?,7
35028,Bernadette,16," Well, I‰Ûªm his wife, I don‰Ûªt want to ruin it for him.",7
35029,Raj,16," That‰Ûªs the dynamic, I‰Ûªm the fun one, you‰Ûªre the buzzkill.",7
35030,Bernadette,16, Since when am I the buzzkill?,7
35031,Raj,16, Do you think this is cool?,7
35032,Bernadette,16," No, I think it‰Ûªs stupid.",7
35033,Raj,16, Aha.,7
35034,Bernadette,16," You‰Ûªre right, it‰Ûªs great.",7
35035,Scene,16, The apartment.,7
35036,Sheldon,16, Hello.,7
35037,Leonard,16," Oh, hey. You guys didn‰Ûªt break up.",7
35038,Sheldon,16," No. Sorry to disappoint you, but Amy pointed out that you were only trying to manipulate me.",7
35039,Amy,16, Which you also figured out by yourself.,7
35040,Sheldon,16, Which I also figured out by myself.,7
35041,Penny,16," Well, I‰Ûªm glad you‰Ûªre still together.",7
35042,Sheldon,16," Yeah, okay, you can stop trying to make this about our relationship.",7
35043,Amy,16, Which is stronger than ever.,7
35044,Sheldon,16," Which is stronger than ever. This is about you trying to change my environment, which was perfect the way it was.",7
35045,Howard,16," But it got the way it was through change. The-the-the spot that you love to sit in, that no one else can sit in, only exists because, despite your objections. I bought this couch. Me. So explain why that change was bad and this change was good.",7
35046,Sheldon,16, Um.,7
35047,Amy,16, You don‰Ûªt need to explain yourself to him.,7
35048,Sheldon,16, I don‰Ûªt need to explain myself to you!,7
35049,Amy,16, You‰Ûªre sick of his nonsense and ready to move in with me.,7
35050,Sheldon,16, Keep the table. We don‰Ûªt use that space.,7
35051,Amy,16," Damn it, I got cocky.",7
35052,Scene,16, Howard and Bernadette‰Ûªs apartment.,7
35053,Howard,16," Hey, Bernie. I‰Ûªm home. Hello.",7
35054,Bernadette,16," Hi, honey.",7
35055,Howard,16, What‰Ûªs going on?,7
35056,Bernadette,16, Maybe you should have a seat.,7
35057,Howard,16," Um, okay. I know my mom‰Ûªs not dead, there‰Ûªd be balloons.",7
35058,Raj,16," Um, okay. First off, know that we all love you and cherish you.",7
35059,Mike Rostenkowski,16," Well, I wouldn‰Ûªt‰Û_",7
35060,Bernadette,16, Daddy.,7
35061,Mike R,16, You‰Ûªre great.,7
35062,Mike Massimino (on skype),16, Can I say something?,7
35063,Raj,16," Oh, of course.",7
35064,Mike M,16," Hey, Fruit Loops.",7
35065,Howard,16, Massimino? Why are you here?,7
35066,Mike M,16," Well, I heard you were thinking about going back up to the space station, and as someone who‰Ûªs been there with you, well, you know how astronauts need to have the right stuff?",7
35067,Howard,16, Sure.,7
35068,Mike M,16, The stuff you have is wrong.,7
35069,Howard,16, You don‰Ûªt think I did a good job up there?,7
35070,Mike M,16," You did a fine job. It‰Ûªs just, you were scared and miserable the whole time.",7
35071,Bernadette,16," I think what we‰Ûªre all trying to say is, you don‰Ûªt seem to be remembering how traumatic the experience was for you.",7
35072,Raj,16, Like how women often forget the pain of childbirth.,7
35073,Mike R,16, Like a woman. Great analogy.,7
35074,Howard,16," Fine, maybe I was a little scared.",7
35075,Mike M,16, You peed in your space suit.,7
35076,Howard,16, You‰Ûªre supposed to do that.,7
35077,Mike M,16, Not during the fitting.,7
35078,Mike R,16," Son, do I need to remind you what you asked me to do before you went up last time?",7
35079,Howard,16, Hang on. That was just me joking around.,7
35080,Mike R,16, You wanted me to shoot you in the foot.,7
35081,Howard,16," Come on, how is that not a joke? You got to get me out of this. Shoot me in the foot.",7
35082,Bernadette,16, Don‰Ûªt forget all the other astronauts picking on you.,7
35083,Raj,16," And how you threw up in zero gravity, and it floated back in your mouth. And you threw up again. And so on and so on.",7
35084,Mike M,16, That was funny.,7
35085,Howard,16," Okay, so I wasn‰Ûªt exactly John Glenn up there, but I‰Ûªve changed. I‰Ûªm a different man now. Yeah, and I‰Ûªm a little insulted that you guys don‰Ûªt think I can handle it.",7
35086,Mike M,16, You know you‰Ûªre gonna have to go through survival training again.,7
35087,Howard,16, Really?,7
35088,Scene,16, A doctor‰Ûªs surgery.,7
35089,Howard,16, You‰Ûªve got to get me out of this.,7
35090,Doctor,16, What do you want me to do? You‰Ûªre perfectly healthy.,7
35091,Howard,16, Check my blood pressure again. I can get it higher. just give me a second. (Dials phone) ,7
35092,Mrs Wolowitz (on phone),16, Hello?,7
35093,Howard,16," Hi, Ma. How are you?",7
35094,Mrs Wolowitz,16," How I am is not dead, but you wouldn‰Ûªt know that, because you don‰Ûªt love me enough to pick up the phone.",7
35095,Howard,16," Go, go, go.",7
35096,Mrs Wolowitz,16," For all you know, I could have slipped in the tub and drowned. That‰Ûªs what happened to your Aunt Ida.",7
35097,Doctor,16, Wow.,7
35098,Scene,16, The apartment.,7
35099,Raj,16," Howard, I‰Ûªm so sorry your blood pressure was off the charts.",7
35100,Howard,16," Oh, me, too. I mean, the doctor was willing to fudge the results, but it just seemed so darned dishonest.",7
35101,Leonard,16, But the mission wouldn‰Ûªt be for at least a year. Isn‰Ûªt that enough time to get your blood pressure under‰Û_,7
35102,Howard,16," Look, my blood pressure‰Ûªs too high, okay? Drop it.",7
35103,Penny,16," You know, my aunt changed her diet, and in a few months, she‰Û_",7
35104,Howard,16," Went to space? I don‰Ûªt think so. Now, pass the soy sauce. Hey, not the green one, the red one.",7
35105,Penny,16," Sheldon, Amy, will you please come join us?",7
35106,Bernadette,16," Yeah, it‰Ûªs fun up here.",7
35107,Leonard,16, So why are you trying to ruin it?,7
35108,Sheldon,16," No, thanks. We‰Ûªre fine. I mean, if you people want to eat at the table, then that‰Ûªs what you should do. I like eating down here because this is how we‰Ûªve always done things. But if those days are gone, they‰Ûªre gone. It just makes me sad.",7
35109,Bernadette,16, Now I feel bad.,7
35110,Leonard,16," Oh, don‰Ûªt anthropomorphize him, he‰Ûªs got big eyes, but his feelings are not like ours.",7
35111,Bernadette,16," No, it just seems silly for us to sit in two groups.",7
35112,Leonard,16," Well, it‰Ûªs not silly if you think of that group as being led by a big, evil baby.",7
35113,Bernadette,16, Look at Amy down there. Should we go?,7
35114,Penny,16," Yeah, let‰Ûªs go.",7
35115,Leonard,16," But Penny, this was your idea. You said that I should stand up to him.",7
35116,Penny,16," Forget it, Leonard. It‰Ûªs over.",7
35117,Leonard,16, Fine.,7
35118,Amy,16, Rajesh?,7
35119,Raj,16, Screw that! I sat on the floor for seven years. I‰Ûªm staying right here.,7
35120,Bernadette,16," Come on, Raj, it‰Ûªs not the same without you.",7
35121,Raj,16, Fine. But no more making fun of how I say tings.,7
35122,Howard,16, You mean tings like moo-stache?,7
35123,Sheldon,16," Well, isn‰Ûªt this nice. Sometimes the baby wins.",7
35124,Sceme,17, The apartment,7
35125,Bernadette,17," Raj, your tag‰Ûªs sticking out.",7
35126,Raj,17," Thank you. That was the closest I‰Ûªve come to sex in, like, two years.",7
35127,Bernadette,17, Now I feel a little gross.,7
35128,Raj,17, You‰Ûªre only making it seem more real for me.,7
35129,Howard,17," Hey, that‰Ûªs my wife. If anyone‰Ûªs gonna make her feel gross about sex, it‰Ûªs me.",7
35130,Raj,17, Can we please talk about something other than my depressing love life?,7
35131,Sheldon,17, How about Penny‰Ûªs depressing acting career?,7
35132,Leonard,17," Hey. I mean, it‰Ûªs been a little tough, but Penny‰Ûªs following her dreams, and in my book, that is not depressing.",7
35133,Penny,17," Aw, thank you.",7
35134,Howard,17, Is that book called Lies I Tell to Get Sex?,7
35135,Raj,17, Is that a real book? I would totally read that book.,7
35136,Amy,17, Can I borrow it when you‰Ûªre done?,7
35137,Penny,17," Well, I‰Ûªll have you guys know I turned down a part in a movie last week.",7
35138,Leonard,17, Why would you do that?,7
35139,Penny,17, Because it was crap. It‰Ûªs a sequel to that awful killer gorilla movie I was in.,7
35140,Bernadette,17, Serial Ape-ist? I thought you died in that.,7
35141,Sheldon,17, She does. 42 minutes in.,7
35142,Raj,17," While showering topless, 16 minutes after brief side butt during a pillow fight with her sorority sisters.",7
35143,Sheldon,17, I have an eidetic memory. I don‰Ûªt know what his problem is.,7
35144,Penny,17," Okay, well, there are no shower scenes in this one. They just try to clone me from my corpse, but my DNA gets mixed with the ape‰Ûªs DNA and I end up running around with giant gorilla hands and feet.",7
35145,Sheldon,17," Am I missing something, or isn‰Ûªt that the part she was born to play?",7
35146,Scene,17, The apartment.,7
35147,Leonard,17, So are you really not gonna do this movie?,7
35148,Penny,17," Well, I don‰Ûªt think it‰Ûªs the kind of part that‰Ûªs good for my career.",7
35149,Leonard,17," Well, but don‰Ûªt a lot of famous actors get their start doing bad movies?",7
35150,Penny,17," Okay, I don‰Ûªt think Meryl Streep ever had to say ‰ÛÏMust keep gorilla hands from killing again!‰Û",7
35151,Raj,17," If she did, it would be amazing. That woman can do no wrong.",7
35152,Leonard,17," I don‰Ûªt know anything about show business, so if you think it‰Ûªs reasonable to turn down paid work and just burn through your savings, I‰Ûªm sure you know what you‰Ûªre doing.",7
35153,Amy,17, I think we‰Ûªre gonna go.,7
35154,Sheldon,17, Are you sure? We were making fun of failed careers. We didn‰Ûªt get to tap the juicy vein that is Howard‰Ûªs.,7
35155,Howard,17," Hey, I work at the same university you do.",7
35156,Sheldon,17," Yes, and Hawkeye‰Ûªs in the Avengers, but no one ever says help, Hawkeye.",7
35157,Bernadette,17, Can I ask you something? Why do you constantly feel the need to put down my husband?,7
35158,Penny,17," Oh, I‰Ûªm sure he does it out of love. The same way my boyfriend makes me feel terrible about my life choices.",7
35159,Amy,17, I think we‰Ûªre gonna go.,7
35160,Leonard,17," No, no, no. This is not a fight. I was just excited that someone offered you a part and a little surprised that you‰Ûªd rather sit at home and do nothing than take it. Now it‰Ûªs a fight.",7
35161,Sheldon,17," Well, with that sorted out, I‰Ûªm happy to answer your question, Bernadette. Howard started it.",7
35162,Howard,17, I didn‰Ûªt do anything. I was just sitting here.,7
35163,Sheldon,17," I wasn‰Ûªt referring to this evening. Ten years ago, upon first seeing me, your husband claimed that I looked like C-3PO and Pee-wee Herman. And he called me C-3P-wee Herman.",7
35164,Raj,17, Ha-a-a. Still funny.,7
35165,Bernadette,17, That was ten years ago.,7
35166,Sheldon,17," Nine years, 11 months and three weeks ago, he followed that up by replacing the slides for my lecture with photographs of nude fat women bending over.",7
35167,Amy,17, Really?,7
35168,Howard,17, The lecture was on cosmic gas clouds. That‰Ûªs funny.,7
35169,Raj,17, I was there. It was funny.,7
35170,Sheldon,17," In any event, that began a decade-long progression of insults, pranks and unwanted magazine subscriptions. To this day, I still get a monthly copy of Granny on Granny. Which, other than its surprisingly fun puzzle page, is complete filth.",7
35171,Scene,17, The street,7
35172,Amy,17, Thanks for walking me to my car.,7
35173,Raj,17," Actually, it‰Ûªs for both of us. Last night, I watched West Side Story, and I‰Ûªm a little freaked out by street gangs.",7
35174,Amy,17, Why can‰Ûªt Raj find a girl? The mystery continues.,7
35175,Raj,17," I don‰Ûªt appreciate your sarcasm, but we‰Ûªve still got two blocks to go, so I‰Ûªll put up with it.",7
35176,Amy,17, Whatever happened with your online dating?,7
35177,Raj,17," No one was writing me back, so I stopped checking my profile.",7
35178,Amy,17," Before I met Sheldon, I was ready to give up, too. Once, I even dropped in on my OBGYN just to get some human contact.",7
35179,Raj,17, It has been a while since I got my prostate checked.,7
35180,Amy,17, Then I met Sheldon and look at where we are now.,7
35181,Raj,17," What? You‰Ûªve kissed, like, once in three years.",7
35182,Amy,17, That‰Ûªs true. Do whatever you want.,7
35183,Scene,17, Sheldon‰Ûªs office.,7
35184,Howard,17, Hey.,7
35185,Sheldon,17, Hello.,7
35186,Howard,17," Listen, I was thinking you and I could probably try to be better friends.",7
35187,Sheldon,17, Really? I was thinking what we have now is a bit much.,7
35188,Howard,17," Seriously, I was talking to Bernadette last night and she made some great points. You and I have known each other a long time, and I didn‰Ûªt hear the rest ‰Ûªcause she took her bra off.",7
35189,Sheldon,17, Very well. How do you propose we move forward?,7
35190,Howard,17," Uh, for starters, we could stop insulting each other.",7
35191,Sheldon,17," That‰Ûªs a great idea. And in the spirit of our new arrangement, I will mask my surprise that you came up with it.",7
35192,Howard,17," Anyway, I got invited to do a little talk at NASA in Houston this weekend. They gave me two tickets. Bernadette can‰Ûªt go. You want to come with me? You can visit your mom, and I‰Ûªll show you around the space centre.",7
35193,Sheldon,17, I have one question. Is this a prank where we land in Houston and you‰Ûªve made up wanted posters that have my face with a moustache and a Spanish name and then I get arrested and deported to South America?,7
35194,Howard,17, No.,7
35195,Sheldon,17, I‰Ûªm glad because I would not have seen that coming.,7
35196,Scene,17, Amy‰Ûªs lab.,7
35197,Raj,17," Amy, I could use some help.",7
35198,Amy,17, Oh. Let me guess. There‰Ûªs an undergrad in a leather jacket snapping his fingers by the water fountain.,7
35199,Raj,17," I thought about what you said last night, and I went back on the dating Web site and I was looking at this girl‰Ûªs profile. She‰Ûªs amazing.",7
35200,Amy,17," Oh, she‰Ûªs cute. And smart. Phi Beta Kappa.",7
35201,Raj,17," And judging by her lack of Adam‰Ûªs apple, she‰Ûªs been female her entire life. I like that in a woman.",7
35202,Amy,17," Great, so what do you need me for?",7
35203,Raj,17," Well, I was up all night trying to write to her, but I wanted to run it by you first.",7
35204,Amy,17, All right.,7
35205,Raj,17," Emily, your face is like a precious dew-kissed flower.",7
35206,Amy,17, Wow.,7
35207,Raj,17," I know. Powerful stuff, huh?",7
35208,Amy,17," No. You‰Ûªre supposed to be yourself, not all desperate and creepy.",7
35209,Raj,17," Okay, I‰Ûªm getting some mixed messages here.",7
35210,Amy,17," Just say something normal like, I saw your profile. Looks like we have a lot in common, let‰Ûªs get a cup of coffee sometime.‰Û",7
35211,Raj,17, Yes. Where I can be jealous of the cup touching your ruby lips. Or you just write it for me.,7
35212,Amy,17, I‰Ûªm not gonna pretend to be you.,7
35213,Raj,17," I don‰Ûªt want you to pretend to be me. You can be like my, uh, online wingman. Like if we met her at a bar and you talked me up.",7
35214,Amy,17," Well, what would I say to her?",7
35215,Raj,17," Just tell her what I‰Ûªm really like. And, if you think it‰Ûªll help, that you saw me changing once and my package reminded you of the muscular tail of a jaguar. Use your own words.",7
35216,Scene,17, Penny‰Ûªs car.,7
35217,Sheldon,17, Thanks again for taking me to the pharmacy.,7
35218,Penny,17," Oh, it‰Ûªs no problem. Is everything okay?",7
35219,Sheldon,17," Oh, I‰Ûªm fine. It‰Ûªs just some, uh, stomach medication for my trip. There‰Ûªs the remote yet distinct possibility that I may end up in South America.",7
35220,Penny,17," Remember the old days when I would‰Ûªve said something dumb like why? Uh, that doesn‰Ûªt sound good.",7
35221,Sheldon,17, Remember the old days when I used to point out that your check engine light was on?,7
35222,Penny,17, Yes.,7
35223,Sheldon,17," Well, get ready to stroll down memory lane. Penny, your check engine‰Û_",7
35224,Penny,17," Yeah, I know it‰Ûªs on, Sheldon. Oh, no, no, no, no, no. I cannot afford this right now.",7
35225,Sheldon,17," Maybe it‰Ûªs just something minor. Ooh, good news, the light just went out.",7
35226,Scene,17, The apartment. ,7
35227,Leonard,17, Are we playing individual or teams?,7
35228,Raj,17, Teams are fun.,7
35229,Sheldon,17," Oh, in that case, I‰Ûªd like to be partnered with my good friend Howard.",7
35230,Raj,17, But I‰Ûªm always on Howard‰Ûªs team. We‰Ûªre best friends. The kind who finish each others‰Û_,7
35231,Howard,17, I really don‰Ûªt think we do tha‰Û_,7
35232,Raj,17, Do that. See?,7
35233,Penny,17," Oh, hi.",7
35234,Leonard,17," Oh, how‰Ûªd it go at the mechanic?",7
35235,Penny,17, Not great. Can I talk to you for a sec?,7
35236,Leonard,17," Yeah, sure.",7
35237,Raj,17, Maybe I can go with you guys to Houston?,7
35238,Howard,17, Isn‰Ûªt it a little late to get plane tick‰Û_,7
35239,Raj,17, Plane tickets? Yeah.,7
35240,Howard,17, Will you please sto‰Û_,7
35241,Raj,17, Stop that? Okay.,7
35242,Scene,17, The stairwell.,7
35243,Penny,17," I don‰Ûªt know what to do. My car threw a rod and it‰Ûªs totaled. I can‰Ûªt afford a new one, I have no job, and now I can‰Ûªt drive to auditions.",7
35244,Leonard,17," I‰Ûªm so sorry. I know it‰Ûªs a sensitive subject, but can you reconsider that part in the movie?",7
35245,Penny,17, I did. I called them. The part‰Ûªs gone. They gave it to someone else. Now that girl‰Ûªs gonna get discovered and become famous and go on Letterman and talk about how she got her big break on a cheap monkey movie all because some dumb girl thought it was beneath her.,7
35246,Leonard,17," At least they talked about you on Letterman. Come on, I can drive you wherever you need to go.",7
35247,Penny,17," How? Unlike me, you have a job. I‰Ûªm just gonna have to go back to being a waitress, like I will be for the rest of my life.",7
35248,Sheldon,17," Leonard, would you wrap it up? We‰Ûªre waiting on you.",7
35249,Penny,17," I‰Ûªm sorry, is the fact that my life‰Ûªs falling apart interfering with your board game?",7
35250,Sheldon,17," It is. You were wrong, friend Howard. She completely understood.",7
35251,Scene,17, Amy‰Ûªs lab.,7
35252,Raj,17," Hey, you busy?",7
35253,Amy,17, No. What‰Ûªs up?,7
35254,Raj,17, Have you heard back from Emily?,7
35255,Amy,17, I have.,7
35256,Raj,17, Great. And?,7
35257,Amy,17, And I‰Ûªm afraid she doesn‰Ûªt think you‰Ûªre right for her.,7
35258,Raj,17," I give you one simple thing to do, contact a complete stranger and make her fall in love with me, and you blow it.",7
35259,Amy,17," I told her what a good guy you are, but she thought it was a bad sign that you didn‰Ûªt write to her yourself. She thought it made you seem too shy and passive.",7
35260,Raj,17," I‰Ûªm not too shy and passive. You write her back and tell her I said that. You know, when you have a second.",7
35261,Amy,17," Look, I‰Ûªll see if I can change her mind tomorrow night.",7
35262,Raj,17, What‰Ûªs happening tomorrow night?,7
35263,Amy,17, I‰Ûªm meeting her for coffee.,7
35264,Raj,17, What?,7
35265,Amy,17," Well, we just, we e-mailed back and forth a bit, and we kind of hit it off.",7
35266,Raj,17," I find a girl I like, and you‰Ûªre stealing her?",7
35267,Amy,17," No. We just ended up having a lot in common. We went to Harvard, we like Chaucer, we‰Ûªre both hardcore into quilting.",7
35268,Raj,17, Your words fall like acid rain on the wounded petals of my heart.,7
35269,Scene,17, Bernadette‰Ûªs car.,7
35270,Howard,17, That‰Ûªs Sheldon. He says he‰Ûªll be down in a minute.,7
35271,Bernadette,17, What are you doing?,7
35272,Howard,17," Oh, he‰Ûªs not coming out until he sees proof you don‰Ûªt have an air freshener in your car.",7
35273,Bernadette,17, This is gonna be a long weekend for you.,7
35274,Howard,17, You‰Ûªre the reason I‰Ûªm doing it.,7
35275,Bernadette,17, I said to stop insulting each other. I didn‰Ûªt tell you to take him on a romantic getaway.,7
35276,Howard,17, How do I know what you said? Damn you and your noise-cancelling breasts.,7
35277,Sheldon,17, Hello.,7
35278,Bernadette,17, Hi.,7
35279,Howard,17," Hey, buddy.",7
35280,Bernadette,17, You excited for Texas?,7
35281,Sheldon,17," Oh, very much so.",7
35282,Howard,17, It‰Ûªs not every day you get to tour NASA with a real astronaut.,7
35283,Sheldon,17," Oh, who‰Ûªs the real astronaut?",7
35284,Howard,17, Buzz Aldrin.,7
35285,Sheldon,17, Oh. Yay.,7
35286,Scene,17, An airplane. ,7
35287,Sheldon,17," (Tap, tap, tap) Howard? (Tap, tap, tap) Howard? (Tap, tap, tap) Howard?",7
35288,Howard,17, What now?,7
35289,Sheldon,17, I have to go to the bathroom.,7
35290,Howard,17, You just went to the bathroom.,7
35291,Sheldon,17," But I didn‰Ûªt use it because it didn‰Ûªt seem safe. Despite all my e-mails, the toilet didn‰Ûªt have a seatbelt.",7
35292,Howard,17," Well, it still doesn‰Ûªt.",7
35293,Sheldon,17," I realize that, but safety concerns went out the window two apple juices ago.",7
35294,Howard,17, Fine.,7
35295,Sheldon,17, Why are you getting annoyed?,7
35296,Howard,17," I‰Ûªm trying to be a better friend, but you constantly say and do irritating things.",7
35297,Sheldon,17, Like when?,7
35298,Howard,17," When? How about in the car? I‰Ûªm an astronaut, and you know it. You just don‰Ûªt like admitting it, because you‰Ûªre jealous.",7
35299,Sheldon,17," Well, truth be told, as a child, I did dream of going to space. Those astronauts were my heroes. And when you got to go, it was hard for me.",7
35300,Howard,17, Thank you.,7
35301,Sheldon,17, Because it made me realize they‰Ûªll just send anyone up there. Aren‰Ûªt you going to let me out?,7
35302,Howard,17, No.,7
35303,Sheldon,17, But I still need to use the bathroom.,7
35304,Howard,17, Here you go. Be creative. What‰Ûªs the matter? Scared of a little turbulence?,7
35305,Sheldon,17," No, turbulence is just the equalization of diurnal temperature variations in the atmosphere. I‰Ûªm not scared at all. Oh, apple juice, stay where you are.",7
35306,Howard,17," Oh, this is nothing. I experienced way worse when I was plummeting back to Earth, apparently not being a real astronaut. Okay, that was a big one.",7
35307,Sheldon,17, I take it back. I‰Ûªm scared of turbulence!,7
35308,Howard,17, I‰Ûªm gonna need that bag back.,7
35309,Scene,17, Penny‰Ûªs apartment. ,7
35310,Leonard,17, You sure you want to do this?,7
35311,Penny,17," Yeah. Why wouldn‰Ûªt I want to get my old job back? It‰Ûªll be fun to see everyone. I haven‰Ûªt talked to them since I said I quit, see you at the Oscars, bitches. Come on, let‰Ûªs just get this over with.",7
35312,Leonard,17," Let‰Ûªs get this over with. Am I driving you to the Cheesecake Factory, or are we having sex? I‰Ûªm just, I‰Ûªm trying to lighten the mood.",7
35313,Penny,17, I know. Thank you.,7
35314,Leonard,17, Sorry.,7
35315,Penny,17, It‰Ûªs just so humiliating.,7
35316,Leonard,17, So humiliating? Am I driving you to the Cheesecake Factory‰Û_? I‰Ûªm sorry. I‰Ûªll. I‰Ûªll stop. I‰Ûªll stop.,7
35317,Scene,17, Outside the building. ,7
35318,Leonard,17," Come on, don‰Ûªt look so sad. You never know what‰Ûªs gonna happen. Maybe tonight will be great.",7
35319,Penny,17," Sweetie, I know you‰Ûªre trying to make me feel better, and I love you for that, but it‰Ûªs making me feel worse, and I kind of hate you. This isn‰Ûªt your car.",7
35320,Leonard,17, I know. I thought we‰Ûªd take yours.,7
35321,Penny,17, I don‰Ûªt understand.,7
35322,Leonard,17," It‰Ûªs nothing fancy, but it‰Ûªll get you to auditions, and at least for now, you don‰Ûªt have to go back to waitressing.",7
35323,Penny,17, I don‰Ûªt know what to say.,7
35324,Leonard,17, Don‰Ûªt say anything.,7
35325,Penny,17," Oh, my God.",7
35326,Leonard,17," I mean, you could say thank you. I did just buy you a car.",7
35327,Scene,17, A coffee shop.,7
35328,Amy,17," Look, I admit that it‰Ûªs odd that Rajesh didn‰Ûªt write to you himself, but if you get to know him, you‰Ûªll see he‰Ûªs just a sweet, regular guy. As a counterpoint, here he is, uninvited and visibly sweaty.",7
35329,Raj,17," Hello, Emily.",7
35330,Emily,17, Hello.,7
35331,Raj,17," Amy told me you were concerned that I might be too passive and shy. Let me ask you something. Would a passive guy barge in here to look you in the eye and say, hey, dew-kissed flower, what‰Ûªs up?",7
35332,Emily,17," No, but a weird guy with no boundaries might.",7
35333,Raj,17," Uh, okay, that‰Ûªs a separate issue. Let‰Ûªs put a pin in that and just focus on the passive thing.",7
35334,Emily,17, I‰Ûªm leaving.,7
35335,Amy,17, Are we still going to go to that Chaucer reading Friday?,7
35336,Emily,17," You know, I think I‰Ûªm just gonna go by myself.",7
35337,Raj,17," Not my best first date. Yeah, but not my worst, either.",7
35338,Scene,17, The airplane.,7
35339,Sheldon,17, I‰Ûªm sorry for every mean thing I ever did or said to you.,7
35340,Howard,17," I‰Ûªm sorry, too. It‰Ûªs all my fault.",7
35341,Sheldon,17," If you weren‰Ûªt my friend, there‰Ûªd be a hole in my life.",7
35342,Howard,17," Thank you, Sheldon.",7
35343,Sheldon,17, Kind of like when Firefly was cancelled. But not as big.,7
35344,Announcement,17, The captain has turned off the fasten seat belt sign. You‰Ûªre now free to move about the cabin.,7
35345,Howard,17, It‰Ûªs over.,7
35346,Sheldon,17, Yeah.,7
35347,Howard,17, Should we stop holding hands now?,7
35348,Sheldon,17, In a minute.,7
35349,Howard,17," Okay, good.",7
35350,Scene,18, The apartment.,7
35351,Amy,18, Should you really be sitting in Sheldon‰Ûªs spot?,7
35352,Raj,18," He‰Ûªs in Texas, he‰Ûªll never know.",7
35353,Penny,18, I wouldn‰Ûªt be so sure about that.,7
35354,Leonard,18," Yeah, he has a very sensitive butt. Well, it‰Ûªs true. Once I saw him sit on a bunch of loose change and add it up.",7
35355,Raj,18, Have you heard from Howard?,7
35356,Bernadette,18, I did. His talk at NASA went great.,7
35357,Penny,18, Sheldon didn‰Ûªt heckle him?,7
35358,Bernadette,18," No, in fact, he was so well-behaved, Howie bought him a Buzz Aldrin bobble head and astronaut ice cream.",7
35359,Stuart,18," Hey, guys.",7
35360,Amy,18," Oh, hi.",7
35361,Bernadette,18," Hi, Stuart.",7
35362,Raj,18," Hey, Stuart!",7
35363,Stuart,18, How‰Ûªs it going?,7
35364,Raj,18," Good. Sheldon‰Ûªs out of town, so we can do whatever we want. We even ordered from the Thai place he doesn‰Ûªt like.",7
35365,Stuart,18," Oh, how is it?",7
35366,Penny,18, Disgusting. Do not tell him.,7
35367,Leonard,18, What do you guys want to do tonight?,7
35368,Amy,18, I don‰Ûªt know.,7
35369,Bernadette,18," Well, I told Howie if I wasn‰Ûªt busy, I‰Ûªd spend the night at his mom‰Ûªs. So for God‰Ûªs sake, think of something.",7
35370,Raj,18, Stuart? Are you okay?,7
35371,Stuart,18," No, I don‰Ûªt feel so‰Û_",7
35372,Leonard,18," Oh, my God, Stuart?",7
35373,Penny,18," Oh, my God, you guys need to do something!",7
35374,Raj,18, Stuart?,7
35375,Leonard,18, Calling 911.,7
35376,Raj,18," Well, it‰Ûªs too late.",7
35377,Leonard,18, What do you mean it‰Ûªs too late?,7
35378,Raj,18, He‰Ûªs been murdered by someone in this room.,7
35379,Penny,18," Oh, my God.",7
35380,Leonard,18," Oh, come on.",7
35381,Raj,18, Welcome to another classic Koothrappali murder mystery dinner.,7
35382,Amy,18, I‰Ûªm leaving.,7
35383,Raj,18, You can‰Ûªt leave. You‰Ûªre a suspect in the mysterious murder of Stuart Bloom.,7
35384,Bernadette,18, I didn‰Ûªt know his last name was Bloom.,7
35385,Amy,18," Yeah, it‰Ûªs Bloom.",7
35386,Penny,18, Are you really gonna lie on the floor and pretend to be dead all night?,7
35387,Stuart,18, What do you think I was gonna do at home?,7
35388,Scene,18, The apartment.,7
35389,Penny,18, Are you gonna make us pretend to be a bunch of lame characters with silly accents?,7
35390,Raj,18," Lame characters with silly ac‰Û_, what kind of actress are you?",7
35391,Penny,18," You‰Ûªre right, I‰Ûªm sorry. Sounds like fun.",7
35392,Raj,18, Thank you.,7
35393,Penny,18, That kind of actress. This sucks.,7
35394,Leonard,18," Come on, guys. Raj put a lot of effort into this. And that‰Ûªs great. It‰Ûªs not sad, it‰Ûªs great.",7
35395,Amy,18, I think it might be fun to be someone else tonight.,7
35396,Raj,18," Actually, you‰Ûªre all just gonna be yourselves.",7
35397,Amy,18," Oh, ugh.",7
35398,Bernadette,18," All right, if I‰Ûªm doing this, I‰Ûªm playing to win, so just to be clear, if we‰Ûªre ourselves, that means one of us killed Stuart?",7
35399,Raj,18," Very good, Bernadette. You are a regular Byomkesh Bakshi.",7
35400,Bernadette,18," What is that, like, the Indian Sherlock Holmes?",7
35401,Raj,18, Or is Sherlock Holmes the English Byomkesh Bakshi?,7
35402,Amy,18," According to Wikipedia, Sherlock Holmes came first.",7
35403,Raj,18," Great, everyone‰Ûªs a Byomkesh Bakshi. Now, here are some secret facts about each of you, including whether you are the murderer. Throughout the game, feel free to ask each other questions to uncover clues.",7
35404,Penny,18," Got it. Hey, who‰Ûªs the murderer?",7
35405,Raj,18, Any question but that.,7
35406,Penny,18," Sorry. Hey, who‰Ûªs not the murderer?",7
35407,Stuart,18," Bernadette, can you not stand so close to me?",7
35408,Bernadette,18, What do you care? You‰Ûªre dead.,7
35409,Stuart,18, Suit yourself. But I can kind of see up your skirt.,7
35410,Scene,18, A hire car.,7
35411,Sheldon,18, Thank you for my bobble head.,7
35412,Howard,18, Thank you for not making fun of me during my speech.,7
35413,Sheldon,18, It wasn‰Ûªt easy. Was it Buzz?,7
35414,Howard,18, We can‰Ûªt show up to your mom‰Ûªs empty-handed. We should bring something.,7
35415,Sheldon,18, I already am. I‰Ûªm bringing the gift of knowledge.,7
35416,Howard,18," Oh, boy.",7
35417,Sheldon,18," Despite what her Bible says, recent archaeological studies indicate that although camels are referenced in the Old Testament, they didn‰Ûªt exist in the Middle East until hundreds of years later.",7
35418,Howard,18, I was gonna say we pick up a cake or a pie. But an insult to her faith is always thoughtful.,7
35419,Scene,18, The apartment. ,7
35420,Bernadette,18," So, what happens next?",7
35421,Raj,18, I can‰Ûªt tell you that. But perhaps the killer dropped a fun and imaginative clue somewhere in the apartment.,7
35422,Penny,18," Ooh, I‰Ûªm gonna check the fridge, and see if there are any clues inside a beer.",7
35423,Amy,18," Hey, I found something. It looks like a little man with a briefcase.",7
35424,Leonard,18," Oh, no, no. That‰Ûªs Clarence Darrow. It‰Ûªs from a game Sheldon made up called Chutes and Lawyers. You slide down a chute and then work your way back up through the appellate system.",7
35425,Raj,18," Well, unlike that, my games are much more fun.",7
35426,Penny,18," Okay, can I ask you something? Why do you like making us do this stuff?",7
35427,Raj,18," Well, I guess it goes back to when I was a fat kid in India, and didn‰Ûªt have any friends.",7
35428,Bernadette,18, I didn‰Ûªt know you were fat.,7
35429,Raj,18," Yeah, I was. I was 200 pounds by the time I was in middle school. Kids were mean. Cows may be sacred there, but it doesn‰Ûªt help if you look like one. Anyway, I was pretty lonely, so I had to make up my own stories and games, and I promised myself if I ever made any friends that, that I would play those games with them.",7
35430,Amy,18, That is so sweet.,7
35431,Leonard,18, I‰Ûªve seen old pictures of you. You were never a fat kid.,7
35432,Raj,18," No, I was svelte as a gazelle. A gazelle blessed with a flair for storytelling.",7
35433,Bernadette,18," Hey, what about this? It looks like a receipt.",7
35434,Amy,18, What‰Ûªs it for?,7
35435,Bernadette,18, For a cup of coffee. But it‰Ûªs dated 20 years from now.,7
35436,Raj,18, From the future? How fun and imaginative.,7
35437,Leonard,18, So one of us came back from the future to murder Stuart?,7
35438,Raj,18, Correct.,7
35439,Leonard,18, Does the gazelle with a flair for storytelling know he‰Ûªs just ripping off Terminator?,7
35440,Raj,18," Does the smart-ass know that Terminator was actually ripped off from an Outer Limits script called Demon With a Glass Hand, by Harlan Ellison?",7
35441,Leonard,18," Oh, does the gazelle know that according to Harlan Ellison, it was not ripped off from Demon With a Glass Hand, but was ripped off from another Outer Limits script he wrote called The Soldier?",7
35442,Penny,18, I‰Ûªm gonna need another clue.,7
35443,Scene,18, Sheldon‰Ûªs childhood home.,7
35444,Howard,18," Okay, give me the flowers and pie.",7
35445,Sheldon,18," But if we show up and you‰Ûªre holding them, she‰Ûªll think they‰Ûªre only from you.",7
35446,Howard,18, They are only from me. You said the gift of you was enough.,7
35447,Sheldon,18," Yes, but now that I‰Ûªve seen what the gift of me with flowers and pie looks like, there‰Ûªs no going back. Boy, I can‰Ûªt wait to see the look on her face. We‰Ûªre leaving right now.",7
35448,Howard,18, What‰Ûªs wrong?,7
35449,Sheldon,18, Nothing.,7
35450,Howard,18," What? Sheldon, tell me what‰Ûªs going on.",7
35451,Sheldon,18, I saw my mommy with a naked man and she was trying to be a mommy again.,7
35452,Scene,18, A bar in Texas.,7
35453,Howard,18, You ready to talk about it?,7
35454,Sheldon,18, I‰Ûªm not nearly drunk enough. Okay. Do you have any idea what it‰Ûªs like to see your mother ravaging someone?,7
35455,Howard,18," Does a brisket count? I‰Ûªm sorry, buddy, that‰Ûªs rough. But didn‰Ûªt she know we were coming?",7
35456,Sheldon,18, No. I wanted to surprise her. What am I supposed to say to her after something like this?,7
35457,Howard,18," Well, did she see you in the window?",7
35458,Sheldon,18, No.,7
35459,Howard,18, Then don‰Ûªt say anything.,7
35460,Sheldon,18," I have to. How can we ever hope to have a healthy relationship if I don‰Ûªt tell her how disappointed I am, and that I‰Ûªll never forgive her?",7
35461,Howard,18," Well, don‰Ûªt do it on the phone.",7
35462,Sheldon,18," No, I‰Ûªm just going to tell her I‰Ûªm coming so she can give that good time Charlie the heave-ho.",7
35463,Howard,18," That‰Ûªs some tough talk, I may need to cut you off.",7
35464,Sheldon,18," Yeah, maybe you better, I took a pretty big sip.",7
35465,Howard,18," Look, she‰Ûªs a grown woman. And, and your dad‰Ûªs been gone a long time. Maybe this is none of your business.",7
35466,Sheldon,18," I beg to differ. I used to live in those genitals. And if someone wants to move into my old room, I should at least get a vote.",7
35467,Scene,18, The apartment.,7
35468,Raj,18," Okay, murder suspects, Leonard has found the time machine the killer must‰Ûªve used. You‰Ûªre all inside it, and we hurtle through the very fabric of time. And welcome to 20 years in the future. Hey, you guys just time-travelled. Stop looking so bored.",7
35469,Penny,18," Well, my beer isn‰Ûªt flat and my rack‰Ûªs not saggy. So far, the future‰Ûªs great.",7
35470,Stuart,18," Hey, can I go to the bathroom?",7
35471,Raj,18," Fine, just try not to look too alive.",7
35472,Stuart,18, That‰Ûªs my jam.,7
35473,Bernadette,18, So one of us went back in time to kill Stuart?,7
35474,Amy,18, But why?,7
35475,Raj,18, Perhaps this will help. Here are some facts about yourselves in the future that might contain a clue.,7
35476,Amy,18," Hey, I won the Nobel Prize in physiology, then I used the money to buy Stuart‰Ûªs comic book store, and close it down so Sheldon would pay attention to me. Not the worst idea.",7
35477,Penny,18," Hey, I‰Ûªm a famous actress living in London.",7
35478,Leonard,18," Hmm, I‰Ûªm a professor at Stanford.",7
35479,Penny,18, Hmm.,7
35480,Bernadette,18, So I guess you two are making it work long distance.,7
35481,Raj,18," Oh, no. In this game, as your careers both took off, you drifted apart. Kind of like how future me lost touch with you guys after I became boy toy for the wrinkled, but still flexible, Madonna.",7
35482,Amy,18," What does your card say, Bernadette?",7
35483,Leonard,18," Uh, uh, uh, hang on. Do you think we‰Ûªd really drift apart if we both became successful?",7
35484,Penny,18," Of course not. If I became a famous actress and had to move, you would just come with me.",7
35485,Leonard,18," But if I get a chance to be a tenured professor, I might not have that much choice in where I end up.",7
35486,Penny,18," Yeah, but if I become a successful actress, we wouldn‰Ûªt need the money.",7
35487,Leonard,18," Well, you don‰Ûªt go into science for the money.",7
35488,Bernadette,18," Speak for yourself. Last month, my company both invented and cured Restless Eye Syndrome. Ka-ching, ya blinky chumps.",7
35489,Penny,18," So, wait, if my career took me somewhere else, you might not go?",7
35490,Amy,18," Dun, dun, dun. He started it.",7
35491,Raj,18," Okay, okay, guys, new back stories. Uh, Penny and Leonard, you two lovebirds are super successful and living in New York. Uh, you‰Ûªre an actress, you‰Ûªre a professor and you have three beautiful kids.",7
35492,Leonard,18, Great.,7
35493,Penny,18, Really? You think I‰Ûªm putting this body through three kids?,7
35494,Scene,18, Sheldon‰Ûªs childhood home.,7
35495,Sheldon,18," Okay, let‰Ûªs do this.",7
35496,Howard,18, Good luck.,7
35497,Sheldon,18," You, aren‰Ûªt you gonna come with me?",7
35498,Howard,18, While you confront your mother about her sex life? I‰Ûªd rather go back to that bar in ass-less chaps.,7
35499,Sheldon,18," (Knock, knock, knock) Mother? (Knock, knock, knock) Mother? (Knock, knock, knock) Mother?",7
35500,Mrs Cooper,18," Shelly, I‰Ûªm so glad you‰Ûªre here.",7
35501,Sheldon,18, I saw you having naked sex.,7
35502,Mrs Cooper,18, What are you talking about?,7
35503,Sheldon,18," Earlier, I came here to surprise you. I looked in the window and I saw you with a man.",7
35504,Mrs Cooper,18," Oh, Shelly, I‰Ûªm so sorry. Come in. Um, maybe we should sit down and talk about this.",7
35505,Sheldon,18, Can you recommend a surface you haven‰Ûªt had coitus on?,7
35506,Mrs Cooper,18," That‰Ûªs not funny. Maybe we should sit at the table. Well, I‰Ûªm sure that, uh, you have a lot of questions.",7
35507,Sheldon,18, Who was he?,7
35508,Mrs Cooper,18, His name is Ron. I met him at my prayer group.,7
35509,Sheldon,18, How long have you been involved with him?,7
35510,Mrs Cooper,18, A few months.,7
35511,Sheldon,18," And of those few months, how long have you been a demented sex pervert?",7
35512,Mrs Cooper,18, That is no way to speak to your mother.,7
35513,Sheldon,18," Perhaps not. But it is a way to speak to a woman who quoted the Bible to me my whole life, and then desecrates one of Ethan Allen‰Ûªs finest sofas.",7
35514,Mrs Cooper,18," I will give you one opportunity, young man, to apologize.",7
35515,Sheldon,18, Or what?,7
35516,Mrs Cooper,18, Or I will send you to your room.,7
35517,Sheldon,18, That‰Ûªs ridiculous. I am a grown man. I am a professional scientist. And I currently occupy the moral high ground.,7
35518,Mrs Cooper,18, Go to your room.,7
35519,Sheldon,18, But I occupy the moral high ground.,7
35520,Mrs Cooper,18, Go to your room.,7
35521,Sheldon,18, But I‰Ûªm a professional scientist.,7
35522,Mrs,18, Go to your room!,7
35523,Sheldon,18, I‰Ûªm a grown man.,7
35524,Scene,18, The apartment.,7
35525,Raj,18, Can we please get back to the game?,7
35526,Leonard,18, In a minute. I don‰Ûªt understand why any success you have in acting is more important than any I have in science.,7
35527,Penny,18," Okay, if you do something cool in science, you might change the world. If I become a famous actress, I‰Ûªm not gonna tell you why movie stars are the best. They just are.",7
35528,Amy,18, I‰Ûªm surprised you guys never talked about this stuff.,7
35529,Leonard,18, Like you and Sheldon have everything figured out?,7
35530,Amy,18," Actually, our relationship agreement covers a wide array of scenarios, including career changes, financial instability, intelligent dog uprising. FYI, we plan on selling out the human race hard.",7
35531,Penny,18," In 20 years, who knows what‰Ûªll happen with any of us?",7
35532,Stuart,18, I think you and Leonard will be together.,7
35533,Penny,18, You do?,7
35534,Stuart,18, Yeah. I think you‰Ûªre the best couple I know.,7
35535,Leonard,18, Aw.,7
35536,Penny,18, That‰Ûªs so sweet.,7
35537,Bernadette,18, What the hell?,7
35538,Amy,18, Excuse me?,7
35539,Penny,18," Ah-da-da-da-da, let the dead man talk. So, why do you think that?",7
35540,Stuart,18," Uh, well, I feel like you guys make each other better. Penny brought Leonard out of his shell. And it seems like Leonard makes Penny think more deeply about the world. I don‰Ûªt know. Together, you two kind of make one awesome person.",7
35541,Penny,18," Aw, Stuart. Now I feel bad for murdering you.",7
35542,Raj,18," Oh, come on.",7
35543,Bernadette,18," Penny did it, I win. Suck it, jackasses.",7
35544,Scene,18, Sheldon‰Ûªs old bedroom.,7
35545,Howard,18," Hey, can I come in?",7
35546,Sheldon,18, Apparently any man is welcome in this house. Why not you? I thought you were waiting in the car.,7
35547,Howard,18," That was an hour ago, Sheldon. A Jew sits in front of a house in Texas that long, For Sale signs start to go up. I take it things didn‰Ûªt go smoothly with your mom.",7
35548,Sheldon,18, No. I‰Ûªm not sure how we‰Ûªre going to get past this.,7
35549,Howard,18," You know, I, I sort of went through something like this myself.",7
35550,Sheldon,18," Howard, we‰Ûªve all seen your mother naked. That woman needs to learn how to tie a robe.",7
35551,Howard,18, I‰Ûªm talking about when my mom started seeing someone a couple of years after my dad left.,7
35552,Sheldon,18, I didn‰Ûªt know she did.,7
35553,Howard,18," Yeah, she was dating this guy, and I was kind of a jerk to her about it.",7
35554,Sheldon,18, What did you do?,7
35555,Howard,18," Well, let‰Ûªs just say it was the most vicious bar mitzvah speech in the history of Temple Beth El. Anyway, she broke up with him. And she‰Ûªs basically been alone ever since. She never said it, but I always felt I was the reason why.",7
35556,Sheldon,18," I‰Ûªm sorry. Although, based on your story, you absolutely were the reason why.",7
35557,Howard,18, All I‰Ûªm saying is you might not want to get in the way of your mom‰Ûªs happiness.,7
35558,Sheldon,18, You may have a point. I love my mother. Even if she fornicates like a demonic weasel.,7
35559,Howard,18, And the healing begins.,7
35560,Scene,18, Mrs Cooper‰Ûªs living room.,7
35561,Sheldon,18, Hello.,7
35562,Mrs Cooper,18," Hello. Are you ready to discuss this calmly, like adults?",7
35563,Sheldon,18, I am.,7
35564,Mrs Cooper,18," Shelly, I‰Ûªm sorry that you saw what you saw. I know that this is hard for you.",7
35565,Sheldon,18," I think what most upsets me about it, Mother, is the hypocrisy. Doesn‰Ûªt this contradict all the religious rules you‰Ûªve been espousing your whole life?",7
35566,Mrs Cooper,18," You‰Ûªre right, it does, and it‰Ûªs something that I‰Ûªm struggling with these days.",7
35567,Sheldon,18, Then why are you doing it?,7
35568,Mrs Cooper,18," Because I‰Ûªm not perfect, Shelly. And that man‰Ûªs booty is.",7
35569,Sheldon,18," Well, this is confusing for me. But I don‰Ûªt want to stand in the way of your happiness. So, I‰Ûªll condemn you internally while maintaining an outward appearance of acceptance.",7
35570,Mrs Cooper,18, That is very Christian of you.,7
35571,Sheldon,18," Mother, if you‰Ûªre going to conduct your life in this fashion, then I should let you know that the world has changed since you were a young woman. You know, it‰Ûªs not all sock hops, soda jerks and segregation anymore.",7
35572,Mrs Cooper,18, How old do you think I am?,7
35573,Sheldon,18," My point is that you‰Ûªre going to need to be careful. You used to be protected by your pre-Enlightenment mythology, but now you‰Ûªre going to need a stronger friend named latex.",7
35574,Mrs Cooper,18, Are you having the sex talk with me?,7
35575,Sheldon,18," Well, someone has to.",7
35576,Mrs Cooper,18," Oh, dear Lord.",7
35577,Sheldon,18," No, don‰Ûªt look to Him. He‰Ûªs mad at you right now.",7
35578,Scene,18, The apartment.,7
35579,Penny,18," Oh, come on, don‰Ûªt pout. I‰Ûªm sorry I ruined your game.",7
35580,Raj,18," I‰Ûªm not pouting, I‰Ûªm brooding. Which is how sexy men pout.",7
35581,Amy,18, It actually was kind of fun.,7
35582,Raj,18, You‰Ûªre just saying that.,7
35583,Amy,18, Yeah.,7
35584,Bernadette,18, I liked the time travel element.,7
35585,Raj,18, Thank you. I thought it was inspired.,7
35586,Leonard,18, It was. By Terminator.,7
35587,Bernadette,18," Well, I hope 20 years from now, we really are all still together and still friends.",7
35588,Penny,18, Definitely.,7
35589,Bernadette,18, Aw.,7
35590,Penny,18, I love it.,7
35591,Leonard,18, Putting it in my phone right now.,7
35592,Penny,18," Yeah, me, too.",7
35593,Stuart,18, My phone doesn‰Ûªt have a calendar. So I‰Ûªll just write it on my hand.,7
35594,Raj,18, And it‰Ûªs done.,7
35595,Penny,18," Yup, we‰Ûªre all in.",7
35596,Leonard,18," All right, I‰Ûªll see you guys in 20 years.",7
35597,Scene,18," In front of the building, 20 years later.",7
35598,Stuart,18, I knew it.,7
35599,Scene,19, The apartment.,7
35600,Sheldon,19," Boy, do I have to urinate.",7
35601,Leonard,19, If only there were a solution to that.,7
35602,Sheldon,19, Seriously. I feel like I‰Ûªve got a fish tank in my pelvis.,7
35603,Leonard,19, So go to the bathroom.,7
35604,Sheldon,19, I can‰Ûªt.,7
35605,Leonard,19, Why not?,7
35606,Sheldon,19," Because I‰Ûªm trying to decide between getting an Xbox One or a PS4. Oh, pee, why‰Ûªd I say that?",7
35607,Leonard,19," Forgive me for asking a stupid question, but why are you being stupid?",7
35608,Sheldon,19," I‰Ûªm not being stupid. I‰Ûªm employing the work of Dutch researcher, Mirjam Tuk, who found that people with full bladders make better decisions.",7
35609,Leonard,19, Why did I pee before I decided to move in here?,7
35610,Penny,19, Hi.,7
35611,Leonard,19," Hey. Oh, how‰Ûªd the audition go?",7
35612,Penny,19, I killed it. I was even able to cry real tears right on the spot.,7
35613,Leonard,19," Oh, that‰Ûªs great.",7
35614,Penny,19," I know. Next time I get pulled over for a speeding ticket, here come the waterworks.",7
35615,Sheldon,19, Here come the waterworks.,7
35616,Leonard,19, Aren‰Ûªt you gonna ask?,7
35617,Penny,19," What is this, my first day?",7
35618,Scene,19, Penny‰Ûªs apartment.,7
35619,Bernadette,19, Can I get your opinion on something that happened at work today?,7
35620,Penny,19," Yeah, sure.",7
35621,Amy,19, Of course.,7
35622,Bernadette,19," Okay, well, I did something that will either make me look like a lovable goof or a horrible monster damned to spend eternity in hell.",7
35623,Amy,19, I‰Ûªm sure it‰Ûªs lovable.,7
35624,Penny,19, I‰Ûªm gonna go with monster. What do you got?,7
35625,Bernadette,19," Well, there‰Ûªs this lady in our office who‰Ûªs retiring, and they were passing around one of those big cards for us to sign.",7
35626,Amy,19, Okay.,7
35627,Bernadette,19, But no one told me she was in a horrible car accident over the weekend and what I was signing was not a retirement card but was actually a get well card.,7
35628,Penny,19, I‰Ûªm liking my odds here.,7
35629,Bernadette,19," So on the card, in the hospital, next to the woman who‰Ûªs clinging to life are the words, ‰ÛÏHey, Vivian. You deserve this. And at least with you gone, no one will steal my yoghurt out of the fridge.‰Û",7
35630,Penny,19, No.,7
35631,Bernadette,19, ‰ÛÏLOL.‰Û Smiley face.,7
35632,Amy,19," Oh, my gosh.",7
35633,Bernadette,19, ‰ÛÏP.S. Good luck wherever you wind up.‰Û,7
35634,Penny,19," Oh. Why didn‰Ûªt I put money on this? (Phone rings) Hey, that‰Ûªs my agent. If I got the part, it‰Ûªs still the second best thing I‰Ûªve heard all day. Hello?",7
35635,Bernadette,19, Am I a terrible person?,7
35636,Amy,19," No. No, it was a mistake.",7
35637,Bernadette,19, Am I a terrible person that it crossed my mind that she might die and never see the card?,7
35638,Amy,19, Now I think you‰Ûªre flirting with the line. Good news?,7
35639,Penny,19," No, I didn‰Ûªt get it.",7
35640,Bernadette,19, I‰Ûªm so sorry.,7
35641,Amy,19, You‰Ûªll get offered something soon.,7
35642,Penny,19," I kind of did. The part in that awful horror movie I passed on came back around. Apparently, it‰Ûªs mine if I want it.",7
35643,Bernadette,19, Are you gonna take it?,7
35644,Penny,19, I don‰Ûªt know what to do.,7
35645,Amy,19," Maybe you‰Ûªll get hit by a car and die. LOL, right?",7
35646,Scene,19, A coffee shop.,7
35647,Raj,19," Hey. Emily, right?",7
35648,Emily,19, Yeah.,7
35649,Raj,19," I, I don‰Ûªt know if you remember me.",7
35650,Emily,19," From the dating Web site. Your friend e-mailed me because you were afraid to, then you tracked me down and acted like a lunatic?",7
35651,Raj,19," Yes, Rajesh Koothrappali. Look, uh, I just, I wanted to say I‰Ûªm sorry. Okay? You were, like, the coolest person I ever found online, and I got really nervous and I, I just blew it.",7
35652,Emily,19," Uh, don‰Ûªt worry about it. And if it makes you feel any better, you‰Ûªre not the weirdest guy I‰Ûªve met off the Internet.",7
35653,Raj,19," Well, give me a chance, you don‰Ûªt even know me.",7
35654,Emily,19," All right, here‰Ûªs your chance.",7
35655,Raj,19," Ah, really? Thank you. Fate has given me a rare second chance, and I swear to Vishnu I‰Ûªm not gonna blow it. Or normal words followed by a charming smile.",7
35656,Scene,19, Amy‰Ûªs apartment.,7
35657,Sheldon,19," So, first there was PlayStation, aka PS1, then PS2, PS3 and now PS4. And that makes sense. You‰Ûªd think after Xbox, there‰Ûªd be Xbox 2. But no, next came Xbox 360. Hmm? And now, after 360, comes Xbox One. Why one? Maybe that‰Ûªs how many seconds of thought they put into naming it.",7
35658,Amy,19," Can you get the butter, please?",7
35659,Sheldon,19," You know, however, with the Xbox One, I can control my entire entertainment system using voice commands. Up until now, I‰Ûªve had to use Leonard.",7
35660,Amy,19, Then get the other one. Pass the butter.,7
35661,Sheldon,19, Get? Hang on. I don‰Ûªt feel like you‰Ûªre taking this dilemma seriously.,7
35662,Amy,19," Fine, Sheldon. You have my undivided attention.",7
35663,Sheldon,19," Okay, now, the PS4 is more angular and sleek-looking.",7
35664,Amy,19, No way.,7
35665,Sheldon,19," Yeah, well, it‰Ûªs true. But the larger size of the Xbox One may keep it from overheating.",7
35666,Amy,19," Well, you wouldn‰Ûªt want your gaming system to overheat.",7
35667,Sheldon,19," No, see? Well, you absolutely would not. And furthermore, the Xbox One now comes with a Kinect included.",7
35668,Amy,19, Included?,7
35669,Sheldon,19," Yes. Not sold separately. Although the PS4 uses cool new GDDR5 RAM, while the Xbox One is still using the conventional DDR3 memory.",7
35670,Amy,19, Why would they still be using DDR3? Are they nuts?,7
35671,Sheldon,19, See? That‰Ûªs what I thought. But then they go and throw in an ESRAM buffer.,7
35672,Amy,19," Whoa, whoa. Wait a second. Who‰Ûªs they?",7
35673,Sheldon,19, Xbox.,7
35674,Amy,19, You‰Ûªre kidding.,7
35675,Sheldon,19," No, I am not. And this ESRAM buffer should totally bridge the 100-gigabit-per-second bandwidth gap between the two RAM types.",7
35676,Amy,19, This is a nightmare. How will you ever make a decision?,7
35677,Amy,19, Please pass the butter!,7
35678,Scene,19, Penny‰Ûªs apartment.,7
35679,Penny,19," Okay, it‰Ûªs not me, right? This script is terrible.",7
35680,Penny,19," Okay. (Reading) Sometimes I feel like I can control the killer gorilla instinct inside of me, but then I see these bananas and I just want to eat them and then kill people. What am I gonna do?",7
35681,Leonard,19," Well, for starters, I wouldn‰Ûªt eat the bananas.",7
35682,Penny,19," No, come on. This is serious.",7
35683,Leonard,19," Uh, uh, does it at least pay well?",7
35684,Penny,19, Less than I was making at The Cheesecake Factory.,7
35685,Leonard,19, What does your agent think?,7
35686,Penny,19, She‰Ûªs thinking of taking a job at The Cheesecake Factory.,7
35687,Leonard,19," You know what, why don‰Ûªt you just do it? You‰Ûªll go have fun for a few weeks, make some money, and who knows what it might lead to?",7
35688,Penny,19," Okay, look, here, page 58. I oil-wrestle an orang-utan in a bikini.",7
35689,Leonard,19," Just to clarify, which one of you is wearing the bikini?",7
35690,Penny,19, Both of us.,7
35691,Leonard,19, So it‰Ûªs a family film.,7
35692,Scene,19, Amy‰Ûªs apartment. ,7
35693,Sheldon,19, Thank you again for dinner.,7
35694,Amy,19, You‰Ûªre welcome.,7
35695,Sheldon,19, Good night.,7
35696,Amy,19," Uh, it‰Ûªs date night. Aren‰Ûªt you, uh, forgetting something?",7
35697,Sheldon,19," Oh, of course. (They kiss) Did I mention the PS4 controllers light up?",7
35698,Amy,19, No.,7
35699,Sheldon,19," Well, they do.",7
35700,Scene,19, The apartment. ,7
35701,Raj,19," And then after coffee, we went for a walk and she told me she always thought people from India were exotic and mysterious. So, with my mouth, I said, we‰Ûªre just like anybody else, but with my eyes, I said, straight up, Red, hop on my flying carpet.",7
35702,Leonard,19," So, are you gonna see her again?",7
35703,Raj,19," Yeah, we have plans this weekend. And if it‰Ûªs a clear night, I‰Ûªm gonna lay some romantic astronomy on her.",7
35704,Penny,19," Okay, like what? Show me.",7
35705,Raj,19, I can‰Ûªt do that to Leonard. This is some powerful panty-dropping stuff.,7
35706,Leonard,19, You have my blessing. Go for it.,7
35707,Raj,19," Okay. Penny, two of the brightest stars in the night sky are Altair and Vega. And it is said they were deeply in love but forever separated by the celestial river of the Milky Way.",7
35708,Penny,19," Oh, that‰Ûªs sad.",7
35709,Raj,19," It is. But once a year, on the seventh day of the seventh month, Vega cries so hard that all the magpies in the world fly up and create a bridge with their wings so the two lovers can be together for a single night of passion.",7
35710,Penny,19, Wow.,7
35711,Leonard,19," Okay, that‰Ûªs enough.",7
35712,Sheldon,19," Quick poll, PS4 or Xbox One? Raj?",7
35713,Raj,19," Uh, Xbox One.",7
35714,Sheldon,19, Penny?,7
35715,Penny,19, Huh?,7
35716,Sheldon,19, Leonard?,7
35717,Leonard,19, PS4.,7
35718,Sheldon,19, Wolowitz?,7
35719,Howard,19, Both great.,7
35720,Sheldon,19, Bernadette?,7
35721,Bernadette,19, I like the Wii.,7
35722,Sheldon,19," Thanks, Grandma.",7
35723,Raj,19," Oh, my goodness.",7
35724,Leonard,19, What‰Ûªs up?,7
35725,Raj,19, I just got an e-mail from my ex-girlfriend Lucy. She misses me and wants to get together.,7
35726,Leonard,19," Two women at the same time? Nice job, playa.",7
35727,Penny,19, Really?,7
35728,Leonard,19, Was it the two women thing or the playa? It was the playa.,7
35729,Scene,19," The same, later.",7
35730,Raj,19, What am I supposed to do? How am I supposed to choose between Emily and Lucy?,7
35731,Howard,19, Why do you have to choose? Date both of them.,7
35732,Raj,19," I can‰Ûªt date two women at once. Zero women, that‰Ûªs my sweet spot.",7
35733,Penny,19," Unless you‰Ûªre sleeping with one of them, seeing other people isn‰Ûªt a big deal.",7
35734,Raj,19," But what if one of them asks me what I was up to the night before and I was with the other one? Then, what, do I lie?",7
35735,Howard and Bernadette (together),19, Yes.,7
35736,Bernadette,19," What do you mean, yes?",7
35737,Howard,19," What do you mean, yes?",7
35738,Bernadette,19, Were you seeing other women when we started dating?,7
35739,Howard,19, No. Were you seeing other men?,7
35740,Bernadette,19, No.,7
35741,Leonard,19, Were you seeing other men?,7
35742,Penny,19, No.,7
35743,Leonard,19, Aren‰Ûªt you gonna ask me?,7
35744,Penny,19," Come on, really?",7
35745,Scene,19, A coffee shop.,7
35746,Leonard,19, Thank you so much for letting us pick your brain.,7
35747,Wil Wheaton,19," Yeah, happy to help. So, what‰Ûªs going on?",7
35748,Penny,19," Well, I‰Ûªm having an impossible time getting my career off the ground, and I got offered a role in this crappy horror movie, and I just don‰Ûªt know if I should take it.",7
35749,Wil,19," Well, I have certainly taken some jobs that I‰Ûªve been embarrassed by.",7
35750,Penny,19, I wouldn‰Ûªt exactly call Star Trek embarrassing.,7
35751,Wil,19, I wasn‰Ûªt.,7
35752,Penny,19," Me, either.",7
35753,Leonard,19," So, what do you think, is there a professional downside to doing it?",7
35754,Wil,19," Well, it‰Ûªs tricky. You want to take projects that you‰Ûªre excited about, but sometimes you also have to pay the bills. When you‰Ûªre on the set working on something that you just know in your heart is bad, not Star Trek.",7
35755,Penny,19," Yeah, beam me up. I love it.",7
35756,Wil,19," Anyway, those jobs can be soul-crushing.",7
35757,Penny,19, That‰Ûªs what I‰Ûªm afraid of.,7
35758,Wil,19," So, I was in Stand By Me when I was a kid, and it was a huge success. The terrible movies I did came after that. I mean, imagine how that feels.",7
35759,Leonard,19, Sounds rough.,7
35760,Wil,19," I‰Ûªm telling you, this business is brutal. To this day, I hate going on auditions. Okay, I walk in, and I can just feel them thinking, he was such a cute kid, what happened to him? And then I don‰Ûªt get the job, and I can never find out why. Honestly, I get so depressed, there are entire weeks that I can‰Ûªt even get out of bed.",7
35761,Leonard,19," Okay, this was helpful.",7
35762,Scene,19, The stairwell.,7
35763,Raj,19, Any news on your co-worker who‰Ûªs in the hospital?,7
35764,Bernadette,19," Poor thing, she was in surgery for 18 hours. She‰Ûªs alive, but she‰Ûªs still in critical condition.",7
35765,Raj,19," Oh, no.",7
35766,Bernadette,19," The one bit of good news is they put her in a medically induced coma before she read the card. So, you know, silver linings.",7
35767,Howard,19, Were you like this when I married you?,7
35768,Scene,19, The apartment. ,7
35769,Leonard (on phone),19," Don‰Ûªt worry about it, buddy. Okay, bye. That was Wil, he‰Ûªs feeling a lot better. Apparently, he‰Ûªs 12-down in the TV Guide crossword puzzle.",7
35770,Raj,19, Did he help you make a decision about the movie?,7
35771,Penny,19, No. Did you figure out what you‰Ûªre gonna do about the two girls?,7
35772,Raj,19," As a matter of fact, I did. I‰Ûªve spent so many years living in fear, saying no to new experiences, but from now on, I‰Ûªm gonna say yes, yes to love, yes to adventure, yes to life. Whatever it may be, the answer‰Ûªs going to be yes.",7
35773,Howard,19," He‰Ûªs gonna die alone, right?",7
35774,Leonard,19, Yes.,7
35775,Penny,19, Yes.,7
35776,Bernadette,19, Yes.,7
35777,Scene,19, An electrical store.,7
35778,Amy,19," I‰Ûªm proud of you, Sheldon.",7
35779,Sheldon,19," You know, I‰Ûªm proud of me, too. I‰Ûªve done all my research, I conducted an informal poll, and I‰Ûªve arrived at the rock-solid certainty I‰Ûªve made the right choice.",7
35780,Amy,19," Well, that‰Ûªs got to be a good feeling.",7
35781,Sheldon,19," Oh, it is. Although.",7
35782,Amy,19," Oh, crap.",7
35783,Sheldon,19, I had the same feeling when I made my dad buy a Betamax instead of a VHS.,7
35784,Amy,19, You were just a little kid.,7
35785,Sheldon,19," Yeah, a little kid who picked the wrong format to record The MacNeil/Lehrer Report. Now I also was certain that HD DVD would win out over Blu-ray.",7
35786,Amy,19, How old were you then?,7
35787,Sheldon,19," Old enough to know better. You know, and now that I think about it, I stood in front of a case of iPods and I bought a Zune.",7
35788,Amy,19, What‰Ûªs a Zune?,7
35789,Sheldon,19," Yeah, exactly. It‰Ûªs an MP3 player brought to us by the makers of Xbox.",7
35790,Amy,19," No, what are you doing? No, no, pick that back up. You know it‰Ûªs good. You did the research.",7
35791,Sheldon,19, But what if I‰Ûªm wrong?,7
35792,Amy,19, You know what? How about I buy it for you? How about I buy you both?,7
35793,Sheldon,19, You know I only have one slot available in my entertainment centre.,7
35794,Amy,19, Then I‰Ûªll buy you a new entertainment centre.,7
35795,Sheldon,19," Well, yeah, okay, sure. But which one?",7
35796,Amy,19," How about this? I‰Ûªve heard that if you flip a coin, it will tell you how you actually feel. Because you‰Ûªll either be disappointed or excited by the outcome.",7
35797,Sheldon,19, Interesting.,7
35798,Amy,19," So, heads it‰Ûªs PS4, tails it‰Ûªs Xbox One.",7
35799,Sheldon,19," All right, I‰Ûªll try.",7
35800,Amy,19, What is it?,7
35801,Sheldon,19, A quarter.,7
35802,Amy,19, Could have given it back to me. That was a choice.,7
35803,Scene,19, A restaurant.,7
35804,Raj,19," You look, you look really pretty tonight.",7
35805,Emily,19, Thanks. I love that jacket.,7
35806,Raj,19," Thank you. Thanks, thanks. I‰Ûªm sorry. I can‰Ûªt do this. My, my ex-girlfriend e-mailed me, and I‰Ûªm seeing her Saturday, And I‰Ûªm glad you like it, it‰Ûªs from J. Crew.",7
35807,Emily,19, I don‰Ûªt understand.,7
35808,Raj,19," My friends told me it was okay to see more than one person at a time, but it, it feels like I‰Ûªm being deceitful.",7
35809,Emily,19, Are you getting back together with her?,7
35810,Raj,19," No. I, I have no idea. What would you do?",7
35811,Emily,19," Uh, usually on first dates, I talk about music and stuff, but I was promised weird, so let‰Ûªs do this. How serious were you two?",7
35812,Raj,19," Well, to be honest, we only went on four dates, hugged twice, kissed once, and there was a handshake loaded with sexual innuendo.",7
35813,Emily,19," Wait, so, a girl you never slept with sent you an e-mail and you felt so guilty about it that you had to tell me?",7
35814,Raj,19, Yeah.,7
35815,Emily,19, That‰Ûªs kind of adorable.,7
35816,Raj,19," Are you, are you sure? Because this is the part of the night where I‰Ûªve said something stupid and the girl usually leaves.",7
35817,Emily,19, I‰Ûªm still here.,7
35818,Raj,19," Yeah, but now you make me wonder what‰Ûªs wrong with you.",7
35819,Emily,19, We just met. You don‰Ûªt need to tell me about other people you‰Ûªre seeing.,7
35820,Raj,19, Really? Because I‰Ûªm dating two women is basically the only cool thing I can say about myself.,7
35821,Scene,19, The electrical store.,7
35822,Sheldon,19," On the one hand, the Xbox One has a better camera, but the PS4 has a removable hard drive. Thoughts?",7
35823,Amy,19, I can‰Ûªt feel my legs.,7
35824,Store assistant,19," Oh, I‰Ûªm sorry, guys, but the store closed five minutes ago.",7
35825,Sheldon,19, But I haven‰Ûªt decided yet.,7
35826,Store assistant,19, You‰Ûªll have to come back tomorrow. The registers are closed.,7
35827,Amy,19," Let‰Ûªs get you some food. You, You‰Ûªll feel better after you eat.",7
35828,Sheldon,19, Okay.,7
35829,Amy,19," What-what do you want, like, Thai food? A burger?",7
35830,Sheldon,19," I don‰Ûªt know. Hey, look, a quarter.",7
35831,Scene,19, A film set. Penny is being fitted with gorilla hands.,7
35832,Costume guy,19, How‰Ûªs that feel?,7
35833,Penny,19, Great. Not like regret at all.,7
35834,Wil,19, Penny? We‰Ûªre working together. Awesome.,7
35835,Scene,20, The cafeteria.,7
35836,Leonard,20," I got to tell you, the more I read about the primordial gravity wave discovery, the more excited I get.",7
35837,Raj,20, I know. Being an astrophysicist right now is like being a rock star.,7
35838,Howard,20, Only without the sex.,7
35839,Raj,20," Yeah, literally, none of it.",7
35840,Leonard,20," What do you think about it, Sheldon?",7
35841,Sheldon,20, Meh.,7
35842,Raj,20," Are you kidding me? This may be the biggest scientific breakthrough of our lifetime. How can you, as a theoretical physicist, not care about this?",7
35843,Sheldon,20," Maybe it‰Ûªs because I‰Ûªm not an elitist. What I‰Ûªd like to know is, how does this gravity wave breakthrough help the man on the street? You know? Who‰Ûªs looking out for Joe six-pack and all his quantum physics concerns?",7
35844,Leonard,20," Oh, my God, you‰Ûªre jealous.",7
35845,Sheldon,20, Why would I be jealous?,7
35846,Leonard,20," Oh, I don‰Ûªt know. Maybe because the origin of the universe just got proven, the Higgs field just got proven, and you‰Ûªve been working on string theory for the last 20 years and you‰Ûªre no closer to proving it than when you started.",7
35847,Sheldon,20," Yeah, well, I‰Ûªve had a lot on my plate. We happen to live in a golden age of television.",7
35848,Barry,20," Excuse me, fewwas. Sowwy for eavesdwopping, but there actually was some big stwing theowy news today out of the Hadwon Cowwider.",7
35849,Sheldon,20, Really? Did they find evidence to support extra dimensions or supersymmetry?,7
35850,Barry,20," No, but they did find evidence that you‰Ûªll bewieve anything.",7
35851,Sheldon,20, Why would you do that? You‰Ûªre a string theorist as well.,7
35852,Barry,20," Incowwect. I am a stwing pwagmatist. I say I‰Ûªm gonna pwove something that cannot be pwoved, I appwy for gwant money, and then I spend it on wiquor and bwoads. Water.",7
35853,Sheldon,20, Do you think he‰Ûªs right? Am I wasting my life on a theory that can never be proven?,7
35854,Howard,20, Maybe. But how great is Game of Thrones?,7
35855,Scene,20, The apartment.,7
35856,Penny,20," Hey, you‰Ûªre up early.",7
35857,Sheldon,20, I couldn‰Ûªt sleep.,7
35858,Penny,20, I told you those Walking Dead pillowcases were a bad idea.,7
35859,Sheldon,20," No, that‰Ûªs not it.",7
35860,Penny,20, Is something bothering you?,7
35861,Sheldon,20," Yes, but you wouldn‰Ûªt understand.",7
35862,Penny,20," Oh, come on, try me.",7
35863,Sheldon,20," All right. I‰Ûªve devoted the prime of my life to string theory and its quest for the compactification of extra dimensions. I‰Ûªve got nothing to show for it, and I feel like a fool.",7
35864,Penny,20," Okay. I get it. I mean, not all the jibberjabber in the middle, but I know what it‰Ûªs like to put your heart and soul into something and get nothing out of it.",7
35865,Sheldon,20, You mean your acting career?,7
35866,Penny,20, No.,7
35867,Sheldon,20, Your relationship with Leonard?,7
35868,Penny,20, No.,7
35869,Sheldon,20, Your failed attempt to go back to college?,7
35870,Penny,20," No. I‰Ûªm saying you and string theory sound like a relationship, and I know what it‰Ûªs like to be in one and realize it‰Ûªs never gonna turn out the way you want.",7
35871,Sheldon,20," I said Leonard, you said no.",7
35872,Penny,20, I‰Ûªm talking about other guys.,7
35873,Sheldon,20," Okay. Well, what do you do?",7
35874,Penny,20," You have to have the courage to end the relationship. You know? Break it off, shake hands, walk away.",7
35875,Sheldon,20, I don‰Ûªt know if I can do that.,7
35876,Penny,20," I know it‰Ûªs hard, honey, but in the end, that‰Ûªs how you grow.",7
35877,Leonard,20," Penny, have you seen my good inhaler?",7
35878,Sheldon,20," Break it off, shake hands, walk away.",7
35879,Scene,20, The cafeteria.,7
35880,Leonard,20," Hey, how‰Ûªs dating two women going?",7
35881,Raj,20," Um, kind of hit a bump. When I was honest and told Emily she wasn‰Ûªt the only person I was seeing, it went great. So I tried the same thing with Lucy.",7
35882,Howard,20, And?,7
35883,Raj,20," She had mixed feelings. But when I said, Emily was cool with it. Emily‰Ûªs the best. Why can‰Ûªt you",7
35884,Leonard,20, Women. Who knows what‰Ûªll set ‰Ûªem off?,7
35885,Raj,20, At least now I can focus all my energies on just one girl.,7
35886,Howard,20, I hope I get to meet her as soon as possible.,7
35887,Raj,20, Why the rush? She isn‰Ûªt going anywhere.,7
35888,Howard,20, She is. But I like that attitude.,7
35889,Sheldon,20," Gentlemen, is anybody interested in my old string theory books?",7
35890,Raj,20, You‰Ûªre really going to do this?,7
35891,Sheldon,20," I am. Yeah, Penny pointed out that what I‰Ûªm going through is essentially a breakup. And according to Cosmopolitan magazine, one of the most effective techniques for moving on is to get rid of all reminders of the relationship.",7
35892,Howard,20, You‰Ûªre reading Cosmo?,7
35893,Sheldon,20," Yes. As it turns out, there‰Ûªs an article on how to get over a breakup in literally every issue. Anyway, it suggests that I set these on fire, but the smell of burning books reminds me of church picnics in East Texas.",7
35894,Howard,20, What‰Ûªs this?,7
35895,Sheldon,20," Oh, that‰Ûªs just a doodle of a hyperelliptic Riemann surface.",7
35896,Leonard,20," Oh, yeah. Wasn‰Ûªt that the basis of your postdoc fellowship?",7
35897,Sheldon,20," It was. This seemed so elegant at the time, but now I realize I was just a simple country boy seduced by a big city theory with variables in all the right places.",7
35898,Raj,20, It‰Ûªs going to be okay.,7
35899,Sheldon,20," I know. As hard as this is, I have to move on. I can‰Ûªt keep postulating multidimensional entities and get nothing in return. I have needs, too.",7
35900,Howard,20," So, you and Emily still together?",7
35901,Scene,20, Raj‰Ûªs apartment.,7
35902,Howard,20, I spoke to Bernadette. She‰Ûªs free tomorrow night.,7
35903,Raj,20," Oh, okay, great. But if we‰Ûªre really gonna do a double date, then we have to go over some ground rules about Emily.",7
35904,Howard,20," Like when it turns out she‰Ûªs made of rubber, I don‰Ûªt say anything?",7
35905,Raj,20, She‰Ûªs very real.,7
35906,Howard,20," Oh, that‰Ûªs what it says on the box. Right next to dishwasher safe.",7
35907,Raj,20, See? This is exactly the kind of thing I‰Ûªm worried about you saying in front of her.,7
35908,Howard,20, I promise I‰Ûªll be on my best behaviour.,7
35909,Raj,20, You better be. No jokes about how close I am with my dog. Or the truth about how close I am with my dog.,7
35910,Howard,20, You got it.,7
35911,Raj,20, No jokes about the year I took ballet.,7
35912,Howard,20, You took ballet?,7
35913,Raj,20," God, you never listen.",7
35914,Scene,20, The apartment.,7
35915,Leonard,20, Are you sure you want to do this?,7
35916,Sheldon,20, The magazine articles suggest that one of the ways to get over a breakup is a new look.,7
35917,Leonard,20," What about your old look, well-groomed ventriloquist doll?",7
35918,Penny (treating Sheldon as a ventriloquist doll),20," Oh my God, I do look like that.",7
35919,Sheldon,20, You stop it.,7
35920,Penny,20," So, how do you want me to cut it?",7
35921,Sheldon,20," Oh, how about Bill Gates meets Nikola Tesla?",7
35922,Leonard,20," So, business in the front, science in the back.",7
35923,Penny,20, Or I don‰Ûªt cut it and maybe just style it a little.,7
35924,Sheldon,20," Oh, I‰Ûªm in your hands. Do a good job and I‰Ûªll tell you Cosmo‰Ûªs ten dynamite tips to enjoy your PMS.",7
35925,Penny,20, Can you keep him quiet? Maybe jangle some keys in front of him?,7
35926,Leonard,20," That doesn‰Ûªt work any more. He just thinks I‰Ûªm taking him to the doctor. So, now that you‰Ûªre no longer invested in string theory, what are you gonna pursue?",7
35927,Sheldon,20," Oh, there are so many exciting areas. Black holes, dark matter.",7
35928,Penny,20," Oh, Leonard was telling me about dark matter, but I didn‰Ûªt really understand it.",7
35929,Sheldon,20, Don‰Ûªt feel bad. Neither does he.,7
35930,Penny,20," Okay, what do you think?",7
35931,Sheldon,20, Have you ever even seen a picture of Tesla?,7
35932,Leonard,20," It actually looks good, Sheldon.",7
35933,Penny,20, Doesn‰Ûªt it?,7
35934,Leonard,20, Yeah.,7
35935,Sheldon,20," I suppose I could see myself in a scientific boy band. Of course, I‰Ûªd be the dreamy one and the smart one.",7
35936,Amy,20, Sorry I‰Ûªm late. What did you do?,7
35937,Penny,20," I gave him a new look. It‰Ûªs cute, huh?",7
35938,Amy,20," Yeah, it‰Ûªs cute. That‰Ûªs the problem. I don‰Ûªt need other girls to see him walking around like sex on a stick.",7
35939,Sheldon,20, She‰Ûªs right. I‰Ûªm too hot.,7
35940,Scene,20, A restaurant.,7
35941,Bernadette,20, I‰Ûªm excited to meet Emily.,7
35942,Howard,20," Me, too. I just hope he doesn‰Ûªt blow it.",7
35943,Bernadette,20, Why would you say that?,7
35944,Howard,20," Because he‰Ûªs Raj, that‰Ûªs his thing. Beckham can bend it, Ralph can wreck it, Raj can blow it. Look, I don‰Ûªt want it to happen, but odds are he‰Ûªs gonna find a way to‰Û_ Oh, crap, I know that girl.",7
35945,Bernadette,20, How?,7
35946,Howard,20," In a bad way, very bad.",7
35947,Raj,20," Hey, guys.",7
35948,Howard,20," Whatever you hear tonight, just remember I love you. Hey.",7
35949,Raj,20," Emily, these are my good friends, Howard and Bernadette. Guys, this is Emily.",7
35950,Emily,20, Nice to meet you.,7
35951,Bernadette,20, Hi.,7
35952,Emily,20, Have we met before?,7
35953,Howard,20," Uh, no. I, I don‰Ûªt, I don‰Ûªt think so.",7
35954,Emily,20, You sure? You look familiar.,7
35955,Howard,20," Well, you sure don‰Ûªt. You I know, you I know, you? Total stranger. Even if you had yummy candy, I would not get in your van.",7
35956,Emily,20, Did you go to that spin class on Green Street?,7
35957,Howard,20, That must be it.,7
35958,Raj,20, Since when do you go to spin class?,7
35959,Howard,20, Wow. Now who doesn‰Ûªt listen?,7
35960,Scene,20, The apartment.,7
35961,Amy,20," Sheldon, your food‰Ûªs getting cold. What are you doing?",7
35962,Sheldon,20," Oh, looking through my textbooks for a new field of inquiry. Why do we have a geology book? Leonard, did you throw a children‰Ûªs party while I was in Texas?",7
35963,Penny,20, Wait. What‰Ûªs wrong with geology?,7
35964,Sheldon,20," Let me put this in a way you‰Ûªll understand, Penny. You remember how you explained to me that the Kardashians aren‰Ûªt real celebrities? Well, geology is the Kardashians of science.",7
35965,Sheldon,20, Have you considered studying standard model physics?,7
35966,Sheldon,20," You want me to give up string theory for something that‰Ûªs less advanced? You know, why don‰Ûªt you break up with Penny and start dating a brown bear?",7
35967,Penny,20, Like you could get a brown bear.,7
35968,Leonard,20," Hey, I‰Ûªve got a good job. I could buy salmon. You don‰Ûªt know.",7
35969,Amy,20, Maybe you could make your new field of study the calculation of nuclear matrix elements.,7
35970,Sheldon,20," Oh, please. If I wanted to take up a fad, I‰Ûªd get a tramp stamp.",7
35971,Leonard,20, What about loop quantum gravity?,7
35972,Sheldon,20," Oh, Duchess, look at me. My quantum gravity‰Ûªs positively loopy.",7
35973,Penny,20, Who‰Ûªs the duchess?,7
35974,Leonard,20, One of the people that lives in his head.,7
35975,Amy,20, I hope he‰Ûªs this distraught if he ever breaks up with me.,7
35976,Leonard,20," Well, if he does, I‰Ûªll see if my bear has a friend.",7
35977,Penny,20," Sheldon, have you ever considered not rushing into something new? I mean, why don‰Ûªt you take your time, enjoy your freedom? Maybe something new to study will find you.",7
35978,Sheldon,20," That‰Ûªs actually not bad advice. You know, I didn‰Ûªt seek out string theory. It just hit me over the head one day.",7
35979,Amy,20, How does that happen?,7
35980,Sheldon,20, A bully chased me through the school library and hit me over the head with the biggest book he could find.,7
35981,Penny,20," Okay, how about we toast your newfound freedom?",7
35982,Sheldon,20," Ah, normally I refrain from alcohol, but since my cerebral cortex is twiddling its proverbial thumbs, why not soak it in grape juice that‰Ûªs been predigested by a fungus?",7
35983,Penny,20, And you wonder why other children beat you with books. Cheers!,7
35984,Scene,20, The restaurant.,7
35985,Bernadette,20," Emily, what do you do?",7
35986,Emily,20, I‰Ûªm a dermatology resident at Huntington Hospital.,7
35987,Raj,20," Mmm, and you know what that means. Someone‰Ûªs skin‰Ûªs about to be softer than ever.",7
35988,Emily,20, This is making me crazy. I know I know you from somewhere.,7
35989,Raj,20," Oh, uh, Howard was an astronaut. Maybe that‰Ûªs where you saw him.",7
35990,Emily,20, Wow. That‰Ûªs amazing. What was that like?,7
35991,Howard,20," It was the most incredible experience of my life. Up there in the space station, you‰Ûªre‰Û_",7
35992,Emily,20," Oh, my God, I remember.",7
35993,Howard,20, Can I finish my astronaut story?,7
35994,Emily,20, It was four years ago.,7
35995,Howard,20, Please don‰Ûªt say it.,7
35996,Emily,20, We were set up on a blind date.,7
35997,Howard,20, Please don‰Ûªt say it.,7
35998,Emily,20, You came to my apartment.,7
35999,Howard,20, You‰Ûªre saying it.,7
36000,Raj,20," Wh, what happened?",7
36001,Bernadette,20," Yeah, what happened?",7
36002,Howard,20," Okay, I‰Ûªll say it. I was on the way to pick her up. My stomach felt a little funny. When I got there, I asked if I could use her bathroom.",7
36003,Bernadette,20, Please don‰Ûªt say it.,7
36004,Howard,20," One roll of toilet paper and 20 minutes later, I was so humiliated, I snuck out the window and never saw her again.",7
36005,Emily,20," You know what else I never saw again, my security deposit.",7
36006,Howard,20," I‰Ûªm sorry. I tried to unclog it, but you didn‰Ûªt have a plunger, and water was spilling out everywhere.",7
36007,Emily,20," Right, just water.",7
36008,Howard,20," Look, I have felt terrible about this for years, and I‰Ûªm glad I have the opportunity to tell you just how sorry I am.",7
36009,Emily,20, It‰Ûªs fine. All my friends love this story. They call you Clogzilla.,7
36010,Raj,20, Get it? Because you clogged up her bathroom like a radioactive monster!,7
36011,Howard,20," Yeah, yeah, I get it.",7
36012,Bernadette,20, Howie.,7
36013,Howard,20," Well, hey, it‰Ûªs not like cotton candy comes out of you.",7
36014,Scene,20, The apartment.,7
36015,Amy,20," Come on, let‰Ûªs get you to bed. You‰Ûªve had a lot to drink.",7
36016,Sheldon,20, No more than Penny.,7
36017,Amy,20, That‰Ûªs what I‰Ûªm saying.,7
36018,Sheldon,20," Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. (Knock, knock, knock) Empty room. (Knock, knock, knock) Empty room. (Knock, knock, knock) Empty room. If somebody says come in, I‰Ûªm gonna freak out.",7
36019,Scene,20, The restaurant.,7
36020,Bernadette,20," So, Emily, why did you decide to specialize in dermatology?",7
36021,Emily,20," I like cutting people with knives, and all the other jobs where you get to do that are illegal.",7
36022,Bernadette,20," You‰Ûªre kidding, right?",7
36023,Raj,20," She‰Ûªs scary, but it‰Ûªs a cute scary.",7
36024,Howard,20," Can I say just one more thing? I had some kind of food poisoning that day. Sure, in retrospect, gas station sushi, maybe not the best choice. Nor was climbing out your window and running away. But I think we can all understand how humiliating that was, and I‰Ûªd really appreciate it if we could move on.",7
36025,Bernadette,20," Howie, we moved on a long time ago.",7
36026,Howard,20, I‰Ûªm just saying‰Û_,7
36027,Bernadette,20, We moved on.,7
36028,Howard,20, Okay. Fine.,7
36029,Bernadette,20, How‰Ûªs your soup?,7
36030,Howard,20," Ah, it‰Ûªs all right. They could‰Ûªve filled the bowl a little more. Excuse me.",7
36031,Bernadette,20, Where are you going?,7
36032,Howard,20, I need some fresh air.,7
36033,Emily,20, Been there.,7
36034,Scene,20," Sheldon, waking up in bed next to a Geology book.",7
36035,Sheldon,20," Oh, no. What have I done?",7
36036,Scene,20, The apartment.,7
36037,Leonard,20, How you feeling?,7
36038,Sheldon,20, Not so good.,7
36039,Leonard,20, Are you gonna introduce me to your friend?,7
36040,Sheldon,20, It‰Ûªs not my friend. Nothing happened.,7
36041,Leonard,20, I don‰Ûªt know. I heard you reading pretty loud last night.,7
36042,Sheldon,20," Oh, dear Lord. Where‰Ûªs Amy?",7
36043,Leonard,20," After she put you to bed, she went home.",7
36044,Sheldon,20," Oh. I should call her and apologize. Oh, no.",7
36045,Leonard,20, What?,7
36046,Sheldon,20," Apparently, I called Stephen Hawking last night.",7
36047,Scene,20, Stephen Hawking‰Ûªs office.,7
36048,Answerphone,20, First new message.,7
36049,Sheldon (voice),20," Hawkman. It‰Ûªs your old buddy Sheldonoscopy. How come you didn‰Ûªt pick up the phone? Oh, right. My bad.",7
36050,Scene,20, The cafeteria..,7
36051,Howard,20, You‰Ûªre awful quiet. Everything okay?,7
36052,Sheldon,20, Not really. I had a bit of an embarrassing evening.,7
36053,Howard,20," Ugh. Me, too. What happened?",7
36054,Sheldon,20, I drank alcohol and may have left an unfortunate voice mail for Stephen Hawking.,7
36055,Howard,20, I wouldn‰Ûªt worry about it. He‰Ûªs got a pretty good sense of humour.,7
36056,Sheldon,20," Oh, I hope so. What happened to you last night?",7
36057,Howard,20," Oh, well, turns out I‰Ûªd already met the girl Raj is seeing when I did a number on her bathroom. And that number was two.",7
36058,Sheldon,20," Well, you know, I‰Ûªve always been a fan of a story told by Attar of Nishapur, about a king who assembled a group of wise men to create a ring that would make him happy when he was sad. And that ring was inscribed with the phrase, this too shall pass.",7
36059,Barry,20," Hey, Cooper. I heard you dwunk-dialed Stephen Hawking last night? Classic.",7
36060,Howard,20," Get out of here, Barry.",7
36061,Barry,20," Whatever you say, Cwogziwwa.",7
36062,Sheldon,20, Clogzilla. That‰Ûªs pretty funny. I don‰Ûªt think that‰Ûªs gonna pass.,7
36063,Scene,20, Stephen Hawking‰Ûªs office.,7
36064,Answerphone,20, Next message.,7

36066,Answerphone,20, Next message.,7
36067,Sheldon (voice),20, Do you know what‰Ûªs great? Geology. Oh. Look at this geode. That‰Ûªs fun to say. Gee-ode. Gee-ode.,7

36075,Sheldon (voice),20," Thiospinel sulfide. Thiospinel sulfide. That‰Ûªs even more fun than gee-ode. Hey, did you see The Lego Movie?",7
36076,Stephen Hawking,20, What a jackass.,7
36077,Scene,21, The apartment.,7
36078,Penny,21," So, we‰Ûªre about to shoot this scene in the movie where the killer ape DNA is slowly taking over my body.",7
36079,Leonard,21, Okay.,7
36080,Penny,21," But I realize they‰Ûªre gluing fur everywhere except my cleavage. So, I asked the director why and he says, it‰Ûªs important to the story that my boobs be the last things to turn ape.",7
36081,Leonard,21, It‰Ûªs sweet that he thinks there‰Ûªs a story.,7
36082,Penny,21," Oh, and there‰Ûªs not even a bathroom on set. I have to go to the gas station across the street. I mean, I was dressed like half an ape and still not even close to the most disgusting person in there.",7
36083,Sheldon,21," Leonard, I could use your assistance.",7
36084,Leonard,21, Sure. What‰Ûªs up?,7
36085,Sheldon,21," Well, now that I‰Ûªve given up string theory, I‰Ûªm struggling to find my next area of focus. So, in your professional opinion, which of these areas do you think is the most promising?",7
36086,Leonard,21," Huh, well, I think there‰Ûªs some really innovative stuff going on in dark matter.",7
36087,Sheldon,21, That‰Ûªs helpful. Okay. Of these four areas‰Û_,7
36088,Penny,21," Sheldon, what did we say about being a nicer friend?",7
36089,Leonard,21, Thank you.,7
36090,Penny,21," Leonard, what did we say about being a gullible weenie?",7
36091,Sheldon,21, It is just so frustrating.,7
36092,Penny,21," ‰Û÷Cause you‰Ûªre trying too hard. You need to do something else, get your mind off it.",7
36093,Leonard,21, Hey. How about we bring back Anything Can Happen Thursdays?,7
36094,Penny,21," Hey, that‰Ûªs good. Why‰Ûªd you guys stop doing that?",7
36095,Leonard,21, You made fun of us. Said it was stupid.,7
36096,Penny,21," Yeah. Sounds like me. Come on, Sheldon. What do you say?",7
36097,Sheldon,21, All right. I officially reinstate Anything Can Happen Thursday.,7
36098,Leonard,21," Great, what do you want to do?",7
36099,Sheldon,21, I don‰Ûªt know. What do you want to do?,7
36100,Penny,21, I don‰Ûªt know. What do you want to do?,7
36101,Leonard,21, I‰Ûªm starting to remember the problem with Anything Can Happen Thursdays.,7
36102,Scene,21, The apartment.,7
36103,Sheldon,21," Hmm, what can we do that‰Ûªs fun?",7
36104,Leonard,21, What can we do that‰Ûªs different?,7
36105,Penny,21, What can we do that‰Ûªs free?,7
36106,Sheldon,21," Oh, got it. We order a pizza.",7
36107,Penny,21, Are you kidding? That‰Ûªs what you always do. Think harder.,7
36108,Sheldon,21," You‰Ûªre right. You‰Ûªre right. Got it. We order calzones, cut them open, eat them like pizza. All right, all right, I‰Ûªll shake the brain bush one more time, see what falls out. Got it. There‰Ûªs a live-action role-playing group that meets every Thursday night in Griffith Park and re-enacts battles from Lord of the Rings.",7
36109,Penny,21," Uh, tell me more about this calzone idea.",7
36110,Leonard,21," You know what? Why don‰Ûªt we just ease into this. Let, let‰Ûªs go for a walk and, and, and see if we find a new restaurant.",7
36111,Sheldon,21, Any chance that restaurant is near Griffith Park?,7
36112,Leonard,21, No.,7
36113,Sheldon,21, All right.,7
36114,Leonard,21," Raj and Howard are at Howard‰Ûªs mom‰Ûªs, but should we call the girls and see if they want to come?",7
36115,Penny,21, No. Bernadette‰Ûªs working late.,7
36116,Sheldon,21, Amy‰Ûªs sick.,7
36117,Leonard,21, Aw. What‰Ûªs wrong with her?,7
36118,Sheldon,21," Well, she talks a lot. She always wants to hold hands.",7
36119,Leonard,21, That‰Ûªs not what I meant.,7
36120,Sheldon,21," Well, if you were referring to her illness your question should have been, what ails her?",7
36121,Leonard,21, What ails her?,7
36122,Sheldon,21, Oh. Who knows?,7
36123,Penny,21," Come on, anything can happen. We can push him down the stairs.",7
36124,Scene,21, Howard‰Ûªs mother‰Ûªs house.,7
36125,Howard,21, Hey. Thanks for coming to hang out.,7
36126,Raj,21, No problem. How‰Ûªs your mom feeling?,7
36127,Howard,21," Okay, but she‰Ûªd feel better if she took her medicine.",7
36128,Raj,21," You know, when Cinnamon won‰Ûªt take her medicine, I hide it in a piece of cheese.",7
36129,Howard,21," Good idea. We can wrap the pill in cheese, feed it to Cinnamon, and then my mom can eat Cinnamon. So what do you feel like doing?",7
36130,Raj,21, I was thinking we could watch a DVD.,7
36131,Howard,21," Well, my mom doesn‰Ûªt have a lot to choose from. Unless you want to watch the video of her colonoscopy. Spoiler alert, 20 minutes in they find a prune pit.",7
36132,Raj,21," Actually, how do you feel about watching House of 1000 Corpses?",7
36133,Howard,21, A straight-up gore-fest? You hate this stuff.,7
36134,Raj,21," I do, but for some reason, Emily loves it and wants to watch it with me tomorrow, so I thought if I start with you first, then I could act cool about it with her.",7
36135,Howard,21," That‰Ûªs actually not a bad plan. I can sit through the colonoscopy now, but that first time I was like, oh my God, a prune pit.",7
36136,Raj,21," Uh, so, you‰Ûªll watch it?",7
36137,Howard,21, Sure.,7
36138,Raj,21, You‰Ûªre a good friend. I owe you one.,7
36139,Mrs Wolowitz (off),21, Howard. Help me get out of the tub.,7
36140,Raj,21, Not that one.,7
36141,Scene,21, The street. ,7
36142,Sheldon,21," So, we‰Ûªre just randomly choosing a restaurant without researching it online?",7
36143,Penny,21, Yep.,7
36144,Sheldon,21," Great. You know, this is how Anything Can Happen Thursday turns into It Won‰Ûªt Stop Coming Up Friday.",7
36145,Leonard,21," Hey, how about that Asian fusion place?",7
36146,Sheldon,21, Fusion and Asians? I‰Ûªm trying not to think about science.,7
36147,Penny,21, What the hell? What? She‰Ûªs not working late.,7
36148,Sheldon,21, And Amy doesn‰Ûªt look sick.,7
36149,Penny,21, Why would they lie to us?,7
36150,Sheldon,21," That‰Ûªs a good question. (Knock, knock, knock) Amy and Bernadette. (Knock, knock, knock) Amy and Bernadette. (Knock, knock, knock) Amy and Bernadette. Why did you lie to us?",7
36151,Scene,21, Howard‰Ûªs mother‰Ûªs house.,7
36152,Raj,21," Hey. Listen to this. Murder, cannibalism and satanic rituals are just a few of the thousand plus horrors that await.",7
36153,Howard,21," I just helped my mom out of the tub, so, I‰Ûªm one slippery horror ahead of you.",7
36154,Raj,21, You‰Ûªre a good son. I don‰Ûªt know how you do it.,7
36155,Howard,21," Beach blankets, my friend, it‰Ûªs all about beach blankets.",7
36156,Raj,21," All right, let‰Ûªs get this over with. Ew, it‰Ûªs got someone‰Ûªs hair on it.",7
36157,Howard,21," Oh, yeah, you‰Ûªre gonna do great with this movie.",7
36158,Scene,21, A bar.,7
36159,Penny,21, You‰Ûªre not working late. Why did you lie to me?,7
36160,Sheldon,21," And Amy, you told me you were sick, but you look just as pale and tired as always.",7
36161,Amy,21," I‰Ûªm sorry, I just needed a break from hearing you obsess about what to do after string theory.",7
36162,Bernadette,21, We kind of just wanted one night where we didn‰Ûªt have to hear about how miserable you are making this movie.,7
36163,Amy,21, But none of that means we don‰Ûªt love you.,7
36164,Penny,21, I haven‰Ûªt been complaining that much about the movie. Have I?,7
36165,Leonard,21, I also love you.,7
36166,Penny,21," Well you know what? Maybe I need a break from all of you. Come on, Sheldon.",7
36167,Sheldon,21, Where are we going?,7
36168,Penny,21," We‰Ûªre gonna have Anything Can Happen Thursday, you‰Ûªre gonna tell me all about your science stuff and I‰Ûªm gonna complain about my movie, and we‰Ûªre gonna support each other because that‰Ûªs what friends do.",7
36169,Sheldon,21," Okay. ‰Û÷Cause if I had to pick now, I‰Ûªd probably go with dark matter because‰Û_",7
36170,Penny,21, Shut up.,7
36171,Scene,21, A restaurant. Sheldon makes an ‰ÛÏunsure‰Û noise.,7
36172,Penny,21, What‰Ûªs wrong?,7
36173,Sheldon,21, I don‰Ûªt understand my food. Chinese noodles with Korean barbecue in a taco.,7
36174,Penny,21, It‰Ûªs fusion.,7
36175,Sheldon,21, My mother would lock her car doors if she had to drive through this hodgepodge of ethnicity.,7
36176,Penny,21, Think I‰Ûªve been complaining too much about the movie?,7
36177,Sheldon,21, Not at all.,7
36178,Penny,21, Thank you.,7
36179,Sheldon,21," But to be fair, when you talk, most of what you say sounds like, wah, wah, wah, clothes, wah, wah, wah.",7
36180,Penny,21," Hey, I don‰Ûªt understand why you‰Ûªre not upset with Amy.",7
36181,Sheldon,21, I am. So much so that I‰Ûªm gonna bring her here for dinner on our next date night.,7
36182,Scene,21, Howard‰Ûªs mother‰Ûªs house.,7
36183,Raj,21," Okay. So, in the last 20 minutes, we‰Ûªve seen a crazy woman kissing a fetus in a jar. We‰Ûªve seen a guy cut in half and sewn to a fish.",7
36184,Howard,21, And the brutal dismemberment of a rotisserie chicken by my mother.,7
36185,Raj,21," On the bright side, she didn‰Ûªt even notice the pill. Why does Emily like this stuff? Do you think there‰Ûªs something psychologically wrong with her?",7
36186,Howard,21, What difference does it make?,7
36187,Raj,21, What do you mean?,7
36188,Howard,21," Oh, come on, she could have a freezer full of ex-boyfriend‰Ûªs body parts and you‰Ûªd still go out with her.",7
36189,Raj,21, I do like that the ex-boyfriend‰Ûªs out of the picture.,7
36190,Scene,21, The bar.,7
36191,Amy,21, I feel so bad about lying to Sheldon. How am I gonna make it up to him?,7
36192,Bernadette,21," I‰Ûªd tell you what I do with Howard, but I don‰Ûªt think dressing up like a Catholic schoolgirl is gonna work with Sheldon.",7
36193,Leonard,21, He‰Ûªd probably give you homework.,7
36194,Amy,21, Did you lie to Howard about tonight?,7
36195,Bernadette,21, Of course.,7
36196,Amy,21, And you don‰Ûªt feel guilty about it?,7
36197,Bernadette,21," Between Penny‰Ûªs gorilla movie and Howard‰Ûªs gorilla mother, I had no choice.",7
36198,Leonard,21, Thankfully Penny and I have a relationship based on honesty. What? I don‰Ûªt lie to her.,7
36199,Bernadette,21," Oh, we know you don‰Ûªt lie to her.",7
36200,Scene,21, The restaurant.,7
36201,Penny,21," Thank you. Hey, maybe the answer to your career question is in one of these.",7
36202,Sheldon,21," Penny, there‰Ûªs only one cookie with something in the middle that solves life‰Ûªs problems, and that‰Ûªs an Oreo. Or a Nutter Butter, if you‰Ûªre in a pinch.",7
36203,Penny,21," Come on, open it. I bet it says something great.",7
36204,Sheldon,21," This is Asian fusion. For all you know, there‰Ûªs a tiny Chihuahua in here.",7
36205,Penny,21," Fine, I‰Ûªll go. Hmm. People turn to you for guidance and wisdom. Yeah, that‰Ûªs a good one.",7
36206,Sheldon,21," No, it‰Ûªs not.",7
36207,Penny,21, How is that not good?,7
36208,Sheldon,21," Turn to you for wisdom? Clearly, that cookie is mocking you. You‰Ûªd never hear that kind of sass from a Nutter Butter.",7
36209,Penny,21," Uh, since you‰Ûªre paying for dinner, I‰Ûªll let that slide. Open yours.",7
36210,Sheldon,21, Have you ever paid for a meal?,7
36211,Penny,21, Not with money. Read.,7
36212,Sheldon,21, Your warm and fun-loving nature delights those around you.,7
36213,Penny,21," Oh, try again.",7
36214,Scene,21, Howard‰Ûªs mother‰Ûªs house. ,7
36215,Howard,21," Let me get this straight. So, he kills this girl‰Ûªs father, cuts off the guy‰Ûªs face, and is wearing it as a mask while he makes out with her.",7
36216,Raj,21, I‰Ûªm just gonna say it. That‰Ûªs not okay. Why can‰Ûªt I be in a relationship with a girl who likes The Sound of Music?,7
36217,Howard,21," Raj, you are the girl in the relationship who likes The Sound of Music. (Phone rings) Hey, Penny. What‰Ûªs up? No, Bernie‰Ûªs working late. Really? Thanks for telling me.",7
36218,Raj,21, What?,7
36219,Howard,21, I‰Ûªm having sex with a Catholic schoolgirl tonight.,7
36220,Scene,21, The street. Outside a psychic‰Ûªs shop.,7
36221,Penny,21," Oh, I think I see our next stop.",7
36222,Sheldon,21," You can‰Ûªt be serious. If I wanted to waste my time on nonsense, I‰Ûªd follow Leonard on Instagram.",7
36223,Penny,21," No, come on, tonight we are trying new things.",7
36224,Sheldon,21, Oh. That‰Ûªs a lot of incense. Or someone set a hippie on fire.,7
36225,Scene,21, Outside the bar.,7
36226,Bernadette (on phone),21," Yeah, honey, I‰Ûªm still stuck at work. Really? Penny said that? Okay, it‰Ûªs true. I‰Ûªm sorry. I‰Ûªll see you at home. Yeah, yeah, I‰Ûªll put it on.",7
36227,Leonard,21, You and I never just hang out like this. Why is that?,7
36228,Amy,21," I know, it‰Ûªs weird, right?",7
36229,Leonard,21, Yeah. We should do it more often.,7
36230,Amy,21," Oh, no. I mean, this is weird right now.",7
36231,Leonard,21," (Phone text sound) Ah, it‰Ûªs Penny.",7
36232,Amy,21, Is she still mad?,7
36233,Leonard,21," Oh, doesn‰Ûªt seem like it. She got Sheldon to go to a psychic with her.",7
36234,Amy,21," A psychic? He considers them not just mumbo jumbo, but extra-jumbo mumbo jumbo.",7
36235,Leonard,21," Well, Penny can be very persuasive. She‰Ûªs gotten me to do a lot of things I wouldn‰Ûªt normally do.",7
36236,Amy,21, Because she has sex with you.,7
36237,Leonard,21," Yeah, she does.",7
36238,Amy,21," Can I confess something? Once in a while, I get a little jealous of how close Penny and Sheldon are.",7
36239,Leonard,21, Really?,7
36240,Amy,21," I mean, not in a romantic way. It‰Ûªs just, she really has some sort of connection with him.",7
36241,Leonard,21," Well, well they‰Ûªve known each other a long time, and Penny grew up around horses, so she knows how to approach him without making him skittish.",7
36242,Amy,21," Don‰Ûªt get me wrong, I‰Ûªm glad they‰Ûªre friends. I just wish he‰Ûªd be that comfortable around me already.",7
36243,Leonard,21," Well, it took him a long time to get comfortable around me, too.",7
36244,Amy,21, Really? What did you do?,7
36245,Leonard,21, Something terrible in a former life? I don‰Ûªt know.,7
36246,Bernadette,21," I gotta go. Penny ratted me out. FYI, she‰Ûªs getting you a watch for your birthday with money she took out of your wallet.",7
36247,Scene,21, The psychic shop.,7
36248,Sheldon,21," I don‰Ûªt mean to be rude or discourteous, but before we begin, I‰Ûªd just like to say there is absolutely no scientific evidence to support clairvoyance of any kind. Which means, and again, no insult intended, that you‰Ûªre a fraud, your profession is a swindle, and, uh, your livelihood is dependent on the gullibility of stupid people. Again, no offence.",7
36249,Penny,21," All right, Sheldon, just ask your question.",7
36250,Sheldon,21," Okay, I just did. What was it?",7
36251,Penny,21," Oh, for God‰Ûªs sake. Look, he‰Ûªs a physicist who‰Ûªs trying to figure out what his next field of study should be.",7
36252,Sheldon,21," For your information, I was asking her about the next Star Trek movie.",7
36253,Penny,21," Okay, I can answer that one, I‰Ûªll be bored.",7
36254,Psychic,21," All right, why don‰Ûªt we begin? Your spirit guides are telling me that there‰Ûªs a woman in your life you‰Ûªre having problems with.",7
36255,Sheldon,21, That‰Ûªs an easy guess. I‰Ûªm clearly an annoying person and have problems with both genders.,7
36256,Psychic,21," Yes, you clearly are. But I‰Ûªm seeing a specific woman that you‰Ûªre in a romantic relationship with.",7
36257,Penny,21," Oh, oh, here we go.",7
36258,Psychic,21, Does she have dark hair?,7
36259,Penny,21," Yes, yes, your spirit guides are on fire.",7
36260,Sheldon,21," The majority of people have dark hair. Even you, at one time.",7
36261,Psychic,21, Does she work in a similar field to you?,7
36262,Sheldon,21," Ha. The opposite. She‰Ûªs a neurobiologist, and I‰Ûªm a theoretical physicist. My spirit guides can go suck an egg.",7
36263,Psychic,21, They‰Ûªre telling me that you have difficulty being close with her.,7
36264,Penny,21," Oh, he does. He so does. What should he do?",7
36265,Psychic,21," He should give himself to this relationship. Once he does, all his other pursuits will come into focus.",7
36266,Penny,21," Sheldon, do you hear that? I mean, Amy is the key to your happiness.",7
36267,Psychic,21, Exactly. Personally and professionally. Everything will fall into place once you commit to her.,7
36268,Sheldon,21," You know what this is? Yeah, and I reserve this word for those rare instances when it‰Ûªs truly deserved. This is malarkey.",7
36269,Penny,21," Wow, you really struck a nerve. I‰Ûªve never heard him use the M word before.",7
36270,Scene,21, Raj‰Ûªs apartment.,7
36271,Raj,21," Here we go, House of a 1,000 Corpses.",7
36272,Emily,21," Now, just so you know, I was a nanny for three years, so if you get scared, I can totally change your diaper.",7
36273,Raj,21," Actually, I have to tell you something. These kind of movies really aren‰Ûªt my thing, so, last night, I watched it just to see what I was getting myself into.",7
36274,Emily,21, Okay.,7
36275,Raj,21," And I have to be honest, I thought it was disturbing and weird, and it made me wonder what it says about someone who enjoys it.",7
36276,Emily,21," I wonder that, too.",7
36277,Raj,21," Then, why do you watch these things?",7
36278,Emily,21, Can I tell you something without you judging me?,7
36279,Raj,21, Sure.,7
36280,Emily,21, They kind of turn me on.,7
36281,Raj,21, And play.,7
36282,Scene,21, The apartment.,7
36283,Sheldon,21, Hello. I didn‰Ûªt expect you this evening.,7
36284,Amy,21," Well, I was just feeling so bad about lying to you the other night, I wanted to make it up to you.",7
36285,Sheldon,21," And how do you propose to do that? (Amy takes off coat and is dressed as a Catholic schoolgirl) Unless you have Gravity on Blu-ray under that skirt, I don‰Ûªt know where you‰Ûªre going with this.",7
36286,Scene,22, The apartment.,7
36287,Sheldon,22," Gentlemen, Star Wars Day is rapidly approaching. We should finalize our plans.",7
36288,Penny,22," What? That‰Ûªs a real thing? What is it, Star Wars Christmas?",7
36289,Howard,22, No. Don‰Ûªt be ridiculous. That‰Ûªs Wookiee Life Day.,7
36290,Penny,22," So, when is it?",7
36291,Leonard,22," Uh, well, it‰Ûªs not May the fifth, and it‰Ûªs not May the third. It‰Ûªs May the fourth.",7
36292,Sheldon,22, Get it?,7
36293,Raj,22, May the fourth be with you?,7
36294,Leonard,22, May the force be with you. Get it?,7
36295,Penny,22," Oh, no. This face wasn‰Ûªt because I didn‰Ûªt get it.",7
36296,Scene,22, Sheldon‰Ûªs bedroom. There is a knock on the door.,7
36297,Sheldon,22, Come in.,7
36298,Leonard,22," Hey, you got a second?",7
36299,Sheldon,22," Yes. Actually, I‰Ûªm glad you‰Ûªre here. I‰Ûªm working on the Star Wars Day schedule. Now, I have a window built in after Phantom Menace for complaining, but I‰Ûªm worried an hour won‰Ûªt be enough time.",7
36300,Leonard,22," Sheldon, I‰Ûªve got some bad news.",7
36301,Sheldon,22, What is it?,7
36302,Leonard,22, I just read online that Arthur Jeffries passed away.,7
36303,Sheldon,22, Professor Proton is dead?,7
36304,Leonard,22," Sorry, buddy.",7
36305,Sheldon,22, What are you doing?,7
36306,Leonard,22, Comforting you?,7
36307,Sheldon,22," Your heart might be in the right place, but your head, chest and arms certainly aren‰Ûªt.",7
36308,Leonard,22," Anyway, the, the funeral‰Ûªs on Sunday.",7
36309,Sheldon,22," But, that‰Ûªs Star Wars Day.",7
36310,Leonard,22," Yeah, um, of all the things about this that are sad, that might not be number one. You okay? I know he meant a lot to you.",7
36311,Sheldon,22, I‰Ûªm fine.,7
36312,Leonard,22, Okay. Yet he cried when they changed the Raisin Bran box.,7
36313,Scene,22, Amy‰Ûªs apartment. ,7
36314,Professor Proton (on youtube),22," This, uh, this is something interesting boys and girls. After an owl eats, he spits up part of his meal that he can‰Ûªt digest, in the form of a pellet. Is, isn‰Ûªt that a hoot? We‰Ûªll be right back after I fire my writers. (Owl hoots) Oh, shut up.",7
36315,Amy,22, Watching your old friend?,7
36316,Sheldon,22," Hmm. Yes. Look at him, Amy. It‰Ûªs such a shame. Struck down in the prime of my life.",7
36317,Amy,22, Do you want me to go to the funeral with you?,7
36318,Sheldon,22," Oh, I‰Ûªm not going to the funeral.",7
36319,Amy,22, Why not?,7
36320,Sheldon,22," All those people blowing their noses. You can‰Ûªt tell the sick from the sad. Mm. I‰Ûªll be at home celebrating Star Wars Day, as planned.",7
36321,Amy,22, Are you sure you don‰Ûªt want to go say good-bye?,7
36322,Sheldon,22," Amy, mourning the inevitable is a complete waste of time.",7
36323,Amy,22, And watching a bunch of goofy space movies you‰Ûªve seen hundreds of times isn‰Ûªt?,7
36324,Sheldon,22," If we were in a physical relationship, you just lost sex tonight.",7
36325,Scene,22, The apartment.,7
36326,Penny,22," Hey, guys.",7
36327,Raj,22," Hey, Penny. Happy Star Wars Day.",7
36328,Penny,22, Okay.,7
36329,Raj,22, Can I make you breakfast? Admiral Ackbar‰Ûªs Snack Bar is open for business.,7
36330,Penny,22," No, thanks. Leonard and I are just going to the funeral.",7
36331,Howard,22, You sure. Not even coffee? We have R2-Decaf. Maybe a nice Cafe Au Leia?,7
36332,Raj,22, And if you‰Ûªre not in the mood for coffee I can always make you a Chai Tea-3PO.,7
36333,Penny,22," Oh, I get it, like C3PO. What happened to me?",7
36334,Raj,22," Hey, uh, Sheldon, you want anything?",7
36335,Sheldon,22," Uh, no, thank you.",7
36336,Howard,22, You‰Ûªre being so quiet. Are you upset or are you just rebooting?,7
36337,Sheldon,22, I‰Ûªm fine.,7
36338,Penny,22," Sweetie, are you sure you don‰Ûªt want to come with us to the funeral?",7
36339,Sheldon,22," Oh, I appreciate the offer, but Arthur is gone and there‰Ûªs nothing I can do about it. When Darth Vader struck down Obi-Wan, did Luke cry like a baby and go to his funeral?",7
36340,Penny,22," No, he blew up the Death Star. Why do I know this?",7
36341,Sheldon,22," Arthur Jeffries was a scientist. I‰Ûªm sure he didn‰Ûªt care about silly superstitions like funerals. You know, if he were here, I think he‰Ûªd say enjoy Star Wars Day.",7
36342,Leonard,22," He was 84, he‰Ûªd say where‰Ûªs my pudding?",7
36343,Raj,22," Before you go, at least let me pack you some Attack of the Scones for the road.",7
36344,Penny,22," Oh, like Attack of the Clones. We are leaving right now.",7
36345,Scene,22, Amy‰Ûs apartment. ,7
36346,Amy,22, Arthur passing away was harder on Sheldon than he‰Ûªs ready to admit. Really hoping this will cheer him up.,7
36347,Bernadette,22," Me, too. Although, it might‰Ûªve been thoughtless of us to bake a Death Star cake.",7
36348,Amy,22," No, it combines two of Sheldon‰Ûªs favorite things, chocolate chips and the ability to destroy a planet at the push of a button.",7
36349,Bernadette,22," Well, anyway, it‰Ûªll be a nice surprise for the boys. And Howie doesn‰Ûªt think I take his interests seriously, so hopefully this will keep him fooled for a while.",7
36350,Amy,22," Okay, let‰Ûªs get the fondant and start decorating.",7
36351,Bernadette,22, This is pretty cool. You don‰Ûªt see too many spherical cakes.,7
36352,Amy,22, I wonder why that is.,7
36353,Scene,22, The funeral.,7
36354,Penny,22, I have a confession to make.,7
36355,Leonard,22, Hmm?,7
36356,Penny,22, I‰Ûªve never been to a funeral before.,7
36357,Leonard,22, Really?,7
36358,Penny,22," I just never knew anyone that died. I had a pet pig when I was a kid. I mean, when he died, we didn‰Ûªt have a funeral, we had a barbecue.",7
36359,Leonard,22," Yeah, we won‰Ûªt be eating Arthur tonight.",7
36360,Penny,22," I didn‰Ûªt know him very well, but I still really liked him. It‰Ûªs weird that he‰Ûªs just gone.",7
36361,Leonard,22, I know.,7
36362,Penny,22, I feel like I want to cry.,7
36363,Leonard,22," Oh that‰Ûªs, that‰Ûªs fine. Go ahead.",7
36364,Penny,22, I can‰Ûªt do it with you staring at me.,7
36365,Leonard,22, Sorry.,7
36366,Penny,22," No, I‰Ûªm dry. You‰Ûªre a big crybaby, you start, I‰Ûªll join in.",7
36367,Leonard,22, I am not a crybaby.,7
36368,Penny,22, Toy Story 3?,7
36369,Leonard,22," The toys were holding hands in a furnace. Look, Arthur lived a full life. And he inspired a lot of people. Sure, he, he was my childhood hero, but the fact that I got to work with him, side by side, before he died was, it was, it was a gift.",7
36370,Penny,22, It was a gift. Thank you for being the emotional one in this relationship.,7
36371,Leonard,22, I got your back.,7
36372,Penny,22, Yeah.,7
36373,Scene,22, The apartment. ,7
36374,Raj,22," Ugh, let‰Ûªs get this over with.",7
36375,Howard,22," Since we all agree Episode I isn‰Ûªt our favourite, maybe we just skip it this time.",7
36376,Sheldon,22," Howard, I think you of all people should avoid espousing the principle that if something is not our favourite we should just get rid of it.",7
36377,Raj,22," You know, I heard of this way of watching the movies called the Machete Order, where you watch Episodes IV and V, then skip Episode I, watch II and III as a flashback, and then finish with VI.",7
36378,Howard,22," Okay, so you‰Ûªd lose most of Jar Jar, all the trade route talk and the boring senate hearings, which are like watching C-SPAN with monsters.",7
36379,Sheldon,22, Get rid of the trade route part? Then how would Palpatine get Chancellor Valorum kicked out of office? How would he get himself elected? How? Can we get through one holiday without you saying something ridiculous?,7
36380,Raj,22, It was just a suggestion.,7
36381,Sheldon,22," Well, you know what else was just a suggestion? Why don‰Ûªt we change the Raisin Bran box? Hmm? And you know who got hurt by that? Every single person who eats breakfast.",7
36382,Raj,22, Wow.,7
36383,Howard,22, I think he‰Ûªs taking this Professor Proton thing pretty hard.,7
36384,Raj,22, Should we try to console him?,7
36385,Howard,22, Or should we respect his privacy in this moment of grief?,7
36386,Raj,22, By staying here and watching the movie.,7
36387,Howard,22, That‰Ûªs what good friends would do.,7
36388,Scene,22, Later.,7
36389,Howard,22," Well, at least without Sheldon here, we got to start with Episode IV.",7
36390,Raj,22," Mm, true. I do feel guilty about him.",7
36391,Howard,22," Me, too.",7
36392,Raj,22, Maybe we should see how he‰Ûªs doing.,7
36393,Howard,22, Yeah.,7
36394,Raj,22, But after the cantina scene.,7
36395,Howard,22, Obviously.,7
36396,Scene,22," Sheldon, dreaming he is in the living room of the apartment on his laptop.",7
36397,Sheldon,22," Look at Arthur, cracking up at a joke I told him. I‰Ûªll never hear that laugh again.",7
36398,Arthur,22, You never heard it that time.,7
36399,Sheldon,22, Arthur. I thought you were dead.,7
36400,Arthur,22," I am. Oh, it, it‰Ûªs fantastic. I mean this, this is the longest that I‰Ûªve gone without running into a men‰Ûªs room in, in, in years.",7
36401,Sheldon,22, Why are you here?,7
36402,Arthur,22," I don‰Ûªt know. I was, I was hoping I was going to haunt my ex-wife.",7
36403,Sheldon,22, I know why. You‰Ûªve come to me because you‰Ûªre my Obi-Wan.,7
36404,Arthur,22," I‰Ûªm, I‰Ûªm not, I‰Ûªm not familiar with that. Is, is, is that an, an Internet?",7
36405,Sheldon,22," Wow. Uh, you‰Ûªre dead, so I‰Ûªm going to let that slide. Obi-Wan Kenobi is a character from Star Wars. After his physical demise, he comes to Luke Skywalker as his mentor in spirit form.",7
36406,Arthur,22," Well, that, that clears that up.",7
36407,Sheldon,22, You must be here to give me advice.,7
36408,Arthur,22," Well, this, this is weird. Most, most of my robes open in, in the back.",7
36409,Sheldon,22, Those are your Jedi robes.,7
36410,Arthur,22," Oh, wait. What, what, what is, what is this?",7
36411,Sheldon,22, Be careful with that.,7
36412,Arthur,22," Oh. Oh. Oh, neato. I‰Ûªm, uh, I‰Ûªm going to need a Band-Aid.",7
36413,Scene,22, The funeral.,7
36414,Leonard,22," So, what did you think of your first funeral?",7
36415,Penny,22," Well, I don‰Ûªt want to be a jerk, but it was kind of a bummer.",7
36416,Leonard,22," Yeah, well, when I die, you can rent a bounce house.",7
36417,Penny,22, You think about dying?,7
36418,Leonard,22," Mm. Well, I think more about if I‰Ûªd have any regrets.",7
36419,Penny,22, What would you regret?,7
36420,Leonard,22," Mm, you know, that I didn‰Ûªt travel more, take more risks, learn another language.",7
36421,Penny,22, You know Klingon.,7
36422,Leonard,22, That‰Ûªs true.,7
36423,Penny,22," No, I meant that as a regret.",7
36424,Leonard,22, I just thought of one more.,7
36425,Penny,22, What‰Ûªs that?,7
36426,Leonard,22, I regret not saying yes when you asked me to marry you.,7
36427,Penny,22," Well, it just wasn‰Ûªt the right time.",7
36428,Leonard,22, Yeah.,7
36429,Penny,22, And this is also not the right time. Do not propose.,7
36430,Leonard,22, What?,7
36431,Penny,22, I know that face. That‰Ûªs your propose face.,7
36432,Leonard,22, I was not gonna propose. It‰Ûªs already two to one.,7
36433,Penny,22, What‰Ûªs two to one?,7
36434,Leonard,22," I proposed twice, you proposed once. Two to one.",7
36435,Penny,22," Oh, my. It‰Ûªs not a contest.",7
36436,Leonard,22, I don‰Ûªt know what you‰Ûªre upset about. I‰Ûªm the one who‰Ûªs losing.,7
36437,Penny,22, Okay. Fine. Would you feel better if I propose so you could turn me down again?,7
36438,Leonard,22," Yeah, I think I would.",7
36439,Penny,22," Okay. Leonard, will you marry me?",7
36440,Leonard,22, Hmm.,7
36441,Penny,22," No, don‰Ûªt you dare. You reject me right now and tie things up.",7
36442,Leonard,22, It‰Ûªs just such a big decision. I don‰Ûªt want to have any regrets.,7
36443,Scene,22, Amy‰Ûªs apartment.,7
36444,Amy,22, Did you ever watch Professor Proton when you were a kid?,7
36445,Bernadette,22," No. My dad controlled the TV, so unless someone was a Texas Ranger, Jake or the Fatman, we didn‰Ûªt see it.",7
36446,Amy,22," I never watched him, either, but he seems to be the reason that Sheldon got interested in science.",7
36447,Bernadette,22," Not me. I got into science ‰Ûªcause I was always the smallest kid in school, so I thought if I became a scientist, I could invent a formula that made me taller.",7
36448,Amy,22, That‰Ûªs cute.,7
36449,Bernadette,22," Yeah, I thought it was working for a while, but then I found out my brother was just lowering the pencil marks on the door frame. How about you?",7
36450,Amy,22," Oh, I guess it must have been back when I was in the Girl Sprouts.",7
36451,Bernadette,22, Girl Sprouts?,7
36452,Amy,22, My mom made it up as an alternative to the Girl Scouts. She didn‰Ûªt want me selling cookies on some street corner like a whore.,7
36453,Bernadette,22, How did that get you into science?,7
36454,Amy,22," Oh, I went to the library and took out a book on biology to see what whores did.",7
36455,Scene,22, Leonard‰Ûªs car.,7
36456,Leonard,22," On the one hand, if I say yes‰Û_",7
36457,Penny,22, This isn‰Ûªt funny anymore. Just say no so we‰Ûªre done with this. Will you marry me or not?,7
36458,Leonard,22," Ooh, interesting. Did you just propose to me again?",7
36459,Penny,22, No.,7
36460,Leonard,22," Really? Because I just heard will you marry me? That‰Ûªs two proposals, one day. Sounds like someone wants to spend the rest of her life telling people how to spell the name Hofstadter.",7
36461,Penny,22, You know what? Fine. Do whatever you want.,7
36462,Leonard,22," Hey. Penny, don‰Ûªt get upset. Here. I love you, but, no, I will not marry you.",7
36463,Penny,22, Thank you.,7
36464,Leonard,22," Now, about that second proposal. On the one hand‰Û_",7
36465,Scene,22, Sheldon‰Ûªs dream.,7
36466,Arthur,22," Where, where, where are we?",7
36467,Sheldon,22, This is the swampland of Dagobah. It‰Ûªs where Luke was trained in the ways of the Jedi.,7
36468,Arthur,22, Oh. Too bad. I thought it was Florida.,7
36469,Sheldon,22," When Obi-Wan came to Luke on this very spot, he gave him all sorts of helpful advice. So, um, what do you got for me?",7
36470,Arthur,22," Um, always, get, get a prenup.",7
36471,Sheldon,22, That‰Ûªs it? I thought there‰Ûªd be more of a reason why you‰Ûªre here.,7
36472,Arthur,22," Well, why, why do you think I‰Ûªm here?",7
36473,Sheldon,22, I suppose it has something to do with your recent passing.,7
36474,Arthur,22," Is, is this the, the first time you‰Ûªve lost, you know, someone close to you?",7
36475,Sheldon,22," Oh, no. No. I‰Ûªve already had to say good-bye to 11 Dr. Whos.",7
36476,Arthur,22," Yeah, I‰Ûªve, I‰Ûªve outlived a few of my doctors, too.",7
36477,Sheldon,22," Of course, my grandfather died when I was five. My father died when I was 14.",7
36478,Arthur,22," I‰Ûªm, I‰Ûªm sorry about that.",7
36479,Sheldon,22," And now you‰Ûªre gone, too. It‰Ûªs like all the men I‰Ûªve looked up to have gone away.",7
36480,Arthur,22," Well, you know, it‰Ûªs, it‰Ûªs okay to, to be sad about them. Just, just make sure, you know, you appreciate those who, who are still there for you.",7
36481,Sheldon,22, But I do appreciate them.,7
36482,Arthur,22," Well, then, what am I doing in a swamp dressed like Friar Tuck? Appreciate them, Sheldon. (Sheldon is woken up by a knocking on his bedroom door.)",7
36483,Leonard,22," Hey, buddy. Heard you‰Ûªre having a rough day. You all right?",7
36484,Sheldon,22, I‰Ûªm okay. How was the funeral?,7
36485,Leonard,22," It was nice, you know. A lot of people showed up, told some great stories about him. Did you know that Arthur‰Ûªs son is a high school sci‰Û_? (Sheldon hugs him) Hey, the guys are about to start Jedi. You want to go watch?",7
36486,Sheldon,22, I do. After I make them go back and watch one through five first.,7
36487,Leonard,22," Sheldon, that, that‰Ûªll take us all night.",7
36488,Sheldon,22," That‰Ûªs true. Oh, it‰Ûªs a good thing I had a nap.",7
36489,Scene,22, The apartment. ,7
36490,Howard,22," Boy, some of the physical comedy with Jar Jar is a little tough to watch.",7
36491,Leonard,22, At least they toned him down in the second one.,7
36492,Penny,22," Yeah, he is pretty stupid.",7
36493,Raj,22," Hey, we can say it. You can‰Ûªt.",7
36494,Amy,22," Hey, guys.",7
36495,Bernadette,22, Happy Star Wars Day.,7
36496,Sheldon,22, Wow. A Death Star cake.,7
36497,Amy,22, Yeah. We were hoping it might cheer you up.,7
36498,Bernadette,22," And even though it meant we had to miss the movies, we could still be part of the fun.",7
36499,Howard,22," Well, you didn‰Ûªt miss anything. We just started over.",7
36500,Bernadette,22, Son of a bitch.,7
36501,Scene,22," The same, everyone is falling asleep.",7
36502,Sheldon,22, You‰Ûªre back.,7
36503,Arthur,22," Yeah, apparently, um, I‰Ûªm here whenever, when, whenever you need me.",7
36504,Sheldon,22, That‰Ûªs nice.,7
36505,Arthur,22," May, maybe for you.",7
36506,Sheldon,22, Why do I need you now?,7
36507,Arthur,22," Well, as near as I could tell, you, you fell asleep watching Star Wars, and now you‰Ûªre, you‰Ûªre dreaming you‰Ûªre watching Star Wars.",7
36508,Sheldon,22, So?,7
36509,Arthur,22," I mean, don‰Ûªt, don‰Ûªt you see a problem there? I mean, how, how you‰Ûªre spending your limited time on Earth?",7
36510,Sheldon,22, Not at all.,7
36511,Arthur,22," Okay, good luck to you.",7
36512,Scene,23, The upstairs landing of Mrs Wolowitz‰Ûªs house.,7
36513,Bernadette,23, Almost there. You‰Ûªre doing great.,7
36514,Howard,23," Thanks for lifting my spirits. Next time, try lifting the box.",7
36515,Raj,23, Please hurry.,7
36516,Mrs Wolowitz (off),23, I don‰Ûªt need a treadmill.,7
36517,Howard,23, The doctor says you need to get exercise.,7
36518,Mrs Wolowitz (off),23, I get plenty of exercise.,7
36519,Howard,23, Crushing my will to live isn‰Ûªt exercise.,7
36520,Raj,23," If she isn‰Ûªt gonna use it, then why are we doing this?",7
36521,Howard,23, She‰Ûªll use it. All I need is to rig it with a fishing pole and a HoneyBaked Ham.,7
36522,Raj,23, All right. Now what?,7
36523,Bernadette,23, We set it up in Howie‰Ûªs old room.,7
36524,Raj,23, Do you know how to set it up?,7
36525,Howard,23," Please, I‰Ûªm an MIT-trained engineer. I think I can handle‰Û_ Ma, look out.",7
36526,Mrs Wolowitz (off),23, Aaaaah! I told you this thing would kill me.,7
36527,Scene,23, The apartment.,7
36528,Raj,23, So she‰Ûªs gonna be laid up for at least six weeks.,7
36529,Leonard,23, Poor Mrs. Wolowitz.,7
36530,Amy,23, Should we do something for her?,7
36531,Sheldon,23, I know. Let‰Ûªs go see the new Spider-Man movie.,7
36532,Amy,23," Sheldon, we‰Ûªre talking about your friend‰Ûªs mother. She got hurt.",7
36533,Sheldon,23," I thought that subject had run its course, so I changed it. It‰Ûªs called reading the room, Amy.",7
36534,Penny,23, Hi.,7
36535,Leonard,23," Hey, how were things on the set?",7
36536,Penny,23," Uh, pretty good, actually.",7
36537,Raj,23, So the movie‰Ûªs not as bad as you thought?,7
36538,Penny,23," Oh, no, it is, but I decided instead of complaining about it, I‰Ûªm just gonna go in every day and give it my all.",7
36539,Amy,23, Good for you.,7
36540,Penny,23, Thanks. There‰Ûªs no reason why I shouldn‰Ûªt be the best bisexual go-go dancer slowly transforming into a killer gorilla anyone‰Ûªs ever seen.,7
36541,Leonard,23, I don‰Ûªt know. The bisexual gorilla go-go dancer in Schindler‰Ûªs List is tough to beat.,7
36542,Sheldon,23," Ah, very good. Because a gorilla go-go dancer of any sexual preference would be out of place in a film about the Holocaust.",7
36543,Leonard,23," It only gets funnier when you explain it, Sheldon.",7
36544,Sheldon,23, I know.,7
36545,Scene,23, Mrs Wolowitz‰Ûªs house.,7
36546,Howard,23," Okay, she‰Ûªs all settled in the guest room.",7
36547,Bernadette,23, Maybe we should get one of those machines to help her up the stairs.,7
36548,Howard,23, You mean a forklift?,7
36549,Bernadette,23, Howie.,7
36550,Howard,23, I‰Ûªm sorry. I just can‰Ûªt deal with this right now.,7
36551,Bernadette,23, Taking care of your own mother? How can you say that?,7
36552,Howard,23," Bernie, she‰Ûªs gonna be off her feet for six to eight weeks. Are you prepared to feed her, wash her and take her to the toilet?",7
36553,Bernadette,23, I would do it for my mother.,7
36554,Howard,23," Yeah, of course you would, you‰Ûªre a loving person. I‰Ûªm what my people would call a putz.",7
36555,Bernadette,23," Look, I‰Ûªm not crazy about the idea, but what other choice do we have?",7
36556,Howard,23, We get a nurse. Preferably someone from a third world country who‰Ûªs used to suffering and unpleasant smells.,7
36557,Bernadette,23, You‰Ûªd hire a total stranger to take care of the woman who raised you? That‰Ûªs so cruel.,7
36558,Howard,23, Not if we pay them well and let them listen to the music of their homeland.,7
36559,Mrs Wolowitz (off),23, I need to tinkle.,7
36560,Howard,23, Sounds like a job for a loving person. Would you like me to play some Polish music while you carry her to the toilet?,7
36561,Bernadette,23, You are a putz.,7
36562,Howard,23, As advertised.,7
36563,Scene,23, A cinema.,7
36564,Sheldon,23, Thanks for coming with me.,7
36565,Raj,23, Thanks for inviting me after everyone else said no. Aren‰Ûªt you gonna get 3-D glasses?,7
36566,Sheldon,23, I brought my own. No sense in risking bridge-of-nose herpes.,7
36567,Raj,23, Is that a real thing?,7
36568,Sheldon,23," Well, until they invent nose condoms, I‰Ûªm not finding out.",7
36569,Raj,23," Emily, Hey.",7
36570,Emily,23," Oh, hey, Raj.",7
36571,Raj,23," Uh, this is my friend, Sheldon. Sheldon, this is Emily.",7
36572,Sheldon,23," Oh, yes, you‰Ûªre the dermatologist. I went for a walk yesterday without sunscreen. Do you see anything on my forehead that I should be concerned about?",7
36573,Emily,23," Um, you know what? I better go. My movie‰Ûªs about to start.",7
36574,Raj,23, Are you here alone?,7
36575,Emily,23," No, not really.",7
36576,Raj,23," What do you mean, not really?",7
36577,Man,23," Hey, should we get our seats?",7
36578,Emily,23," Yeah. It was nice seeing you. Um, I‰Ûªll call you later.",7
36579,Raj,23," Yeah, okay.",7
36580,Sheldon,23," That was awkward, right?",7
36581,Raj,23, Uh-huh.,7
36582,Sheldon,23, Is it because she‰Ûªs dating you but was out with that other fellow?,7
36583,Raj,23, Yes.,7
36584,Sheldon,23, Good. I thought she saw something on my forehead.,7
36585,Scene,23, The movie set. ,7
36586,Director,23, And action.,7
36587,Wil Wheaton,23, Please don‰Ûªt shut me out.,7
36588,Penny,23, Go away. Just go away.,7
36589,Wil,23," I swear, I will find a way to turn you back.",7
36590,Penny,23, What gave you the right to mix my DNA with that of a killer gorilla?,7
36591,Wil,23, I was trying to save your life.,7
36592,Penny,23," Life? What life? Look at me, I‰Ûªm a monster. And now I have blood on my hands, or paws. I don‰Ûªt know.",7
36593,Wil,23, You can‰Ûªt give up. I love you.,7
36594,Penny,23," I love you, too. But I‰Ûªm afraid I love killing more. Like, one day, I might actually try and kill you.",7
36595,Director,23," And cut. All right. All right, let‰Ûªs set up for the next scene.",7
36596,Penny,23," Actually, you know what? Can we do one more? I think I could do it better.",7
36597,Director,23, Let‰Ûªs just move on. No one cares.,7
36598,Penny,23," Well, I care. I mean, look, if we‰Ûªre gonna do this, why not try and make it something we‰Ûªre actually proud of?",7
36599,Director,23," Look, sweetie, this movie is garbage, but you should be happy about that, ‰Ûªcause if it was a good movie, you wouldn‰Ûªt be in it.",7
36600,Leonard,23," Whoa, whoa, hang on. There‰Ûªs no need to insult her.",7
36601,Director,23, And who are you?,7
36602,Leonard,23, I‰Ûªm her boyfriend.,7
36603,Director,23, Isn‰Ûªt she too hot for you?,7
36604,Leonard,23," A little, yeah.",7
36605,Director,23," Well, boyfriend, get off my set.",7
36606,Penny,23, You can‰Ûªt do that. He‰Ûªs with me.,7
36607,Director,23," You know what? You can get off my set, too. You‰Ûªre fired.",7
36608,Penny,23, What? You can‰Ûªt fire me. I‰Ûªm the star. I‰Ûªm the girl that goes bananas. It says so on the poster.,7
36609,Director,23," Yeah, but we just shot the last scene where we see your face. So from now own, the star of the movie is whoever wears this.",7
36610,Wil,23," Hey, if you‰Ûªre gonna fire her, then you have to fire me, too.",7
36611,Scene,23, A bar.,7
36612,Wil,23," Wow, that fell apart really fast.",7
36613,Scene,23, The apartment.,7
36614,Raj,23, Thanks for skipping the movie. I couldn‰Ûªt sit in that theatre for two hours wondering about Emily and that guy.,7
36615,Sheldon,23," Oh, quite all right. After my forehead melanoma scare I‰Ûªve learned not to sweat the small stuff. Well, sorry, I don‰Ûªt have all the ingredients to make chai tea.",7
36616,Raj,23, You don‰Ûªt have to make me anything.,7
36617,Sheldon,23," No, I do. You‰Ûªre upset about Emily and you‰Ûªre Indian. I need to make you chai tea. Now, I have all the ingredients except cardamom seeds. Do you happen to have any on you?",7
36618,Raj,23," Sorry, I left them in my turban.",7
36619,Sheldon,23," Oh, I‰Ûªll make English breakfast tea. They destroyed your culture. That‰Ûªs close enough. You know, I‰Ûªm curious, why are you so upset about seeing Emily with another man?",7
36620,Raj,23, Wouldn‰Ûªt you be upset if you saw Amy out with someone else?,7
36621,Sheldon,23, Can‰Ûªt happen. We have an ironclad relationship agreement which precludes her from physical contact with anyone other than me.,7
36622,Raj,23," But you don‰Ûªt have sex with her, either.",7
36623,Sheldon,23," Slick, huh?",7
36624,Raj,23," To be truthful, Emily and I haven‰Ûªt dated that long, and we never agreed to be exclusive to each other.",7
36625,Sheldon,23, Have you had intercourse?,7
36626,Raj,23, No.,7
36627,Sheldon,23," Well, stick to your guns. There will be a lot of pressure.",7
36628,Scene,23, Mrs Wolowitz‰Ûªs house.,7
36629,Mrs Wolowitz (off),23, I‰Ûªm hungry again.,7
36630,Howard,23, It‰Ûªs like the world‰Ûªs fattest cuckoo clock.,7
36631,Bernadette,23," You know, you‰Ûªre always talking about having a baby someday. This is exactly what it‰Ûªs gonna be like.",7
36632,Howard,23," No, it‰Ûªs not.",7
36633,Bernadette,23," Come on. The constant fussing, eating, pooping, burping, drooling. We‰Ûªre even waiting for the day when she can finally walk on her own.",7
36634,Howard,23, Maybe you‰Ûªre right. Anything she finds on the floor goes right in her mouth.,7
36635,Bernadette,23," I‰Ûªm just telling you now, if we do have kids, don‰Ûªt expect me to do all the work.",7
36636,Howard,23," Hey, I‰Ûªm a very paternal person. I‰Ûªd be excellent at taking care of a baby.",7
36637,Mrs Wolowitz (off),23, I‰Ûªm still hungry.,7
36638,Howard,23," I‰Ûªm coming, you big baby.",7
36639,Scene,23, The bar.,7
36640,Penny,23," You know, the only thing worse than doing a movie where they glue monkey hair to your ass is getting fired from a movie where they glue monkey hair to your ass.",7
36641,Wil,23," Forget it, man, it‰Ûªs crap. You just move on to the next thing.",7
36642,Penny,23," Yeah, well, it‰Ûªs easy for you to say. You used to be famous.",7
36643,Wil,23, Hey. I just lost a job for you.,7
36644,Penny,23," All right, I‰Ûªm sorry, you‰Ûªre famous.",7
36645,Wil,23," Penny, it‰Ûªs not about being famous. It‰Ûªs about the art. It‰Ûªs about the passion we have for our craft. (Text message tone) I have an audition for Sharknado 2. If I book this, I am totally gonna pay you back for this beer.",7
36646,Penny,23," God, what am I doing with my life?",7
36647,Leonard,23, You having second thoughts about acting?,7
36648,Penny,23," You were on set, you saw what it was like.",7
36649,Leonard,23," Yeah, but it‰Ûªs not always that bad.",7
36650,Penny,23," Oh, really?",7
36651,Leonard,23," What about when you did, uh, Anne Frank at that cute little theater?",7
36652,Penny,23, It was over a bowling alley.,7
36653,Leonard,23," Yeah, but there was ample parking.",7
36654,Penny,23, Are you done?,7
36655,Leonard,23, And you were so good in the TV commercial.,7
36656,Penny,23, It was for haemorrhoid cream.,7
36657,Leonard,23, And I got itchy and swollen just watching you.,7
36658,Penny,23," Leonard, you are really not cheering me up.",7
36659,Leonard,23, Come on. How can you be sad when you‰Ûªre going home with all five-foot-six of this?,7
36660,Penny,23," Hmm. You think you‰Ûªre five-foot-six, that‰Ûªs funny.",7
36661,Scene,23, The apartment.,7
36662,Raj,23," I don‰Ûªt understand it. I‰Ûªm a nice guy, I have a great job, I‰Ûªm well-educated, come from a good family. Why don‰Ûªt women want to be with me?",7
36663,Sheldon,23," An interesting question. Well, good night.",7
36664,Raj,23, What? Don‰Ûªt send me home. I can‰Ûªt be alone right now.,7
36665,Sheldon,23, That‰Ûªs your problem. You can‰Ûªt be alone.,7
36666,Raj,23, What do you mean?,7
36667,Sheldon,23, How many women have you had dates with?,7
36668,Raj,23, Eleven.,7
36669,Sheldon,23, How many of those women did you think would become your perfect companion?,7
36670,Raj,23, Eleven. Wait. Do I count the 200-pound Sailor Moon girl that Howard and I had a threesome with at Comic Con?,7
36671,Sheldon,23, Sure.,7
36672,Raj,23, I‰Ûªll stick with eleven. She liked Howard better.,7
36673,Sheldon,23," Well, now do you see the problem?",7
36674,Raj,23," Maybe. I, I don‰Ûªt know.It‰Ûªs late, I should, I should go. Look, I do get what you‰Ûªre saying. Instead of desperately clinging to any woman who will go out with me, I need to work on my fear of being alone.",7
36675,Sheldon,23," I was trying to suggest chemical castration, but it‰Ûªs my bedtime, so whatever gets you out the door. Good night.",7
36676,Scene,23, Mrs Wolowitz‰Ûªs house.,7
36677,Bernadette,23," Howie, I‰Ûªm back!",7
36678,Howard,23," Shh, I just got her to sleep.",7
36679,Bernadette,23, Sorry.,7
36680,Howard,23, What took you so long? The grocery store is a few blocks away.,7
36681,Bernadette,23, They only had regular yoghurt. I had to go to a different store to get the extra-fat kind your mom likes.,7
36682,Howard,23, Then why do I smell coffee on your breath?,7
36683,Bernadette,23," So what? After two days of taking care of her, excuse me for stopping to get a mocha.",7
36684,Howard,23," A mocha? Well, it must be nice to be queen.",7
36685,Bernadette,23, Queen? I‰Ûªve been killing myself here.,7
36686,Howard,23," Well, whose fault is that? I wanted to get a nurse, but you were all, I‰Ûªm nice, I want to take care of people.",7
36687,Bernadette,23, I‰Ûªm glad I got that mocha. And you know what else I‰Ûªm glad about? I bought you a brownie and I ate it in the car.,7
36688,Mrs Wolowitz (off),23, Howard.,7
36689,Howard,23, Thanks a lot. Now I have to go rub her belly again.,7
36690,Scene,23, Raj‰Ûªs apartment.,7
36691,Raj,23, Hey.,7
36692,Emily,23, Thanks for letting me come over.,7
36693,Raj,23," Of course. Please, come in.",7
36694,Emily,23," I just wanted to say how sorry I am about tonight, and I want to make sure that we‰Ûªre okay.",7
36695,Raj,23," Uh, look, you and I haven‰Ûªt made any commitments to each other.",7
36696,Emily,23," I know. I just felt like I needed to explain. The guy I was with did my last tattoo, and he‰Ûªs been asking me out for months. I finally said yes just to get it over with.",7
36697,Raj,23, It‰Ûªs okay.,7
36698,Emily,23, Really?,7
36699,Raj,23," Well, I mean, yeah, it freaked me out a little, but that‰Ûªs my issue, not yours.",7
36700,Emily,23," Wow. If I saw you out with another woman, I‰Ûªd be pretty upset.",7
36701,Raj,23," Thank you. Not just for being upset, but for believing that could happen.",7
36702,Emily,23," Just so you know, I‰Ûªm not seeing anyone else.",7
36703,Raj,23," Well, me, neither.",7
36704,Emily,23, Okay.,7
36705,Raj,23," Okay. Please. So, uh, you, you have tattoos?",7
36706,Emily,23, Yeah.,7
36707,Raj,23, I don‰Ûªt. I have a hole in my belly button that may or may not have been a piercing.,7
36708,Emily,23, That‰Ûªs cool.,7
36709,Raj,23," It‰Ûªs a piercing. So, uh, how many tattoos?",7
36710,Emily,23," One on my shoulder, one not on my shoulder and one really not on my shoulder.",7
36711,Raj,23," It‰Ûªs, uh, been a long time since I‰Ûªve seen a girl‰Ûªs really not her shoulder.",7
36712,Emily,23," Well, how about you show me your piercing and I show you my tattoos?",7
36713,Raj,23," But, uh, before I take my shirt off, I just need like ten minutes to do some crunches.",7
36714,Scene,23, Penny‰Ûªs apartment.,7
36715,Penny,23," Oh, my God. What a day.",7
36716,Leonard,23, Can I get you anything?,7
36717,Penny,23, No. I need to start making some smart decisions.,7
36718,Leonard,23, With your career?,7
36719,Penny,23, With my life.,7
36720,Leonard,23, Like what?,7
36721,Penny,23, I don‰Ûªt know. We could get married.,7
36722,Leonard,23," Come on, be serious.",7
36723,Penny,23, I am.,7
36724,Leonard,23," Why? Because I‰Ûªm a, a smart decision?",7
36725,Penny,23," Well, yeah.",7
36726,Leonard,23, So I‰Ûªm like a bran muffin.,7
36727,Penny,23," What? No, that‰Ûªs not what I‰Ûªm saying.",7
36728,Leonard,23," No, it‰Ûªs exactly what you‰Ûªre saying. I‰Ûªm the boring thing you‰Ûªre choosing because I‰Ûªm good for you.",7
36729,Penny,23," What does it matter? The point is, I‰Ûªm choosing you.",7
36730,Leonard,23," Well, it matters a lot. I don‰Ûªt want to be a bran muffin. I, I want to be a Cinnabon, you know? A strawberry Pop-Tart. Something you‰Ûªre excited about even though it could give you diabetes.",7
36731,Penny,23," Sweetie, you can be any pastry you want.",7
36732,Leonard,23," No, no. No, it‰Ûªs too late. I‰Ûªm your bran muffin. Probably fat-free and good for your colon.",7
36733,Penny,23, You know what? Forget it. I never should‰Ûªve brought it up.,7
36734,Leonard,23," You know I want to marry you, but you‰Ûªre only doing this because you got fired and you‰Ûªre feeling sorry for yourself.",7
36735,Penny,23," Okay, it may look that way, but getting fired from that movie was the best thing that could have happened to me, okay? I finally realize I don‰Ûªt need to be famous or have some big career to be happy.",7
36736,Leonard,23, Then what do you need?,7
36737,Penny,23," You, you stupid Pop-Tart.",7
36738,Leonard,23, Oh. Then I guess I‰Ûªm in.,7
36739,Penny,23, Really? You guess you‰Ûªre in?,7
36740,Leonard,23," Not like, I guess I‰Ûªm in. Like I guess, I‰Ûªm in!",7
36741,Leonard,23," So is that it? Are, are we engaged?",7
36742,Penny,23," Yeah, I think so.",7
36743,Leonard,23, All right.,7
36744,Penny,23, What‰Ûªs wrong?,7
36745,Leonard,23, I‰Ûªm not sure. Just feels a little anticlimactic.,7
36746,Penny,23," Yeah, it kind of does, huh?",7
36747,Leonard,23," Oh, I know. This might help.",7
36748,Penny,23, Where did you get a ring?,7
36749,Leonard,23," I‰Ûªve had it for a couple years, not important. Penny, will you marry me?",7
36750,Penny,23," Oh, my God, yes.",7
36751,Leonard,23, This would have been so much more romantic if you didn‰Ûªt have monkey hair on your finger.,7
36752,Scene,23, Mrs Wolowitz‰Ûªs house.,7
36753,Howard,23, How you feeling?,7
36754,Bernadette,23," Last night was a little rough, but I think we‰Ûªre gonna get through this.",7
36755,Howard,23, I‰Ûªm proud of us.,7
36756,Bernadette,23," Me, too.",7
36757,Mrs Wolowitz (off),23, Where‰Ûªs my pancakes?!,7
36758,Foreign Nurse,23," Coming, Mrs. Wolowitz!",7
36759,Bernadette,23, You were right.,7
36760,Howard,23, Welcome to Team Putz.,7
36761,Scene,24, The Apartment.,7
36762,Leonard,24, How‰Ûªs your mom holding up?,7
36763,Howard,24," She‰Ûªs doing okay, but we just lost another nurse.",7
36764,Amy,24, How many is that now?,7
36765,Howard,24," Two, and I know what you‰Ûªre thinking, she‰Ûªs eating them.",7
36766,Bernadette,24," She‰Ûªs just so impossible, they keep quitting.",7
36767,Sheldon,24," So, who‰Ûªs watching her now?",7
36768,Howard,24, A bowl full of M&M‰Ûªs with a few Ambien tossed in.,7
36769,Raj,24," What up, guys?",7
36770,All,24," Hello, hey!",7
36771,Leonard,24," Okay. Well, now that everyone‰Ûªs here, Penny and I have some big news. We‰Ûªre engaged.",7
36772,Raj,24, And I thought me having sex with Emily was gonna be the big news.,7
36773,Leonard,24," Hey, hey, what the hell?",7
36774,Bernadette,24, You guys propose all the time. This never happens.,7
36775,Penny,24, You‰Ûªre right! Yay!,7
36776,Scene,24, The cafeteria.,7
36777,Raj,24," Boy, I‰Ûªm so hungry today. I wonder why?",7
36778,Howard,24, Because you had sex the other night?,7
36779,Raj,24," You know what? That may be it. By the way, it isn‰Ûªt like riding a bike. Like, I fell off a few times.",7
36780,Leonard,24," Hey, buddy.",7
36781,Sheldon,24, Hello.,7
36782,Leonard,24, You okay?,7
36783,Sheldon,24, I just got called into President Siebert‰Ûªs office. The university won‰Ûªt let me switch my field of study to inflationary cosmology. They‰Ûªre forcing me to continue with string theory.,7
36784,Howard,24, Why?,7
36785,Sheldon,24," He said it‰Ûªs why they hired me, it‰Ûªs, it‰Ûªs what my grant was designated for, and that everybody has to do things they don‰Ûªt want to do. He then gave an example of something he had to do, even though he didn‰Ûªt want to, which was look at my stupid face.",7
36786,Leonard,24," That‰Ûªs a rude thing to say, out loud.",7
36787,Sheldon,24," It‰Ûªs an outrage. Honestly, I‰Ûªm tempted to leave the university.",7
36788,Howard,24," You know, if you‰Ûªre really serious about that, I hear there are some exciting opportunities in home care for the old and fat.",7
36789,Leonard,24," Whatever you do, just don‰Ûªt make any rash decisions.",7
36790,Sheldon,24, I don‰Ûªt know. I am really aggravated.,7
36791,Raj,24," When I‰Ûªm feeling low, I have sex with a girl. But that‰Ûªs just me.",7
36792,Scene,24, Mrs Wolowitz‰Ûªs house.,7
36793,Howard,24," Oh, come on, give her a chance.",7
36794,Nurse,24," No. Life, it is too short.",7
36795,Bernadette,24," I know you‰Ûªve only been here a day and a half, but you‰Ûªre like part of the family. I don‰Ûªt think the service is gonna send any more people.",7
36796,Howard,24," Yeah, maybe it‰Ûªs time we just release Ma back into the sea.",7
36797,Bernadette,24, That‰Ûªs not helpful.,7
36798,Howard,24," Well, then, we may need to get used to the idea that we‰Ûªre gonna be living here the next few months.",7
36799,Bernadette,24, But we have jobs. We can‰Ûªt baby-sit her 24 hours a day.,7
36800,Howard,24," Well, what if we use our vacation time?",7
36801,Bernadette,24," I wanted to go to Hawaii, not hell.",7
36802,Howard,24, I don‰Ûªt know what else we can do.,7
36803,Bernadette,24," Howie, I love you, and as your wife, your mother is every bit as much my problem as she is yours, so, I want a divorce.",7
36804,Scene,24, The apartment.,7
36805,Mrs Hofstadter (on webcam),24," Hello, Leonard.",7
36806,Leonard,24," Hi, Mom. I have some exciting news.",7
36807,Mrs Hofstadter,24, I‰Ûªm listening.,7
36808,Leonard,24," Before I tell you, will you promise to try and be happy for me and keep any concerns you have to yourself?",7
36809,Mrs Hofstadter,24, No. Let me save you all of your hemming and hawing. Sheldon already told me that you and Penny are engaged.,7
36810,Leonard,24, I hate that you talk to him more than you talk to me.,7
36811,Mrs Hofstadter,24, Would you like for you and me to talk more?,7
36812,Leonard,24, You know what? It‰Ûªs probably fine.,7
36813,Mrs Hofstadter,24," In any event, while I‰Ûªve had my misgivings about Penny, Sheldon spoke very fondly of her, and if she is good enough for him, then she‰Ûªs good enough for me.",7
36814,Leonard,24, I‰Ûªm your son. What about the fact that she‰Ûªs good enough for me?,7
36815,Mrs Hofstadter,24, Sure.,7
36816,Leonard,24," Thanks, Mom.",7
36817,Mrs Hofstadter,24," Leonard, would it make you feel better to hear that your mother approved of your life choices?",7
36818,Leonard,24," Yes, it would.",7
36819,Mrs Hofstadter,24," Yeah. Well, you should work on that.",7
36820,Scene,24, Penny‰Ûªs apartment.,7
36821,Penny (on phone),24," No, Mom, it‰Ûªs the same guy I‰Ûªve been going out with for the past two years. Yeah, the scientist. Well, it‰Ûªs complicated. I mean, he works with lasers and atomic magnets. No, I did not see it coming. No, we did not set a date. No, I am not pregnant. Yeah, this is a first for our family. All right, tell Dad I love him. I gotta go. All right, bye.",7
36822,Amy,24, Atomic magnets?,7
36823,Penny,24, Shut up.,7
36824,Bernadette,24," Sorry I‰Ûªm late. The leaf blower broke, so I had to hand-dry my mother-in-law.",7
36825,Penny,24, You want some wine?,7
36826,Bernadette,24," Thanks. Little warning before you jump into this marriage business. You‰Ûªre not just marrying him, you‰Ûªre marrying his family.",7
36827,Penny,24, I think Leonard‰Ûªs mom‰Ûªs okay with me.,7
36828,Bernadette,24," It doesn‰Ûªt matter if she‰Ûªs okay with you. The question is, can she go to the bathroom by herself? Hit me again.",7
36829,Amy,24," So, what are the living arrangements gonna be?",7
36830,Penny,24," Well, haven‰Ûªt really talked about it yet, but I figure at some point, I‰Ûªll move in with him, or he‰Ûªll move in with me.",7
36831,Amy,24," Well, with you not working, that makes financial sense.",7
36832,Bernadette,24, You‰Ûªre not working. How would you like a job in home health care?,7
36833,Penny,24, Not a chance.,7
36834,Bernadette,24, Please. I‰Ûªm desperate.,7
36835,Penny,24, No.,7
36836,Bernadette,24, I‰Ûªll pay you anything you want.,7
36837,Penny,24," Okay, then, yeah.",7
36838,Scene,24, Mrs Wolowitz‰Ûªs house.,7
36839,Penny,24," No, keep your money.",7
36840,Bernadette,24, I could‰Ûªve ridden a bull longer than that.,7
36841,Scene,24, The apartment. ,7
36842,Leonard,24, What you working on?,7
36843,Sheldon,24," I‰Ûªm writing an appeal to the Faculty Senate, so that I can move on from string theory.",7
36844,Leonard,24, Oh. How‰Ûªs it going?,7
36845,Sheldon,24," You tell me. Dear Esteemed Colleagues, as you may know, I have requested to change my field of study. My decision to do so is, I believe, in the best interest of science. At your convenience, I‰Ûªd be happy to explain it to you in words you‰Ûªll understand.",7
36846,Leonard,24, It‰Ûªs nice that you called them esteemed.,7
36847,Sheldon,24, You‰Ûªre right. I‰Ûªll take that out.,7
36848,Leonard,24," So, listen, there was something I was hoping to float past you.",7
36849,Sheldon,24, Mm.,7
36850,Leonard,24," Now that Penny and I are engaged, I thought we might want to talk about our living arrangements.",7
36851,Sheldon,24," Of course. She‰Ûªs spent many nights here, and you‰Ûªre worried about preserving the myth of her virginity before the wedding.",7
36852,Leonard,24, I‰Ûªm not.,7
36853,Sheldon,24," Good, because not only has that ship sailed, if it hit an iceberg, countless men would perish.",7
36854,Leonard,24," Actually, this is about where she and I are going to live.",7
36855,Sheldon,24, What do you mean?,7
36856,Leonard,24," Well, well, we might want to live together.",7
36857,Sheldon,24," Oh, yeah, well, I‰Ûªve already given this some thought, and I‰Ûªm willing to let Penny live with us one day a week for a trial period. Now, obviously, not when she‰Ûªs made cranky by the shedding of her uterine lining.",7
36858,Leonard,24, That‰Ûªs very sweet. But we were thinking more of us maybe living together with‰Û_ not you.,7
36859,Sheldon,24, I don‰Ûªt understand. How could we all live together if I‰Ûªm not there?,7
36860,Leonard,24," Look, I, I know this is, this is change, and that sounds scary.",7
36861,Sheldon,24, Where are you going to go?,7
36862,Leonard,24," I don‰Ûªt know. We just started to think about this. Maybe I‰Ûªll move in with Penny, or maybe she and I‰Ûªll take this place, and you can move across the hall.",7
36863,Sheldon,24, Move across the hall? Did you take a marijuana?,7
36864,Leonard,24," No, I did not.",7
36865,Sheldon,24, Did you get hit on the head with a coconut?,7
36866,Leonard,24, No.,7
36867,Sheldon,24," Well, then, I‰Ûªm all out of guesses. What? Me move across the hall. Why would you even suggest such a thing?",7
36868,Leonard,24," Because I love Penny, and want to give her the life she deserves.",7
36869,Sheldon,24, I see. You‰Ûªre putting your future bride‰Ûªs happiness above mine.,7
36870,Leonard,24," Well, yeah.",7
36871,Sheldon,24, Wow.,7
36872,Scene,24, Amy‰Ûªs apartment. ,7
36873,Sheldon,24, How dare the university force me to go back to string theory?,7
36874,Amy,24, They just don‰Ûªt appreciate you.,7
36875,Sheldon,24," Yeah, and on top of that, Leonard has the audacity to suggest that now that he and Penny are engaged, he may not want to live with me any more.",7
36876,Amy,24," Here, I made you some Strawberry Quik.",7
36877,Sheldon,24," I have real problems here, Amy. I can‰Ûªt be mollified with a beverage designed for children. Mmm, yummy.",7
36878,Amy,24," You know, this might work out for the best. I mean, you‰Ûªre always complaining about what a terrible roommate Leonard is. Like how he turns up the thermostat when you‰Ûªre not there.",7
36879,Sheldon,24," Ugh, it‰Ûªs like walking into the Amazon. And not the good Amazon with one-day shipping. The awful one with birds and snakes.",7
36880,Amy,24, You hate the sound of all those keys on his key chain.,7
36881,Sheldon,24," Four keys! Who does he think he is, a warden?",7
36882,Amy,24, See? Maybe you‰Ûªll love living alone.,7
36883,Sheldon,24, I don‰Ûªt know. Perhaps.,7
36884,Amy,24," And if it turns out you don‰Ûªt, you and I could live together.",7
36885,Sheldon,24," You and‰Û_ oh, sure, and while we‰Ûªre at it, why don‰Ûªt we get engaged, too? Why don‰Ûªt we get a little house, start a family? Enjoy our sunset years together? Do you hear yourself, woman?",7
36886,Amy,24," Sheldon, it was just a thought.",7
36887,Sheldon,24," No. Here‰Ûªs a thought. You‰Ûªre not moving in, Leonard‰Ûªs not moving out, everything stays exactly the way it is. And by the way, I saw you make this Strawberry Quik with syrup, you‰Ûªre supposed to use the powder.",7
36888,Amy,24, It tastes the same.,7
36889,Sheldon,24, No. The syrup tastes better and I don‰Ûªt like it.,7
36890,Scene,24, The apartment. ,7
36891,Penny,24, This is so sweet. You never cook for me.,7
36892,Leonard,24," Well, you cook for me all the time and, ugh.",7
36893,Penny,24," If you don‰Ûªt like my cooking, why haven‰Ûªt you ever said anything?",7
36894,Leonard,24, It‰Ûªs hard to talk with so much heavy chewing to do.,7
36895,Penny,24, Sorry. I‰Ûªll get better.,7
36896,Leonard,24," I know you‰Ûªll try. So, should we talk about setting a date?",7
36897,Penny,24," Well, I‰Ûªd like to pick one that works with my brother‰Ûªs schedule.",7
36898,Leonard,24, Okay. And when would that be?,7
36899,Penny,24," Uh, 12 to 18 months from now, depending on good behaviour.",7
36900,Amy,24," Hi, is Sheldon here?",7
36901,Leonard,24," No, I thought he was with you.",7
36902,Amy,24," He was, but he stormed off and now he isn‰Ûªt answering his phone.",7
36903,Leonard,24, What happened?,7
36904,Amy,24, He was really angry that you suggested he move out.,7
36905,Leonard,24, Oh.,7
36906,Amy,24, I also mentioned that he and I could live together but he was too mad at you to realize what a great idea that is.,7
36907,Leonard,24," Well, he‰Ûªs been having a couple of tough days. I‰Ûªm sure he‰Ûªs fine. He probably just needs a little alone time to decompress.",7
36908,Amy,24," You‰Ûªre probably right. So, what are you guys doing?",7
36909,Penny,24," Well, Leonard cooked for me and now we‰Ûªre just having a nice dinner, you know, as a newly engaged couple.",7
36910,Amy,24, That‰Ûªs nice.,7
36911,Leonard,24," Anyway, as I was saying, Sheldon probably just needs a little alone time. ‰Û÷Cause that‰Ûªs important. Not just for him, but for most anybody, really.",7
36912,Amy,24," Don‰Ûªt I know it. What is that, polenta?",7
36913,Penny,24," Amy, get out.",7
36914,Amy,24, Right.,7
36915,Scene,24, The comic book store.,7
36916,Sheldon,24, No.,7
36917,Stuart,24," Hey, Sheldon.",7
36918,Sheldon,24, What happened?,7
36919,Stuart,24, I was cooking in the back room last night and the hot plate caught on fire.,7
36920,Sheldon,24, And you couldn‰Ûªt put it out?,7
36921,Stuart,24," I was across the street at the do-it-yourself car wash, taking a shower.",7
36922,Sheldon,24, So when will you reopen?,7
36923,Stuart,24," Um, I don‰Ûªt know. I‰Ûªm waiting to hear back from the insurance company.",7
36924,Sheldon,24," So, tomorrow?",7
36925,Stuart,24," I don‰Ûªt mean to be rude, Sheldon, but, uh, my life is kind of falling apart right now.",7
36926,Sheldon,24," Your life? The university is making me do string theory and my girlfriend loves me so much she wants to live with me. And now, the place I need to go when I‰Ûªm sad is damp and smells funny.",7
36927,Stuart,24," Well, sorry I let you down.",7
36928,Sheldon,24," No. I do not accept this. Everything is changing and I hate it. It stops now. I‰Ûªm helping you get back on your feet. I would like to purchase this comic book, please.",7
36929,Stuart,24, That‰Ûªll be $2.99.,7
36930,Sheldon,24, Really? It‰Ûªs soaking wet.,7
36931,Stuart,24," Fine, a dollar.",7
36932,Sheldon,24, Can you break a twenty?,7
36933,Stuart,24," No, I only have hundreds.",7
36934,Sheldon,24," You know what? I don‰Ûªt always recognize sarcasm, but I do right now, and I don‰Ûªt appreciate it. I‰Ûªm sorry for your loss. But you‰Ûªre not the only one whose day has been a disaster.",7
36935,Stuart,24, (Light falls on ground just where he was standing a moment before) That could have killed me. I can‰Ûªt catch a break.,7
36936,Scene,24, The apartment. ,7
36937,Leonard,24, I haven‰Ûªt heard from Sheldon in a while. You think he‰Ûªs okay?,7
36938,Penny,24," Oh, I‰Ûªm sure he‰Ûªs fine.",7
36939,Leonard,24, I‰Ûªm gonna see where he is.,7
36940,Penny,24, How?,7
36941,Leonard,24," Oh, I know his password, so I can track his phone.",7
36942,Penny,24, You do that?,7
36943,Leonard,24," Not always, but ever since he wandered off at the swap meet chasing a balloon, I get worried.",7
36944,Penny,24," He can take care of himself. Look, we went over stranger danger and gave him that whistle.",7
36945,Leonard,24, That‰Ûªs weird.,7
36946,Penny,24, What?,7
36947,Leonard,24, He‰Ûªs at the train station.,7
36948,Penny,24, So? He loves trains.,7
36949,Leonard,24," It‰Ûªs dark out and he‰Ûªs alone, I don‰Ûªt like it. Let‰Ûªs go get him.",7
36950,Penny,24, It‰Ûªs sweet how you look out for him. You‰Ûªre a good guy.,7
36951,Leonard,24, It‰Ûªs not just that. My mother would kill me if I let something happen to him.,7
36952,Scene,24, The comic book store.,7
36953,Raj,24," Dude, I‰Ûªm so sorry.",7
36954,Howard,24," Don‰Ûªt take this the wrong way, but did you do this for the insurance money?",7
36955,Stuart,24," No. God, you sound like the police, the firemen, my parents, my therapist and the insurance company.",7
36956,Raj,24," We‰Ûªre here for you, man. Whatever you need, okay?",7
36957,Stuart,24," Uh, actually, I was wondering if I could crash at your place for a few nights.",7
36958,Raj,24," Sure, of course. Oh, actually, Emily was gonna spend the night.",7
36959,Stuart,24, You slept with her? Nice.,7
36960,Raj,24," Well, I can‰Ûªt take all the credit. She let me do it to her, but, uh, but I can always call her and cancel.",7
36961,Howard,24, Hang on. I know a place you can stay and earn some money at the same time.,7
36962,Stuart,24, Great.,7
36963,Howard,24," I just have to warn you, it‰Ûªll involve humiliation, degradation and verbal abuse.",7
36964,Stuart,24, So what‰Ûªs the catch?,7
36965,Scene,24, The train station.,7
36966,Leonard,24, Sheldon.,7
36967,Sheldon,24, You tracked my phone?,7
36968,Leonard,24, Yeah.,7
36969,Sheldon,24," Boy, you chase one balloon for three miles.",7
36970,Penny,24, We were worried about you.,7
36971,Sheldon,24, Don‰Ûªt be melodramatic. I‰Ûªm just getting on a train and leaving forever.,7
36972,Leonard,24, Seriously? You don‰Ûªt even have a change of clothes or a toothbrush.,7
36973,Sheldon,24, My plan is to stop at malls and buy what I need. It‰Ûªs called living off the land.,7
36974,Leonard,24," Okay, I know you‰Ûªre upset and there‰Ûªs a lot of stuff going on, but it‰Ûªs nothing we can‰Ûªt work out. Come on, let‰Ûªs get you home.",7
36975,Sheldon,24, No. I‰Ûªve reached my breaking point. I need to leave. Now.,7
36976,Penny,24, And go where?,7
36977,Sheldon,24, It doesn‰Ûªt matter.,7
36978,Leonard,24, So a few things don‰Ûªt go your way and your best decision is to ride the rails like a hobo?,7
36979,Sheldon,24, I suppose it is. Except I have a credit card. And I refuse to carry my laptop at the end of a stick. And I‰Ûªd sooner die than eat beans out of a can.,7
36980,Leonard,24," Come on, come home with us and tomorrow I‰Ûªll, I‰Ûªll take you to Legoland.",7
36981,Sheldon,24, Legoland is not the solution to everything. And it‰Ûªs too much of a scene since that movie came out.,7
36982,Leonard,24, Then what can I do?,7
36983,Sheldon,24," Leonard, I am overwhelmed. Everything is changing and it‰Ûªs simply too much. I need to get away and think.",7
36984,Leonard,24," Oh, come on, you know you‰Ûªre overreacting.",7
36985,Penny,24," Leonard, hang on. Just come here. Maybe we need to let him go.",7
36986,Leonard,24, What? Why?,7
36987,Penny,24, It might be good for him.,7
36988,Leonard,24, You know he can‰Ûªt take a trip like this by himself.,7
36989,Penny,24, He‰Ûªs a grown man.,7
36990,Leonard,24," No, he looks like a grown man. You‰Ûªve seen Freaky Friday, sometimes little kids end up in big person bodies.",7
36991,Penny,24," Leonard, we can‰Ûªt protect him forever.",7
36992,Leonard,24," I know, but‰Û_",7
36993,Penny,24," He‰Ûªll be okay. You taught him well, Padawan.",7
36994,Sheldon,24," Good Lord. Padawan‰Ûªs the student, not the teacher.",7
36995,Penny,24," Seriously, let him go.",7
36996,Leonard,24," Sheldon, if you really need to do this, I‰Ûªm not gonna stand in your way.",7
36997,Sheldon,24, I do.,7
36998,Leonard,24, Okay. Good luck.,7
36999,Penny,24, Be safe and call us.,7
37000,Sheldon,24, I will.,7
37001,Leonard,24," Bye, buddy. Sheldon?",7
37002,Sheldon,24, Yes?,7
37003,Leonard,24, I‰Ûªm gonna miss you.,7
37004,Sheldon,24, Of course you are.,7
37005,Leonard,24, He just made that easier.,7
37006,Penny,24, Mm.,7
37007,Scene,24, Mrs Wolowitz‰Ûªs house.,7
37008,Stuart,24," Hey. What are you guys still doing here? I got this, go. Go home.",7
37009,Howard,24, You sure?,7
37010,Stuart,24," Yeah, she‰Ûªs fed, she took her pills, she‰Ûªs all tucked in and watching TV.",7
37011,Bernadette,24," So, she‰Ûªs not too much for you?",7
37012,Stuart,24," Are you kidding? I love her, she‰Ûªs great.",7
37013,Mrs Wolowitz (off),24," Stewie, you gonna watch Wheel of Fortune with me?",7
37014,Stuart,24," Coming, Debbie.",7
37015,Howard,24, You call her Debbie?,7
37016,Stuart,24," She insisted. So, hey, guys, thank you so much. This job is a dream come true.",7
37017,Howard,24, Was that a little weird?,7
37018,Bernadette,24," Yeah. I don‰Ûªt know why, but something about it feels unnatural.",7
37019,Howard,24," Okay, let‰Ûªs go.",7
37020,Bernadette,24, Yep.,7
37021,Scene,24, The apartment.,7
37022,Amy (on phone),24," Okay, Sheldon, thanks for checking in. Talk to you tomorrow? Oh, okay, bye.",7
37023,Leonard,24, He‰Ûªs okay?,7
37024,Amy,24, Actually sounds like he‰Ûªs doing pretty well.,7
37025,Penny,24, I really think this is gonna be for the best.,7
37026,Leonard,24," Me, too. And he was able to take a sabbatical from‰Û_",7
37027,Amy,24, How could you let him go?,7
37028,Scene,1, A railway station. Sheldon is wearing no trousers.,8
37029,Sheldon,1," Excuse me. Is it at all possible that you‰Ûªre knitting a pair of pants? Oh, well, no, you‰Ûªre understandably terrified. But, you know, allow me to explain. 45 days ago, um, I embarked on a railroad journey of healing because my university was making me do string theory, and my favorite comic book store burned down, and when my room mate got engaged, my girlfriend wanted to move in with me, which was no doubt a ploy just to see my, well, excuse my language, but my bathing suit parts. Uh, sir, may I use your phone?",8
37030,Man,1, I don‰Ûªt think so.,8
37031,Sheldon,1," Yeah, well, I understand that I‰Ûªm half naked, but there is a reasonable explanation. While I slept in my sleeper car, all my possessions were stolen. Now, typically, I wear pyjamas, but I recently adopted a hobo lifestyle and pyjamas are the sleep-pants of the Man. I‰Ûªll have you know, Mahatma Gandhi wore no pants and a nation rallied behind him. My good man, now, before you walk away, I know that I may appear deranged, but I am, in fact, a world-renowned physicist. Ask me the difference between a boson and a fermion. Go ahead, ask. Bosons have integer spin, fermions have half-integer spin. My legs are getting cold. Why won‰Ûªt anybody help me?",8
37032,Scene,1, The apartment.,8
37033,Leonard,1, Morning.,8
37034,Penny,1, Hi. Want to do yoga with me?,8
37035,Leonard,1," Um, let me just have some coffee first, and then I‰Ûªll have the strength to tell you how much I won‰Ûªt be doing that. (Phone rings) Hello?",8
37036,Sheldon,1," Hello, Leonard.",8
37037,Leonard,1," Hey, buddy. Good to hear your voice.",8
37038,Sheldon,1," Uh, I‰Ûªm in Kingman, Arizona, and, uh, I need you to come pick me up.",8
37039,Leonard,1, I‰Ûªd love to. I‰Ûªm just about to do yoga with Penny.,8
37040,Sheldon,1," Leonard, I‰Ûªm at the police station. I was robbed. They took my phone, my wallet, my iPad, everything.",8
37041,Leonard,1," Oh, my God, are you okay?",8
37042,Sheldon,1," No, I‰Ûªm not okay. Uh, I‰Ûªm wearing borrowed pants, I don‰Ûªt have I.D., and one of the officers here won‰Ûªt stop calling me chicken legs.",8
37043,Leonard,1," Okay. Uh, I‰Ûªll, I‰Ûªll come get you. What‰Ûªs the address?",8
37044,Penny,1," Hey, what‰Ûªs going on?",8
37045,Leonard,1, He got all of his stuff stolen.,8
37046,Penny,1, Oh.,8
37047,Sheldon,1," 2530 East Andy Devine Avenue,",8
37048,Leonard,1, Okay.,8
37049,Sheldon,1, Hurry.,8
37050,Leonard,1," Sheldon, hang tight. Hey, do you want me to bring anything?",8
37051,Sheldon,1," Oh, yes, please. A pair of pants. And my toothbrush. Yeah, and my mail. And a really good comeback for chicken legs, because ‰ÛÏI know you are, but what am I?‰Û was met with stony silence.",8
37052,Leonard,1, I‰Ûªll be there as soon as I can.,8
37053,Penny,1, Is he okay?,8
37054,Leonard,1," Yeah, he‰Ûªs fine, he‰Ûªs just a little rattled.",8
37055,Penny,1, Oh.,8
37056,Leonard,1, Feel like driving to Arizona with me?,8
37057,Penny,1," I can‰Ûªt, I have that job interview.",8
37058,Leonard,1," Oh, right.",8
37059,Penny,1," Besides, I don‰Ûªt need six hours of your hair is different, why did you change your hair? I‰Ûªm holding my breath until your hair grows back.",8
37060,Leonard,1," All right, fine. Hey, can you think of a reason I shouldn‰Ûªt invite Amy to come with me?",8
37061,Penny,1, Nope.,8
37062,Leonard,1," Come on, you didn‰Ûªt even try.",8
37063,Scene,1, Howard‰Ûªs car.,8
37064,Raj,1, Thanks for the lift.,8
37065,Howard,1, What‰Ûªs wrong with your car?,8
37066,Raj,1, I‰Ûªm having my windows untinted.,8
37067,Howard,1, Why?,8
37068,Raj,1, Got a hot girlfriend now. I want the haters to know.,8
37069,Howard,1, What are you talking about? No one‰Ûªs paying attention to you.,8
37070,Raj,1," Wow. How‰Ûªs that Hater-Ade taste, bro? Hey, this isn‰Ûªt the way to work.",8
37071,Howard,1, I just want to pop in and make sure Ma‰Ûªs okay.,8
37072,Raj,1, I thought Stuart was looking after her.,8
37073,Howard,1," He was, but now that her cast is off, he moved out. And honestly, I‰Ûªm kind of glad. It was getting a little weird.",8
37074,Raj,1, How so?,8
37075,Howard,1," I don‰Ûªt know, they‰Ûªre, chummy.",8
37076,Raj,1, Like us?,8
37077,Howard,1," No, not like us. Creepy chummy, like you and your dog.",8
37078,Raj,1, She feeds him out of her own mouth?,8
37079,Howard,1," I mean, he calls her Debbie, she calls him Stewie and they‰Ûªre all giggly around each other. And believe me, when food goes in that mouth, it does not come out.",8
37080,Raj,1, So are you worried because he‰Ûªs replacing you as a son or are you worried because he‰Ûªs becoming her lover?,8
37081,Howard,1," First of all, no one can replace me as a son. I‰Ûªm her little matzo ball. And secondly, my mother is well past having any kind of sex life.",8
37082,Raj,1," Okay, okay. Although many older women lead vibrant, active‰Û_",8
37083,Howard,1, I said well past it.,8
37084,Scene,1, Kingman Police Station.,8
37085,Sheldon,1," Excuse me, Officer Hernandez? Any leads on the person who stole my belongings?",8
37086,Hernandez,1, Not yet.,8
37087,Sheldon,1," Well, perhaps I can help. Sherlock Holmes always says when you eliminate the impossible, whatever remains, however improbable, must be the truth. Now, have, have you tried doing that?",8
37088,Hernandez,1, Nope.,8
37089,Sheldon,1," Well, maybe you should. There‰Ûªs lots of books called Sherlock Holmes, and there‰Ûªs no books called Officer Hernandez.",8
37090,Scene,1, Leonard‰Ûªs car.,8
37091,Leonard,1, Thanks again for coming. Six hours was gonna be a long drive by myself.,8
37092,Amy,1," My pleasure. And I‰Ûªm not angry at all that my boyfriend was in trouble and called you instead of me. I love that,",8
37093,Leonard,1," Yeah, time‰Ûªs gonna fly by.",8
37094,Scene,1, Howard and Bernadette‰Ûªs apartment.,8
37095,Penny,1, I haven‰Ûªt been on a job interview in years. I‰Ûªm really nervous.,8
37096,Bernadette,1," Don‰Ûªt be. You are built for pharmaceutical sales. You‰Ûªre cute, you‰Ûªre flirty and started that like there were gonna be three things.",8
37097,Penny,1, I don‰Ûªt have any experience in sales. Unless you count the bikini car wash I did in high school. But you already made me take that off my rÌ©sumÌ©.,8
37098,Bernadette,1," This job is a lot like being a waitress, except instead of pushing the fish tacos ‰Ûªcause they‰Ûªre about to go bad, you‰Ûªre just pushing our antidepressants before the FDA finds out they may cause rectal bleeding.",8
37099,Penny,1, They do?,8
37100,Bernadette,1," Maybe. But like our lawyers say, the world is full of things that can cause a rectum to bleed. Anyway, I talked you up to Dan. He‰Ûªs the guy who‰Ûªll be interviewing you.",8
37101,Penny,1," Oh, I really appreciate this. I just hope I‰Ûªm not in over my head.",8
37102,Bernadette,1, You‰Ûªll be fine. Just be yourself.,8
37103,Penny,1, I wish I felt more confident.,8
37104,Bernadette,1," Penny, I wouldn‰Ûªt have put you up for this job if I didn‰Ûªt think you could handle it.",8
37105,Penny,1," Oh, thank you, but maybe I should cancel.",8
37106,Bernadette,1, It‰Ûªs too late to cancel. You‰Ûªre going.,8
37107,Penny,1, But I don‰Ûªt know anything about pharmaceuticals.,8
37108,Bernadette,1," Oh, I understand. You want to do something you‰Ûªre already good at. I know. Why don‰Ûªt I get you a job at the Sitting Around All Day Wearing Yoga Pants Factory?",8
37109,Penny,1, They‰Ûªre comfortable.,8
37110,Scene,1, Mrs Wolowitz‰Ûªs house.,8
37111,Howard,1," Ma, I hope you‰Ûªre decent. Raj is here. You just started seeing naked women again, and I don‰Ûªt want you to be confused about where the boobs should be.",8
37112,Stuart,1," Oh, hey, guys. What are you doing here?",8
37113,Howard,1," Uh, what are you doing here? I thought you moved out.",8
37114,Stuart,1," Oh, yeah, I was going to, and then Debbie and I got to talking over dinner the other night. I didn‰Ûªt have any place to go, she likes having me around, so we both said, why leave? at the same time. It was precious.",8
37115,Howard,1, It‰Ûªs not that precious.,8
37116,Raj,1," I‰Ûªd like to back you up, but it sounds like it was pretty precious.",8
37117,Mrs Wolowitz (off),1," Stewie, I can‰Ûªt find my glasses.",8
37118,Stuart,1," Be right there, Deb Deb. They‰Ûªre probably on her head.",8
37119,Howard,1, Or in her neck. Listen. You staying here seems like something she would‰Ûªve talked to me about.,8
37120,Stuart,1," Well, maybe if you called your mother more often, you‰Ûªd know.",8
37121,Raj,1, It wouldn‰Ûªt kill you to pick up the phone.,8
37122,Scene,1, Kingman Police Station.,8
37123,Sheldon,1, Any word on my stolen items?,8
37124,Hernandez,1, We‰Ûªre doing everything we can.,8
37125,Sheldon,1," You know, Sherlock Holmes liked to use cocaine to sharpen his focus. But I‰Ûªm sure those Cool Ranch Doritos are doing the trick.",8
37126,Leonard,1, Sheldon.,8
37127,Sheldon,1," Leonard. Oh, I‰Ûªm so happy to see you.",8
37128,Amy,1, Are you okay?,8
37129,Sheldon,1," Oh, I‰Ûªm fine. Why did you come?",8
37130,Amy,1," What do you mean, why did I come? You‰Ûªre my boyfriend. I haven‰Ûªt seen you in over a month. I just drove six hours to help you out. Don‰Ûªt you have anything to say besides why did you come?",8
37131,Sheldon,1," I do, but, I feel uncomfortable saying it out loud in front of these police officers.",8
37132,Amy,1, Fine. Whisper it.,8
37133,Sheldon (whispers),1, Shotgun.,8
37134,Scene,1, Leonard‰Ûªs car.,8
37135,Leonard,1," So, Sheldon, tell us about your trip. Where‰Ûªd you go?",8
37136,Sheldon,1," Where didn‰Ûªt I go? I went to New York, Chicago, Atlanta, Denver, Seattle.",8
37137,Leonard,1, How were they?,8
37138,Sheldon,1," Oh, I have no idea. I never left the train station.",8
37139,Leonard,1, Hang on. You travelled across the entire country and never left a train station?,8
37140,Sheldon,1, Why would I? That‰Ûªs where all the cool trains are.,8
37141,Leonard,1," I‰Ûªm sorry, so you never went outside?",8
37142,Sheldon,1, Or had a single piece of fruit.,8
37143,Scene,1, Pharmaceutical Company Office.,8
37144,Dan,1," So, why do you think you‰Ûªd make a good pharmaceutical sales rep?",8
37145,Penny,1," Well, I‰Ûªm a people person. People like me. Some of my favourite people are people. I feel like I‰Ûªm saying people a lot. People, people, people. Okay, I‰Ûªm done.",8
37146,Dan,1, You sure?,8
37147,Penny,1, People. Yes.,8
37148,Dan,1," Good. So, how do you feel your previous job experience has prepared you for a career like this?",8
37149,Penny,1," Uh, well, as a waitress, sales was a big part of my job. I mean, believe me, I convinced a lot of very large customers, who should not be eating cheesecake, to have more cheesecake. I mean, one of those chubsters even had an insulin pump.",8
37150,Dan,1, Uh-huh. I have an insulin pump.,8
37151,Penny,1, People.,8
37152,Scene,1, Howard‰Ûªs car.,8
37153,Howard,1," It‰Ûªs weird, right? A grown man in his thirties living with my mother.",8
37154,Raj,1," That is weird. I thought he was, like, 45.",8
37155,Howard,1," Come on, you don‰Ûªt think it‰Ûªs a little odd?",8
37156,Raj,1," I don‰Ûªt know. I mean, she‰Ûªs lonely. He needs a place to stay. I doubt there‰Ûªs any funny business going on. And even if there was, who cares? They‰Ûªre both adults.",8
37157,Howard,1, Who cares? You wouldn‰Ûªt care if I slept with your mom?,8
37158,Raj,1," You know what? You‰Ûªre my best friend, and she‰Ûªs in a bad marriage. I give you my blessing.",8
37159,Howard,1, This is stupid. I‰Ûªm just gonna call my mother and be honest with her.,8
37160,Raj,1, ‰Û÷Cause that‰Ûªs what little matzo balls do.,8
37161,Stuart (voice on answerphone),1, This is Debbie.,8
37162,Mrs Wolowitz (voice on answerphone),1, And this is Stuart.,8
37163,Together,1, Just kidding.,8
37164,Stuart (voice on answerphone),1, Leave a message.,8
37165,Raj,1, This is the part where you talk.,8
37166,Scene,1, Pharmaceutical Company Office.,8
37167,Dan,1," All right, let‰Ûªs say a physician was prescribing one of our competitor‰Ûªs drugs. How would you convince them to switch to ours?",8
37168,Penny,1," Um, any chance his car needs to be washed by a girl in a bikini? No. Okay, I‰Ûªm really sorry for wasting your time.",8
37169,Dan,1, Don‰Ûªt worry about it. Thanks for stopping by.,8
37170,Penny,1," Okay, thanks. Um, I‰Ûªm sorry, listen, could you do me a favour and not tell Bernadette how badly I blew this interview? She‰Ûªll get upset. And honestly I‰Ûªm a, a little terrified of her.",8
37171,Dan,1," Wait, wait. You‰Ûªre scared of Bernadette?",8
37172,Penny,1," Yeah, kind of.",8
37173,Dan,1, I thought it was just me. Everyone thinks she‰Ûªs so nice with that squeaky little voice.,8
37174,Penny,1," I know, but she‰Ûªs kind of a bully.",8
37175,Dan,1," Wll, she is. I didn‰Ûªt even want to meet you, but, uh, I was too scared to say no to her.",8
37176,Penny,1," Me, too.",8
37177,Dan,1," Yeah, yeah. One, one time, I had, I had to tell her we were cutting the, the research funding for one of the drugs she was developing.",8
37178,Penny,1, What happened?,8
37179,Dan,1," I couldn‰Ûªt do it. She‰Ûªs still working on it. Oh, we‰Ûªre not gonna tell her about this, right?",8
37180,Penny,1," Oh, my God, no.",8
37181,Scene,1, Leonard‰Ûªs car.,8
37182,Sheldon,1," At the hot dog stand in the Denver train station, Heinz ketchup. At the hot dog stand in the Salt Lake City train station, Heinz ketchup. At the hot dog stand in the Indianapolis train station?",8
37183,Leonard,1, I don‰Ûªt care.,8
37184,Sheldon,1," Wrong. Hunt‰Ûªs. Hey, Amy, what do you say? You ready to move on to the mustard round?",8
37185,Amy,1, Have you not noticed that I‰Ûªve been sitting back here quietly stewing for the past two hours?,8
37186,Sheldon,1, I just thought you were bad at the game.,8
37187,Amy,1," I‰Ûªm mad at you. How could you just go away like that without even saying good-bye, and then call Leonard for help instead of me?",8
37188,Sheldon,1," Amy, may I please have a moment of privacy to speak with my roommate?",8
37189,Amy,1, We‰Ûªre in a moving car. What do you expect me to do? Stick my fingers in my ears?,8
37190,Sheldon,1," Well, I was thinking put your head out the window like a dog, but that‰Ûªll work. Please? This‰Ûªll be quick. Leonard? As soon as we get home, I want to have coitus with Amy. Okay, she can‰Ûªt hear. The reason I called you is because I didn‰Ûªt want Amy to know I couldn‰Ûªt make it on my own.",8
37191,Leonard,1, What‰Ûªs the big deal?,8
37192,Sheldon,1," Oh, of course it‰Ûªs no big deal to you. You idolize me, and nothing could ever knock me off that pedestal you put me on.",8
37193,Leonard,1," Well, yeah, it‰Ûªs true. You, you are a god to me.",8
37194,Amy,1, Can I stop now?,8
37195,Leonard,1, Just tell her.,8
37196,Sheldon,1, I called Leonard because I failed. And I didn‰Ûªt want you to think less of me.,8
37197,Amy,1, You were worried about that?,8
37198,Sheldon,1, Yes.,8
37199,Amy,1," Sheldon, it‰Ûªs okay with me that you‰Ûªre not perfect.",8
37200,Sheldon,1, Can I have one more moment with Leonard?,8
37201,Amy,1, Sure.,8
37202,Sheldon,1, Amy just hurt my feelings. I want to break up with her.,8
37203,Scene,1, Howard and Bernadette‰Ûªs apartment.,8
37204,Howard,1," Now, I never thought I‰Ûªd say this, but I‰Ûªm kind of excited to see Sheldon.",8
37205,Bernadette,1," I never thought I‰Ûªd say this, but Penny got a job today.",8
37206,Howard,1, She did?,8
37207,Bernadette,1," Well, the only reason she got it is ‰Ûªcause the guy who interviewed her loves me.",8
37208,Howard (answering a knock on the door),1, What do you want?,8
37209,Stuart,1," I, uh, kind of got the feeling you might not be okay with me staying at your mom‰Ûªs.",8
37210,Howard,1," You‰Ûªre right, I‰Ûªm not. I think it‰Ûªs weird.",8
37211,Bernadette,1, Howie?,8
37212,Howard,1," It is. He‰Ûªs a grown man. He‰Ûªs just gonna live there rent-free? How is that gonna motivate him to get off his butt and get a job? I mean, do you even have a plan?",8
37213,Stuart,1," Hey, you‰Ûªre not my father, okay? And besides, your mother and I were talking‰Û_",8
37214,Howard,1, Your mother and I? You‰Ûªre not my father.,8
37215,Stuart,1, I didn‰Ûªt say I was your father.,8
37216,Howard,1," Well, I didn‰Ûªt say I was your father.",8
37217,Bernadette,1," Okay, calm down. You‰Ûªre not his father, he‰Ûªs not your father. Nobody‰Ûªs anybody‰Ûªs father.",8
37218,Stuart,1," I, I‰Ûªm sorry you don‰Ûªt like my life choices, but it‰Ûªs my life.",8
37219,Howard,1," Well, it‰Ûªs my house, it‰Ûªs my rules.",8
37220,Stuart,1," Oh, oh, okay, Dad, if I mow the lawn, can I have my allowance?",8
37221,Bernadette,1," Hey, don‰Ûªt you take that sarcastic tone with him.",8
37222,Stuart,1, I don‰Ûªt have to listen to you.,8
37223,Howard,1, Don‰Ûªt talk to her like that. That is my mother. Wife. My wife. I said my wife.,8
37224,Stuart,1," You know what? This isn‰Ûªt getting us anywhere. When you‰Ûªre ready to apologize, you know where to find me.",8
37225,Howard,1," Yeah, in my house.",8
37226,Stuart,1," That‰Ûªs right, sucka.",8
37227,Scene,1, The stairwell. ,8
37228,Sheldon,1, I wish I‰Ûªd never gone on that trip. I feel no better now than when I left.,8
37229,Amy,1, But you still accomplished something.,8
37230,Leonard,1," Yeah. If you had told anyone that you were going away on a train by yourself across the country, do you know what they would have said?",8
37231,Sheldon,1, That I couldn‰Ûªt do it?,8
37232,Leonard,1, Exactly. Right after they said yeah.,8
37233,Amy,1, But you did do it. So what if it didn‰Ûªt all go your way? That‰Ûªs what makes it an adventure.,8
37234,Sheldon,1," That‰Ûªs a good point. You know, I‰Ûªm a lot like Gandalf the Grey. He fought the Balrog and emerged stronger than ever as Gandalf the White. I was robbed of my phone and pants, and I, too, came back stronger. And whiter, too, ‰Ûªcause I wasn‰Ûªt in direct sunlight for six weeks.",8
37235,Amy,1, See? This trip was good for you.,8
37236,Sheldon,1," Indeed. I was the world‰Ûªs smartest caterpillar. And then after pupating in our nation‰Ûªs railway system, I‰Ûªve burst forth as the world‰Ûªs smartest butterfly.",8
37237,Leonard,1, Butterfly could‰Ûªve gotten himself home from Arizona.,8
37238,Sheldon,1," Yeah, I feel renewed. I‰Ûªm ready to deal with any changes that come my way.",8
37239,All,1, Hey.,8
37240,Penny,1," Hey, look who‰Ûªs back.",8
37241,Sheldon,1, Your hair is different. You changed your hair. I can‰Ûªt take this. I‰Ûªm out.,8
37242,Scene,1, The apartment.,8
37243,Sheldon,1, Would you like to see pictures from my trip?,8
37244,Penny,1, I thought your phone got stolen.,8
37245,Sheldon,1," Yeah, it did, but luckily all my photos got backed up to the Cloud.",8
37246,Leonard,1, And you thought they all had a silver lining.,8
37247,Sheldon,1," Here, day one, uh, this was the seat I was going to sit in but didn‰Ûªt because there were cracker crumbs on it. As it was first class, I suspect Ritz. This is the train bathroom. This is the Imodium I took so I would never have to use the train bathroom.",8
37248,Penny,1, I cannot believe you travelled the entire country and never left the train station.,8
37249,Sheldon,1," I know. You know, I almost died in a fire in Des Moines, but I stayed put. FYI, that‰Ûªs when the Imodium gave out.",8
37250,Scene,2, The apartment.,8
37251,Sheldon,2," I recently read that during World War Two, Joseph Stalin had a research program to create supersoldiers by having women impregnated by gorillas.",8
37252,Howard,2, What a sick use of science.,8
37253,Raj,2," Hey, as long as the baby‰Ûªs healthy.",8
37254,Amy,2, I wonder if Stalin considered any other animals.,8
37255,Leonard,2," Hippos are the deadliest creature. A half-human, half-hippo soldier would be pretty badass.",8
37256,Howard,2," Yes, but when they‰Ûªre hungry-hungry, you can stop them with marbles.",8
37257,Sheldon,2," Yeah, the correct animal for interspecies supersolider is koala. You would wind up with an army so cute it couldn‰Ûªt be attacked.",8
37258,Raj,2," But half-man, half-owl could fly‰Û_",8
37259,Sheldon,2, The answer is cuddly soldiers with big flat noses. Moving on.,8
37260,Howard,2," So, Penny, when‰Ûªs the new job start?",8
37261,Penny,2, Next Monday.,8
37262,Bernadette,2, Did you get a chance to look over the materials I gave you?,8
37263,Penny,2," Uh, not yet, but I will.",8
37264,Bernadette,2, Great. When?,8
37265,Penny,2, I said I‰Ûªll get to it.,8
37266,Sheldon,2," I‰Ûªm sensing awkwardness, am I right?",8
37267,Amy,2, Yes.,8
37268,Sheldon,2, Swish.,8
37269,Bernadette,2," I don‰Ûªt want to be pushy, but you‰Ûªve never done pharmaceutical sales before. It seems like you could use this time to get a head start.",8
37270,Penny,2," Well, the first few weeks will be all training. They‰Ûªll tell me everything I need to know.",8
37271,Bernadette,2, But imagine how impressed they‰Ûªd be if you showed up already familiar with the material.,8
37272,Penny,2," Okay, so what, you want me to be like a teacher‰Ûªs pet?",8
37273,Bernadette,2, Couldn‰Ûªt hurt.,8
37274,Leonard,2," Mm, I don‰Ûªt know. Who here has ever been hurt because they were the teacher‰Ûªs pet?",8
37275,Sheldon,2, It was like the rest of the class wanted Ms. McDonald to forget the quiz.,8
37276,Scene,2, Mrs Davis‰Ûª office.,8
37277,Sheldon,2," (Knock, knock, knock) Mrs. Davis. (Knock, knock, knock) Guess who?",8
37278,Mrs Davis,2, Dr. Cooper.,8
37279,Sheldon,2," (Knock, knock, knock) That‰Ûªs right, good job. Hello. Uh, you wanted to see me?",8
37280,Mrs Davis,2," Yes. Uh, welcome back.",8
37281,Sheldon,2, Thank you. I assume you‰Ûªd like to reopen our dialogue about the university forcing me to continue with string theory?,8
37282,Mrs Davis,2," You mean the dialogue that went, please, no, please, no, please, no.",8
37283,Sheldon,2," That‰Ûªs the one. I believe you went last, so, uh, please?",8
37284,Mrs Davis,2," Dr. Cooper, while you were away, we came up with a solution that would allow you to change your field of study.",8
37285,Sheldon,2," Wow. Pouting and running away actually worked. I must say, that may not be a lesson you want to reinforce with me. So, um, what is the solution?",8
37286,Mrs Davis,2," Currently, you‰Ûªre being paid under a grant to specifically research string theory. If we promote you to junior professor, you‰Ûªll be able to choose whatever field of research you‰Ûªd like.",8
37287,Sheldon,2," But if I‰Ûªm a professor, then I‰Ûªll have to teach a class.",8
37288,Mrs Davis,2, That is correct.,8
37289,Sheldon,2, So your solution is to promote me and pay me more money so that I can impart my knowledge to the next generation of scientists?,8
37290,Mrs Davis,2, Yes.,8
37291,Sheldon,2, You people are sick.,8
37292,Scene,2, Amy‰Ûªs lab.,8
37293,Penny,2, Hey. Ready to go to lunch?,8
37294,Amy,2, Just give me a minute. I‰Ûªm stimulating the pleasure cells of this starfish. I just need to turn it off.,8
37295,Penny,2, What happens if you don‰Ûªt?,8
37296,Amy,2, Then I have to sit through lunch knowing this starfish is having a better day than I am. Is Bernadette meeting us at the restaurant?,8
37297,Penny,2," Uh, no. Actually, I didn‰Ûªt invite her.",8
37298,Amy,2, How come?,8
37299,Penny,2," Well, ever since she helped me get this job, she won‰Ûªt stop bugging me.",8
37300,Amy,2," Well, I think she just wants you to do well, and she‰Ûªs worried that you won‰Ûªt ‰Ûªcause you were just a stunningly poor waitress.",8
37301,Penny,2, That is not true.,8
37302,Amy,2, I‰Ûªm still waiting on my mini corndogs from two years ago.,8
37303,Penny,2," I told you, they‰Ûªll be right out.",8
37304,Amy,2," Okay, so no Bernadette.",8
37305,Penny,2," Well, you saw her the other night. Am I wrong?",8
37306,Amy,2," No, I just, I feel kind of uncomfortable talking about her like this. Usually when someone‰Ûªs being talked about behind their back, it‰Ûªs me and it‰Ûªs right in front of my face.",8
37307,Penny,2, I‰Ûªm sorry. I just need a little break from her.,8
37308,Amy,2," I understand. You know, there is some research that indicates that sharing negative attitudes about a third party can be a powerful bonding force between two friends.",8
37309,Penny,2," So, what are you saying?",8
37310,Amy,2," I‰Ûªm saying, in the spirit of science, what is that little skank‰Ûªs problem?",8
37311,Scene,2, The cafeteria.,8
37312,Raj,2," So, I‰Ûªve been trying to come up with a cute couple‰Ûªs nickname for me and Emily. What do you like better? Emippali or Koothrapemily?",8
37313,Howard,2, Why is it your last name and her first name?,8
37314,Raj,2," Oh, well, her last name is Sweeney, and something just didn‰Ûªt seem right about Koothrapeeney.",8
37315,Leonard,2," Hey, how‰Ûªd it go with human resources?",8
37316,Sheldon,2," Awful. They‰Ûªre allowing me to move on from string theory, but they made me a junior professor and are requiring me to teach a class.",8
37317,Raj,2, I don‰Ûªt understand. Why is it bad that you have to teach?,8
37318,Sheldon,2, What a stupid question.,8
37319,Leonard,2, The kids are gonna love him.,8
37320,Sheldon,2, I can‰Ûªt believe I have to waste my time babysitting a bunch of grad students who probably think dark matter is what‰Ûªs in their diapers.,8
37321,Leonard,2," This might not be that bad. Uh, you like telling people they‰Ûªre wrong.",8
37322,Sheldon,2," Wrong, Just because I enjoyed that one doesn‰Ûªt mean I always do.",8
37323,Raj,2, You enjoy giving people grades.,8
37324,Sheldon,2," A valid point, but unoriginal. B-minus.",8
37325,Howard,2, And you love the sound of your own voice.,8
37326,Sheldon,2," Yeah, well, of course I do. Listen to it. It‰Ûªs like an earful of melted caramel.",8
37327,Leonard,2," Look, most importantly, this will let you move on and study dark matter.",8
37328,Sheldon,2," It is true that many of my heroes have taken students under their wings. Feynman, Einstein, Professor X. Humorously, in the case of Professor X, some of his students actually had wings. That‰Ûªs rich. I‰Ûªll use that one to lighten the mood after my entire class fails the midterm.",8
37329,Scene,2, Amy‰Ûªs lab.,8
37330,Amy,2," Measuring starfish serotonin levels in response to one point two molar stimulation of pleasure cells. You like that, don‰Ûªt you? That‰Ûªs right, say my name.",8
37331,Bernadette (on skype),2, Hey.,8
37332,Amy,2," Hey, what‰Ûªs going on?",8
37333,Bernadette,2, Not much. You want to get a drink later? Just the two of us?,8
37334,Amy,2, No Penny?,8
37335,Bernadette,2, Not tonight. I‰Ûªm a little frustrated with her.,8
37336,Amy,2, Because you got her the job and you think she should be working harder to prepare for it?,8
37337,Bernadette,2," So it‰Ûªs not just me. You see it, too.",8
37338,Amy,2," I do, I see it.",8
37339,Bernadette,2," It‰Ûªs driving me crazy. Just this afternoon, I saw on Instagram that instead of studying, she went out to lunch and got a manicure.",8
37340,Amy,2, That‰Ûªs outrageous.,8
37341,Bernadette,2, I know.,8
37342,Amy,2," If she doesn‰Ûªt do well, this could reflect poorly on you.",8
37343,Bernadette,2, Exactly. Does she not realize it or does she not care?,8
37344,Amy,2, I don‰Ûªt know. The important thing is I am here for you so we can mutually disparage this unpleasing third party.,8
37345,Scene,2, Sheldon‰Ûªs classroom.,8
37346,Leonard,2, Hey. We just wanted to see how your class was going. Where is everybody?,8
37347,Sheldon,2, There is no class.,8
37348,Howard,2, Did you send everyone to the principal‰Ûªs office already?,8
37349,Sheldon,2, No one signed up.,8
37350,Leonard,2," Well, that‰Ûªs not your fault.",8
37351,Sheldon,2," I called the department secretary to see what happened. Apparently, I have a reputation for being obnoxious.",8
37352,Leonard,2, What?,8
37353,Raj,2," Hey, Sheldon, I‰Ûªm sorry.",8
37354,Sheldon,2," No, it‰Ûªs fine. Now I can devote all my time to dark matter.",8
37355,Raj,2," Aw, you brought cookies for everyone?",8
37356,Sheldon,2," Oh, yes. Fig Newtons. I was going to ask them which scientist both helped to develop calculus and had a famous cookie named after him? And then after someone said Newton, I was going to tell them they‰Ûªre wrong. The cookies are named after a town in Massachusetts. And then I‰Ûªd throw the cookies away.",8
37357,Howard,2," Hey, what if I took your class?",8
37358,Sheldon,2, Why would you do that?,8
37359,Leonard,2," Yeah, why would you do that?",8
37360,Raj,2, What‰Ûªs wrong with you?,8
37361,Howard,2," I‰Ûªm thinking about getting my doctorate, and he wants to teach. Why not?",8
37362,Sheldon,2," Oh, Howard. I appreciate the gesture, but this is a graduate-level physics class. I don‰Ûªt think you‰Ûªd understand a single thing I was talking about.",8
37363,Raj,2," Ask why not again, I‰Ûªve got an answer.",8
37364,Howard,2," Sheldon, I‰Ûªm more than smart enough to take your class.",8
37365,Sheldon,2, No.,8
37366,Howard,2, Yes.,8
37367,Sheldon,2, How would you determine the ground state of a quantum system with no exact solution?,8
37368,Howard,2, I would guess a wave-function and then vary its parameters until I found the lowest energy solution.,8
37369,Sheldon,2," Hmm. Do you know how to integrate X squared times E to the minus X, without looking it up?",8
37370,Howard,2," I‰Ûªd use Feynman‰Ûªs trick, differentiate under the integral sign.",8
37371,Sheldon,2," Okay. Um, what is the correct interpretation of quantum mechanics?",8
37372,Howard,2," Since every interpretation gives exactly the same answer to every measurement, they are all equally correct. However, I know you believe in the Many Worlds Interpretation, so I‰Ûªll say that. Now do you think I‰Ûªm smart enough?",8
37373,Sheldon,2, No.,8
37374,Howard,2," Oh, come on. You might‰Ûªve gone to school for a couple more years than me, but guess what, engineers are just as smart as physicists.",8
37375,Sheldon,2, You take that back.,8
37376,Howard,2, No.,8
37377,Scene,2, The stairwell.,8
37378,Amy,2," So, after drinks with Bernadette, I get home, and Penny calls to complain about her. And then while I‰Ûªm talking to Penny, I get a text from Bernadette.",8
37379,Sheldon,2, I am trying to prepare my lesson plan for Howard. Why are you telling me this?,8
37380,Amy,2," Because it‰Ûªs taken 15 years, but high school is finally awesome. I love them both, but I‰Ûªm in the centre now, and I love that even more.",8
37381,Sheldon,2," Amy, please. I am trying to figure out a way to intellectually emasculate a dear friend of mine.",8
37382,Amy,2, But I‰Ûªm just‰Û_,8
37383,Sheldon,2, Not now.,8
37384,Amy,2," You better watch that attitude, buddy. You‰Ûªre dating the popular girl now.",8
37385,Scene,2, The apartment.,8
37386,Leonard,2, Hmm. You‰Ûªre up late.,8
37387,Sheldon,2," Oh, I‰Ûªm working on my lesson plan for Wolowitz. He is going to be so lost. Look at this section over here. Even I don‰Ûªt really understand it.",8
37388,Leonard,2," Sheldon, why are you doing this?",8
37389,Sheldon,2," I‰Ûªm a teacher, Leonard. It‰Ûªs my job.",8
37390,Leonard,2," No, I mean, why are you going to so much trouble to prove that you‰Ûªre smarter than Wolowitz?",8
37391,Sheldon,2," Oh, it‰Ûªs no trouble, it‰Ûªs actually a pleasure.",8
37392,Leonard,2," You want to know what I think? I think the idea that someone could be as smart as you, or even smarter, scares the pants off you, and you can‰Ûªt deal with it.",8
37393,Sheldon,2," Interesting point. You‰Ûªre suggesting that I have emotional issues below my consciousness which drive my behaviour, thus causing me to lash out at anything or anyone that threatens my intellectual superiority.",8
37394,Leonard,2, Might be something to think about.,8
37395,Sheldon,2, Leonard?,8
37396,Leonard,2, Yeah.,8
37397,Sheldon,2, Howard‰Ûªs allergic to peanuts. How can I use that against him?,8
37398,Scene,2, Sheldon‰Ûªs classroom.,8
37399,Howard,2, Hey.,8
37400,Sheldon,2," Okay, now that everyone‰Ûªs here, we can begin.",8
37401,Howard,2," Before we do, I just talked to Leonard. And if you‰Ûªre gonna spend all your time trying to belittle me by making this class unnecessarily hard, then I‰Ûªm out. But if you‰Ûªre interested in making a sincere effort to be a good teacher, then I‰Ûªm willing to give this a shot.",8
37402,Sheldon,2, I suppose that‰Ûªs a fair request. There‰Ûªs no reason we both can‰Ûªt benefit from this experience.,8
37403,Howard,2, Okay.,8
37404,Sheldon,2," Okay. Well, then, uh, first things first. Um, are you familiar with the Brachistochrone problem?",8
37405,Howard,2, I am.,8
37406,Sheldon,2, Good. And how it relates to the calculus of variations?,8
37407,Howard,2, It‰Ûªs an inverted cycloid.,8
37408,Sheldon,2," Wonderful. Now, what about Euler-Lagrange theorems?",8
37409,Howard,2, That‰Ûªs where I‰Ûªm a little fuzzy.,8
37410,Sheldon,2," Ha! I knew it. All right. We have a lot of information to cover before your first test. Which, by the way, is in eight minutes. The good news is I‰Ûªm grading on a curve, so you‰Ûªre pretty much guaranteed a C.",8
37411,Howard (singing),2," All I do is win, win, win no matter what.",8
37412,Sheldon,2, What are you doing?,8
37413,Howard (singing),2," Everybody hands go up, up and they stay there!",8
37414,Sheldon,2, What are you doing?,8
37415,Howard,2," If you‰Ûªre gonna be a crappy teacher, then I‰Ûªm gonna be a crappy student. (Singing) Uh, uh, Ludacris going in on the verse. ‰Ûªcause I never been defeated and I won‰Ûªt stop now‰Û_",8
37416,Sheldon,2, Will you stop it. This is a classroom. This is not American Bandstand.,8
37417,Howard,2, Okay.,8
37418,Sheldon,2," Now, where was I? Let‰Ûªs see. Oh, yes. Over here. You‰Û_ What are you doing now?",8
37419,Howard,2, Making a straw.,8
37420,Sheldon,2, Why?,8
37421,Howard,2, So I can shoot you with a spitball.,8
37422,Sheldon,2," You‰Ûªre not going to do that, and I‰Ûªll tell you why. This is an institution of higher learning, I am your professor, and you‰Ûªre going to treat me with the prop‰Û_ You shot your spit in my mouth!",8
37423,Howard,2, Is that gonna be on the test? Because I don‰Ûªt think I can do that again.,8
37424,Scene,2, Amy‰Ûªs lab.,8
37425,Amy (on phone),2," Hey, girlfriend. Can I get a what what?",8
37426,Penny,2, What?,8
37427,Amy,2," Close enough. Um, I was just calling to see what you were up tonight. Thought maybe we could hit up Color Me Mine, maybe sneak in some Pinot Greej. Whatevs.",8
37428,Penny,2," Uh, thanks, but I think I‰Ûªm gonna stay in and go over the stuff Bernadette gave me.",8
37429,Amy,2," Oh. Oh, I hear you. Try and get that nag off your back, right? I mean, you‰Ûªre not a bicycle, why‰Ûªs she riding you like that?",8
37430,Penny,2," No, I think she was just trying to help. Plus, I really want to do well at this job. So‰Û_",8
37431,Amy,2," Okay, good luck. And call me later, you know, if you decide she‰Ûªs a bitch or something. Hey, girlfriend.",8
37432,Bernadette,2," Hey, Amy.",8
37433,Amy,2," Tonight. You, me, Color Me Mine. Maybe we sneak in some Pinot, make it Color Me Wine.",8
37434,Bernadette,2," That sounds fun, but I promised Penny I‰Ûªd come by and help her study.",8
37435,Amy,2," Oh. Well, good luck getting her to do that. She‰Ûªs probably off getting another manicure. You remember when she did that? You remember?",8
37436,Bernadette,2," I was probably being too hard on her. We talked, we‰Ûªre good.",8
37437,Amy,2," Oh. Great. I‰Ûªm happy for you guys. You know, when the two of you aren‰Ûªt getting along, it puts me in a really weird position.",8
37438,Bernadette,2," Well, don‰Ûªt worry, everything‰Ûªs back to normal.",8
37439,Amy,2," You mean, like, where she‰Ûªs nice to your face? Okay got it. Bye. Hey, boyfriend.",8
37440,Sheldon,2, Can‰Ûªt talk. Spitball. Probably gonna die.,8
37441,Scene,2, The apartment.,8
37442,Sheldon,2, Well?,8
37443,Leonard,2," Sheldon, I promise. Your uvula does not have an STD.",8
37444,Sheldon,2, Are you sure? It just doesn‰Ûªt feel as innocent as it used to.,8
37445,Howard,2, You reported me to human resources?,8
37446,Sheldon,2, You violated the sanctity of my mouth.,8
37447,Howard,2," Well, I dropped your class, so I hope you‰Ûªre happy.",8
37448,Sheldon,2, I told you you weren‰Ûªt smart enough to take it.,8
37449,Howard,2," I‰Ûªm smart enough, Sheldon. Asking me a bunch of questions about a topic I‰Ûªm not familiar with doesn‰Ûªt prove anything. I could do the same to you.",8
37450,Sheldon,2," Yeah, try me.",8
37451,Howard,2," Okay. You enjoy making fun of engineering so much, how do you quantify the strength of materials?",8
37452,Sheldon,2, Young‰Ûªs modulus.,8
37453,Raj,2, Is that right?,8
37454,Howard,2," Yeah. Okay, how do you prevent eddy currents in a transformer?",8
37455,Sheldon,2, Laminate the core material.,8
37456,Leonard,2," Come on, give him a hard one.",8
37457,Howard,2," That was a hard one. All right. How does the flow rate in a pipe depend on its diameter? You don‰Ûªt know, do you? What‰Ûªs the matter, smart guy? Don‰Ûªt know Poiseuille‰Ûªs law?",8
37458,Sheldon (coughing several times),2, Thank goodness I got it. Now I can quit checking my stool.,8
37459,Scene,2, Penny‰Ûªs apartment.,8
37460,Bernadette,2," Okay, what are the potential side effects for our erectile dysfunction drug?",8
37461,Penny,2," Headaches, dizziness and nausea.",8
37462,Bernadette,2, Yes.,8
37463,Penny,2, Those are also the side effects of having a 75-year-old man with an erection climb on top of you.,8
37464,Bernadette,2, Want to stop here?,8
37465,Penny,2," Uh, no. I can keep going.",8
37466,Bernadette,2," Nah, you got this. Let‰Ûªs go for a drink. I‰Ûªll call Amy.",8
37467,Penny,2," Okay, good. She seemed like she really wanted to go out tonight.",8
37468,"Amy (phone ringing, running down stairs from outside Penny‰Ûªs door)",2," Hey, girl.",8
37469,Scene,2, The apartment.,8
37470,Leonard,2," Okay, next question, for the Butterfinger. How long is a galactic yea",8
37471,Raj,2, 250 million years.,8
37472,Leonard,2, Yes. (Cheers) ,8
37473,Howard,2," Okay, this one is for a Cadbury Creme Egg.",8
37474,Sheldon,2, Oh! It‰Ûªs not even Easter time. This is crazy.,8
37475,Howard,2," Which Archimedean solid has 20 regular triangular faces, 30 square faces, 12 pentagonal faces, 60 vertices and 120 edges?",8
37476,All together,2, The Rhombicosidodecahedron. (Cheers) ,8
37477,Leonard,2, We are so smart.,8
37478,Raj,2, Why didn‰Ûªt girls like us in high school?,8
37479,Howard,2, Because we were awkward and weird and couldn‰Ûªt play sports!,8
37480,Leonard,2, Right again. (Cheers),8
37481,Scene,3, The apartment.,8
37482,Howard,3," So, how does this game work? I just throw it, like a real ball?",8
37483,Leonard,3," Yeah, just nice and easy, right over the plate.",8
37484,Howard,3, All right.,8
37485,Raj,3," You suck, Wolowitz.",8
37486,Howard,3, What‰Ûªs that about?,8
37487,Raj,3, I‰Ûªm heckling you. It‰Ûªs a beloved part of baseball.,8
37488,Sheldon,3," He‰Ûªs right. And given that you‰Ûªre probably still waiting to be picked for a game that was played in fifth grade, I‰Ûªm sure you do suck.",8
37489,Penny,3, Hi. What‰Ûªs going on?,8
37490,Leonard,3, Baseball.,8
37491,Penny,3," Okay, this is not what I meant when I said go outside and play.",8
37492,Leonard,3, He‰Ûªs practicing.,8
37493,Penny,3, For what?,8
37494,Howard,3," The Angels wanted an astronaut to throw out the first pitch, so guess who they called?",8
37495,Penny,3," What, you? Really?",8
37496,Howard,3," Well, a lot of people who weren‰Ûªt available, but then me.",8
37497,Penny,3, That‰Ûªs so cool. Congratulations. I guess that makes you the athlete of the group.,8
37498,Sheldon,3," Well, not just him. May I remind you that you‰Ûªre talking to the seeker, beater, chaser and water boy of the third place Griffith Park Quidditch team.",8
37499,Penny,3, I know. Watching your boyfriend run around with a broomstick between his legs isn‰Ûªt something you forget.,8
37500,Leonard,3," C‰Ûªmon now, throw one.",8
37501,Howard,3," All right, here we go.",8
37502,Raj,3, You look like a jackass.,8
37503,Howard,3, Cut it out. You‰Ûªre hurting my feelings.,8
37504,Leonard,3, Now you know why we‰Ûªre not outside.,8
37505,Scene,3, The stairwell.,8
37506,Sheldon,3, Did you enjoy my lecture?,8
37507,Amy,3," No, and neither did our waiter.",8
37508,Sheldon,3," Well, if you‰Ûªre going to serve Cornish game hen, you should either be familiar with the history of Cornwall or be prepared to learn it.",8
37509,Amy,3, It‰Ûªs hard to argue with that. And I know because I saw a sad man with a pepper mill desperately try and fail.,8
37510,Penny,3," Hey, how was dinner?",8
37511,Sheldon,3," Good, I had Cornish game hen.",8
37512,Leonard,3," Oh, that poor waiter.",8
37513,Amy,3," Sheldon, how about tomorrow night we see a movie?",8
37514,Penny,3, You guys are going out two nights in a row?,8
37515,Sheldon,3," I missed a number of date nights while I was on my train trip, and I‰Ûªm contractually obligated to make them up under the terms of the Relationship Agreement.",8
37516,Penny,3, That‰Ûªs so hot.,8
37517,Amy,3," It‰Ûªs better than hot, it‰Ûªs binding.",8
37518,Sheldon,3," If you‰Ûªre free tomorrow night, I‰Ûªd love to have you join us on a double date.",8
37519,Penny,3, Aw.,8
37520,Amy,3, You are aware that a double date doesn‰Ûªt count as two dates.,8
37521,Sheldon,3," Oh. Well, then come or don‰Ûªt. I don‰Ûªt care.",8
37522,Scene,3, Howard and Bernadette‰Ûªs apartment.,8
37523,Bernadette,3, I can‰Ûªt believe you‰Ûªre sore.,8
37524,Howard,3," Hey, even professional pitchers need a rubdown after the game.",8
37525,Bernadette,3, But they throw an actual ball. You were throwing air at a TV.,8
37526,Howard,3," For your information, I also gave Leonard one hell of a high five.",8
37527,Bernadette,3, I‰Ûªm kind of surprised you agreed to do this in front of a stadium full of people.,8
37528,Howard,3, They‰Ûªre doing Space Day and NASA asked me. I felt like I couldn‰Ûªt say no.,8
37529,Bernadette,3," Okay. Well, if you want, I could help you practice. I played a lot of softball growing up.",8
37530,Howard,3," Thank you, that would be great.",8
37531,Bernadette,3," Great. And while we‰Ûªre at it, maybe we could butch up your run for when you head out to the mound.",8
37532,Howard,3, What‰Ûªs wrong with the way I run?,8
37533,Scene,3, Penny‰Ûªs apartment.,8
37534,Penny,3," Sheldon, I‰Ûªm surprised you‰Ûªd choose to go to a pub.",8
37535,Sheldon,3," At our committee meeting, Amy made a motion for a picnic in a park, but I tacked so many amendments on that thing it sank like a lead balloon.",8
37536,Amy,3, I then suggested a pub.,8
37537,Sheldon,3," Yeah, which I was initially sceptical of until I saw online that they serve Yorkshire pudding.",8
37538,Leonard,3, You don‰Ûªt even like Yorkshire pudding.,8
37539,Sheldon,3," No, it‰Ûªs yucky, but informing people about the history of Yorkshire is yummy, yum-yum.",8
37540,Amy,3," After a lively debate, that proposal passed by a two-zero margin.",8
37541,Leonard,3, Nice to see a busy couple keep the spark of bureaucracy alive.,8
37542,Sheldon,3," Ignore them, Amy. They‰Ûªre just jealous because they‰Ûªll never have a relationship as good as ours.",8
37543,Penny,3, Isn‰Ûªt this when he says bazooka or something?,8
37544,Sheldon,3," I wasn‰Ûªt making a joke, I was merely stating fact. Amy and I have a superior relationship to yours.",8
37545,Leonard,3," You don‰Ûªt honestly think that, do you?",8
37546,Sheldon,3," Leonard, I assumed you knew. The ranking of relationships in our circle by quality is me and Amy, Howard and Bernadette, Raj and his girlfriend, Penny and Chardonnay, Penny and you.",8
37547,Leonard,3," There isn‰Ûªt any ranking. And if there were, we wouldn‰Ûªt be at the bottom of it.",8
37548,Penny,3," Yeah, and actually, I drink Sauvignon Blanc.",8
37549,Leonard,3, That‰Ûªs the part you have a problem with?,8
37550,Penny,3, Relax.,8
37551,Amy,3," There they go, fighting again. You‰Ûªd never hear her talk that way to Sauvignon Blanc.",8
37552,Scene,3, A gymnasium. ,8
37553,Raj,3," So you never played baseball as a kid, not even Little League?",8
37554,Howard,3," Well, I was going to, but the day of tryouts I found my dad‰Ûªs Playboy collection. Threw my arm out.",8
37555,Bernadette,3," All right, the pitcher‰Ûªs mound in Major League Baseball is sixty feet, six inches away from home plate.",8
37556,Howard,3, Great. You take this and say when to stop. How much further?,8
37557,Bernadette,3, Keep going.,8
37558,Howard,3, How about now?,8
37559,Bernadette,3, I‰Ûªll let you know.,8
37560,Howard,3, Are you saying stop and we‰Ûªre just too far away to hear you?,8
37561,Bernadette,3," Okay, stop.",8
37562,Howard,3, Are you kidding me?!,8
37563,Bernadette,3, That‰Ûªs sixty feet.,8
37564,Howard,3, There‰Ûªs no way this is sixty feet.,8
37565,Bernadette,3, I‰Ûªm looking at it.,8
37566,Howard,3, You realize this isn‰Ûªt one of those times I want you to exaggerate how long something is.,8
37567,Scene,3, Amy‰Ûªs car.,8
37568,Leonard,3," Okay, I got to, I, I, I, I got to ask. What makes you think that your relationship is so wonderful and ours isn‰Ûªt?",8
37569,Sheldon,3," For starters, we enjoy spending time together.",8
37570,Leonard,3, So do we. And I‰Ûªve seen you guys ignore each other for hours doing totally different things.,8
37571,Sheldon,3, It‰Ûªs called parallel play.,8
37572,Leonard,3," Yeah, toddlers do that.",8
37573,Sheldon,3, Not as well as we do.,8
37574,Leonard,3, You believe this guy? He has to be the best at everything.,8
37575,Penny,3, So what? Why do you even care?,8
37576,Sheldon,3," Oh, listen to them. Not even married and the honeymoon‰Ûªs over.",8
37577,Leonard,3, Whatever. You can‰Ûªt even go on a date without checking your relationship agreement.,8
37578,Sheldon,3," If you‰Ûªve got a problem basing a relationship on a contract, I‰Ûªd like to tell you about 13 plucky colonies that entered a relationship agreement called the U.S. Constitution. And it may not be cool to say so, but I think that love affair is still pretty hot today.",8
37579,Amy,3," It‰Ûªs a good thing I‰Ûªm not wearing flag underwear right now, ‰Ûªcause there‰Ûªs about to be a fire.",8
37580,Scene,3, The gym.,8
37581,Bernadette,3," Okay, it‰Ûªs not that hard. You just look to where you want to throw it, step towards where you want to throw, and throw it.",8
37582,Howard,3," That‰Ûªs your help? That‰Ûªs like saying here‰Ûªs how you fly a plane, get in the airplane, know where you want to go and fly it.",8
37583,Bernadette,3, Just throw the ball. Let‰Ûªs see what we‰Ûªre working with.,8
37584,Raj,3," Come on Howard, fire it in.",8
37585,Bernadette,3, Throw the damn ball!,8
37586,Scene,3, The pub.,8
37587,Amy,3, So when do you guys plan on getting married?,8
37588,Penny,3," Uh, we‰Ûªre not sure. But I want to wait long enough to prove to my mother I‰Ûªm not pregnant.",8
37589,Sheldon,3, May I have one of your fries?,8
37590,Amy,3, Of course. Can I have a bite of your burger?,8
37591,Sheldon,3, Absolutely not.,8
37592,Leonard,3, Some perfect couple. He won‰Ûªt even share his food with her.,8
37593,Sheldon,3, It has avocado on it. She‰Ûªs allergic to avocado. Are you so jealous of our relationship you want Amy to die?,8
37594,Leonard,3, I‰Ûªm not jealous. I just think it‰Ûªs silly for you to compare relationships like they‰Ûªre something that can be quantified.,8
37595,Sheldon,3," Everything is quantifiable. That French fry? A seven. Spider-Man? A nine. The number nine? Oddly, only a four.",8
37596,Leonard,3, How ridiculous is he?,8
37597,Penny,3, A hundred.,8
37598,Leonard,3," Sheldon, you‰Ûªre just assigning random numbers to things based on your opinion.",8
37599,Sheldon,3," No, I‰Ûªm not. French fries have three variables, crispiness, saltiness and shape. Which is why a curly fry only gets a two. If I wanted curls for dinner, I‰Ûªd order a clown wig.",8
37600,Penny,3," Well, a relationship is more complicated than a French fry.",8
37601,Sheldon,3," Not according to the work of Berscheid, Snyder and Omoto.",8
37602,Penny,3," Oh, what did those rascals do now?",8
37603,Amy,3," They developed the Relationship Closeness Inventory, which predicts the stability of a couple based on behaviour.",8
37604,Sheldon,3," Yeah, not to be confused with the French Fry Goodness Inventory. That‰Ûªs pure Cooper.",8
37605,Leonard,3," So, this is accurate?",8
37606,Sheldon,3," It‰Ûªs been around for 25 years, and has been extensively corroborated by other researchers.",8
37607,Penny,3," Well, kind of takes the romance out of relationships.",8
37608,Sheldon,3, Kind of? It does it perfectly.,8
37609,Amy,3, Sheldon and I got an eight-point-two out of ten.,8
37610,Leonard,3, Fine. We‰Ûªll take it right now.,8
37611,Penny,3," No, don‰Ûªt.",8
37612,Leonard,3, What?,8
37613,Penny,3, Just don‰Ûªt take it.,8
37614,Leonard,3, Why not?,8
37615,Penny,3, ‰Û÷Cause it‰Ûªs stupid. Who cares what number it is?,8
37616,Leonard,3, Come on. It‰Ûªll be fun.,8
37617,Penny,3, I said I don‰Ûªt want you to. I‰Ûªm getting another drink.,8
37618,Leonard,3, Sorry.,8
37619,Amy,3, I‰Ûªm gonna let you count this as two dates. They‰Ûªre a lot of work.,8
37620,Scene,3, The gym.,8
37621,Bernadette,3, Think he‰Ûªs getting any better?,8
37622,Raj,3, Yup.,8
37623,Howard,3, That was a close one.,8
37624,Bernadette,3, Okay.,8
37625,Raj,3, Is it too late for him to cancel?,8
37626,Bernadette,3, I think so.,8
37627,Howard,3, Heads up! Watch out!,8
37628,Scene,3, The pub.,8
37629,Leonard,3, Are you mad at me?,8
37630,Penny,3," No, stop being stupid.",8
37631,Leonard,3," Um, whew? Is this about the test, or is this about us?",8
37632,Penny,3," Look, I don‰Ûªt need a score on a test to make me worry about something I‰Ûªm already worried about.",8
37633,Leonard,3, What are you worried about?,8
37634,Penny,3," That we‰Ûªre engaged and have nothing in common, and it scares me.",8
37635,Leonard,3," Yeah, that scares me, too.",8
37636,Penny,3, It does?,8
37637,Leonard,3, Sometimes.,8
37638,Penny,3," Well, that‰Ûªs not good. You being blindly infatuated with me was the rock we were building this relationship on.",8
37639,Leonard,3," Okay, well, this might make you feel better. Uh, we‰Ûªre both scared that our marriage will be a disaster, and so, that‰Ûªs something that we have in common. Also, we both think I‰Ûªm not funny. Huh? See, you‰Ûªre not laughing.",8
37640,Scene,3, Howard and Bernadette‰Ûªs apartment. ,8
37641,Mike (on Skype),3," Hey, Froot Loops, what‰Ûªs up?",8
37642,Howard,3," Hey, Mike. Listen, NASA asked me to throw out the first pitch at an Angels game. You got any advice?",8
37643,Mike,3, Yeah. Don‰Ûªt do it. What else you up to?,8
37644,Howard,3, Why shouldn‰Ûªt I do it?,8
37645,Mike,3," There‰Ûªs no upside. If you do well, no one cares. And if you screw up, you‰Ûªre an idiot on YouTube forever.",8
37646,Howard,3, But it‰Ûªs for a good cause. What about all the kids that‰Ûªll be there?,8
37647,Mike,3, That‰Ûªs what I‰Ûªm telling you. Kids are the worst. My own daughter tweeted I have a giant nose.,8
37648,Howard,3," Well, maybe I‰Ûªll do a good job.",8
37649,Mike,3," I don‰Ûªt know. In space, you couldn‰Ûªt even toss me a pen, and that was in zero gravity.",8
37650,Howard,3," Okay, thanks for the pep talk.",8
37651,Mike,3," Anytime, Froot Loops. Give your wife a hug for me. She‰Ûªs so much cuter than you, I don‰Ûªt know how you ever got her.",8
37652,Bernadette,3, He‰Ûªs so nice.,8
37653,Scene,3, The pub.,8
37654,Penny,3," Hey, sorry about that.",8
37655,Amy,3," No, we‰Ûªre sorry. We never should have been comparing relationships in the first place.",8
37656,Sheldon,3," Why? We won. You know, I say, next, we take on Koothrappali and his dog. Really give ourselves a challenge.",8
37657,Leonard,3, I just want to say one more thing about this. Just because Penny and I are very different people does not mean that we‰Ûªre a bad couple.,8
37658,Sheldon,3," The answer is one simple test away. Hmm? You know, it‰Ûªs like when I thought there was a possum in my closet. Did I sit around wondering? No, I sent Leonard in with a pointy stick and a bag.",8
37659,Leonard,3, I killed his Chewbacca slippers.,8
37660,Penny,3, Let‰Ûªs just take the test.,8
37661,Leonard,3," No, no, no, I don‰Ûªt want to.",8
37662,Penny,3," Oh, well, ‰Ûªcause you know we‰Ûªre gonna do bad.",8
37663,Leonard,3, Because it doesn‰Ûªt matter. I don‰Ûªt care if we‰Ûªre a ten or a two.,8
37664,Sheldon,3, Or a one. A one is possible.,8
37665,Leonard,3," Marriage is scary. You‰Ûªre scared, I‰Ûªm scared. But it doesn‰Ûªt make me not want to do it. It, it just makes me want to hold your hand and do it with you.",8
37666,Penny,3, Leonard.,8
37667,Amy,3, It would make me so happy if you said things like that.,8
37668,Sheldon,3," We got an eight-point-two. Trust me, you‰Ûªre happy.",8
37669,Scene,3, Angels Stadium,8
37670,Raj,3," Mmm, I love how they put a waterfall at centre field. It really ties the whole stadium together.",8
37671,Penny,3," Look at you, talking sports.",8
37672,Leonard,3," This is fun, huh? We get to see our friend throw out the first pitch, have a hot dog, watch the game.",8
37673,Sheldon,3, Whoa. Nobody said anything about watching the game.,8
37674,Amy,3," Sheldon, what did you expect?",8
37675,Sheldon,3," I expected to see Howard throw the baseball, finish my hot dog, and hightail it across the street to Disneyland just in time for Mickey‰Ûªs Soundsational Parade.",8
37676,Amy,3," I‰Ûªll tell you what. If we stay, I‰Ûªll buy you cotton candy and a bobblehead.",8
37677,Sheldon,3, Who‰Ûªs the bobblehead of?,8
37678,Amy,3, Does it matter?,8
37679,Sheldon,3," No, as long as it bobbles.",8
37680,Bernadette,3," Howie, I am so proud of you.",8
37681,Howard,3," Thanks. I‰Ûªm proud of me, too.",8
37682,Man,3, You ready?,8
37683,Howard,3, Let‰Ûªs do it.,8
37684,Man,3, All right.,8
37685,Howard,3, Wish me luck.,8
37686,Bernadette,3, Go get ‰Ûªem.,8
37687,Stadium Announcer,3," Ladies and gentlemen, in honour of Space Day at Angel Stadium, the first pitch will be thrown out by NASA astronaut Howard Wolowitz.",8
37688,Howard,3, Thank you. Thank you.,8
37689,Penny,3, Can he really throw a ball?,8
37690,Leonard,3," On our Quidditch team, he‰Û_",8
37691,Penny,3," Yeah, that‰Ûªs a no.",8
37692,Howard,3," I have a message for the young people here today. When I was asked to throw the first pitch, a little voice in my head said I couldn‰Ûªt do it. So, I practiced and practiced, and you know what? That little voice was right, but then I remembered that I‰Ûªm not an athlete. I‰Ûªm a scientist. So, today‰Ûªs first pitch will be delivered to home plate by science. Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls, I present to you a working prototype of the Mars Rover. And here‰Ûªs the wind-up, and the pitch.",8
37693,Bernadette,3, Why is it going so slow?,8
37694,Howard,3, ‰Û÷Cause I‰Ûªm an idiot who didn‰Ûªt think this through.,8
37695,Sheldon,3," Okay, new plan. We go to Disneyland, play hide and seek on Tom Sawyer‰Ûªs Island, and then come back and see the end of the pitch.",8
37696,Howard,3," Okay, while we‰Ûªre waiting for the ball to arrive, here‰Ûªs some fun facts about Mars.",8
37697,Man in Crowd,3," You suck, Wolowitz!",8
37698,Sheldon,3, He makes a valid point.,8
37699,Howard,3," Okay, booing isn‰Ûªt gonna make it go any faster.",8
37700,Scene,4, The cafeteria.,8
37701,Leonard,4, Have you guys heard about this research team that‰Ûªs trying to transgenically manipulate chicken DNA to create some sort of chicken dinosaur?,8
37702,Sheldon,4," Oh, I think that sounds wonderful.",8
37703,Howard,4, What? You‰Ûªre afraid of both dinosaurs and chickens.,8
37704,Sheldon,4," Yes, but tell me a dinosaur chicken salad sandwich wouldn‰Ûªt hit the Mesozoic spot.",8
37705,Raj,4," Hey, guys.",8
37706,Howard,4, Hey.,8
37707,Sheldon,4, Hello.,8
37708,Raj,4, We still on for tomorrow night?,8
37709,Leonard,4, Yeah. I‰Ûªm excited to finally meet your girlfriend.,8
37710,Sheldon,4," Speaking of which, according to a recent study out of Oxford University, when someone takes on a new romantic partner, that person loses one or two close friends.",8
37711,Howard,4, Since when do you read social science?,8
37712,Sheldon,4, I go to the bathroom like everybody else.,8
37713,Raj,4, Why would I lose friends just because I started dating someone?,8
37714,Leonard,4," Yeah, you didn‰Ûªt lose anyone when you met Amy. Yeah, well, no, this study refers to romantic partners. Not the way I would categorize the two of us.",8
37715,Raj,4, You guys kiss and hold hands.,8
37716,Leonard,4, I‰Ûªve seen him do it. It‰Ûªs not romantic.,8
37717,Raj,4," Look, I‰Ûªm not the kind of guy who drops his friends just because he‰Ûªs in a relationship.",8
37718,Leonard,4, What happens if she doesn‰Ûªt like us?,8
37719,Raj,4," Well, hey, you‰Ûªre my dear friends. You‰Ûªll get a Christmas card for a couple of years, and then you‰Ûªre dead to me.",8
37720,Scene,4, The apartment.,8
37721,Amy,4," So, Howard, is Stuart still living with your mom?",8
37722,Howard,4, I don‰Ûªt want to talk about it.,8
37723,Bernadette,4, But he‰Ûªs going to.,8
37724,Howard,4," My mom got him cable. In my whole life, growing up in that house, no cable. Do you know how many HBOs that leech had my mother get him? Seven. Seven HBOs. Seven.",8
37725,Bernadette,4," Long story short, they have seven HBOs.",8
37726,Raj,4," Hey, guys.",8
37727,Sheldon,4, Hello.,8
37728,Raj,4," Emily, you know almost everybody here.",8
37729,Emily,4, Hi.,8
37730,Raj,4," And this is Leonard, this is Penny.",8
37731,Emily,4," Oh, it‰Ûªs so nice to meet you.",8
37732,Leonard,4," Nice to finally meet you, too.",8
37733,Penny,4, Hi.,8
37734,Emily,4, Hello.,8
37735,Leonard,4," Wow, Raj, you were not lying about her.",8
37736,Raj,4, I told you she exists.,8
37737,Penny,4," Hey, I hear you‰Ûªre a dermatologist.",8
37738,Emily,4," Uh, yeah, I‰Ûªm a resident at Huntington Hospital.",8
37739,Sheldon,4," Oh, I like their emergency room. Yeah, even if it turns out you don‰Ûªt have Dengue fever, they still let you take a lollipop.",8
37740,Bernadette,4," You know, Penny just started training to be a pharmaceutical sales rep. Maybe she can practice on you some time.",8
37741,Penny,4," Oh, it would be great to practice on a real doctor.",8
37742,Emily,4, Yeah. I‰Ûªm sure that‰Ûªd be fine.,8
37743,Sheldon,4, I have some odd freckles on my buttocks. Can I make an appointment for you to look at them?,8
37744,Emily,4," Um, okay, I guess.",8
37745,Amy,4," I‰Ûªm with him three years, nothing. She‰Ûªs with him two minutes, and he‰Ûªs taking his pants off.",8
37746,Scene,4, Penny‰Ûªs apartment.,8
37747,Bernadette,4, Last night was fun. What did you think of Emily?,8
37748,Penny,4, I don‰Ûªt know. I kind of got the sense she didn‰Ûªt like me.,8
37749,Bernadette,4, Did she say she didn‰Ûªt like you?,8
37750,Penny,4, Of course not. No one ever says they don‰Ûªt like you straight to your face.,8
37751,Amy,4, We have led different lives.,8
37752,Bernadette,4, You guys just met. Why would she feel that way?,8
37753,Penny,4, It‰Ûªs just this vibe I got.,8
37754,Bernadette,4, I‰Ûªm sure you‰Ûªre worried about nothing.,8
37755,Penny,4," Yeah. You‰Ûªre probably right. I used to think my high school P.E. teacher didn‰Ûªt like me, but it turned out, she liked me a little too much.",8
37756,Bernadette,4, Really?,8
37757,Penny,4," Yeah. It was fine. We went to a Melissa Etheridge concert, I got an A, it all worked out.",8
37758,Bernadette,4," When you go to Emily‰Ûªs office to practice, you‰Ûªll see. It‰Ûªs fine.",8
37759,Penny,4," Yeah, I hope you‰Ûªre right.",8
37760,Amy,4, You really went your entire life without anyone saying I hate you to your face?,8
37761,Penny,4, Yeah.,8
37762,Amy,4," I‰Ûªd say it now, but look at those cheekbones.",8
37763,Scene,4, Capital Comics.,8
37764,Sheldon,4," I miss Stuart‰Ûªs place. All this loud music and exposed brick. What, is this a comic book store, or a rave at the third little pig‰Ûªs house?",8
37765,Howard,4," Yep, I wish Stuart would reopen. I hate this place, too.",8
37766,Leonard,4," Okay, him I believe because he‰Ûªs an 80-year-old man in a 15-year-old‰Ûªs tee shirt. But you‰Ûªre just upset about Stuart and your mom and all their HBOs.",8
37767,Howard,4," Yes, I am. You know, I can‰Ûªt even watch Game of Thrones now without thinking of mother saying, Stuart, which one is Thrones?",8
37768,Raj,4," You know, he might not reopen. He didn‰Ûªt get a lot of money from the insurance company.",8
37769,Sheldon,4," Oh, boy, if there is one thing that gets my goat, it‰Ûªs those dad-gum insurance companies.",8
37770,Leonard,4," Why? Because they won‰Ûªt get off your lawn? Is Stuart trying to get a loan, or, or find investors?",8
37771,Howard,4," All I know is, he‰Ûªs got my mother buying four-ply toilet paper. I mean, four-ply. If his butt is so delicate, why doesn‰Ûªt he just use an angora rabbit?",8
37772,Sheldon,4," For starters, they shed and bite.",8
37773,Leonard,4," Hey, here‰Ûªs a thought. Why don‰Ûªt we put up the rest of the money that Stuart needs?",8
37774,Raj,4," So, we‰Ûªd be, like, owners of a comic book store?",8
37775,Leonard,4, It‰Ûªs kind of a dream come true.,8
37776,Howard,4, That does sound fun.,8
37777,Raj,4," Ooh, maybe we could come up with a business plan to compete with this place.",8
37778,Sheldon,4," I‰Ûªll give you a plan right now. Step one, open comic book store. Step two, start rumour this comic book store gives you genital warts. Step three, buy a big bag to put the money in.",8
37779,Leonard,4, It‰Ûªs not that bad.,8
37780,Scene,4, Emily‰Ûªs surgery. ,8
37781,Penny,4, Hey.,8
37782,Emily,4, Hi.,8
37783,Penny,4, Thank you so much for letting me practice my sales pitch on you. I really appreciate it.,8
37784,Emily,4, Sure.,8
37785,Penny,4," Um, I brought coffee. I wasn‰Ûªt sure what you like, so I got a regular, a cappuccino and a Chai tea. Since you like Raj, I thought you might be into that.",8
37786,Emily,4, Thanks. If we could get started. I‰Ûªm a little busy.,8
37787,Penny,4," Oh, yeah, sure. Let me just get out my materials. Leonard gave me this briefcase. He used to carry it around in high school. You can still see the dent where they whacked him with it. Okay, I would like to talk to you about our new birth control pill, Femevra.",8
37788,Emily,4, Great.,8
37789,Penny,4," So, Femevra‰Ûªs triphasic design provides balanced hormonal exposure.",8
37790,Emily,4, All right.,8
37791,Penny,4," It has also been shown to cause significantly fewer side effects than other oral contraceptives. Although it can cause acne, which, if you ask me, kind of increases its effectiveness as a contraceptive.",8
37792,Emily,4, Funny.,8
37793,Penny,4," Okay, I‰Ûªm sorry. Did we get off on the wrong foot? Because since the other night, I kind of feel like you might have a problem with me.",8
37794,Emily,4," No, it‰Ûªs fine.",8
37795,Penny,4," Are you sure, because it doesn‰Ûªt seem fine?",8
37796,Emily,4," Okay. If you really want to talk about this, I do have a problem.",8
37797,Penny,4," Oh, my God. Tell me, what did I do?",8
37798,Emily,4," Look, it‰Ûªs nothing. It‰Ûªs just, Raj told me that a while ago, you two hooked up.",8
37799,Penny,4," What? Oh, why would he say that?",8
37800,Emily,4, Did it not happen?,8
37801,Penny,4," Well, I wouldn‰Ûªt exactly call it a hook-up.",8
37802,Emily,4, Did you kiss?,8
37803,Penny,4, Yeah.,8
37804,Emily,4, Were you naked?,8
37805,Penny,4, Yeah.,8
37806,Emily,4," So, it was a hook-up.",8
37807,Penny,4, No. Yeah.,8
37808,Scene,4, The apartment. ,8
37809,Sheldon,4," So, what are some ways we could set our comic book store apart from the competition?",8
37810,Leonard,4," Oh, kids buy comic books. It would be great to figure out a way to get more kids in the store.",8
37811,Howard,4," You know, when I was a kid, I loved going there, but I could never get a ride.",8
37812,Raj,4," Ooh, what if we got a van and drove around and picked kids up?",8
37813,Sheldon,4," Nice. You mean, like at parks and schools?",8
37814,Howard,4," Toy stores, puppet shows.",8
37815,Leonard,4," Hold on. So, your idea is to get a van and cruise the streets looking for kids to pick up?",8
37816,Sheldon,4, Yes.,8
37817,Leonard,4, And are you gonna use candy to lure them in?,8
37818,Raj,4, We are now.,8
37819,Penny,4, You told Emily we hooked up?,8
37820,Raj,4," Um, well, in my defence, I tell everybody.",8
37821,Penny,4, Why would you say that?,8
37822,Raj,4, We were having a conversation about past lovers.,8
37823,Penny,4, We weren‰Ûªt lovers. Come on. Everyone knows we didn‰Ûªt sleep together. We got drunk and fooled around. Why couldn‰Ûªt you just leave me out of it?,8
37824,Raj,4," Well, we were being honest. You would leave me out of the conversation with the next guy if you dumped Leonard?",8
37825,Leonard,4, Why say it?,8
37826,Penny,4, Yes.,8
37827,Raj,4," Well, I would never leave you off my list, and not just because, without you, we‰Ûªre playing fast and loose with the word list.",8
37828,Penny,4," Well, good job. Now she hates me. Ugh.",8
37829,Raj,4, Great.,8
37830,Sheldon,4," On the bright side, that Oxford study was right. One friend down. I wonder who you‰Ûªre going to lose next.",8
37831,Raj,4," You, okay? It‰Ûªs you. You‰Ûªre, you‰Ûªre next.",8
37832,Sheldon,4, No. You‰Ûªre crazy about me.,8
37833,Scene,4, Penny‰Ûªs apartment.,8
37834,Penny,4," I don‰Ûªt know what Emily‰Ûªs so upset about anyway. Even if I had slept with him, so what? Everyone has a past.",8
37835,Amy,4, Hmm-hmm.,8
37836,Penny,4, Almost everyone has a past.,8
37837,Bernadette,4," Come on, look how pretty you are. I‰Ûªm sure this isn‰Ûªt the first girl to hate you.",8
37838,Penny,4, It‰Ûªs not.,8
37839,Bernadette,4, And I‰Ûªm sure you can turn it around.,8
37840,Penny,4, How? You can‰Ûªt force someone to like you.,8
37841,Amy,4," What if you just hang around and act like her friend until you wear her down? I mean, next thing you know, you‰Ûªre in her home, you‰Ûªre eating her food, drinking her wine.",8
37842,Penny,4," No, that won‰Ûªt work.",8
37843,Amy,4, You‰Ûªre right. Cheers.,8
37844,Bernadette,4," Oh, I know. Why don‰Ûªt you use your sales training to go back down there and sell yourself?",8
37845,Penny,4, What?,8
37846,Bernadette,4," Yeah. But instead of selling a drug, you‰Ûªd be selling Penny. it‰Ûªs cute.",8
37847,Penny,4, It‰Ûªs stupid.,8
37848,Bernadette,4," Well, maybe people would like you more if you didn‰Ûªt crap all over their ideas.",8
37849,Amy,4," I‰Ûªm gonna go with Penny on this one. Then again, why wouldn‰Ûªt I? I mean, we go way back.",8
37850,Penny,4," Oh, my God. I didn‰Ûªt used to like you.",8
37851,Amy,4, Shh. Amy‰Ûªs here now.,8
37852,Scene,4, Capital Comics.,8
37853,Sheldon,4," You know, the more I think about it, the more intrigued I am about having our own store.",8
37854,Howard,4, We‰Ûªll get to see all the new stuff before it hits the shelves.,8
37855,Sheldon,4," And we‰Ûªll get to have fun interactions with our customers. Like, this isn‰Ûªt a library, buy it or get out.",8
37856,Howard,4, You say things like that all the time.,8
37857,Sheldon,4," Yes, but as a store owner, I‰Ûªll finally have a good comeback to, You don‰Ûªt work here, shut up.",8
37858,Leonard,4," Uh, do you know how Penny told Raj he should have left her off his list?",8
37859,Howard,4, Yeah.,8
37860,Leonard,4," Well, do you think when she and I had that conversation, she left people off her list?",8
37861,Sheldon,4, I‰Ûªm sure she did.,8
37862,Leonard,4, Why?,8
37863,Sheldon,4," Because if she hadn‰Ûªt, she‰Ûªd still be wading through the list.",8
37864,Leonard,4, Will you stay out of this?,8
37865,Sheldon,4, If only Penny had said that once in a while.,8
37866,Howard,4," Hey, what difference does it make? You‰Ûªre the one she wants to marry.",8
37867,Leonard,4, That‰Ûªs true.,8
37868,Howard,4," Yeah, and I‰Ûªm not sure that complete honesty is always the best thing for a relationship.",8
37869,Sheldon,4," Yeah, he‰Ûªs right. Once, in a moment of candour, I told Amy that her hair reminded me of a duck caught in an oil spill. She stormed out. Which was sad, because we were playing Scrabble, and I had all the letters to spell persimmon.",8
37870,Leonard,4, Why are you even part of this conversation? You don‰Ûªt know anything about women.,8
37871,Sheldon,4," I know that if I had a wife or a fiancÌ©e, I‰Ûªd ask her first before I invested money in a comic book store.",8
37872,Howard,4, He‰Ûªs right.,8
37873,Sheldon,4," Yeah, well, of course I am. I was also right about her hair. It did everything but quack.",8
37874,Scene,4, The stairwell.,8
37875,Leonard,4, There‰Ûªs something I wanted to run past you.,8
37876,Penny,4, What‰Ûªs up?,8
37877,Leonard,4," Mm, the guys and I were thinking about investing in Stuart‰Ûªs comic book store. Is that okay?",8
37878,Penny,4, Why are you asking me?,8
37879,Leonard,4," Well, you know, we‰Ûªre engaged, and it‰Ûªs kind of a big deal financially. It seems like something we should talk about.",8
37880,Penny,4," Oh. Well, would you consider mounds of credit card debt kind of a big deal financially?",8
37881,Leonard,4, Yeah.,8
37882,Penny,4, Huh.,8
37883,Scene,4, Howard and Bernadette‰Ûªs apartment.,8
37884,Howard,4," Mm. So, me and the guys were talking about this great investment opportunity.",8
37885,Bernadette,4, Nope.,8
37886,Howard,4, But you didn‰Ûªt hear what it was.,8
37887,Bernadette,4, I know.,8
37888,Howard,4," Oh, come on.",8
37889,Bernadette,4, Fine. What is it?,8
37890,Howard,4, It‰Ûªs to help reopen the comic book store.,8
37891,Bernadette,4, Nope.,8
37892,Howard,4," Well, hear me out.",8
37893,Bernadette,4," Howard, you know we‰Ûªre saving up for a house.",8
37894,Howard,4," I know, but all the guys are doing it. We‰Ûªre splitting it four ways, so it‰Ûªs really not that much money.",8
37895,Bernadette,4, It just seems like a risky investment.,8
37896,Howard,4," I get that. I, okay, look, the real reason this is important is, before my dad left me and my mom, he used to take me to the comic book store. It was one of the few things we did together.",8
37897,Bernadette,4," Oh. Howie, I had no idea.",8
37898,Howard,4," Well, I don‰Ûªt like to talk about it.",8
37899,Bernadette,4," Oh, baby. That story‰Ûªs made up, isn‰Ûªt it?",8
37900,Howard,4, That‰Ûªs how much buying a comic book store means to me.,8
37901,Scene,4, The apartment.,8
37902,Sheldon,4, I‰Ûªd like your honest opinion on something.,8
37903,Amy,4, Of course.,8
37904,Sheldon,4," Now, before I start, I need you to know that I‰Ûªm very excited about this, and anything you say that isn‰Ûªt enthusiastically supportive will throw our entire relationship into question. So, keep an open mind.",8
37905,Amy,4," I‰Ûªm feeling a little backed into a corner, Sheldon.",8
37906,Sheldon,4," Perfect. Now, I‰Ûªm considering investing in Stuart‰Ûªs comic book store.",8
37907,Amy,4," Interesting. Can you see how a grown man, an accomplished scientist, who invests in a store that sells picture books about flying men in colourful underwear might be wasting both his financial and intellectual resources?",8
37908,Sheldon,4, No.,8
37909,Amy,4, Then I think it‰Ûªs a terrific idea.,8
37910,Sheldon,4, Great. Wait till you hear about our van.,8
37911,Scene,4, Penny‰Ûªs apartment.,8
37912,Raj,4, Hey.,8
37913,Penny,4, Hi.,8
37914,Raj,4, Thanks for inviting us over.,8
37915,Penny,4," Oh, thank you for coming.",8
37916,Emily,4," Uh, listen, Penny, before you start, I just want to apologise for being so rude the other day in my office.",8
37917,Penny,4," No, no. No need to apologise.",8
37918,Raj,4," Excuse me, can I say something? I just love both you guys, and I want you to get along. And when I say love I meant as a friend. And, uh, way too soon, right?",8
37919,Penny,4," Okay, sit down. Listen, Emily, what happened between me and Raj was a long time ago.",8
37920,Raj,4," It was, and I may have made it seem like a bigger deal than I should have.",8
37921,Penny,4," Yeah, and Leonard and I are engaged now, and I‰Ûªm just hoping we can put this whole thing behind us.",8
37922,Emily,4," Mm. I‰Ûªd like that, too. Yeah, I thought I‰Ûªd be okay with it, but then I saw how pretty you are.",8
37923,Penny,4," Oh, that‰Ûªs so sweet. I mean, look at you, you are gorgeous.",8
37924,Raj,4," It‰Ûªs true, you‰Ûªre both gorgeous. Kind of says something about the man who could bed you both. You get why I‰Ûªve been alone most of my adult life.",8
37925,Scene,4, Mrs Wolowitz‰Ûªs house.,8
37926,Stuart,4," So, what brings you by?",8
37927,Howard,4," Well, I don‰Ûªt need a reason, it‰Ûªs my house.",8
37928,Stuart,4," Technically, it‰Ûªs your mom‰Ûªs house, but we certainly want you to feel welcome.",8
37929,Howard,4, I‰Ûªm always welcome.,8
37930,Stuart,4," Mm, just try and call first.",8
37931,Bernadette,4," Okay, let‰Ûªs get down to business. Howie was thinking about putting up some money to help you reopen the store, but before that happens, I have a few questions.",8
37932,Stuart,4," Oh. I appreciate the offer, but actually your mother already gave me the money.",8
37933,Howard,4, What?,8
37934,Stuart,4," Yeah. I told her it was too much, but she said she was happy to help out her bubala.",8
37935,Howard,4," Excuse me. Ma, you are cancelling that cheque, and Stuart is not your bubala, I‰Ûªm your bubala. You can‰Ûªt have more than one bubala.",8
37936,Stuart,4," I don‰Ûªt know who he‰Ûªs talking to. She‰Ûªs at Target, buying me shirts.",8
37937,Scene,4, Penny‰Ûªs apartment. ,8
37938,Raj,4, I‰Ûªm so glad we could work this all out.,8
37939,Penny,4," Yeah, me, too.",8
37940,Emily,4," You know, we should have dinner one night with you and Leonard.",8
37941,Penny,4," Oh, we would love that.",8
37942,Raj,4, Great.,8
37943,Penny,4," Okay, good night, guys.",8
37944,Emily,4," All right, night.",8
37945,Penny,4, Bye.,8
37946,Emily and Penny (simultaneously),4, I hate her.,8
37947,Scene,4, The apartment. ,8
37948,Raj,4, I‰Ûªm really disappointed we‰Ûªre not gonna have our own comic book store.,8
37949,Leonard,4, I know. I was looking forward to it.,8
37950,Sheldon,4," It would‰Ûªve been so nice to have a place that was ours, where we could just sit and read comics in peace.",8
37951,Howard,4, With comfy seats.,8
37952,Raj,4, And snacks.,8
37953,Sheldon,4," Well, I guess it was too good to be true.",8
37954,Leonard,4, Yeah.,8
37955,Scene,5, The cafeteria.,8
37956,Raj,5," Hey, I read that someone invented a way to convert your footsteps into electromagnetic energy so you can charge your cell phone while walking.",8
37957,Leonard,5, We had that idea years ago. How come we never did anything with it?,8
37958,Howard,5," Probably because we left the diagram of it in the restaurant, and none of us wanted to walk back.",8
37959,Sheldon,5," I know the real reason you never made progress with that idea. You thought of it September 22nd, 2007. Two days later, Penny moved in, and so much blood rushed to your genitals, your brain became a ghost town.",8
37960,Leonard,5, That‰Ûªs not what happened.,8
37961,Sheldon,5, I remember it distinctly because I had just composed my annual poem commemorating the anniversary of Dr. Seuss‰Ûªs death.,8
37962,Howard,5, No one wants to hear it.,8
37963,Sheldon,5," Why, die. Why did he die? Old, told. I was told he was old.",8
37964,Leonard,5, Penny is not the reason I didn‰Ûªt pursue that idea.,8
37965,Sheldon,5," Oh, really? Since meeting her, what have been your greatest accomplishments?",8
37966,Raj,5, Easy. Sleeping with Penny.,8
37967,Howard,5, Getting Penny to go back out with him after she dumped him.,8
37968,Raj,5, Tricking Penny into getting engaged.,8
37969,Howard,5," And a few weeks ago, he almost did a pull-up.",8
37970,Leonard,5, I think someone owes me an apology.,8
37971,Sheldon,5," Well, don‰Ûªt feel bad. I think we‰Ûªve all been distracted since the girls entered our lives.",8
37972,Howard,5, You admit Amy‰Ûªs a distraction?,8
37973,Sheldon,5," Oh, very much so. Listen to this. This is from two days ago. Hi. Hope you‰Ûªre having a good day. Who has time for this constant sexting?",8
37974,Leonard,5," Well, maybe we have lost our focus.",8
37975,Howard,5, It wouldn‰Ûªt kill us to get together and brainstorm ideas.,8
37976,Raj,5," Ooh, we could have one of those retreats.",8
37977,Howard,5, My cousin has a cabin out in the woods.,8
37978,Sheldon,5, I‰Ûªm not going to a cabin in the woods. Did you see the movie Cabin in the Woods?,8
37979,Leonard,5, Then we‰Ûªll go to a hotel.,8
37980,Sheldon,5, A hotel? Did you see The Shining?,8
37981,Raj,5, We could go up to Big Bear and get a house on the lake.,8
37982,Sheldon,5, Did you see The Lake House?,8
37983,Raj,5, Nothing bad happens in The Lake House.,8
37984,Sheldon,5," Yeah, well, no, not to them. To me. Time traveling mailbox. The only time that traveled was an hour and half of my life down the toilet.",8
37985,Leonard,5, Fine. Then we‰Ûªll just stay here and do it.,8
37986,Sheldon,5," Well, you didn‰Ûªt suggest a beach house.",8
37987,Leonard,5, You would go to a beach house?,8
37988,Sheldon,5," Well, good Lord, no, have you seen Jaws?",8
37989,Scene,5, Penny‰Ûªs apartment.,8
37990,Penny,5, Hey.,8
37991,Leonard,5," Hey. So, the guys and I are talking about having kind of a science retreat this weekend. I just wanted to know if that‰Ûªs okay. You and I had talked about going to brunch on Sunday.",8
37992,Penny,5, Want to go to Vegas this weekend?,8
37993,Amy,5, Of course I do.,8
37994,Penny,5, Bernadette? Girl‰Ûªs weekend. Vegas. You in?,8
37995,Bernadette,5," Hell, yeah.",8
37996,Penny,5, Yes. I‰Ûªll check flights.,8
37997,Bernadette,5, I‰Ûªll check hotels.,8
37998,Amy,5," I‰Ûªll check my underpants. I‰Ûªm so excited, I think I peed.",8
37999,Leonard,5, They seem okay with it.,8
38000,Scene,5, The apartment.,8
38001,Raj,5, Hey.,8
38002,Leonard,5, Hey.,8
38003,Howard,5, Hey. I didn‰Ûªt think you‰Ûªd make it.,8
38004,Raj,5, Why not?,8
38005,Howard,5," Well, ‰Ûªcause you have a steady girlfriend now, and we assumed you‰Ûªd have to stay home to lower the food down to her in the pit.",8
38006,Raj,5," For your information, Emily is working tonight.",8
38007,Sheldon,5," Yeah, one would assume, on getting out of the pit.",8
38008,Leonard,5," Okay, let‰Ûªs focus. The girls are gone, we have 48 hours. There are no distractions. Let‰Ûªs change the world.",8
38009,Sheldon,5, Thinking caps on.,8
38010,Howard,5, Here we go.,8
38011,Raj,5," Ooh, this is exciting. We‰Ûªre innovating. I feel like we‰Ûªre in the Facebook movie.",8
38012,Howard,5, Oh. I never saw that.,8
38013,Sheldon,5, Really?,8
38014,Raj,5," Oh. It‰Ûªs wonderful, and I swear I‰Ûªm not saying that because Justin Timberlake is in it.",8
38015,Sheldon,5," Yeah, I have it on Blu-ray. We should watch it.",8
38016,Raj,5, Cool. I‰Ûªll make the popcorn.,8
38017,Leonard,5," Guys, in 30 seconds, we went from let‰Ûªs change the world to let‰Ûªs watch TV.",8
38018,Sheldon,5, I‰Ûªm sorry. Is that a no?,8
38019,Howard,5, Okay. No. Leonard‰Ûªs right. We‰Ûªre here to focus. Didn‰Ûªt we used to have a list of all our ideas?,8
38020,Leonard,5," I, I think I still have it.",8
38021,Sheldon,5, I did not get a clear answer. I‰Ûªm gonna set this down now.,8
38022,Leonard,5," Ah, here it is. Whoa. I haven‰Ûªt looked at these in years. Robot girlfriend.",8
38023,Howard,5," Mm, that was mine.",8
38024,Leonard,5, Robot prostitute.,8
38025,Howard,5, Also mine.,8
38026,Sheldon,5, Wait. I‰Ûªm confused. Why would you need both a robot girlfriend and a robot prostitute?,8
38027,Howard,5, There‰Ûªs just some things you don‰Ûªt do with your robot girlfriend.,8
38028,Raj,5," Boy, when you met Bernadette, the field of robotics really took a hit.",8
38029,Leonard,5," Okay, let‰Ûªs just skip all the inventions you can have sex with. All right, no, here we go, ergonomic heated seat cushion.",8
38030,Howard,5," No, it vibrates. Keep going.",8
38031,Leonard,5," You know, let‰Ûªs just come up with something new.",8
38032,Sheldon,5," You know, a number of significant innovations have been inspired by science fiction. The, the geosynchronous satellite from Arthur C. Clarke. The Motorola flip phone, that came from Star Trek. And I‰Ûªve long suspected that the idea of an African-American president was stolen from the movie Deep Impact.",8
38033,Raj,5," Hey, the future they show in Back to the Future II is only a year away. A lot of the things in that movie haven‰Ûªt been invented yet.",8
38034,Leonard,5, How cool would that be if we could make one of those a reality?,8
38035,Sheldon,5," If we could figure out the scientific basis for Marty‰Ûªs hover board, that would have universal application.",8
38036,Leonard,5," Well, it‰Ûªs, it‰Ûªs possible at absolute zero, but we would have to remove the temperature restrictions.",8
38037,Raj,5," Oh, I have an idea.",8
38038,Sheldon,5, I think I have the same one.,8
38039,Howard,5, We got to watch Back to the Future II.,8
38040,Raj,5, I‰Ûªll make the popcorn.,8
38041,Scene,5, A Vegas hotel room.,8
38042,Penny,5," So, where should we go first?",8
38043,Amy,5, Ooh. There‰Ûªs a cover band in the lounge.,8
38044,Penny,5, Nah.,8
38045,Amy,5, But they play Barry Manilow.,8
38046,Penny,5, No.,8
38047,Amy,5, But they‰Ûªre called Fairly Manilow.,8
38048,Penny,5, Oh. Okay.,8
38049,Amy,5, Great.,8
38050,Penny,5, No.,8
38051,Bernadette,5," Well, what do you want to do?",8
38052,Penny,5," Well, we‰Ûªre in Vegas. I want to go downstairs, get a bucket of margaritas, dance until I vomit all over a roulette wheel and watch it go everywhere.",8
38053,Amy,5, What if we don‰Ûªt want to vomit?,8
38054,Penny,5," Oh, you will. That‰Ûªs why they give you the bucket. Uh-oh.",8
38055,Amy,5, What?,8
38056,Penny,5, It‰Ûªs my boss. They moved my field ride up to Monday.,8
38057,Amy,5, What does that mean?,8
38058,Penny,5," It means instead of having a week to study, I only have two days.",8
38059,Bernadette,5, That sucks.,8
38060,Amy,5, Can you start in the morning?,8
38061,Penny,5," Uh, it‰Ûªs kind of a lot. You know, let me do a little tonight, and I‰Ûªll catch up with you guys later.",8
38062,Bernadette,5, You sure?,8
38063,Penny,5," Yeah, it‰Ûªs okay. Go ahead.",8
38064,Amy,5," So, um, now that Penny‰Ûªs not coming‰Û_",8
38065,Bernadette,5, We‰Ûªre not seeing Fairly Manilow.,8
38066,Amy,5, Okay.,8
38067,Scene,5, The apartment. ,8
38068,Howard,5," Hold on. Pause. Something doesn‰Ûªt make sense. Look, in 2015, Biff steals the sports almanac and takes the time machine back to 1955, to give it to his younger self. But as soon as he does that, he changes the future, so the 2015 he returns to would be a different 2015, not the 2015 that Marty and Doc were in.",8
38069,Leoanard,5," This is Hot Tub Time Machine all over again. If future Biff goes back to 2015 right after he gives young Biff the almanac, he could get back to the 2015 with Marty and Doc in it. Because it wasn‰Ûªt until his 21st birthday that 1955 Biff placed his first bet.",8
38070,Sheldon,5," Wait. Whoa, whoa. Is placed right?",8
38071,Leonard,5, What do you mean?,8
38072,Sheldon,5, Is placed the right tense for something that would have happened in the future of a past that was affected by something from the future?,8
38073,Leonard,5, Had will have placed?,8
38074,Sheldon,5, That‰Ûªs my boy.,8
38075,Leonard,5," Okay, so, it wasn‰Ûªt until his 21st birthday that Biff had will have placed his first bet and made his millions. That‰Ûªs when he altered the timeline.",8
38076,Sheldon,5," Yeah, but he had will haven‰Ûªt placed it!",8
38077,Howard,5, What?,8
38078,Sheldon,5," Unlike Hot Tub Time Machine, this couldn‰Ûªt be more simple. When Biff gets the almanac in 1955, the alternate future he creates isn‰Ûªt the one in which Marty and Doc Brown ever use the time machine to travel to 2015. Therefore, in the new timeline, Marty and Doc never brought the time machine‰Û_",8
38079,Leonard,5, Wait. Is brought right?,8
38080,Sheldon,5, Marty and Doc never had have had brought?,8
38081,Leonard,5, I don‰Ûªt know. You did it to me.,8
38082,Sheldon,5," Oh, I‰Ûªm going with it. Marty and Doc never had have had brought the time machine to 2015. That means 2015 Biff could also not had have had brought the almanac to 1955 Biff. Therefore, the timeline in which 1955 Biff gets the almanac is also the timeline in which 1955 Biff never gets the almanac. And not just never gets. Never have, never hasn‰Ûªt, never had have hasn‰Ûªt.",8
38083,Raj,5," He‰Ûªs right. Also, what kind of name is Biff? Sounds like when you pop open a can of Pillsbury dough. Biff.",8
38084,Howard,5," Oh, that stuff is so good wrapped around cocktail weenies.",8
38085,Leonard,5, Guys.,8
38086,Sheldon,5," Do you know that the word wiener comes from the German name of the Austrian capital Vienna, or Wien?",8
38087,Raj,5, Do you know if you look at Austria on a map it actually looks like a wiener?,8
38088,Leonard,5," Guys, what are we doing? We sent the girls away so we could focus.",8
38089,Sheldon,5, I don‰Ûªt think it worked.,8
38090,Scene,5, A bar in Vegas.,8
38091,Amy,5," Maybe after this, you‰Ûªll be in the mood for some Manilow.",8
38092,Bernadette,5," I think after this, I‰Ûªll be dead.",8
38093,Amy,5," Look at us out, while Penny‰Ûªs in the room studying.",8
38094,Bernadette,5, I‰Ûªm proud of her. This is a great opportunity. It‰Ûªs nice to see her take it seriously.,8
38095,Amy,5, It is. But enough about Penny. Let‰Ûªs talk about us. We‰Ûªre looking good.,8
38096,Bernadette,5, We are.,8
38097,Amy,5," Better than good. I mean, look at you. Your body‰Ûªs bangin‰Ûª.",8
38098,Bernadette,5, Amy.,8
38099,Amy,5," Don‰Ûªt Amy me. We‰Ûªre always talking about how hot Penny is. Come on, scientist to scientist, how big are those Hadron Colliders?",8
38100,Bernadette,5, You‰Ûªre embarrassing me.,8
38101,Amy,5," Oh, don‰Ûªt be embarrassed. I‰Ûªll show you the divot in my spine.",8
38102,Bernadette,5, What?,8
38103,Amy,5," No, no, it‰Ûªs okay. I was born with it. If you put a double-A battery in there, it makes my leg kick.",8
38104,Scene,5, Leonard‰Ûªs laboratory.,8
38105,Leonard,5, All right.,8
38106,Sheldon,5," Oh, this is already better. There are far fewer distractions in here.",8
38107,Raj,5," Plus, this is where our minds are conditioned to focus on work.",8
38108,Leonard,5," So, I‰Ûªve been thinking about the hover boards, and maybe there‰Ûªs a way we could use Maglev technology.",8
38109,Howard,5," Or if we could figure out a way to supercool the materials, we could utilize quantum coupling.",8
38110,Sheldon,5," Well, I wonder if anyone‰Ûªs tried that.",8
38111,Raj,5, Go online and look it up.,8
38112,Howard,5," Oh, I can‰Ûªt argue with him. It‰Ûªs right there on the screen. Austria does look like a wiener.",8
38113,Raj,5," That‰Ûªs nothing, dude. Go check out how hung Florida is.",8
38114,Leonard,5, I‰Ûªm sure Mrs. Florida‰Ûªs walking funny. Can we get back to work?,8
38115,Sheldon,5," Yeah, he‰Ûªs right. Oh, here‰Ûªs a thought. What if we use some form of operant conditioning techniques to keep us from getting off topic?",8
38116,Howard,5, Like behavior modification?,8
38117,Sheldon,5," Yeah, exactly. Did you know those techniques were used to actually teach pigeons to play ping-pong?",8
38118,Raj,5, That cannot be true.,8
38119,Raj,5," Hey, it was match point.",8
38120,Leonard,5, Some psychologists perform operant conditioning with punishment. Maybe we can come up with a punishment for straying off topic.,8
38121,Raj,5, Not getting to see who wins at pigeon ping-pong comes to mind.,8
38122,Howard,5, We could snap a rubber band on our wrists every time we get sidetracked.,8
38123,Sheldon,5," Mmm, not bad. You know, in medieval times, idle chatter was punished with a device called the scold‰Ûªs bridle. It‰Ûªs an iron cage that‰Ûªs locked around the head and pierces the tongue.",8
38124,Leonard,5, If only we had one.,8
38125,Sheldon,5," Oh, I‰Ûªll check Amazon.",8
38126,Scene,5, The hotel room.,8
38127,Bernadette,5, Housekeeping.,8
38128,Amy,5, We had a complaint about somebody pooping on a party in there.,8
38129,Bernadette,5, It was us the whole time.,8
38130,Amy,5, Why‰Ûªd you tell her? It was working.,8
38131,Bernadette,5, Was it working?,8
38132,Penny,5, Yeah.,8
38133,Bernadette,5," Oh, I‰Ûªm so sorry.",8
38134,Penny,5, You guys look like you‰Ûªre having fun.,8
38135,Amy,5, We‰Ûªre having the best time.,8
38136,Bernadette,5, Guess who won a hundred dollars playing craps.,8
38137,Penny,5, That‰Ûªs a dollar.,8
38138,Bernadette,5, Then guess who wildly overtipped a cocktail waitress.,8
38139,Amy,5," Hey, Penny, hey, let‰Ûªs go. We found a place that has Australian male strippers.",8
38140,Bernadette,5, We want to see if they twirl their junk in the other direction.,8
38141,Penny,5, That sounds so great. But I have a little more studying to do.,8
38142,Amy,5, Can you believe this nerd?,8
38143,Bernadette,5," Come on, do you want to sit here being a loser, or do you want to watch me climb into an Australian man‰Ûªs G-string like a baby kangaroo?",8
38144,Penny,5," All right, guys, look, I would love to go out, but I‰Ûªve got to get this done, okay? So have fun at the club. And if you get in trouble, find a policeman. And if he‰Ûªs taking off his pants, he is not a real policeman.",8
38145,Amy,5," Okay, okay, this is obviously very important to her. Let‰Ûªs just, we‰Ûªll help her study so she can get done quicker. Here, here, I‰Ûªm gonna quiz you. I‰Ûªm gonna quiz you. I got your notes. I got your notes. I got your notes. If you want these, they‰Ûªre gonna be at the strip club.",8
38146,Bernadette,5, Aren‰Ûªt you gonna chase her?,8
38147,Penny,5, To the walk-in closet? Sure.,8
38148,Scene,5, Leonard‰Ûªs lab.,8
38149,Leonard,5," Okay, so we agree, whenever someone takes us off topic they get their arm hair yanked off.",8
38150,Raj,5, And I really can‰Ûªt let that happen or the girl who does my eyebrows will think I‰Ûªve been cheating on her.,8
38151,Leonard,5," All right, now, one benefit of quantum coupling‰Û_",8
38152,Sheldon,5," Wait, a question, who decides if someone‰Ûªs gone off topic?",8
38153,Leonard,5," I think it‰Ûªll be pretty clear. If not, we‰Ûªll take a vote. Oh, and also‰Û_",8
38154,Sheldon,5, Ow. We didn‰Ûªt vote!,8
38155,Leonard,5," We didn‰Ûªt have to, that was clearly a tangent. Now come on. Back to work. If we‰Ûªre leaning towards quantum coupling‰Û_ Aah! Why?",8
38156,Sheldon,5, You said quantum coupling. That made me think of the show Quantum Leap. That‰Ûªs a tangent and it‰Ûªs your fault.,8
38157,Howard,5," That‰Ûªs ridiculous. Sheldon, I vote that is not a tangent.",8
38158,Leonard,5, Thank you. And now I owe you one.,8
38159,Sheldon,5, Ow. That was your fault.,8
38160,Howard,5, Hey.,8
38161,Raj,5," Ooh, that is a lot of hair. Ow. And now I‰Ûªm gonna hear it from Jenny.",8
38162,Leonard,5, Everyone stop. This was a stupid idea. Negative reinforcement isn‰Ûªt working.,8
38163,Sheldon,5, I think you mean positive punishment. Negative reinforcement is the removal of a positive stimulus. It‰Ûªs a common mistake.,8
38164,Howard,5, Negative reinforcement is really wrong?,8
38165,Sheldon,5," Oh, it‰Ûªs used incorrectly all the time. Even Bill Murray makes that mistake in the first scene of Ghostbusters.",8
38166,Raj,5, No way. Not Bill Murray.,8
38167,Bill Murray (on screen),5, I‰Ûªm studying the effect of negative reinforcement on ESP ability.,8
38168,Raj,5, Huh. Bill Murray did get it wrong.,8
38169,Howard,5, Jump ahead to the Stay Puft Marshmallow Man.,8
38170,Leonard,5, No.,8
38171,Sheldon,5, Leonard‰Ûªs right. We can‰Ûªt just jump ahead. We have to watch the whole movie.,8
38172,Leonard,5," Look. We keep procrastinating. We saw Back to the Future II, pigeons playing ping-pong, a bunch of countries that look like genitals and one guy whose genitals look like Denmark.",8
38173,Raj,5," Yeah, sorry for clicking on that.",8
38174,Leonard,5, It‰Ûªs late. We‰Ûªve wasted hours. Can we please find it in ourselves to do any amount of work tonight?,8
38175,Sheldon,5, But we didn‰Ûªt see them bust one ghost.,8
38176,Leonard,5," So you‰Ûªre, you‰Ûªre saying we should stand here in my lab on a Saturday night and watch the rest of Ghostbusters on a crappy laptop?",8
38177,Sheldon,5, No.,8
38178,Scene,5, The apartment.,8
38179,All,5, Ghostbusters!,8
38180,Leonard,5, It really does hold up.,8
38181,Scene,5, The Vegas strip club.,8
38182,Bernadette,5, See? Isn‰Ûªt this better than a hotel room?,8
38183,Penny,5, Yep. Shake that thing.,8
38184,Bernadette,5, Have you ever seen a body so fine?,8
38185,Amy,5," We had some pretty hot corpses in my anatomy class, but none of them moved like that.",8
38186,Scene,5, The hotel room.,8
38187,Penny,5," Good morning. You want to go to the pool? Come on, you said it yourself, only nerds and losers stay in the room. Wow, it‰Ûªs bright out. Isn‰Ûªt it bright? I should probably close these curtains. Nah. Bye.",8
38188,Bernadette,5, Would you please close the drapes?,8
38189,Amy,5, Okay.,8
38190,Scene,6, The apartment.,8
38191,Bernadette,6, I like your suit.,8
38192,Penny,6," Oh, thanks. Got a couple new outfits for work.",8
38193,Howard,6," How does it feel knowing your fiancÌ©e‰Ûªs job is to go out and flirt with doctors, looking like that, while you sit here, you know, looking like this?",8
38194,Leonard,6, She doesn‰Ûªt flirt with doctors.,8
38195,Penny,6, Yeah. It‰Ûªs all very professional.,8
38196,Amy,6," You know when you bend over, I can see down your shirt?",8
38197,Penny,6," Okay, good.",8
38198,Bernadette,6," Speaking of new careers, how are things going with dark matter, Sheldon?",8
38199,Sheldon,6," Oh, yeah, I‰Ûªd have to say it‰Ûªs the most exiting time in the history of the field.",8
38200,Bernadette,6, Oh. What‰Ûªs going on?,8
38201,Sheldon,6, I started doing it.,8
38202,Raj,6," You know, the government funded the biggest experiment yet to detect dark matter.",8
38203,Leonard,6," Yeah, I‰Ûªve read about that, they‰Ûªre sending research teams down into abandoned salt mines.",8
38204,Raj,6," You know, Sheldon, if we apply to be one of those teams, we could be on the ground floor of something big, not just for theoretical physics but for astrophysics as well.",8
38205,Penny,6," Wait, hang on, you guys are gonna work in a mine?",8
38206,Sheldon,6, Why not?,8
38207,Penny,6, You had a panic attack when we went through the car wash.,8
38208,Sheldon,6, Perhaps the emotion you‰Ûªre referring to was shock at you having something cleaned.,8
38209,Leonard,6," I think what Penny meant is, the thought of you two in a mine is kind of funny, it‰Ûªs like a cat riding a Roomba.",8
38210,Howard,6,"If they get scared, they‰Ûªll have those hats with the lights on them, ‰Ûªcause down there it‰Ûªs night-night all the time.",8
38211,Bernadette,6, Maybe they could ride around in one of those mine carts that go ee-oo-ee-oo-ee-oo.,8
38212,Leonard,6," Yeah, it‰Ûªll help them get away when they see a g-g-ghost.",8
38213,Sheldon,6,Are they making fun of us?,8
38214,Raj,6, Yup.,8
38215,Sheldon,6, I miss the old days when I couldn‰Ûªt tell.,8
38216,Scene,6, Penny‰Ûªs apartment.,8
38217,Leonard,6," So, one of my favourite video games of all time is called Shadow of the Colossus, and it was only for PlayStation 2, but then they came out with a new version for PS3 with better graphics. I finally got the chance to play it, and for some reason, it just wasn‰Ûªt as good as the first one. Or something about yoga.",8
38218,Penny,6," I‰Ûªm sorry, I was thinking about work.",8
38219,Leonard,6," Well, I was just saying that there was this video game‰Û_",8
38220,Penny,6," Yeah, that‰Ûªs when I started thinking about work. Uh, listen, I‰Ûªve got some good news.",8
38221,Leonard,6, Hmm.,8
38222,Penny,6, This is for you.,8
38223,Leonard,6, Huh. What is this?,8
38224,Penny,6," Well, you know how they gave me the company car? Didn‰Ûªt make sense to have two, so I sold the other one.",8
38225,Leonard,6, The one I gave you?,8
38226,Penny,6," Yeah. And there‰Ûªs your money back, and now we‰Ûªre even. How great is that?",8
38227,Leonard,6," Uh, yeah.",8
38228,Penny,6, What?,8
38229,Leonard,6, Nothing.,8
38230,Penny,6," Oh, come on, Leonard, I know the car was a thoughtful gesture and I really appreciate it, but it doesn‰Ûªt make sense to have both.",8
38231,Leonard,6, You‰Ûªre right.,8
38232,Penny,6, What should I have done? Taken a picture of us in the car and put it in a pink frame with puffy paint around it that says best fiancÌ© ever?,8
38233,Leonard,6, Doesn‰Ûªt sound that bad.,8
38234,Penny,6," Well, good, because that‰Ûªs what I did.",8
38235,Leonard,6," Aw, oh, thank you. That is so sweet.",8
38236,Penny,6," Well, it‰Ûªs not that sweet, I paid for the frame with your money and then got a massage.",8
38237,Leonard,6," You know what, you don‰Ûªt have to give me this. You keep it.",8
38238,Penny,6, Why?,8
38239,Leonard,6," The car was a gift, it was something you needed. I was happy to help you out.",8
38240,Penny,6," And I really appreciate it, but now I don‰Ûªt need it, so here you go.",8
38241,Leonard,6," Well, this is silly, so you don‰Ûªt need the car, but you could use it to buy yourself something else, like a new purse to put all this money in.",8
38242,Penny,6," Sweetie, I can buy my own stuff. I have a good job now.",8
38243,Leonard,6," I know, and I‰Ûªm proud of you, but that doesn‰Ûªt mean I can‰Ûªt do something nice. Like this.",8
38244,Penny,6," Okay, I don‰Ûªt want this to turn into a fight.",8
38245,Leonard,6," I don‰Ûªt, either.",8
38246,Penny,6," Great. Thank you. Can you pass the salt, please?",8
38247,Leonard,6," Sure. In my mind, that broke the tension with comedy and led to sex.",8
38248,Scene,6, Sheldon‰Ûªs office.,8
38249,Raj,6," Hey, Sheldon, you busy?",8
38250,Sheldon,6," I‰Ûªm always busy. This mind is capable of advanced multitasking. You know, currently, I‰Ûªm attempting to solve the Penrose conjecture, I‰Ûªm composing my Nobel acceptance speech for when I‰Ûªve solved the Penrose conjecture, and I‰Ûªm wondering how mermaids have babies.",8
38251,Raj,6, Don‰Ûªt they lay eggs on a rock?,8
38252,Sheldon,6, Now I‰Ûªve got room for another thing. What do you want?,8
38253,Raj,6," So, I did a little research on what the conditions are like in the mines, and the guys might be right, sounds pretty rough down there. For starters, it‰Ûªs very humid, and about a hundred degrees.",8
38254,Sheldon,6," Well, I‰Ûªm from Texas and you‰Ûªre from India, we‰Ûªre no strangers to the fragrant armpit. Next.",8
38255,Raj,6," It‰Ûªs also a live mine, so there‰Ûªll be dynamite explosions going off in the distance.",8
38256,Sheldon,6," Yeah, I have a lactose intolerant roommate with a taste for ice cream. Next.",8
38257,Raj,6," Oh, you have to be down there for 12 hours at a time.",8
38258,Sheldon,6, Yeah? We have to be somewhere.,8
38259,Raj,6," Well, there‰Ûªs no toilets, we‰Ûªll have to do our business in a bucket.",8
38260,Sheldon,6," So it‰Ûªs settled, we‰Ûªre not doing it.",8
38261,Raj,6," Look, I get it, but before we pass up on an incredible opportunity, I was thinking about when Howard was training to go to space, they put him in a simulated environment.",8
38262,Sheldon,6, Interesting. You‰Ûªre suggesting that we recreate the conditions of the mine to see if we can handle it.,8
38263,Raj,6, Exactly.,8
38264,Sheldon,6, Very well.,8
38265,Raj,6, So where should we do it?,8
38266,Sheldon,6," Well, I‰Ûªll just Google hot, dark and moist, see what comes up.",8
38267,Raj,6," Uh, Sheldon‰Û_",8
38268,Sheldon,6," Oh, there, well, look, there‰Ûªs all kinds of videos.",8
38269,Scene,6, Penny‰Ûªs apartment.,8
38270,Leonard,6," Hey, you got a sec?",8
38271,Penny,6, Hi. Sure.,8
38272,Leonard,6, I was hoping we could talk about the money again.,8
38273,Penny,6," Oh, sweetie, just forget about it.",8
38274,Leonard,6," No, no, no, no, hear me out. I know things got a little weird last night.",8
38275,Penny,6," Well, leaving an envelope full of cash on my dresser after sex would count as weird.",8
38276,Leonard,6," Well, I think I came up with a pretty good solution.",8
38277,Penny,6, Mm.,8
38278,Leonard,6," Why don‰Ûªt we just put the money in a joint account? It‰Ûªll be our first money together. We can use it for the wedding, the honeymoon, whatever.",8
38279,Penny,6," You know what, that‰Ûªs great. I love that.",8
38280,Leonard,6," Yeah, of course you do, I‰Ûªm not just a genius in bed. You sure are, baby.",8
38281,Penny,6, You two want to be alone?,8
38282,Leonard,6," I want you to know I get why you don‰Ûªt want the money, you‰Ûªve got this new job, you‰Ûªre excited about being financially independent, and I am nothing but proud of you.",8
38283,Penny,6," Oh, thank you so much. It feels so good to hear you say that. And I want you to know that I get this job kind of changes the balance in our relationship, and I‰Ûªm trying to be sensitive to that.",8
38284,Leonard,6, What?,8
38285,Penny,6," Well, I just think that maybe you‰Ûªre a little hung up on the money because I‰Ûªm less reliant on you now, and that‰Ûªs a little scary.",8
38286,Leonard,6, Hmm. Maybe. Or maybe I tried to do something nice and maybe you had a problem with it because of your control issues.,8
38287,Penny,6, Control issues?,8
38288,Leonard,6, Maybe.,8
38289,Penny,6," Or, maybe now that I‰Ûªm no longer an out-of-work actress who can‰Ûªt pay for her own dinner, that makes you a little insecure.",8
38290,Leonard,6," Well, I can‰Ûªt believe you‰Ûªd say that. You know how insecure I am about my insecurities.",8
38291,Penny,6, You know what? I‰Ûªm sorry. It‰Ûªs stupid to fight over money.,8
38292,Leonard,6," Yeah, I‰Ûªm sorry, too. We‰Ûªre about to share the rest of our lives together. It‰Ûªs our money, who cares who has it?",8
38293,Penny,6," Ugh, You‰Ûªre right, who cares? Mm. Get that money out of my back pocket or I will break your fingers.",8
38294,Scene,6, The university basement.,8
38295,Raj,6, Huh. All this time I never knew there were steam tunnels down here.,8
38296,Amy,6," Most universities have them. When I was an undergrad, I spent three days in one pledging a sorority.",8
38297,Raj,6, Did you get in?,8
38298,Amy,6, No. They forgot I was there. But it really opened up my pores.,8
38299,Sheldon,6," Well, according to my research, the steam tunnels below this access point should be the closest analog to the mines.",8
38300,Raj,6, This is gonna be so much more accurate than the steam room at the gym.,8
38301,Sheldon,6," Plus, there‰Ûªs almost no chance we‰Ûªll see any of our coworkers half naked.",8
38302,Raj,6," Or totally naked. I love Howard, but the dude needs a little shame.",8
38303,Sheldon,6," All right, Amy, this walkie-talkie is yours. If we run into any problems, I‰Ûªll contact you. And if anything bad happens, what‰Ûªs the rule?",8
38304,Amy,6, Save you first; come back for Raj only if there‰Ûªs time.,8
38305,Raj,6, We‰Ûªre going to be fine.,8
38306,Amy,6," Sheldon, I‰Ûªm really impressed you‰Ûªre willing to try this.",8
38307,Sheldon,6," Well, admittedly, this brushes up against my well-known aversions to heat, small places, going below floor-level, dampness, hatches, ladders, darkness, echoes, and eliminating in Home Depot buckets. That last one is quite new, but I have a feeling that‰Ûªs gonna rocket to the top of the list.",8
38308,Raj,6, I‰Ûªm sweating already.,8
38309,Sheldon,6," Yeah, as the person beneath you, allow me to say, I know.",8
38310,Raj,6, How hot is it?,8
38311,Sheldon,6," Uh, let‰Ûªs see. 704? No, wait, it‰Ûªs on clock. Uh, the real answer isn‰Ûªt much better. 102 degrees.",8
38312,Raj,6," Well, that‰Ûªs what we wanted. This is as hot as the mines will be.",8
38313,Sheldon,6," True. Sheldon‰Ûªs Mine Simulation Log, entry one. Koothrappali‰Ûªs restating of the obvious is already getting on my nerves.",8
38314,Scene,6, Howard and Bernadette‰Ûªs apartment.,8
38315,Leonard,6, Thanks again for having us.,8
38316,Howard,6," Oh, of course. What did you guys want to talk about?",8
38317,Penny,6," Well, you know, now that we‰Ûªre engaged, we had some questions about how you handle money as a couple.",8
38318,Bernadette,6, I told you they weren‰Ûªt gonna ask us to swing with them.,8
38319,Howard,6, I didn‰Ûªt think they were going to. I just wanted to have a way to say no without hurting Leonard‰Ûªs feelings.,8
38320,Leonard,6," Well, nailed it.",8
38321,Howard,6, So what did you want to know?,8
38322,Penny,6," Well, do you guys ever fight over money?",8
38323,Bernadette,6," Sure, sometimes. I mean, it can be a little awkward since I make so much more money than Howie.",8
38324,Howard,6, You didn‰Ûªt have to say so much more.,8
38325,Bernadette,6," Well, I didn‰Ûªt have to, but for the sake of accuracy I felt that I should.",8
38326,Howard,6," I brought a lot of significant assets into the relationship, too.",8
38327,Bernadette,6, Like what? Your incomplete set of Star Trek collector plates?,8
38328,Howard,6," For your information, I just bought the last one I needed on eBay.",8
38329,Bernadette,6, Without asking me?,8
38330,Howard,6, There were only three minutes left in the auction and it was a mint condition Scotty from a smoke-free home.,8
38331,Bernadette,6," How much, Howie?",8
38332,Howard,6, Not a lot.,8
38333,Bernadette,6, How much?,8
38334,Howard,6, Let‰Ûªs not talk about this in front of our friends.,8
38335,Bernadette,6, Was it more or less than falconry school?,8
38336,Howard,6," For the tenth time, that was a Groupon.",8
38337,Leonard,6, Like I would swing with him.,8
38338,Scene,6, The steam tunnel. ,8
38339,Raj,6, How you feeling?,8
38340,Sheldon,6, Good. Little claustrophobic.,8
38341,Raj,6, Let‰Ûªs set up the equipment. It‰Ûªll help take your mind off of it.,8
38342,Sheldon,6, Miners often sang mining songs to keep their spirits up.,8
38343,Raj,6, Do you know any mining songs?,8
38344,Sheldon,6," Just the hits. (Singing) Where it‰Ûªs dark as a dungeon, and it‰Ûªs damp as the dew.",8
38345,Rajj,6, That‰Ûªs pretty.,8
38346,Sheldon,6," Where the dangers are double, and the pleasures are few. Where the rain never falls and the sun never shines, yes, it‰Ûªs dark as a dungeon way down in the mine.",8
38347,Raj,6, It‰Ûªs a little more bleak than I thought.,8
38348,Sheldon,6," Well, I pray when I‰Ûªm dead and the ages shall roll, that my body will blacken and turn into coal.",8
38349,Raj,6, Getting kind of grim.,8
38350,Sheldon,6," Then I‰Ûªll look from the door of my heavenly home, and pity the miner that mines my poor bones.",8
38351,Raj,6, Okay. How ‰Ûªbout a little Miley Cyrus next?,8
38352,Sheldon,6, Who‰Ûªs he?,8
38353,Scene,6, Howard and Bernadette‰Ûªs apartment.,8
38354,Howard,6, Talk about wasted money. What about the late fees on our credit card because somebody didn‰Ûªt pay the bill on time?,8
38355,Bernadette,6," Well, maybe I would have paid it if I wasn‰Ûªt also doing everything else around here.",8
38356,Howard,6," Oh, you‰Ûªre saying I don‰Ûªt do anything around here. Look at my chore chart.",8
38357,Leonard,6, She made him a chore chart.,8
38358,Penny,6, I see it.,8
38359,Howard,6, Do the dishes. There‰Ûªs a star right there.,8
38360,Bernadette,6, That was a pity star. Putting water in the roasting pan and leaving it in the sink is not doing the dishes.,8
38361,Howard,6, That pan had to soak and you know it.,8
38362,Bernadette,6," Well, don‰Ûªt come crying to me when you don‰Ûªt get your allowance.",8
38363,Howard,6," It‰Ûªs not an allowance. It‰Ûªs a stipend, and we said we weren‰Ûªt gonna call it an allowance in front of my friends.",8
38364,Leonard,6," I usually don‰Ûªt like lemon bars, but these, these are really good.",8
38365,Scene,6, The steam tunnel. ,8
38366,Raj,6," So, as Hannah Montana, Miley was a world-famous pop star. But then she would take off her wig and go to school like a normal girl. Which, I don‰Ûªt have to tell you, at that age, is its own headache.",8
38367,Sheldon,6, That‰Ûªs preposterous. How would she go unrecognized just by wearing a wig?,8
38368,Raj,6, But you‰Ûªre okay with Superman concealing his identity with a pair of glasses?,8
38369,Sheldon,6, He doesn‰Ûªt just put on a pair of glasses. He combs back his curlicue and affects a mild-mannered personality.,8
38370,Amy (shouting),6, You guys doing okay down there?,8
38371,Sheldon,6, I told you to use the walkie-talkie!,8
38372,Amy (on walkie-talkie),6, You guys doing okay down there?,8
38373,Sheldon,6, Please keep this channel clear for emergencies. Thank you.,8
38374,Amy,6, I‰Ûªm going to the vending machine. Do you want anything?,8
38375,Sheldon,6, This is a simulation. We have to survive on the supplies we brought.,8
38376,Amy,6," Okay, just checking.",8
38377,Raj,6, We should have asked her to get some Funyuns.,8
38378,Sheldon,6, You‰Ûªre not going to have Funyuns when we‰Ûªre a mile below the surface of the Earth.,8
38379,Raj,6, What if we brought them down with us?,8
38380,Sheldon,6, We‰Ûªll take some Funyuns.,8
38381,Amy,6, Anything else?,8
38382,Sheldon,6," Some York Peppermint Patties, a couple of Dr. Peppers, and run to Best Buy and see if they have a portable DVD player and season one of a show called Hannah Montana.",8
38383,Rajj,6," Have her get season two. Season one, it was still finding itself.",8
38384,Scene,6, Howard and Bernadette‰Ûªs apartment. ,8
38385,Bernadette,6, Sorry you guys had to see that.,8
38386,Penny,6," Oh, don‰Ûªt apologize.",8
38387,Leonard,6, Yeah. It just makes it a lot harder to pretend it never happened.,8
38388,Bernadette,6, Money‰Ûªs a sensitive subject for Howie because of the difference in our income.,8
38389,Penny,6, It really bothers him?,8
38390,Bernadette,6," Well, sure. There‰Ûªs still a lot of pressure on guys to be providers. So even though he‰Ûªs happy for me, it‰Ûªs just a little tough on him.",8
38391,Penny,6, Uh-oh.,8
38392,Leonard,6, What?,8
38393,Penny,6," Well, if I do well in sales, I could end up making a lot more money than you.",8
38394,Leonard,6," Not a problem. I grew up with a mother who emasculated my father financially and in every other aspect of his life, so really, it‰Ûªs what I think love looks like.",8
38395,Bernadette,6, I‰Ûªll be right back. I‰Ûªm gonna go check on him.,8
38396,Penny,6, Maybe it‰Ûªs a good thing we came here. It‰Ûªs like a lesson in what not to do.,8
38397,Leonard,6, Yeah I don‰Ûªt want something dumb like money to come between us.,8
38398,Penny,6, It won‰Ûªt. Let‰Ûªs just promise to figure this kind of stuff out before we get married.,8
38399,Howard (off),6, Why are you being so bossy?,8
38400,Bernadette (off),6, Why are you being a baby?,8
38401,Howard (off),6," I‰Ûªm not a baby. I‰Ûªm a grown man, and I made the bed. Now where‰Ûªs my star?",8
38402,Leonard,6, Should we go?,8
38403,Penny,6, Hang on. I want to see if he gets the star.,8
38404,Scene,6, The steam tunnel. ,8
38405,Raj,6," Oh, this heat is brutal.",8
38406,Sheldon,6," As someone from the tropical subcontinent of India, you should know that fanning yourself in a humid environment only raises your body temperature.",8
38407,Rajj,6, Huh. That does explain why the servants used to look so hot while they were fanning me. Let‰Ûªs get our minds off how uncomfortable we are. We could take some more simulated instrument readings.,8
38408,Sheldon,6, My major focus at the moment is keeping my claustrophobia at bay.,8
38409,Raj,6, How‰Ûªs that going?,8
38410,Sheldon,6," You tell me. I feel like I can‰Ûªt breathe, and I am tempted to crack you open and suck the air right out of your lungs.",8
38411,Raj,6," Sheldon, if this is too much, we can stop.",8
38412,Sheldon,6, We‰Ûªre not stopping.,8
38413,Raj,6, You don‰Ûªt have to bite my head off.,8
38414,Sheldon,6," I apologize. I just, I‰Ûªm plagued by an internal struggle.",8
38415,Raj,6," If you would just use the bucket, you‰Ûªd be so much more comfortable.",8
38416,Sheldon,6, My struggle is emotional.,8
38417,Raj,6, Oh. Is it Amy?,8
38418,Sheldon,6," It‰Ûªs dark matter. When I entered the field of string theory, I was a prodigy. I rose to a position of respect, and I assumed my career would continue on that upward trajectory. Now here I am in my 30s, I‰Ûªm back at square one. And, frankly, it‰Ûªs frightening.",8
38419,Raj,6," Sheldon, you know what I think of when I‰Ûªm scared? Voyager.",8
38420,Sheldon,6, Voyager the space probe or Voyager the Star Trek TV show?,8
38421,Raj,6, The space probe.,8
38422,Sheldon,6, Good. Because I am too hot and tired to go on about how much I hate Voyager the TV show.,8
38423,Raj,6," By the time I was born, Voyager 1‰Ûªs mission was supposed to be over. It had seen Jupiter and Saturn and all their moons, but it kept going. When I left India for America, I was never more scared in my life. I had no idea what lay ahead. Whenever I feel that way, I think about how Voyager is still out there somewhere beyond our solar system, going further than anyone ever thought it could. Don‰Ûªt leave. You can do this.",8
38424,Amy,6," Sheldon, is everything okay?",8
38425,Sheldon,6, It‰Ûªs too late for Koothrappali. Let‰Ûªs go.,8
38426,Amy,6, 11 minutes. That‰Ûªs longer than I thought.,8
38427,Raj (off),6, They‰Ûªre in my shirt. They‰Ûªre in my shirt. They‰Ûªre in my shirt.,8
38428,Scene,6, Penny‰Ûªs bedroom.,8
38429,Penny,6," Okay, this is definitely the most fun thing we can do with the money.",8
38430,Leonard,6," I‰Ûªve never done it on a big old pile of cash before. Me neither, Leonard. It‰Ûªs my first time, too.",8
38431,Scene,6, Howard and Bernadette‰Ûªs bedroom.,8
38432,Bernadette,6, I‰Ûªm so sorry I made you feel bad about the money stuff.,8
38433,Howard,6, It‰Ûªs okay.,8
38434,Bernadette,6," No, it‰Ûªs not okay. I want us to be partners, equals. Adults in a mature relationship.",8
38435,Howard,6," I want that, too.",8
38436,Bernadette,6," Now, let‰Ûªs talk about your birthday party.",8
38437,Howard,6," Ooh, laser tag, laser tag.",8
38438,Bernadette,6, Oh.,8
38439,Scene,6, The apartment. ,8
38440,Amy,6, Do you really need me to transcribe this?,8
38441,Sheldon,6," You‰Ûªre not doing it for me. You‰Ûªre doing it for future generations who will benefit from my struggle. (Voice on recorder) Sheldon‰Ûªs Mine Simulation Log, entry four. My Kit Kat has melted. All is lost.",8
38442,Raj,6," You call yourself a friend? I was trying to help you, and at the first sign of trouble you ran away, leaving me to fend off a family of rats. You‰Ûªre a completely selfish human being and a, and a physical and a moral coward.",8
38443,Sheldon,6, His statements of the obvious continue to annoy.,8
38444,Scene,7, Penny‰Ûªs apartment.,8
38445,Bernadette,7," So, what are you working on these days?",8
38446,Amy,7, I‰Ûªm studying one-celled organisms to try and find the neurochemicals that lead to the feeling of shame.,8
38447,Bernadette,7, What would a one-celled organism have to be embarrassed about?,8
38448,Penny,7," Same as all of us, getting out of a car without underwear.",8
38449,Bermadette,7," Speaking of underwear, I have some interesting news.",8
38450,Penny,7," Okay, if it‰Ûªs sometimes Howie wears yours, Leonard already told us.",8
38451,Bernadette,7," He was being funny. I‰Ûªm pretty sure. Anyway, I was asked to be a part of a magazine article about the 50 sexiest female scientists in California. Isn‰Ûªt that cool?",8
38452,Amy,7, I think it‰Ûªs awful.,8
38453,Penny,7, Why would you say that?,8
38454,Amy,7," Bernadette is a successful microbiologist. She should be celebrated for her achievements, not her looks. I mean, what kind of message does that send?",8
38455,Penny,7, I think the message is check out the rack on that scientist.,8
38456,Bernadette,7, Why can‰Ûªt someone be thought of as both smart and pretty?,8
38457,Amy,7, I just don‰Ûªt think a professional woman should have to flaunt her sexuality in order to get ahead.,8
38458,Penny,7," Okay, what‰Ûªs the big deal? Look, if it helps me make a sale with a physician, I don‰Ûªt think it hurts to flirt a little. I mean, laugh at their joke, touch their arm, maybe crank up the AC in the car beforehand, you know, to wake up the girls.",8
38459,Amy,7," Maybe it‰Ûªs different in the world of sales, but it‰Ûªs already hard enough for women to be taken seriously in science.",8
38460,Bernadette,7," I was kind of excited about the article, but now you‰Ûªre making me feel bad.",8
38461,Penny,7," No, I think you should do whatever you want. You know, maybe if fashion magazines had female scientists in them, I would‰Ûªve become a theoretical physicist. Stop smirking at each other.",8
38462,Scene,7, The building foyer. ,8
38463,Man with Flowers,7, Thank you.,8
38464,Sheldon,7," No, thank you. Delivery men are the unsung foot soldiers of our nation‰Ûªs commerce. It‰Ûªs because of people like you, people like me can limit our human contact. I‰Ûªd shake your hand, but, well, you know.",8
38465,Man,7," I‰Ûªm not a delivery man, I‰Ûªm a doctor. Although I do often deliver alarming biopsy results to my patients.",8
38466,Sheldon,7, That‰Ûªs humorous.,8
38467,Man,7, All right.,8
38468,Sheldon,7," Yeah, I bet you leave your patients in stitches. That was also humorous.",8
38469,Man,7, All right.,8
38470,Sheldon,7, Are you bringing flowers to a patient to cushion the blow of a terminal diagnosis? That wasn‰Ûªt a joke.,8
38471,Man,7, All right. These are actually for a nice woman who makes sales calls to my office.,8
38472,Sheldon,7," Hmm. You know, they have delivery people that will do that for you.",8
38473,Man,7, I was hoping to impress her by tracking her down on the Internet and then showing up unannounced at her door.,8
38474,Sheldon,7, Making the extra effort. Good for you.,8
38475,Leonard,7," Great timing, food just got here.",8
38476,Sheldon,7," Ooh, Siam Palace?",8
38477,Leonard,7, Yes.,8
38478,Sheldon,7," Uh, mee krob and chicken satay?",8
38479,Leonard,7, Yes.,8
38480,Sheldon,7," Uh, extra peanut sauce?",8
38481,Leonard,7," No, but you can have mine.",8
38482,Sheldon,7," Eh, well, very well. Oh, and on the topic of sharing things that are yours, there is a gentleman caller bringing flowers to your fiancÌ©e as we speak.",8
38483,Leonard,7, What? Why didn‰Ûªt you say that first?,8
38484,Sheldon,7, Why didn‰Ûªt you get extra peanut sauce? We can both play this game.,8
38485,Leonard,7, Can I help you?,8
38486,Man,7," Oh, hi. Uh, does Penny live here?",8
38487,Leonard,7, May I ask why?,8
38488,Man,7," Well, uh, I met her at my office, she winked at me. And, uh, I came hoping to initiate a romantic relationship.",8
38489,Leonard,7," Okay, um, look, I‰Ûªm pretty sure she didn‰Ûªt wink at you.",8
38490,Man,7," Oh, she did. Seductively, like this. And then she touched my arm for two Mississippis. Like, you know, one Mississippi, two‰Û_",8
38491,Leonard,7," I got it, I got it. Listen, um, I think there‰Ûªs been a misunderstanding. See, Penny is my fiancÌ©e.",8
38492,Man,7, Really? I‰Ûªve never seen her wear an engagement ring.,8
38493,Raj,7, Really?,8
38494,Man,7," So, am I to presume that her flirtation was just a sales technique?",8
38495,Leonard,7, I think so.,8
38496,Man,7, When will I learn? It‰Ûªs just like the cute girl at the pet store all over again.,8
38497,Leonard,7, Excuse me?,8
38498,Man,7," Oh, uh, she touched my arm for five Mississippis, and I bought a two thousand dollar iguana habitat. Which she was always too busy to come over and see. You give these to Penny. You‰Ûªre a, you‰Ûªre a lucky man.",8
38499,Leonard,7, Thank you. Sorry.,8
38500,Man,7," Oh, uh, you probably don‰Ûªt want her to see this. It‰Ûªs unnecessarily graphic.",8
38501,Sheldon,7," Hold on, Doctor. Leonard, where are your social skills? This man is clearly upset. We should invite him in for a hot beverage.",8
38502,Leonard,7, He tried to score with Penny.,8
38503,Sheldon,7," So have these two, and they‰Ûªre having dinner with us.",8
38504,Scene,7, A bar.,8
38505,Amy,7," So, how was work today?",8
38506,Bernadette,7," It was fine, but you‰Ûªll be happy to know they pulled the sexy scientists article.",8
38507,Amy,7, What happened?,8
38508,Bernadette,7, I don‰Ûªt know. They just canceled the photo shoot and said they‰Ûªre rethinking it.,8
38509,Amy,7," Well, I‰Ûªm really sorry, but I think it‰Ûªs for the best. You want people focusing on your achievements, not staring at your breasts in some magazine.",8
38510,Bernadette,7," I guess. It‰Ûªs really not that important. Hey, up here.",8
38511,Amy,7," Sorry, it‰Ûªs just we‰Ûªre, we were talking about them. So, look, I, I wasn‰Ûªt going to say anything, but since you seem to be okay with the article being canceled, I have a little confession. I‰Ûªm the reason it was pulled.",8
38512,Bernadette,7, What? How?,8
38513,Amy,7, I sent the editors of the magazine a pretty scathing e-mail.,8
38514,Bernadette,7," Amy, what did you say?",8
38515,Amy,7," I simply pointed out that they would never consider doing an article ranking male scientists on their sexuality, let alone showing them in various stages of undress.",8
38516,Bernadette,7," Because no one wants to see Neil deGrasse Tyson in a wet T-shirt, bent over the hood of a Porsche.",8
38517,Amy,7," Well, it doesn‰Ûªt make a difference, because they agreed it was in bad taste, and now you agree, so Amy saves the day.",8
38518,Bernadette,7," No, what happened was you got jealous, so you took away a chance for me to get some publicity.",8
38519,Amy,7, But it was bad publicity.,8
38520,Bernadette,7," That‰Ûªs for me to decide, not you.",8
38521,Amy,7," I disagree. As a female scientist, I think what you do affects all of us.",8
38522,Bernadette,7," And I think you don‰Ûªt like people expressing their sexuality because no one wants you to express yours. Oh, Amy, I‰Ûªm so sorry. That was over the line.",8
38523,Amy,7, You have a nice night.,8
38524,Bernadette,7," Please don‰Ûªt go. Up until my vicious attack, you were the one in the wrong.",8
38525,Scene,7, The apartment.,8
38526,Sheldon,7," Here you go, Doctor. Red Zinger with one teaspoon of honey.",8
38527,Man,7, Thank you. Neat Star Trek mug. I actually have one of the phasers from the original TV show.,8
38528,Raj,7," Oh, cool.",8
38529,Howard,7, How‰Ûªd you get that?,8
38530,Man,7," Oh, easy, Gene Roddenberry needed a vasectomy.",8
38531,Sehldon,7, Wait a minute. You‰Ûªve snipped Gene Roddenberry‰Ûªs vas deferens?,8
38532,Man,7, Yes.,8
38533,Howard,7," Wow, he really went where no man has gone before.",8
38534,Man,7," I don‰Ûªt like to brag,but, uh, you see, I‰Ûªm kind of the doctor to the stars‰Ûª urinary tracts.",8
38535,All,7, Wow.,8
38536,Man,7," Uh, you, you want to see James Cameron‰Ûªs kidney stone?",8
38537,All,7, Ooh.,8
38538,Man,7," He was so happy after he passed it, he gave me a Terminator.",8
38539,Leonard,7, That is amazing. How long have you been collecting?,8
38540,Man,7," Ever since I was a kid, but, uh, I didn‰Ûªt really get serious until William Shatner‰Ûªs bladder infection.",8
38541,Sheldon,7, What‰Ûªd you get? What‰Ûªd you get?,8
38542,Man,7," Well, he said it was a tribble. It could be a toupee, but either way, it‰Ûªs pretty cool.",8
38543,Raj,7, I would love to see your collection.,8
38544,Man,7," Anytime. Uh, I‰Ûªve got some cool stuff. When I first started, I thought it would be a good way to meet women, but, well, you know.",8
38545,Howard,7, We know.,8
38546,Raj,7, Preach.,8
38547,Man,7, Can I ask you a personal question?,8
38548,Leonard,7, Sure.,8
38549,Man,7," Um, I mean, you‰Ûªre a guy like me, so how‰Ûªd you get a girl like Penny?",8
38550,Leonard,7," Oh. Well, you know, just being myself, really.",8
38551,Sheldon,7," Oh, please, you know, I‰Ûªll tell you how he did it. Implacable, relentless badgering. In urology terms, he was a drug-resistant staph infection. And she was a urethra that could not shake him.",8
38552,Leonard,7, I don‰Ûªt know that I‰Ûªd call myself an infection.,8
38553,Howard,7, A gallant man would defend his fiancÌ©e for being called a urethra.,8
38554,Leonard,7, Can we please change the subject?,8
38555,Penny,7, Hi.,8
38556,Raj,7," Well, that didn‰Ûªt go your way.",8
38557,Penny,7," Dr. Lorvis, what are you doing here?",8
38558,Dr Lorvis,7," Uh, well, actually I came to see you.",8
38559,Penny,7, Really? Why?,8
38560,Leonard,7," Ah, that‰Ûªs a good question. Apparently someone was being awfully flirty while not wearing their engagement ring, causing another someone to show up here thinking the first someone might be available.",8
38561,Sheldon,7," Oh, God. Don‰Ûªt make it so hard on her. Look, the first someone is the deceitful you. The second someone is the delightful Dr. Lorvis.",8
38562,Penny,7," Oh, this is very embarrassing. Dr. Lorvis, I am so sorry. I did not mean to lead you on.",8
38563,Dr Lorvis,7, You touched my arm for two Mississippis.,8
38564,Penny,7, Oh. That‰Ûªs why you were mumbling Mississippi.,8
38565,Leonard,7, Can we talk in private?,8
38566,Penny,7," Please, yes.",8
38567,Leonard,7, I‰Ûªll be right back.,8
38568,Sheldon,7, So what other celebrity genitalia have you handled?,8
38569,Leonard,7," So, uh, what‰Ûªs the deal? You take off your ring when you go to work?",8
38570,Penny,7," What? No, no, I just put it on the other hand and turn it around. Keep that hand in my pocket.",8
38571,Leonard,7, Why?,8
38572,Penny,7," Well, what do you mean why? Look, I make more sales if these doctors think I‰Ûªm single. I did the same kind of thing as a waitress. The real question is, what is he doing in your apartment?",8
38573,Leonard,7," Oh, he was upset. So Sheldon invited him in for a hot beverage.",8
38574,Penny,7, You were okay with that?,8
38575,Leonard,7," No. I got upset. And Sheldon made me a beverage, too.",8
38576,Penny,7," Okay, he just showed up at my door. Don‰Ûªt you think that‰Ûªs a little weird?",8
38577,Leonard,7," A little, but he‰Ûªs basically harmless. He‰Ûªs actually kind of a nice guy.",8
38578,Penny,7," Okay. Whatever, look, my company does not allow me to socialize with doctors outside of work. You got to get rid of him.",8
38579,Leonard,7, Why am I the one that has to get rid of him?,8
38580,Penny,7," I can‰Ûªt do it, he‰Ûªs my best client.",8
38581,Leonard,7," All right, I‰Ûªll get rid of him. But you owe me one.",8
38582,Raj,7," Hey, we‰Ûªre going to Oliver‰Ûªs house to see his collection. You want to go with us?",8
38583,Leonard,7," Yeah, sure. You owe me.",8
38584,Scene,7, Dr Lorvis‰Ûª basement.,8
38585,Leonard,7," Oh, my God.",8
38586,Sheldon,7," Leonard, I was wrong. Heaven does exist. And it‰Ûªs in the basement of a urologist‰Ûªs house in Sherman Oaks.",8
38587,Dr Lorvis,7, Welcome to my Fortress of Solitude. This is where I go to get away from all my other solitude.,8
38588,Howard,7," Oh, come on. It‰Ûªs a replica.",8
38589,Dr Lorvis,7, Original.,8
38590,Howard,7," Oh, I think I just cheated on my wife.",8
38591,Raj,7, The gun from Hellboy?,8
38592,Dr Lorvis,7, Yup.,8
38593,Raj,7, How did you get it?,8
38594,Dr Lorvis,7, Bought it at auction.,8
38595,Raj,7," Oh, I was hoping for a juicy tidbit about Ron Perlman‰Ûªs testicles.",8
38596,Woman‰Ûªs voice (off),7," Oliver, I‰Ûªm going to play bingo.",8
38597,Dr Lorvis,7," Okay, Mother. Have fun.",8
38598,Howard,7," Still lives with his ma. Yikes, right?",8
38599,Raj,7," Yeah, I‰Ûªm not quite sure how to respond.",8
38600,Leonard,7," Wow, Donkey Kong. This, this was my game when I was a kid.",8
38601,Sheldon,7," Because it‰Ûªs a story of a pretty blonde girl tirelessly pursued by a small, oddly-shaped man?",8
38602,Leonard,7," No, because I liked it.",8
38603,Sheldon,7," Well, now, don‰Ûªt get defensive. You‰Ûªre oddly-shaped, but you got the girl.",8
38604,Dr Lorvis,7," So, I‰Ûªve noticed Leonard gets teased a lot 0about his relationship with Penny.",8
38605,Sheldon,7," Yes. If you‰Ûªd like to join in, the premise is their love seems unlikely and doomed to failure.",8
38606,Dr Lorvis,7," So, you think she‰Ûªll be single soon?",8
38607,Sheldon,7," Oh, if you want to get in on the pool, you‰Ûªre too late. All the squares have been purchased.",8
38608,Dr Lorvis,7," Interesting. Excuse me, I have to take care of something.",8
38609,Sheldon,7," Leonard, as your friend I feel I should tell you something.",8
38610,Leonard,7, What?,8
38611,Sheldon,7, I‰Ûªm still upset about that peanut sauce.,8
38612,Scene,7, The lobby.,8
38613,Dr Lorvis,7," Oh, could you hold the door?",8
38614,Amy,7, Nice flowers.,8
38615,Dr Lorvis,7," Thank you. They‰Ûªre for a girl. Uh, I‰Ûªm being implacable and relentless.",8
38616,Amy,7, Isn‰Ûªt she lucky?,8
38617,Dr Lorvis,7, She keeps sending me mixed signals. But I think we both want the same thing.,8
38618,Amy,7, What‰Ûªs that?,8
38619,Dr Lorvis,7, Unconditional love.,8
38620,Amy,7, I guess that‰Ûªs all anybody wants.,8
38621,Dr Lorvis,7, I guess so.,8
38622,Amy,7," Well, I hope you get it.",8
38623,Dr Lorvis,7," One Mississippi, two Mississippi.",8
38624,Scene,7, Dr Lorvis‰Ûª basement.,8
38625,Leonard,7," Next game, let‰Ûªs switch helmets.",8
38626,Sheldon,7," No, I‰Ûªd look silly in that helmet.",8
38627,Scene,7, The stairwell. ,8
38628,Amy,7, I can‰Ûªt take these.,8
38629,Dr Lorvis,7," Why not? I mean, you want what I want. And we had two wonderful Mississippis.",8
38630,Amy,7, But what about the other girl?,8
38631,Dr Lorvis,7," Oh, right. I‰Ûªll tell her we should just be friends.",8
38632,Penny,7, Dr. Lorvis?,8
38633,Dr Lorvis,7," Penny, we should just be friends. Happy?",8
38634,Scene,7, Dr Lorvis‰Ûª basement.,8
38635,Raj,7, You think he bites?,8
38636,Howard,7, Stick your head in there and find out.,8
38637,Raj,7, You fooled me with that goat at the petting zoo. You will not fool me again.,8
38638,Leonard,7, I wonder where Dr. Lorvis is. He‰Ûªs been gone a while.,8
38639,Raj,7, Maybe he‰Ûªs playing bingo with his mommy.,8
38640,Howard,7, It‰Ûªs sad how some guys can‰Ûªt cut the apron strings.,8
38641,Raj,7," Okay, now you‰Ûªre messing with me.",8
38642,Leonard,7," Uh, guys, we‰Ûªre locked in here.",8
38643,Sheldon,7," Oh, this day just keeps getting better.",8
38644,Scene,7, Penny‰Ûªs apartment.,8
38645,Penny,7," So, you just left them alone playing games in your house?",8
38646,Dr Lorvis,7," Well, they seemed happy and I thought that would give me time for you and I to get to know each other better. That was before we met.",8
38647,Amy,7, We all have a past.,8
38648,Penny,7," Doc, you‰Ûªve got to see what you‰Ûªre doing is, is a little creepy.",8
38649,Dr Lorvis,7, You sound just like Sigourney Weaver when I followed her into a restroom.,8
38650,Penny,7," Okay, you can‰Ûªt just go chasing after every girl who‰Ûªs nice to you.",8
38651,Dr Lorvis,7," Well, that‰Ûªs not what Sheldon says. And he seems to know his way around the ladies.",8
38652,Penny (on phone),7," Hey, Leonard. Guess who‰Ûªs back. Dr. Lorvis. Yeah. You care to join us? What? You locked them in your basement?",8
38653,Dr Lorvis,7," Well, they‰Ûªre, they‰Ûªre not locked in. The door just sticks.",8
38654,Penny,7," Okay, so how do they unstick it?",8
38655,Dr Lorvis,7, They‰Ûªd need the key.,8
38656,Penny,7," Okay. Nope. That‰Ûªs it. We are gonna go over there right now, and you are going to let them out.",8
38657,Dr Lorvis,7," Three Mississippi, four Mississippi.",8
38658,Penny,7, Move it.,8
38659,Scene,7, The foyer. ,8
38660,Bernadette,7," Oh, good, you‰Ûªre here. Amy, I am so sorry.",8
38661,Amy,7, That has to wait. This weirdo locked the guys up in his basement.,8
38662,Bernadette,7, What?,8
38663,Dr Lorvis,7, She seems nice. Who‰Ûªs she?,8
38664,Penny,7, Just walk.,8
38665,Scene,7, Dr Lorvis‰Ûª basement. ,8
38666,Sheldon,7, You can do this.,8
38667,Raj,7, One ladder left.,8
38668,Leonard,7, Oh-hom yeah.,8
38669,Howard,7, Yes.,8
38670,Leonard,7, Next level.,8
38671,Penny,7," Leonard, are you okay?",8
38672,Leonard,7, Better than okay. I am having the game of my life.,8
38673,Amy,7," Dr. Lorvis, isn‰Ûªt there something you want to say?",8
38674,Dr Lorvis,7, Yes. I‰Ûªm very sorry for locking you in my home.,8
38675,Howard,7," Yeah, that was very uncool. Get the hammer. Get the hammer.",8
38676,Leonard,7, Got it.,8
38677,Penny,7," Okay, Leonard, let‰Ûªs go.",8
38678,Leonard,7, Just hang on.,8
38679,Dr Lorvis,7," Well, while we wait, would you like to see Tobey Maguire‰Ûªs prostate sonogram?",8
38680,Amy,7, Sure.,8
38681,Penny,7, Yeah.,8
38682,Dr Lorvis,7," Oh, spoiler alert. He was worried about nothing.",8
38683,Scene,8, The cafeteria.,8
38684,Leonard,8," Oh, hey, oh, we ran into your mom at Benihana last night.",8
38685,Howard,8," Oh, yeah, she loves that place. Every time they flip a shrimp in the air, she practically leaps out of her seat to catch it. That‰Ûªs why I don‰Ûªt take her to SeaWorld.",8
38686,Leonard,8," I know you-you don‰Ûªt want to hear it, but she was there with Stuart.",8
38687,Howard,8, That‰Ûªs fine. I don‰Ûªt care.,8
38688,Rajj,8, It doesn‰Ûªt bug you when they go out on dates?,8
38689,Howard,8, They‰Ûªre not dating. They‰Ûªre just two friends who went out to dinner.,8
38690,Raj,8, And then went back to the home they share where they probably fell asleep in the matching pajamas she got them because they both just love penguins.,8
38691,Howard,8," Hey, lots of people wear matching pajamas who aren‰Ûªt dating.",8
38692,Raj,8, Like who?,8
38693,Howard,8, Like you and your dog.,8
38694,Leonard,8, Don‰Ûªt rule out the dating.,8
38695,Howard,8," Fine, it bothers me. You happy?",8
38696,Sheldon,8, You think you‰Ûªve got problems. The gibbon is the only member of the ape family not classified as a great ape.,8
38697,Howard,8, How is this helpful?,8
38698,Sheldon,8, All the non-human apes are classified as great apes except one. That means taxonomists created the entire category of lesser ape just to single out the poor gibbon as the weird kid on the playground. Now there‰Ûªs a hairy little fellow with a genuine beef.,8
38699,Leonard,8, But the gibbon doesn‰Ûªt know what it‰Ûªs categorized as. It doesn‰Ûªt even know it‰Ûªs called a gibbon.,8
38700,Sheldon,8," True. Sorry, kid, you‰Ûªve got it worse than a gibbon.",8
38701,Scene,8, Penny‰Ûªs Apartment. ,8
38702,Amy,8, Hi.,8
38703,Penny,8, Hey.,8
38704,Bernadette,8, We brought snacks for movie night.,8
38705,Penny,8," Oh, great. I don‰Ûªt suppose you also brought napkins, clean bowls, utensils and a roll of toilet paper.",8
38706,Bernadette,8, Right here.,8
38707,Penny,8," Ah, You guys are the best.",8
38708,Amy,8, What‰Ûªs with the clothes?,8
38709,Penny,8," Well, with all the new stuff I bought for work, I needed to make room in my closet.",8
38710,Amy,8," I meant why are they folded? But whatever. Ooh, what‰Ûªs this?",8
38711,Penny,8," That, believe it or not, is my prom dress.",8
38712,Bernadette,8," Wow, you still have it? I just assumed it was balled up in the corner of a barn somewhere.",8
38713,Penny,8, What kind of teenager did you think I was?,8
38714,Bernadette,8, Slutty.,8
38715,Amy,8, Easy.,8
38716,Penny,8, The word is popular.,8
38717,Bernadette,8, How was your prom? Did you go?,8
38718,Amy,8," No, but I was on clean-up crew.",8
38719,Penny,8," Aw, that‰Ûªs sad.",8
38720,Amy,8," No, it was okay. The DJ let me dance one slow song with my mop before he shut down. Whenever I see a bucket of dirty water, I still hear Lady in Red.",8
38721,Bernadette,8," My prom was pretty terrible, too. I was so excited about my date, but it turned out he only asked me ‰Ûªcause he liked my friend. He spent the whole night talking about her.",8
38722,Amy,8," Okay, we get it, you had a friend and a date. Stop bragging.",8
38723,Penny,8, Doesn‰Ûªt matter. Prom is silly anyways.,8
38724,Bernadette,8, Easy for you to say; you probably went with the captain of the football team.,8
38725,Penny,8, No. I just made out with him a little while his date was puking.,8
38726,Amy,8, My date would‰Ûªve had to clean that up.,8
38727,Bernadette,8," Ooh, I have an idea. Maybe we can have, like, a prom do-over.",8
38728,Amy,8," Oh, that would be so much fun. We could decorate the roof and make the guys wear tuxedos.",8
38729,Bernadette,8," Ooh, and get our hair done, and slow-dance.",8
38730,Penny,8," Okay, guys, trust me, as someone who‰Ûªs been to, like, seven proms, it is never as good as you want it to be.",8
38731,Amy,8, You went to seven proms?,8
38732,Penny,8," Yeah, let‰Ûªs see. Uh, four Under the Seas, two Enchanted Evenings, and one Night to Remember that I cannot remember for the life of me.",8
38733,Scene,8, The apartment.,8
38734,Howard,8, Hey.,8
38735,Raj,8, Hey.,8
38736,Leonard,8," Hey, where‰Ûªs Bernadette?",8
38737,Howard,8, She and Amy are out dress shopping for their prom thing.,8
38738,Raj,8," Oh, yeah, I got that Evite. Ever since I saw Pretty in Pink, I‰Ûªve wanted to go to an American prom. But then I saw Carrie, and I did not want to go to an American prom. But then I saw Never Been Kissed, and I‰Ûªm back on the prom bandwagon. This prom thing‰Ûªs been a real roller coaster.",8
38739,Howard,8," Bernie‰Ûªs really excited. I could tell because her voice got so high, the beagle next door started howling.",8
38740,Raj,8, Did you go to your prom?,8
38741,Sheldon,8," No. I had a date with a proper education. Instead of a tuxedo, I dressed myself in good habits. Instead of spiked punch, I enjoyed the intoxicating flavour of knowledge. Instead of dancing in a gym, I shook my bootyto the seductive rhythms‰Û_",8
38742,Penny,8," Okay, okay.",8
38743,Shldon,8, ‰Û_of AP Calculus.,8
38744,Raj,8, How come you‰Ûªre not shopping with Amy and Bernadette?,8
38745,Leonard,8," Let me guess, you think the whole idea is lame?",8
38746,Penny,8," Well, who cares what I think? What do you think?",8
38747,Leonard,8," Hmm, to be honest, it‰Ûªs kind of a dream come true to go to even a fake prom with a woman as beautiful as you.",8
38748,Penny,8," Ugh, thanks a lot.",8
38749,Leonard,8, What?,8
38750,Penny,8," Well, now I can‰Ûªt blow this thing off without being a bitch.",8
38751,Raj,8, That sounds like a yes.,8
38752,Scene,8, Howard and Bernadette‰Ûªs apartment.,8
38753,Bernadette,8," Ooh, every single person RSVP‰Ûªd yes. This is so exciting. Isn‰Ûªt this exciting?",8
38754,Howard,8, Yep.,8
38755,Bernadette,8," Look, even Stuart‰Ûªs bringing a date. I wonder who it is.",8
38756,Howard,8, You know exactly who it is. He‰Ûªs gonna bring my mom. Why did you even invite him?,8
38757,Bernadette,8," Because he‰Ûªs our friend, and you two need to get along. And why can‰Ûªt he take your mom? You took her to your prom.",8
38758,Howard,8," I didn‰Ûªt take her, she was a chaperone.",8
38759,Bernadette,8, I saw a picture of you two dancing together.,8
38760,Howard,8, What was I gonna do? They were playing our song. I can‰Ûªt take this anymore.,8
38761,Stuart (on phone),8, Hello.,8
38762,Howard,8," Stuart, we have to talk. This thing with you and my mom, I hate it. It‰Ûªs making me crazy. You and I were friends for years, and now you‰Ûªre bringing my mother to a party I‰Ûªm going to? What the hell?",8
38763,Stuart,8," I‰Ûªm not bringing your mother, I have a date.",8
38764,Howard,8," Oh, so now you‰Ûªre cheating on my mother?",8
38765,Stuart,8," Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. What are you talking about? There‰Ûªs nothing weird going on with me and your mother.",8
38766,Mrs Wolowitz (off),8," Stewie, your bath is getting cold!",8
38767,Stuart,8," I got to go, bye.",8
38768,Scene,8, Penny‰Ûªs apartment.,8
38769,Sheldon,8," (Knock, knock, knock) Penny? (Knock, knock, knock) Penny? (Knock, knock, knock) Penny? (Knock, knock, knock) Penny? (Knock, knock, knock) Penny?",8
38770,Penny,8, You knocked more than usual.,8
38771,Sheldon,8," Next time I might be in a rush, it‰Ûªs good to have a few in the bank.",8
38772,Penny,8," Okay, what‰Ûªs up?",8
38773,Sheldon,8," I‰Ûªd like to discuss this party that Amy and Bernadette are throwing. Since you and I are both reluctant to go, I think I‰Ûªve come up with a perfect way for us to enjoy it.",8
38774,Penny,8," Great, how?",8
38775,Sheldon,8," We pretend we‰Ûªre aliens. I‰Ûªm not the best at reading facial cues, but I‰Ûªm gonna say that you love it and want to hear more. Now, in the beloved novel Hitchhiker‰Ûªs Guide to the Galaxy, an alien named Ford Prefect pretended to be human in order to blend in so that he could write an entry about Earth for The Hitchhiker‰Ûªs Guide to the Galaxy, which is a travel book within the actual book, which is also called The Hitchhiker‰Ûªs Guide to the Galaxy.",8
38776,Penny,8," Okay, just one question. What?",8
38777,Sheldon,8," My point is, pretending to be an alien is a valuable coping mechanism I‰Ûªve used many times. I did it the first time I went to see you in a play. You had no idea Commander Umfrumf of Ceti Alpha Three was in the audience. Oh, don‰Ûªt worry, he gave you seven thumbs up.",8
38778,Penny,8," Here‰Ûªs a question, as an alien pretending to be human, are you planning to engage in any post-prom mating rituals with Amy?",8
38779,Sheldon,8, There are post-prom mating rituals?,8
38780,Penny,8," Not always. Unless your date drives a van with an air mattress, then always.",8
38781,Sheldon,8," Well, if it‰Ûªs part of the prom experience, then I‰Ûªm open to it.",8
38782,Penny,8, You‰Ûªre kidding.,8
38783,Sheldon,8," I may be an alien, but I have urges. If Amy wants to copulate by firing her eggs into space, well, then, I will happily catch them with the reproductive sac on my upper flermin. I‰Ûªm not the best at reading facial cues, but I can see that you‰Ûªre a little turned on.",8
38784,Scene,8, The apartment. ,8
38785,Leonard,8," You know, if you‰Ûªre not gonna learn how to do this, they make some pretty good clip-ons.",8
38786,Sheldon,8, Bruce Wayne doesn‰Ûªt wear a clip-on.,8
38787,Leonard,8, Bruce Wayne doesn‰Ûªt make his roommate tie it for him.,8
38788,Sheldon,8," His name is Alfred, and, yes, he does.",8
38789,Leonard,8," There, perfect.",8
38790,Sheldon,8," What, are you sure? It‰Ûªs my first prom, I want to do it correctly.",8
38791,Leonard,8, I thought you were gonna pretend to be an alien.,8
38792,Sheldon,8," I was, but Penny didn‰Ûªt want to. You didn‰Ûªt want to. Bernadette, Amy, Koothrappali and Wolowitz didn‰Ûªt want to. And even I knew it was weird to hire somebody.",8
38793,Leonard,8, Was that a flask?,8
38794,Sheldon,8," Yes. I‰Ûªve decided to embrace all of the traditions associated with prom, including spiking the punch.",8
38795,Leonard,8, You‰Ûªre gonna put alcohol in the punch?,8
38796,Sheldon,8," Oh, no, this is pomegranate juice. It‰Ûªs all the fun of high school high jinks with the cell-protecting zip of antioxidants.",8
38797,Leonard,8," If you had ripped jeans and a leather jacket, you‰Ûªd be like the toughest kid on the Disney Channel. So, anything else planned for tonight?",8
38798,Sheldon,8," Oh, everything. Getting our picture taken, slow-dancing, being elected prom king. Pointing out that kings aren‰Ûªt elected. It‰Ûªs gonna be off the hook.",8
38799,Leonard,8," And while you‰Ûªre at it, I know that at this age your hormones are raging, but just because all your friends are having sex doesn‰Ûªt mean you have to.",8
38800,Sheldon,8, Why would you say that?,8
38801,Leonard,8," You know, ‰Ûªcause, ‰Ûªcause a lot of people lose their virginity on prom night.",8
38802,Sheldon,8, Penny implied the same thing. Is this true?,8
38803,Leonard,8," Just relax, it‰Ûªs a joke. You don‰Ûªt have hormones.",8
38804,Scene,8, Penny‰Ûªs apartment. ,8
38805,Leonard,8," Wow, you look amazing.",8
38806,Penny,8," Thank you, so do you.",8
38807,Amy,8," Sheldon, you look so handsome.",8
38808,Sheldon,8, Thank you.,8
38809,Penny,8," Sheldon, doesn‰Ûªt Amy look hot? That‰Ûªs got to put some starch in the upper flermin.",8
38810,Amy,8, What‰Ûªs that?,8
38811,Leonard,8," Oh, it‰Ûªs a scaly genital organ that grows between his shoulder blades. Try not to touch it when you‰Ûªre dancing.",8
38812,Sheldon,8, Excuse me.,8
38813,Amy,8, Where are you going?,8
38814,Sheldon,8," I can‰Ûªt do this. And for your information, Leonard, the upper flermin doesn‰Ûªt grow between my shoulder blades, it grows out of the belly button on my neck.",8
38815,Leonard,8," He‰Ûªs right, I was thinking of the lower flermin.",8
38816,Scene,8, A limo.,8
38817,Raj,8," Ooh, I‰Ûªll, uh, text Stuart, let him know we‰Ûªre close.",8
38818,Bernadette,8, That‰Ûªs a neat tattoo.,8
38819,Emily,8," Oh, thanks, it‰Ûªs Sally from Nightmare before Christmas.",8
38820,Bernadette,8," Aw, that movie‰Ûªs so cute.",8
38821,Howard,8, Do you like her because you both have red hair?,8
38822,Emily,8," Uh, a little, but more that she‰Ûªs covered in scars and can pull her own limbs off and sew them back on.",8
38823,Bernadette,8, I like Cinderella.,8
38824,Emily,8," Did you know, in the original book, the sisters cut off their toes with knives in order to fit in the glass slipper?",8
38825,Bernadette,8, I like Bibbidi-Bobbidi-Boo.,8
38826,Raj,8," Hey, here comes Stuart and his date.",8
38827,Emily,8," Oh, she‰Ûªs cute.",8
38828,Howard,8," Oh, my God.",8
38829,Bernadette,8, What?,8
38830,Howard,8, That‰Ûªs Jeanie.,8
38831,Bernadette,8, That‰Ûªs Jeanie?,8
38832,Emily,8, Who‰Ûªs Jeanie?,8
38833,Howard,8, Don‰Ûªt say it.,8
38834,Raj,8, That‰Ûªs Howard‰Ûªs cousin that he had sex with.,8
38835,Howard,8," She is my second cousin. We were 15, I just said, don‰Ûªt say it.",8
38836,Emily,8," No, it‰Ûªs okay. He told me that story a long time ago.",8
38837,Howard,8, Raj.,8
38838,Raj,8," It was our first date, there was an awkward silence. What was I supposed to say?",8
38839,Scene,8, The rooftop. ,8
38840,Penny,8," Oh, it‰Ûªs beautiful.",8
38841,Leonard,8," Oh, the girls really did a nice job.",8
38842,Penny,8," Aw, I know I wasn‰Ûªt into this before, but I‰Ûªm so glad I get to take you to your first prom.",8
38843,Leonard,8, What makes you think I didn‰Ûªt go to my prom? I went.,8
38844,Penny,8," Well, who‰Ûªd you go with?",8
38845,Leonard,8, I took a little lady I like to call loneliness.,8
38846,Penny,8, Aw.,8
38847,Leonard,8," Oh, it‰Ûªs all right. We ended up having a threesome with her friend humiliation, so‰Û_",8
38848,Penny,8," Well, if I would have been there and saw you alone, I would‰Ûªve asked you to dance.",8
38849,Leonard,8," No, you wouldn‰Ûªt have.",8
38850,Penny,8," Well, you don‰Ûªt know that.",8
38851,Leonard,8, It was before my growth spurt.,8
38852,Penny,8," What, that already happened?",8
38853,Leonard,8, Very funny.,8
38854,Penny,8," Well, you wouldn‰Ûªt have asked me either.",8
38855,Leonard,8, I would have asked you. In my head. On the way home. While I was having a good cry.,8
38856,Scene,8, Sheldon‰Ûªs bedroom.,8
38857,Amy,8," Sheldon, can I come in?",8
38858,Sheldon,8, I don‰Ûªt think that‰Ûªs a good idea.,8
38859,Amy,8, Why not?,8
38860,Sheldon,8," According to an online message board, I may be having a panic attack. SoccerMom09 had similar symptoms. But to be fair, the twins were a real handful that day.",8
38861,Amy,8, You‰Ûªre making me worry. What‰Ûªs going on?,8
38862,Sheldon,8, What‰Ûªs going on is we‰Ûªre about to go to a prom. And there‰Ûªs a great deal of pressure on young couples like us to engage in what Mr. Bob Eubanks called making whoopee.,8
38863,Amy,8, What pressure? All I said was you look handsome. Can you please open the door?,8
38864,Sheldon,8, It‰Ûªs not just that. Leonard and Penny also made comments about it. And I‰Ûªm not blind. Even I looked twice when I saw my posterior in these tuxedo pants.,8
38865,Sceme,8, The limo.,8
38866,Stuart,8," So, I met Jeanie at your Aunt Gladys‰Ûª. She passed me the Manischewitz, I took one look at this punim, and I almost plotzed on the kugel.",8
38867,Rajj,8, Is this what I sound like when I talk about India?,8
38868,Howard,8," So, my mother‰Ûªs okay with this?",8
38869,Jeannie,8, Why would your mother have a problem with me and Stuart?,8
38870,Howard,8," ‰Û÷Cause they have a weird, inappropriate relationship.",8
38871,Jeannie,8, Weirder than what you and I did in my dad‰Ûªs Corolla?,8
38872,Raj,8, This is so messed up.,8
38873,Emily,8," I know, I‰Ûªm having the best time.",8
38874,Howard,8, Why would you even come to this? Didn‰Ûªt you know I‰Ûªd be here?,8
38875,Jeannie,8," It was a long time ago, Howard.",8
38876,Stuart,8," And you‰Ûªre only second cousins, who cares?",8
38877,Bernadette,8," So, you knew and you brought her anyway?",8
38878,Stuart,8," Oh, so she‰Ûªs good enough for Howard, but not for me?",8
38879,Howard,8, Yeah.,8
38880,Bernadette,8," Yeah, go have weird relationships with your own mother and cousin. This is his turf.",8
38881,Howard,8, Yeah.,8
38882,Scene,8, The rooftop.,8
38883,Penny,8," Well, I might not have asked you to dance then, but I will ask you now.",8
38884,Leonard,8, There‰Ûªs no music.,8
38885,Penny,8, I don‰Ûªt care. We‰Ûªll make our own music.,8
38886,Leonard,8," My God, who‰Ûªs the dork now? Thank you for wearing your flats.",8
38887,Penny,8, Thank you for wearing your heels.,8
38888,Leonard,8, Look at me. Dancing with the prettiest girl at the prom.,8
38889,Penny,8, Want to take a picture of us and send it to your old friends in the chess club?,8
38890,Leonard,8, I sent them a bikini shot of you years ago. This is nice. I kind of wish no one else was coming.,8
38891,Penny,8," I know, me, too. But it will be fun to have a prom without all the drama.",8
38892,Scene,8, The limo.,8
38893,Bernadette,8," Howie, get off of him.",8
38894,Howard,8, Not until he stops humping his way up my family tree.,8
38895,Scene,8, Sheldon‰Ûªs bedrooom.,8
38896,Amy,8," Sheldon, this is silly. I‰Ûªm not missing another prom. I‰Ûªm going upstairs now. Good-bye.",8
38897,Sheldon,8, I really did think you looked pretty.,8
38898,Amy,8, You did?,8
38899,Sheldon,8, Yes. So much so that I started to panic.,8
38900,Amy,8," Well, you can relax. Just because you think I look pretty doesn‰Ûªt mean we have to spend the night together.",8
38901,Sheldon,8, Were you hoping we would because it‰Ûªs prom?,8
38902,Amy,8, I‰Ûªm always hoping. But tonight I just wanted to have a nice time with you. And maybe dance with someone who has arms.,8
38903,Sheldon,8, Thank you for understanding.,8
38904,Amy,8," Of course I understand. Sheldon, there‰Ûªs something else I‰Ûªve been wanting to say, but before I do, I just, I want you to know that you don‰Ûªt have to say it back. I know you‰Ûªre not ready, and I don‰Ûªt want you to say it just because social convention dictates‰Û_",8
38905,Sheldon,8," I love you, too.",8
38906,Amy,8, You said it.,8
38907,Sheldon,8, There‰Ûªs no denying I have feelings for you that can‰Ûªt be explained in any other way. I briefly considered that I had a brain parasite. But that seems even more farfetched. The only conclusion was love. I know what‰Ûªs happening. This is a panic attack. SoccerMom09 says to lie down with your feet elevated.,8
38908,Amy,8, Okay.,8
38909,Sheldon,8," Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Just because I love you doesn‰Ûªt mean girls are allowed in my room.",8
38910,Scene,8, The rooftop.,8
38911,Raj,8," Okay. Here we go, say cheese. Iskip) Say cheese. Iskip) Say cousin. Iskip) Say‰Û_",8
38912,Stuart,8," Oh, sorry. Hang on, sorry. (On phone) Hey, Debbie. I, yeah, yeah, I‰Ûªm here with Jeanie. Okay, but we‰Ûªre just friends. It‰Ûªs, yeah. I got to go.",8
38913,Scene,9, The apartment. ,8
38914,Amy,9, This is an easy one. You love this guy.,8
38915,Sheldon,9, Me.,8
38916,Amy,9," Come on, he‰Ûªs an under-appreciated genius.",8
38917,Sheldon,9, Still think it‰Ûªs me.,8
38918,Amy,9," It‰Ûªs not you. Now think, there‰Ûªs a car named after him.",8
38919,Sheldon,9," Of course there is. The Mini Cooper, ‰Ûªcause it‰Ûªs me.",8
38920,Amy,9," How about this, he‰Ûªs a poor man‰Ûªs Sheldon Cooper.",8
38921,Sheldon,9," Oh, Tesla.",8
38922,Penny,9, Hi.,8
38923,Amy,9, Hello.,8
38924,Sheldon,9," Hey, how did it go?",8
38925,Leonard,9," Oh, not fun. The doctor shoved a camera up into my sinuses.",8
38926,Penny,9," Yeah, I watched. It was like the scary boat tunnel in Willy Wonka.",8
38927,Amy,9, Did they figure out what‰Ûªs wrong?,8
38928,Leonard,9, Yeah. It‰Ûªs a deviated septum. The surgery to correct it is simple. He‰Ûªs gonna do it next week.,8
38929,Sheldon,9, Why would you have surgery?,8
38930,Leonard,9," Because I can‰Ûªt breathe. I snore, I get sinus infections.",8
38931,Penny,9," Yeah, back off, he‰Ûªs all mine.",8
38932,Sheldon,9, But you don‰Ûªt have a life-threatening condition. Why would you take the risk of surgery?,8
38933,Amy,9," Sheldon, it‰Ûªs a routine procedure, I‰Ûªve heard you complain about his snoring.",8
38934,Sheldon,9," Yes, for the first five or six years, but I‰Ûªve gotten used to it. It helps me sleep. He‰Ûªs like my mucus-powered white noise machine.",8
38935,Leonard,9," Sheldon, I‰Ûªm gonna get the surgery, it‰Ûªs no big deal. End of story.",8
38936,Sheldon,9, Very well. I‰Ûªm done talking about it.,8
38937,Leonard,9, Thank you.,8
38938,Sheldon,9, I believe it was your turn in the game.,8
38939,Amy,9, Okay.,8
38940,Sheldon,9," Let‰Ûªs see. Oh, this person is most famous for never having gotten his nose mutilated with elective surgery and never living the rest of his life in the shadows as a hideous, disfigured freak.",8
38941,Leonard,9, I think you could give a better clue.,8
38942,Sheldon,9, I don‰Ûªt. I‰Ûªm not even sure if that‰Ûªs a person or a typo.,8
38943,Scene,9, Leonard‰Ûªs bedroom. ,8
38944,Leonard,9," Okay, why?",8
38945,Sheldon,9, I‰Ûªm listening to you snore. I‰Ûªm wondering how I‰Ûªll ever sleep without it.,8
38946,Leonard,9," If it helps you sleep, then why are you sitting here staring at me like the albino boogeyman?",8
38947,Sheldon,9," Really Leonard. Insults? After I spent two hours in your closet, waiting for you to fall asleep?",8
38948,Leonard,9, What‰Ûªs your problem?,8
38949,Sheldon,9," If the surgery is successful, the snoring is gone. And if you die during surgery, the snoring is gone.",8
38950,Leonard,9," It sounds like either way, I finally get some rest.",8
38951,Sheldon,9," I have to be honest with you Leonard, I‰Ûªm truly worried.",8
38952,Leonard,9," I told you, there‰Ûªs nothing to worry about.",8
38953,Sheldon,9," Well, I‰Ûªve been doing some research and I‰Ûªve learned that one in 700,000 people die from general anaesthesia.",8
38954,Leonard,9," Buddy, wh, do you realize that that also means 699,999 people don‰Ûªt die?",8
38955,Sheldon,9, I suppose that‰Ûªs true. You‰Ûªre such a glass half-full kind of guy. I‰Ûªm going to miss that.,8
38956,Scene,9, Howard and Bernadette‰Ûªs apartment.,8
38957,Raj,9," Oh, so, my, uh, parents‰Ûª 40th anniversary‰Ûªs coming up and I can‰Ûªt think of a thing to get them.",8
38958,Howard,9," Damn, can you imagine being married to someone for 40 years?",8
38959,Bernadette,9, Not anymore.,8
38960,Raj,9," Anyway, any ideas on a gift?",8
38961,Bernadette,9," Well, what are some of the things they like?",8
38962,Raj,9," They used to like going to the Mumbai Symphony, but last year my mom thought they were phoning it in. Then my dad said based on their love life, she should know about phoning it in.",8
38963,Bernadette,9, He said that to her?,8
38964,Raj,9," Well, they weren‰Ûªt speaking at the time, so he had a servant say it to her. Oh, maybe I could make a gift for them. I know how much you guys love the coasters I made for you.",8
38965,Bernadette,9, They‰Ûªre yours in the divorce.,8
38966,Scene,9, The apartment.,8
38967,Leonard,9, Hey. What‰Ûªre you working on?,8
38968,Sheldon,9," Remember when I said if you went through with your surgery, there was a one-in-700,000 chance of dying?",8
38969,Leonard,9, Yeah?,8
38970,Sheldon,9," Well, I‰Ûªve been crunching the numbers, and so far, I‰Ûªve gotten your probability of death all the way to a sphincter-tightening one in 300.",8
38971,Leonard,9, Great timing. My check sphincter light just went on.,8
38972,Sheldon,9," Leonard, what if you have an allergic reaction to the surgeon‰Ûªs latex gloves?",8
38973,Leonard,9, I‰Ûªm not allergic to latex.,8
38974,Sheldon,9," Well, then why don‰Ûªt you wear the rubber gloves I bought for you to do the dishes?",8
38975,Leonard,9, For the same reason I don‰Ûªt wear the apron or the hair net.,8
38976,Sheldon,9, Fine. What about epilepsy?,8
38977,Leonard,9," I don‰Ûªt have epilepsy, either.",8
38978,Sheldon,9," You don‰Ûªt, but the surgeon might, hmm? And your carotid artery is just one shaky scalpel away from becoming the dancing fountain at Disneyland.",8
38979,Leonard,9," Sheldon, do you realize that driving is riskier than surgery?",8
38980,Sheldon,9," I do. I have the drive to the hospital right here. That is if you make it to the car without falling down the stairs. And don‰Ûªt expect me to carry you, I do that enough in life.",8
38981,Leonard,9," Buddy, I, I get that you‰Ûªre worried about me and I, I appreciate that, but I‰Ûªm not going to die.",8
38982,Sheldon,9, You don‰Ûªt know that.,8
38983,Leonard,9," Well, I do know that it won‰Ûªt be from an asteroid strike.",8
38984,Sheldon,9, You know who else said that? Every cocky T. Rex currently swimming around in the gas tank of your car.,8
38985,Leonard,9," If there was an asteroid strike, wouldn‰Ûªt you die, too?",8
38986,Sheldon,9," I don‰Ûªt know, I‰Ûªm smart and scrappy, I think I‰Ûªd find a way.",8
38987,Leonard,9," Tell you what, the surgery‰Ûªs not for a week, I‰Ûªll think about it.",8
38988,Sheldon,9," Thank you. And while you‰Ûªre thinking about it, if you have the surgery in Nicaragua during monsoon season, I can practically guarantee your death.",8
38989,Scene,9, Raj‰Ûªs apartment.,8
38990,Raj (on phone),9," Yes. Okay. I, I understand. Of course, yes. I‰Ûªll call you tomorrow. Bye.",8
38991,Howard,9," So I found this fencing school in Burbank that has a Jedi class. And if you‰Ûªre cool being the only adults there, they said they are.",8
38992,Raj,9," Dude, my parents just split up.",8
38993,Howard,9, What?,8
38994,Raj,9," Uh, that was my dad on the phone. He moved out.",8
38995,Howard,9," Oh, my God, I, I‰Ûªm sorry. I mean, if you‰Ûªre not up to it, we don‰Ûªt have to go out, we can just hang here.",8
38996,Raj,9," No, it‰Ûªs fine. It‰Ûªs not that big a deal. As long as they‰Ûªre happy, I‰Ûªm happy. And when I get to see them for the holidays, I‰Ûªll get to celebrate Diwali twice, one at each house. That‰Ûªs double the Diwali.",8
38997,Howard,9, You sure you‰Ûªre okay?,8
38998,Raj,9, I‰Ûªm okay.,8
38999,Howard,9, You don‰Ûªt look okay.,8
39000,Raj,9, How can I be okay? I come from a broken home.,8
39001,Scene,9, A waiting room.,8
39002,Leonard,9, The doctor said I should be out of surgery by ten.,8
39003,Penny,9, Okay. And Sheldon really believes we‰Ûªre at a public swimming pool?,8
39004,Leonard,9," He was so busy figuring out how many parts per million of urine we‰Ûªd be floating around in, he didn‰Ûªt even question it.",8
39005,Scene,9, Amy‰Ûªs car.,8
39006,Sheldon,9, 18 parts per million. And he‰Ûªs still doing it.,8
39007,Amy,9, Don‰Ûªt worry about that. I‰Ûªm happy to take you to work.,8
39008,Sheldon,9," Well, thank you. And Leonard never lets me have French toast sticks in the car. I can‰Ûªt have syrupy fingers, but he can do the backstroke in a toilet bowl.",8
39009,Amy,9, It‰Ûªs nice they‰Ûªre getting exercise.,8
39010,Sheldon,9," Although now that I think about it, Leonard would never go swimming in public without his swim shirt.",8
39011,Amy,9, I‰Ûªm sure he brought it.,8
39012,Sheldon,9," No, but last year, at Magic Mountain, he got such a bad sunburn, we had to cut him out of it.",8
39013,Amy,9," He probably got a new one. Finish your breakfast. Look, there‰Ûªs an entire section of my dashboard that doesn‰Ûªt have any syrup on it.",8
39014,Sheldon,9, You‰Ûªre acting odd. Why?,8
39015,Amy,9," I‰Ûªm odd all the time, everyone knows that. Just last night I tried to see how many fava beans I could fit in my mouth.",8
39016,Sheldon,9, Tell me the truth.,8
39017,Amy,9, Twenty eight.,8
39018,Sheldon,9, Come on.,8
39019,Amy,9, Fifty six.,8
39020,Sheldon,9, Amy. What‰Ûªs going on?,8
39021,Amy,9," All right. Don‰Ûªt get upset, but, an earlier appointment opened up for Leonard and he‰Ûªs getting the surgery right now.",8
39022,Sheldon,9, I see. Take me to Leonard.,8
39023,Amy,9," Just go to work, he‰Ûªll be fine.",8
39024,Sheldon,9," Amy, he‰Ûªs my best friend, and if you don‰Ûªt take me, I‰Ûªm going there anyway.",8
39025,Amy,9, Fine. It‰Ûªs sweet that you care about him so much.,8
39026,Sheldon,9, I do. And I wouldn‰Ûªt be able to forgive myself if something happened to him and I wasn‰Ûªt at his bedside to say I told you so.,8
39027,Scene,9, The waiting room. ,8
39028,Sheldon,9, Hello.,8
39029,Penny,9, We had a really nice swim.,8
39030,Sheldon,9," Oh, stop it. I assume this medical centre‰Ûªs already treated the burns on your bottom from the recent pants fire.",8
39031,Penny,9," ‰Û÷Cause I‰Ûªm a liar, liar?",8
39032,Sheldon,9, That‰Ûªs for the fire marshal to determine.,8
39033,Penny,9, You had to tell him?,8
39034,Amy,9," He wore me down. And I was distracted, he has on extra baby powder today.",8
39035,Sheldon,9, Is he okay?,8
39036,Penny,9, He‰Ûªs still in surgery.,8
39037,Sheldon,9, Very well.,8
39038,Penny,9, He‰Ûªs gonna be all right. That is sticky.,8
39039,Amy,9," Come on, let‰Ûªs talk about something other than the surgery.",8
39040,Sheldon,9," That‰Ûªs a good idea. Penny, did you and Leonard ever discuss funeral arrangements?",8
39041,Penny,9, I think she meant something a little happier.,8
39042,Sheldon,9," I suppose we could try to make it a celebration, but he died so young.",8
39043,Scene,9, Raj‰Ûªs office.,8
39044,Howard,9," Knock, knock.",8
39045,Bernadette,9, Hi.,8
39046,Raj,9, Hey. What brings you by?,8
39047,Bernadette,9," Oh, muffin much.",8
39048,Howard,9," Told you, not funny.",8
39049,Bernadette,9, He‰Ûªs just not laughing because he‰Ûªs feeling blueberry. Tough crowd.,8
39050,Raj,9, I‰Ûªm sorry. This is very sweet. Thanks.,8
39051,Howard,9," So, how you doing?",8
39052,Raj,9, Better. I guess the news just hit me a lot harder than I expected.,8
39053,Bernadette,9," Well, of course. I would be devastated if my parents split up.",8
39054,Howard,9, Why? Your father barely speaks to your mother.,8
39055,Bernadette,9," Well, at least he stuck around, not like your dad, who just took off.",8
39056,Howard,9," As you can see, we‰Ûªre here to cheer you up.",8
39057,Bernadette,9," Sorry, Raj. Do you have any sense of what happened with your folks?",8
39058,Raj,9," I think, over time, they started to resent each other, and instead of talking about the things that bothered them, they kept it bottled up, and the hate just grew.",8
39059,Bernadette,9," It‰Ûªs a shame they spent all that time unhappy. But sometimes, there‰Ûªs muffin you can do about it. You get it, right?",8
39060,Scene,9, The waiting room.,8
39061,Penny,9," Oh, it‰Ûªs nice you got him that.",8
39062,Sheldon,9," Oh, this isn‰Ûªt for Leonard, no. Amy bought it for me.",8
39063,Amy,9, Stubbed his toe on the revolving door on the way in.,8
39064,Sheldon,9, You know those confounded things make me dizzy.,8
39065,Amy,9, Who told you to keep going around?,8
39066,Sheldon,9, There was a large plant in the lobby. It kept looking like the outside.,8
39067,Penny,9," Okay, listen, when Leonard comes out, he is not gonna feel great, so, please don‰Ûªt give him a hard time.",8
39068,Amy,9," Penny has a good point. This is like the man in the supermarket with the goiter on his neck. Whatever you‰Ûªre thinking, just keep it to yourself.",8
39069,Sheldon,9, It was like a grapefruit.,8
39070,Amy,9, And I‰Ûªm sure he knew that before you held a grapefruit up next to it.,8
39071,Sheldon,9," Well, I‰Ûªm not making any promises. Not only did Leonard take what I feel is an unnecessary risk, he deceived me.",8
39072,Penny,9," Okay, the reason he deceived you is you were being a pain in the ass.",8
39073,Sheldon,9," The reason I was being a pain in the B is because I was worried about him, and no one else was.",8
39074,Penny,9, Really? You won‰Ûªt even say A?,8
39075,Sheldon,9, You bet your sweet B I won‰Ûªt.,8
39076,Penny,9," Obviously, I care about Leonard. I‰Ûªm gonna spend the rest of my life with him.",8
39077,Sheldon,9, And I‰Ûªm not? It‰Ûªs an earthquake. I knew it.,8
39078,Penny,9," Sheldon, it was just a little tremor.",8
39079,Sheldon,9," A little tremor that turns routine sinus surgery into a frontal lobotomy. Oh, I don‰Ûªt care for this at all. Oh, I need to see he‰Ûªs okay.",8
39080,Amy,9," Sheldon, you can‰Ûªt go back there.",8
39081,Sheldon,9, Try and stop me.,8
39082,Amy,9, Are you okay?,8
39083,Sheldon,9, Why didn‰Ûªt you stop me?,8
39084,Scene,9, Howard and Bernadette‰Ûªs apartment. ,8
39085,Bernadette,9, Can I tell you something? This whole thing with Raj‰Ûªs parents just got me a little worried about us.,8
39086,Howard,9, What are you talking about? We‰Ûªre fine. And Raj‰Ûªs parents probably split up because of Raj.,8
39087,Bernadette,9, What?,8
39088,Howard,9," They always say the children aren‰Ûªt to blame, but, come on.",8
39089,Bernadette,9," I‰Ûªm not joking, Howie. You heard what he said about his parents. It was the little things they kept bottled up. I don‰Ûªt want that to happen to us.",8
39090,Howard,9, How can I convince you it won‰Ûªt?,8
39091,Bernadette,9," Well, is there anything about me you‰Ûªre keeping inside?",8
39092,Howard,9, I‰Ûªm not answering that. It‰Ûªs a trap.,8
39093,Bernadette,9, So there are things you don‰Ûªt like.,8
39094,Howard,9, And here I am in the trap. You just keep talking. I‰Ûªm gonna chew my leg off.,8
39095,Bernadette,9," Just tell me one thing that bothers you, and I promise I won‰Ûªt get mad.",8
39096,Howard,9," Okay. The truth is, sometimes, you‰Ûªre too beautiful.",8
39097,Bernadette,9," Oh. Howie, be serious.",8
39098,Howard,9," Okay, okay. I really don‰Ûªt like how your wings poke me when we sleep ‰Ûªcause you‰Ûªre an angel.",8
39099,Bernadette,9," Okay, fine, maybe it was a bad idea.",8
39100,Howard,9," I just don‰Ûªt think the secret to a happy marriage is going out of our way to criticize each other. Although, there are ways to improve our communication. One thing I learned when I was in couples therapy was‰Û_",8
39101,Bernadette,9, Who were you in couples therapy with?,8
39102,Howard,9, Not important.,8
39103,Bernadette,9, Was it your mom?,8
39104,Howard,9, Not important.,8
39105,Bernadette,9, It was your mom.,8
39106,Howard,9," Anyway, the therapist had us tell each other what we loved about one another.",8
39107,Bernadette,9," Oh, that‰Ûªs so sweet. I want to do that.",8
39108,Howard,9, All right.,8
39109,Bernadette,9," Okay, um, I love that you make me laugh.",8
39110,Howard,9, Thank you. And I love that you‰Ûªre strong and independent.,8
39111,Bernadette,9," And yet, I still love when you hold a door for me.",8
39112,Howard,9," I love that I‰Ûªm kind of a slob around here, and you‰Ûªre okay with that.",8
39113,Bernadette,9," Uh-huh. And I love that I work and do all the cleaning, and you‰Ûªre okay with that.",8
39114,Howard,9," See, I am. Isn‰Ûªt this great?",8
39115,Scene,9, The apartment.,8
39116,Penny,9," Come on, smile. This is gonna be my Christmas card.",8
39117,Sheldon,9, You know this is all your fault.,8
39118,Leonard,9, How is it my fault?,8
39119,Sheldon,9, I told you not to get the surgery.,8
39120,Leonard,9," Okay, first of all, the surgery was a success, and secondly, I didn‰Ûªt even want you there.",8
39121,Sheldon,9," Wow. I don‰Ûªt know which hurts worse, my nose or my heart. Well, I‰Ûªm done speaking to you.",8
39122,Amy,9, Don‰Ûªt be like that. You two need to talk this out.,8
39123,Penny,9," Yeah, ‰Ûªcause you sound really funny.",8
39124,Leonard,9," Sheldon, I‰Ûªm sorry I didn‰Ûªt tell you about the surgery, but you were worried about nothing.",8
39125,Sheldon,9," Oh, you‰Ûªre hardly out of the woods, no. You still run the risk of infection, a blood clot, the possibility that an inattentive surgeon let a barn spider lay eggs in your nose. The minute you sneeze web, I‰Ûªm moving out.",8
39126,Leonard,9," I never thought I‰Ûªd say these words, but come on, nose spider.",8
39127,Penny,9," Who are you kidding? You were so panicked Leonard was gonna die, you‰Ûªll never leave him.",8
39128,Amy,9, Sheldon will move out eventually.,8
39129,Penny,9," Yeah, once he figures out how to work a door.",8
39130,Sheldon,9," I was not panicked, and I am not overly attached to Leonard.",8
39131,Leonard,9, You were so worried that you smashed your face trying to check on me. You love me.,8
39132,Sheldon,9," Yeah. Tell me those aren‰Ûªt the words of a man with a spider eating its way through his brain. Amy, you‰Ûªre a neuroscientist. Crack his skull open, spray some Raid in there.",8
39133,Scene,9, Howard and Bernadette‰Ûªs apartment.,8
39134,Bernadette,9," I love that you take pride in your looks, even when I have to pee in the morning, and you‰Ûªre in there spending an hour on your hair.",8
39135,Howard,9, I love that you‰Ûªre too good to pee in the kitchen sink.,8
39136,Bernadette,9," I love that you have the confidence to speak, even without giving it an ounce of thought.",8
39137,Howard,9, And I love how your hair is always on the soap. It‰Ûªs like washing myself with a hamster.,8
39138,Raj,9," Hey, guys. Sorry I am so late. I was on the phone with my mother.",8
39139,Bernadette,9," Oh, how is she?",8
39140,Raj,9," Pretty good. She bought the book Eat, Pray, Love and used it to set my father‰Ûªs Mercedes on fire. So, what‰Ûªs up with you guys?",8
39141,Howard,9, We‰Ûªre just saying all the things we love about each other.,8
39142,Raj,9," Oh, like you and I did at couples therapy.",8
39143,Scene,9, The apartment. ,8
39144,Leonard,9," Oh, what‰Ûªd you get?",8
39145,Sheldon,9," Oh, I ordered it before your surgery. It‰Ûªs the urn I was going to put you in.",8
39146,Penny,9," Okay, that‰Ûªs morbid. Send it back.",8
39147,Sheldon,9," I can‰Ûªt send it back, I had it engraved. Here lie the ashes of Leonard Hofstadter. He thought he was right, but his room mate knew better.‰Û",8
39148,Leonard,9," That‰Ûªs funny. Boy, I‰Ûªm gonna miss these painkillers.",8
39149,Penny,9," Hey, why did you get two? I‰Ûªm with stupid.",8
39150,Sheldon,9," Oh, that one‰Ûªs mine.",8
39151,Scene,10, The apartment.,8
39152,Sheldon,10," Hello. I‰Ûªm Doctor Sheldon Cooper, and welcome to Sheldon Cooper presents Fun with Flags, the final episode flagtacular. I knew it was coming. Still scary. Now, I‰Ûªm sure you‰Ûªre thinking, the final episode? Who will stand between us and flag ignorance?",8
39153,Amy,10, I know I was thinking that. Is this a show on flags or mind reading?,8
39154,Sheldon,10," But the truth is I can no longer balance a full-time career, a popular Internet show, and a girlfriend.",8
39155,Amy,10," And he really does have one, you jerks on the comment board.",8
39156,Sheldon,10," So as they say, all good things must come to an end.",8
39157,Amy,10, After only 232 episodes.,8
39158,Sheldon,10, 233 if we include the one somebody forgot to press record on.,8
39159,Amy,10, You said you weren‰Ûªt gonna bring that up.,8
39160,Sheldon,10," And you said you pressed record. Anyway, please sit back, relax, and join us as we take our final lap, as indicated by the waving of this racing flag. And, of course, white flags can also represent surrender, the Stewards of Gondor, and the Japanese Minamoto clan, but I‰Ûªm sure you remember that from episode sixty-two, White Flags, Who‰Ûªs Wavin‰Ûª ‰Û÷Em and Why?",8
39161,Amy,10, That was a good one.,8
39162,Sheldon,10, It was so good.,8
39163,Scene,10, An office at the university.,8
39164,Raj,10," You know, I thought cleaning out a dead professor‰Ûªs office was gonna just be boring, but then I found his dentures and realized it‰Ûªs also gross.",8
39165,Howard,10, Doesn‰Ûªt Professor Abbott‰Ûªs family want any of this stuff?,8
39166,Leonard,10, I don‰Ûªt think he had a family.,8
39167,Raj,10, That‰Ûªs rough.,8
39168,Leonard,10," I know. You can spend your whole life working, and at the end all that‰Ûªs left are some papers in a box.",8
39169,Howard,10," Makes you think. Oh, well.",8
39170,Leonard,10," Hey. Hey, we‰Ûªre supposed to look through all this stuff before we throw it away in case it‰Ûªs important.",8
39171,Howard,10, I did. It‰Ûªs all outdated or disproved.,8
39172,Raj,10," I don‰Ûªt know. This old pen kind of proves gravity. When I tilt it, her bathing suit falls right off.",8
39173,Howard,10," Oh, my dad used to have a pen like that. I dated it all through sixth grade.",8
39174,Leonard,10, It still feels weird just throwing away his work like this.,8
39175,Howard,10," Don‰Ûªt feel bad. Someday someone will be throwing out your work, too.",8
39176,Leonard,10," That someone was Sheldon, and the day was yesterday. Hey, look at this. Dear Roger, to be opened upon your first great discovery. Love, Mom. Wow, look at the date. He saved this fifty years and never got to open it.",8
39177,Howard,10, That‰Ûªs intense.,8
39178,Raj,10, Poor Roger Abbott.,8
39179,Howard,10, Roger Abbott sounds just like Roger Rabbit.,8
39180,Raj,10," Roger Abbott, Roger Abbott, Roger Abbott. Oh, my God, Leonard, I know he‰Ûªs dead, but try it. It‰Ûªs fun. Roger Abbott, Roger Abbott.",8
39181,Scene,10, A hotel conference room.,8
39182,Dan,10," Penny. Oh, my rookie of the year.",8
39183,Penny,10," Oh, Dan. My boss who didn‰Ûªt want to hire me and now‰Ûªs a little hug machine.",8
39184,Dan,10," Oh, look at you. Brand-new and already the third best sales rep.",8
39185,Penny,10, Aw.,8
39186,Dan,10, Yes. Why don‰Ûªt you come over to my table.,8
39187,Penny,10, I‰Ûªll be right there. Bernadette‰Ûªs just parking the car.,8
39188,Dan,10," Oh, good. Bernadette. Cute, sweet, vicious little Bernadette.",8
39189,Penny,10, Come on. She‰Ûªs not that bad.,8
39190,Dan,10," Oh, yeah? At the company picnic she yelled at me and my grandson for losing the three-legged race. I mean, he still calls her that mean kid with the big boobies.",8
39191,Penny,10," I know she can be a little intense, but, I swear, she is so sweet once you get past all the‰Û_",8
39192,Bernadette,10," Hey, what are you talking about?",8
39193,Penny,10, Oh. We were just talking about how much we love working with you. Isn‰Ûªt that right? Dan?,8
39194,Scene,10, The apartment. ,8
39195,Sheldon,10," Over the years here at Fun With Flags, we‰Ûªve had an opportunity to learn, laugh, wonder.",8
39196,Amy,10," And, yes, even shed a tear or two.",8
39197,Sheldon,10, Like when you do a two-hour Fourth of July spectacular and it doesn‰Ûªt get recorded.,8
39198,Amy,10, How many times do I have to say I‰Ûªm sorry?,8
39199,Sheldon,10, How about four thousand. One for every domino I set up to make that American flag. Please enjoy these highlights.,8
39200,Sheldon,10," Crikey, what flag do we have today?",8
39201,Amy,10," Australia, mate.",8
39202,Sheldon,10, And now it‰Ûªs time for the speed round of Flag or Not a Flag.,8
39203,Kripke,10," Fwag, fwag, not a fwag, fwag, I am cwushing this.",8
39204,Amy,10," Say, Betsy Ross, what you working on?",8
39205,Sheldon,10, I have no idea. Because the story of me sewing the first American flag is unsupported poppycock.,8
39206,Amy,10," Then who did sew it, hmm?",8
39207,Sheldon,10, Don‰Ûªt ask me. I‰Ûªm just a simple seamstress whose descendants are out to make a quick buck.,8
39208,Sheldon,10," Fancy a dip, my dear?",8
39209,Amy,10, I do.,8
39210,Sheldon,10," Wait, that purple flag indicates that marine pests, such as jellyfish, are present.",8
39211,Amy,10," Wow, that flag is a lifesaver.",8
39212,Sheldon,10, No. This is. Stop looking at my legs.,8
39213,Kripke,10," Not a fwag, fwag, fwag, not a fwag. Fwag. Ugh cwap.",8
39214,Scene,10, The office.,8
39215,Raj,10," When stuff like this gets me down, you know what I like to do?",8
39216,Howard,10, Sing Hakuna Matata like an eight-year-old girl?,8
39217,Raj,10," Wrong, smarty-pants. It‰Ûªs Everything Is Awesome from The Lego Movie.",8
39218,Leonard,10, Look at these notebooks. They‰Ûªre full of pages and pages of data. He clearly spent years on this.,8
39219,Howard,10, Mmm. It‰Ûªs just columns of random numbers. Toss it.,8
39220,Leonard,10," Well, but what if this was a potential breakthrough for him? What if, what if this is the thing that would‰Ûªve finally let him open that bottle of champagne?",8
39221,Raj,10," Maybe he didn‰Ûªt know what to pair champagne with. Strawberries, caviar, oysters. All good choices. Yeah, that look right there is why people eat before they come to your parties.",8
39222,Leonard,10, This has to mean something.,8
39223,Howard,10," Well, there‰Ûªs no discernible pattern that I can see, but it shouldn‰Ûªt be too hard to run the numbers and check.",8
39224,Leonard,10," Well, maybe we can get some time on the supercomputer.",8
39225,Howard,10, Sure. We could try multiple regressions with varying physical and experimental constants.,8
39226,Leonard,10," Oh, we could run a pattern-matching algorithm against well-known unsolved physics problems.",8
39227,Howard,10," Ooh, it might be a substitution cipher. We could start with basic cryptanalysis.",8
39228,Raj,10, Or we could talk to this guy he used to share an office with.,8
39229,Howard,10," Oh, let‰Ûªs do that.",8
39230,Leonard,10," Because you don‰Ûªt know how to do cryptanalysis, do you?",8
39231,Howard,10," Yeah, I‰Ûªm not even sure if it‰Ûªs the right word.",8
39232,Scene,10, The conference room. ,8
39233,Penny,10," So, Dan, you have a grandson. How old is he?",8
39234,Dan,10, Seven.,8
39235,Bernadette,10," Oh, yeah. I remember him from the picnic. He was the one crying like a wuss the whole time.",8
39236,Penny,10, I heard he was being picked on by a mean kid.,8
39237,Bernadette,10," Just builds character. Like my dad said, nobody likes a crybaby except their mommies and Democrats.‰Û",8
39238,Dan,10, I need another drink.,8
39239,Bernadette,10, What‰Ûªs his problem?,8
39240,Penny,10," Oh, I don‰Ûªt know. Maybe he didn‰Ûªt like the fact that you called his grandson a wuss.",8
39241,Bernadette,10," Well, I didn‰Ûªt think you were supposed to say sissy anymore.",8
39242,Penny,10," Okay, look, I know what a good person you are, but sometimes people think you might come off a little harsh.",8
39243,Bernadette,10," What? I‰Ûªm, like, the sweetest person I know. Look at me. I should be in a tree baking cookies.",8
39244,Penny,10," Yes, but once in a while, people think you‰Ûªre a little mean.",8
39245,Bernadette,10," Oh, yeah? You one of those people?",8
39246,Penny,10," No. No, no, no. I think the cookie thing.",8
39247,Scene,10, The apartment.,8
39248,Amy,10, Action.,8
39249,Sheldon,10," Welcome back. Our guest today is a returning fan favourite. He puts the reading in your rainbow, the Geordi in your La Forge, and the Kunta in your Kinte, Mr. LeVar Burton.",8
39250,LeVar Burton,10," Thank you, Sheldon. Now, remember our deal.",8
39251,Sheldon,10," You do this, I delete your contact information.",8
39252,LeVar,10, While?,8
39253,Sheldon,10, While you watch me do it.,8
39254,LeVar,10, Great. Happy to be back.,8
39255,Sheldon,10," Well, since you‰Ûªre here, I‰Ûªd like to get your opinion on something. In honour of Black History Month, I portrayed George Washington Carver in a loving tribute that my roommate called wildly racist. What do you think? (On recording) Hi. My name is George.",8
39256,LeVar,10," Oh, hell, no.",8
39257,Sheldon,10," You heard him, Leonard. No, it‰Ûªs not racist.",8
39258,Scene,10, An apartment building.,8
39259,Howard,10, Are we sure this is the place?,8
39260,Raj,10, The doorman said this is the right building.,8
39261,Leonard,10," I think if you‰Ûªre pulling up your pants, you‰Ûªre not a doorman. (Knocks)",8
39262,Man (off),10, Who is it?,8
39263,Leonard,10," Uh, I‰Ûªve been looking for a Professor Sharpe?",8
39264,Prof Sharpe,10, Hold on. Can I help you?,8
39265,Leonard,10, Hi. We‰Ûªre from the university. We‰Ûªre trying to get some information about Professor Abbott.,8
39266,Howard,10, We were cleaning out his office and found these books full of numbers.,8
39267,Leonard,10, Any chance you know what it is?,8
39268,Prof Sharpe,10," Yes, he was always working on this.",8
39269,Raj,10," I was thinking it might be some sort of interstellar coordinate system, maybe an updated version of Hubble‰Ûªs law. I keep seeing the number 90 repeating. That could be the angle of perturbation of a distant galaxy.",8
39270,Prof Sharpe,10, It‰Ûªs the number of calories in a yoghurt. That‰Ûªs his food diary.,8
39271,Leonard,10, Really?,8
39272,Prof Sharpe,10," Yeah, he wrote down everything he ever ate. He was convinced that calorie restriction was the key to living forever.",8
39273,Raj,10, Does it work?,8
39274,Howard,10, Seriously?,8
39275,Raj,10," Well, he could have been hit by a bus. You don‰Ûªt know.",8
39276,Prof Sharpe,10," Sorry it‰Ûªs not more interesting. On the bright side, you didn‰Ûªt have to listen to his stomach growl for 35 years.",8
39277,Leonard,10," So, was there anything that Professor Abbott worked on during his life that came close to an accomplishment?",8
39278,Prof Sharpe,10," To be honest, his research never amounted to anything.",8
39279,Raj,10," You were his colleague. How did your research turn out? Great. Hey, this is the apartment you get when you win a Nobel.",8
39280,Raj,10," Well, you could be very frugal. I‰Ûªm getting a little tired of everybody‰Ûªs sarcasm.",8
39281,Scene,10, The conference room.,8
39282,Bernadette,10," I‰Ûªm not a bully. I mean, maybe I come off a little strong, but that‰Ûªs only because my dad raised me to be tough and not to take crap from anybody.",8
39283,Penny,10," No. That‰Ûªs fine, but there‰Ûªs a difference between being tough and telling your friend her new pants look like a saggy diaper.",8
39284,Bernadette,10," I did say that, didn‰Ûªt I?",8
39285,Penny,10," Yeah, you did. I felt so self-conscious, I had to return them.",8
39286,Bernadette,10, Where? To Babies R Us?,8
39287,Penny,10, You‰Ûªre doing it again.,8
39288,Bernadette,10," Okay, sorry. Can we just go? I feel like everybody hates me.",8
39289,Penny,10," Oh, come on, they don‰Ûªt hate you, all right? They‰Ûªre just a little intimidated. All you need to do is show everyone how sweet you really are.",8
39290,Bernadette,10, I think I‰Ûªd rather go.,8
39291,Penny,10," No, come on. You are not going anywhere, all right? I am here for you, and we are gonna fix this together.",8
39292,Bernadette,10, Thank you.,8
39293,Penny,10, Even though your dress is ugly.,8
39294,Scene,10,The apartment.,8
39295,Sheldon,10," Well, my little flag-keteers, it looks like the last episode of Fun with Flags is at an end. If I could, I would run each and every one of you viewers up a flagpole and salute you. And if you touched the ground, burn you. I‰Ûªd like to take a moment to personally thank Dr. Amy Farrah Fowler, who you may or may not know is the first woman to co-host a flag or banner-related Internet info-tainment show.",8
39296,Amy,10," Take that, glass ceiling.",8
39297,Sheldon,10," And if I may get serious for a moment, hosting this show has been one crazy ride. But with all its ups and downs, I wouldn‰Ûªt give it up for the world. Except for now, when I‰Ûªm giving it up. Before I sign off, I‰Ûªd, uh, I‰Ûªd like to share with you all one last use for a white flag. It‰Ûªs good for times like this. Good night.",8
39298,Amy,10," Cut. Sheldon, that was beautiful.",8
39299,Sheldon,10, If you didn‰Ûªt press record‰Û_,8
39300,Amy,10, I pressed it.,8
39301,Scene,10, The office.,8
39302,Leonard,10," Well, that‰Ûªs it. That‰Ûªs the end of Roger Abbott.",8
39303,Raj,10, And we still don‰Ûªt know who framed him.,8
39304,Leonard,10, I still keep thinking about how an entire life can seemingly amount to nothing.,8
39305,Howard,10," I guess the sad truth is, not everyone will accomplish something great. Some of us may just have to find meaning in the little moments that make up life.",8
39306,Leonard,10, That‰Ûªs a nice way of looking at it.,8
39307,Howard,10," Yeah for you, not for me. I went to space. I‰Ûªm covered.",8
39308,Leonard,10," You know what? This bottle was meant to celebrate an achievement. Let‰Ûªs make a pact. When one of us gets their first big breakthrough, we‰Ûªll celebrate by opening this bottle of champagne and toasting Professor Abbott.",8
39309,Howard,10, I love that.,8
39310,Raj,10," Yeah, me, too.",8
39311,Leonard,10," Then, of course, rubbing our success in Sheldon‰Ûªs face.",8
39312,Raj,10," Oh, well, that‰Ûªs the best part.",8
39313,Howard,10," Oh, yeah.",8
39314,Scene,10, The conference room.,8
39315,Bernadette,10," Dan, could I talk to you for a minute?",8
39316,Dan,10," Sure, go ahead.",8
39317,Bernadette,10, Just want you to know I didn‰Ûªt mean to be rude about your grandson.,8
39318,Dan,10," No, it‰Ûªs okay.",8
39319,Bernadette,10," No, it‰Ûªs not. Penny told me that everyone‰Ûªs scared of me.",8
39320,Dan,10," What? What? Why would she say that? You know she drinks, right?",8
39321,Penny,10, What?,8
39322,Bernadette,10," No, she‰Ûªs right, and I just want you to know that from now on, I‰Ûªm gonna be much more sensitive. I don‰Ûªt want anyone walking on eggshells around me.",8
39323,Dan,10," Oh, well, okay, then, uh, one thing I‰Ûªve been meaning to tell you is that the company is gonna stop paying for our coffee.",8
39324,Bernadette,10, No problem. When does that start?,8
39325,Dan,10, Five months ago.,8
39326,Bernadette,10, What?,8
39327,Dan,10, Yeah.,8
39328,Bernadette,10, Who‰Ûªs been paying for my coffee?,8
39329,Dan,10, All of us.,8
39330,Penny,10, Yeah. It comes from the swear jar we put money in when you curse.,8
39331,Bernadette,10, What else don‰Ûªt I know about?,8
39332,Penny,10," Uh, well, you know your private bathroom?",8
39333,Bernadette,10, Yeah?,8
39334,Penny,10, That was supposed to be for the whole floor.,8
39335,Bernadette,10, You‰Ûªre kidding.,8
39336,Dan,10," No, no. It‰Ûªs okay. It only really affected Wheelchair Kathy, and she‰Ûªs back in the hospital now, so it all worked out.",8
39337,Bernadette,10, I feel so bad.,8
39338,Penny,10," Well, then, maybe you shouldn‰Ûªt have named her Wheelchair Kathy.",8
39339,Bernadette,10," Oh, my God. I thought everybody liked me, but I‰Ûªm just a monster.",8
39340,Dan,10," But a cute one, like that, uh, eyeball guy in Monsters, Inc.",8
39341,Bernadette,10," No, I‰Ûªm the worst. I‰Ûªm a terrible person.",8
39342,Dan,10," Come on, don‰Ûªt cry. It‰Ûªs okay.",8
39343,Bernadette,10, It‰Ûªs not okay. How can I even work here anymore?,8
39344,Penny,10, Because this company needs you.,8
39345,Dan,10, It‰Ûªs fine. We don‰Ûªt mind paying for the coffee.,8
39346,Bernadette,10, I can‰Ûªt let you do that.,8
39347,Dan,10, Maybe we could get you an espresso machine for your office.,8
39348,Bernadette,10, I guess that would be all right.,8
39349,Penny,10, See? You don‰Ûªt have to be mean to get what you want.,8
39350,Bernadette,10, You‰Ûªre right. Now where did we land on my bathroom?,8
39351,Scene,10, The apartment. ,8
39352,Leonard,10, Hey.,8
39353,Sheldon,10, Hello.,8
39354,Leonard,10, How come you‰Ûªre up so late?,8
39355,Sheldon,10," I posted the last episode of Fun with Flags hours ago, and not a single person cared enough to comment. All that effort for nothing.",8
39356,Leonard,10," Mm. I know how you feel. I spent the day throwing out a man‰Ûªs entire career, and all that‰Ûªs left is an old bottle of champagne and a naked lady pen that Raj took when he thought no one was looking.",8
39357,Sheldon,10, It‰Ûªs not the same thing. I don‰Ûªt think you know how I feel at all.,8
39358,Leonard,10, Sad?,8
39359,Sheldon,10, Hmm. You do get me. Someone left a comment.,8
39360,Leonard,10, Yeah. What did they say?,8
39361,Sheldon,10," Too bad your show is done. I kind of liked it. Leonard, did you hear that? Oh, the people are heartbroken. I can‰Ûªt take this away from the world. Fun with Flags is back.",8
39362,Leonard,10, Congratulations.,8
39363,Sheldon,10, Let‰Ûªs celebrate.,8
39364,Leonard,10," Sheldon, that wasn‰Ûªt for you.",8
39365,Sheldon,10," Oh, no, I‰Ûªm not going to drink it. I just wanted to hear the pop. Yeah, I knew it was coming. Still scary.",8
39366,Scene,10, LeVar Burton‰Ûªs house.,8
39367,Sheldon,10," (Knock, knock, knock) LeVar Burton? (Knock, knock, knock) LeVar Burton? (Knock, knock, knock) LeVar Burton?",8
39368,LeVar,10, Ugh. What are you doing here?,8
39369,Sheldon,10," You told me not to call, and I didn‰Ûªt know how else to give you the good news. Fun with Flags is back, and you can be in the next episode.",8
39370,LeVar,10," Wil Wheaton said, get a gate. I don‰Ûªt know why I didn‰Ûªt get a gate.",8
39371,Sheldon,10," You, at least listen to the premise. Since you were born in Germany, I thought we could talk",8
39372,Scene,11, The apartment. ,8
39373,Penny,11," Hey, how are things going with your parents?",8
39374,Sheldon,11," You know, speaking of attorneys, if I ever needed a lawyer, I would not hire She-Hulk.",8
39375,Penny,11," You know what? That was almost on topic. I‰Ûªm gonna say good job, Sheldon.",8
39376,Amy,11," Wait, She-Hulk‰Ûªs a lawyer?",8
39377,Howard,11," Yeah, she works at a law firm in New York.",8
39378,Sheldon,11," Yes, but she‰Ûªs the only monster at the firm. Between you, me and the wall, I think she‰Ûªs an affirmative action hire.",8
39379,Raj,11," Anyway, Dad‰Ûªs gonna be here in town, so I won‰Ûªt be able to do Christmas dinner this year.",8
39380,Amy,11," If you‰Ûªre not up to hosting Christmas dinner, I‰Ûªm happy to do it. You can even bring your father.",8
39381,Raj,11, That would be nice.,8
39382,Amy,11," I‰Ûªve always wanted to do a traditional Victorian Christmas. Parlour games, goose and figgy pudding.",8
39383,Sheldon,11," Ugh. English pudding. You get yourself all excited for pudding, and here comes a cake with raisins in it. I‰Ûªm not going.",8
39384,Amy,11, You‰Ûªre going.,8
39385,Sheldon,11, Why do you hate me?,8
39386,Amy,11, I don‰Ûªt hate you. I love you.,8
39387,Sheldon,11," Well, you call it love, but it has a lot of raisins in it.",8
39388,Raj,11," Amy, good luck getting these guys excited about a dinner with a theme. I gave up when no one cared about my Tom Hanks-giving.",8
39389,Bernadette,11, I think a Victorian Christmas sounds nice.,8
39390,Howard,11, I agree.,8
39391,Leonard,11, Why not?,8
39392,Penny,11," Me, too.",8
39393,Raj,11, You guys suck.,8
39394,Scene,11, The University clean room.,8
39395,Leonard,11," You know the best part of working in the clean room? No allergies. Check it out. Oh, that, that, that‰Ûªs a lot of oxygen.",8
39396,Howard,11, We should get going to Amy‰Ûªs.,8
39397,Leonard,11, Can you believe there was a time when we would have needed an array of giant Cherenkov telescopes to detect cosmic particles? And here we are building our own multi-wire detector like a couple of badasses.,8
39398,Howard,11," I know. If we were still single, we‰Ûªd be tripping over all that booty.",8
39399,Leonard,11," Ladies do love a man dressed like a kitchen garbage bag. Oh, no.",8
39400,Howard,11, How the hell did a pigeon get in here?,8
39401,Leonard,11," You shut the loading doors, right?",8
39402,Howard,11, I thought you did.,8
39403,Leonard,11, Do you know what a disaster this is?,8
39404,Howard,11," You mean ‰Ûªcause this room isn‰Ûªt supposed to have dust in it, and we just let in a flying crap machine?",8
39405,Leonard,11, What do we do? Should we call someone?,8
39406,Howard,11, And tell them that we compromised all the equipment? Let‰Ûªs just get it out of here before anyone knows.,8
39407,Leonard,11," Okay, how do we catch it?",8
39408,Howard,11," Well, what if we turn off all the lights except for one, and it‰Ûªll come to it.",8
39409,Leonard,11, It‰Ûªs not a moth.,8
39410,Howard,11, Don‰Ûªt yell at me. You‰Ûªre not gonna get any good ideas out of me if you‰Ûªre yelling.,8
39411,Leonard,11," Okay, so if I remain calm, I‰Ûªll get more gems like turn off the lights?",8
39412,Howard,11," Great, we‰Ûªre turning on each other. That‰Ûªs just what the bird wants us to do.",8
39413,Scene,11, Amy‰Ûªs apartment. ,8
39414,Penny,11," So, Dr. Koothrappali, long flight?",8
39415,Dr Koothrappali,11, Twenty hours.,8
39416,Penny,11," Oh, that‰Ûªs rough.",8
39417,Dr Koothrappali,11," Not at all. Did you know that when you fly transcontinental without your wife, you don‰Ûªt pray for the plane to crash?",8
39418,Raj,11, Can we please talk about anything else?,8
39419,Dr Koothrappali,11, Forgive me. How are you and Leonard?,8
39420,Penny,11," Oh, great. Everything‰Ûªs good.",8
39421,Dr Koothrappali,11, I see you got engaged.,8
39422,Penny,11," Yes, we did.",8
39423,Dr Koothrappali,11, Let me tell you a story.,8
39424,Raj,11, Dad.,8
39425,Dr Koothrappali,11, Sorry. I‰Ûªm sure you won‰Ûªt grow to hate each other.,8
39426,Raj (on phone),11," Hey, Leonard. What‰Ûªs up? What? How did that happen? Yeah, okay. I‰Ûªll be there as soon as I can. Sorry. I have to run to the university.",8
39427,Amy,11, What‰Ûªs going on?,8
39428,Raj,11, There‰Ûªs been a problem with an experiment. A bird got into the clean room.,8
39429,Dr Koothrappali,11, You want me to come?,8
39430,Raj,11," Uh, no. You had a long flight. You stay here and relax.",8
39431,Dr Koothrappali,11," Relax. Easy for you to say. Your mother isn‰Ûªt cleaning out your bank account. Forty years, the woman never cleaned a thing.",8
39432,Penny,11, You‰Ûªre just gonna leave him here?,8
39433,Dr Koothrappali,11," Relax, he says.",8
39434,Raj,11, Yup. Bye.,8
39435,Scene,11, Bernadette‰Ûªs car.,8
39436,Bernadette (singing),11," Here comes Santa Claus, here comes Santa Claus, right down Santa Claus Lane. Vixen and Blitzen and all his reindeer pulling on the reins.",8
39437,Sheldon,11," Yeah, I appreciate the ride.",8
39438,Bernadette (singing),11," Bells are ringing, children singing, all is merry and bright. So hang your stockings and say your prayers ‰Ûªcause Santa Claus is coming tonight. Why‰Ûªd you turn it off?",8
39439,Sheldon,11," Because in the last ten minutes, Santa came to town, kissed Mommy and ran Grandma over with a reindeer. I had a drunk uncle who did all those things. Nobody sings songs about him.",8
39440,Bernadette,11, Maybe you‰Ûªd like it more if you thought of Santa as a superhero and his power is bringing joy to children.,8
39441,Sheldon,11," My uncle was accused of that, too. It turned out to be legal in Oklahoma.",8
39442,Bernadette,11," Okay, new subject. Let‰Ûªs talk about presents. What did you get Amy?",8
39443,Sheldon,11," Oh, we‰Ûªre not exchanging gifts.",8
39444,Bernadette,11," Come on, Sheldon, you have to get her something.",8
39445,Sheldon,11," Why should I? She knows that I don‰Ûªt like Christmas, and yet, every year, she forces me to celebrate it. Not only am I going to this foolish dinner against my will, at the Christmas tree lot, there was mistletoe, and she kissed me under it in public. Like we were the stars of a Tijuana sex show.",8
39446,Bernadette,11, She‰Ûªs just excited about the holidays.,8
39447,Sheldon,11," Yes, and she‰Ûªs not taking my feelings into account at all. Maybe it‰Ûªs time I teach her a lesson.",8
39448,Bernadette,11, How?,8
39449,Sheldon,11," Hmm. It‰Ûªd have to be something heinous, something that makes her as miserable as she‰Ûªs making me. Oh, I‰Ûªve got it. This is good.",8
39450,Bernadette,11, What?,8
39451,Sheldon,11, I‰Ûªm going to buy her a present.,8
39452,Bernadette,11," Yeah, you‰Ûªre gonna have to walk me through that.",8
39453,Sheldon,11," With gift-giving, there‰Ûªs an implied social contract. If I show up tonight with a present, and she doesn‰Ûªt have one for me, she‰Ûªll feel terrible.",8
39454,Bernadette,11, Then you‰Ûªre both sad?,8
39455,Sheldon,11," Yes. Maybe she‰Ûªll feel so guilty, she‰Ûªll never make me celebrate the holidays again.",8
39456,Bernadette,11, So your evil plot here is to buy your girlfriend a present?,8
39457,Sheldon,11," That‰Ûªs right. So stay on my good side, or I‰Ûªll get you a little something, too.",8
39458,Scene,11, The clean room. ,8
39459,Howard,11," Okay, here‰Ûªs the plan. I‰Ûªm gonna put the food in the bag, and when he lands in the bag to eat it, we close it up.",8
39460,Leonard,11, A Slim Jim?,8
39461,Howard,11, It‰Ûªs all I could find. It‰Ûªll work.,8
39462,Leonard,11, Sure. If the pigeon‰Ûªs stoned or a trucker.,8
39463,Howard,11," Okay, well, what‰Ûªs your plan?",8
39464,Leonard,11, I told you my plan. Let‰Ûªs call Building Services and get help.,8
39465,Howard,11, And admit that we contaminated the clean room?,8
39466,Leonard,11," No, admit that you contaminated the clean room.",8
39467,Howard,11, Why do you keep assuming it was me?,8
39468,Leonard,11," Because you do this kind of thing all the time, and then you try to cover it up.",8
39469,Howard,11, Like when?,8
39470,Leonard,11," What about when you flipped the Mars Rover, or lost Koothrappali‰Ûªs dog, or almost drove off with that baby?",8
39471,Howard,11," Again, it looked like my car, and the baby didn‰Ûªt even cry until his mother punched me with her keys.",8
39472,Leonard,11," Fine, put the Slim Jim in the garbage bag.",8
39473,Howard,11," Well, what if you said it without sounding so condescending?",8
39474,Leonard,11," I can try, but your plan has the words garbage bag and Slim Jim in it.",8
39475,Raj,11," Hey, what‰Ûªs going on?",8
39476,Leonard,11, Oh. Genius here wants to catch a bird with a garbage bag and a Slim Jim.,8
39477,Raj,11, Should have put it in the bag first.,8
39478,Scene,11, Amy‰Ûªs apartment.,8
39479,Penny,11," So, if you don‰Ûªt mind me asking, do you think you might start dating again?",8
39480,Dr Koothrappali,11, It‰Ûªs much too soon for that. Why? Do you know someone?,8
39481,Penny,11," No, but if things don‰Ûªt work out with me and Leonard, I‰Ûªll give you a call. Wait. How much do you talk about Star Trek?",8
39482,Amy,11," Okay, let‰Ûªs get this Victorian party started. I‰Ûªve done some research about some traditional parlour games we can play.",8
39483,Penny,11, Like what?,8
39484,Amy,11," Well, there‰Ûªs a fun one called Ball of Wool. You take a ball of wool, and you put it right in the centre of the table. Then people sit on opposite sides of the table and try to blow the wool off.",8
39485,Penny,11," Sorry. She‰Ûªs taken, too.",8
39486,Scene,11, The clean room.,8
39487,Howard,11, You know what I think your problem is? You‰Ûªre jealous because you and I used to be best friends until Koothrappali came along.,8
39488,Leonard,11, And you found somebody you could push around?,8
39489,Raj,11, Hey.,8
39490,Howard,11, Stay out of this.,8
39491,Raj,11, Okay.,8
39492,Howard,11," You know, maybe I‰Ûªm best friends with Raj because he doesn‰Ûªt think he‰Ûªs smarter than me.",8
39493,Raj,11, Actually.,8
39494,Howard,11," I said, stay out of it.",8
39495,Leonard,11," No, no, no. No, Raj, go ahead, say what you were gonna say.",8
39496,Raj,11," All I‰Ûªm gonna say is you guys need to stop this right now. It. it‰Ûªs bad enough that my parents are fighting, now I have to hear the two of you? And who cares who‰Ûªs smarter? If it‰Ûªs Leonard or me or, you know, it‰Ûªs Christmas, let‰Ûªs say it‰Ûªs Howard.",8
39497,Howard,11," Well, if you‰Ûªre so smart, you get the bird out.",8
39498,Raj,11," No, you‰Ûªre the one who let him in.",8
39499,Howard,11, How do you know it wasn‰Ûªt Leonard?,8
39500,Raj,11, Come on.,8
39501,Scene,11, A shopping mall.,8
39502,Bernadette,11, What about that sweater?,8
39503,Sheldon,11," No, it‰Ûªs not good enough. It has to be perfect.",8
39504,Bernadette,11, I think the nicest gifts I‰Ûªve got from Howie show how well he knows me.,8
39505,Sheldon,11," Hmm. Let‰Ûªs see, what do I know about Amy? She loves medieval literature, Chaucer‰Ûªs her favourite. And her eyes sparkle when she watches old French movies. I enjoy how harp music causes her fingers to dance as if she‰Ûªs playing along.",8
39506,Bernadette,11," Wow, you really do love her.",8
39507,Sheldon,11," I do. Now, let‰Ûªs find the kind of gift that makes her feel small and worthless.",8
39508,Scene,11, Amy‰Ûªs apartment. ,8
39509,Amy,11, You won.,8
39510,Penny,11," Certainly doesn‰Ûªt feel like it, does it?",8
39511,Dr Koothrappali,11," You know, my wife used to throw theme parties like this all the time.",8
39512,Penny,11," Oh, I guess that‰Ûªs where Raj gets it from.",8
39513,Dr Koothrappali,11," Well, he and his mother spent a lot of time together when he was young. I was always working.",8
39514,Penny,11," Hey, you know, Raj is dating a doctor who works a lot. Him and his mom have a type. You, you got to laugh at that, right? No? All right.",8
39515,Scene,11, Santa‰Ûªs grotto. ,8
39516,Santa,11," All right, let me see if I‰Ûªve got this straight. A picture of you on my lap is a way to punish your girlfriend for making you celebrate Christmas?",8
39517,Sheldon,11, Correct.,8
39518,Santa,11, Santa thinks dating you may be punishment enough.,8
39519,Sheldon,11, There‰Ûªs an argument for that. But I want to make sure.,8
39520,Photographer,11, Smile.,8
39521,Santa,11," Ho, ho. ho.",8
39522,Scene,11, The clean room.,8
39523,Leonard,11," Okay. On the count of three, I‰Ûªll shoot the fire extinguisher and get him airborne. Howard, you wave the blanket and guide him towards the exit. Raj, you hold open the curtain so he can fly out.",8
39524,Howard,11, Are you sure a dummy like me can handle something as complicated as a blanket?,8
39525,Leonard,11, Do you want the fire extinguisher?,8
39526,Howard,11," Yeah, I do.",8
39527,Leonard,11, Great. Here you go.,8
39528,Howard,11," Okay. One, two, three.",8
39529,Raj,11," Uh, you have to take the pin out.",8
39530,Leonard,11," You miss the blanket now, don‰Ûªt you?",8
39531,Howard,11," On three. One, two, three.",8
39532,Raj,11, What did you do?,8
39533,Howard,11," It was an accident. Oh, my God. Oh, my God.",8
39534,Leonard,11," Relax, it wasn‰Ûªt your fault.",8
39535,Howard,11," Uh, maybe it‰Ûªs just stunned.",8
39536,Raj,11," Dude, it‰Ûªs not breathing.",8
39537,Howard,11," Oh, no. I killed it. Oh, not again.",8
39538,Raj,11," What do you mean, not again?",8
39539,Howard,11," When I was ten, I was playing in my backyard and sat on a blue jay. I mean, I tried to bring it back to life with electricity, but it just caught on fire. The worst part was it smelled delicious.",8
39540,Leonard,11," Uh, guys, I found an article here that says you can do CPR on birds.",8
39541,Howard,11, Great. Do it.,8
39542,Leonard,11," I‰Ûªm not doing it. You killed him, you do it.",8
39543,Raj,11, I‰Ûªll do it.,8
39544,Howard,11, No. I need to do it. This is on me.,8
39545,Leonard,11, Okay. Mouth over beak and light chest compressions.,8
39546,Raj,11," Don‰Ûªt blow too hard. If you pop him, I will vomit.",8
39547,Leonard,11, Anything?,8
39548,Howard,11, I am tasting a lot of Slim Jim.,8
39549,Leonard,11," Wait, wait, his wing moved.",8
39550,Howard,11," Oh, he blinked his eyes. He‰Ûªs alive.",8
39551,Raj,11, It‰Ûªs a Christmas miracle.,8
39552,Howard,11," I might argue a Hanukkah miracle, but I‰Ûªll take it. Come on, little guy, let‰Ûªs get you outside. Get the curtain.",8
39553,Raj,11, Someone should really close that loading door.,8
39554,Scene,11," The same, later.",8
39555,Raj,11," Well, that‰Ûªs that. The room‰Ûªs compromised. They‰Ûªll have to change all the filters, probably shut it down for weeks.",8
39556,Howard,11," You were right. Go ahead, call Building Services. Tell them it was my fault.",8
39557,Leonard,11," No, we‰Ûªre both to blame. You know, let me take the heat on this one.",8
39558,Raj,11," Yeah, just leave me out of it. You know if they come here and see crap everywhere, they‰Ûªre just gonna blame the Indian guy.",8
39559,Leonard (on phone),11," Hey. I‰Ûªm sorry, we‰Ûªre still here. Is everything okay?",8
39560,Penny,11, It‰Ûªs kind of boring. Although it did get exciting for a minute when Amy inhaled a wool ball. How much longer do you think you‰Ûªll be?,8
39561,Leonard,11, I don‰Ûªt know. There‰Ûªs still a bird in here. We are gonna get in a ton of trouble.,8
39562,Penny,11," Honey, it‰Ûªs Christmas Eve. Who even knows you‰Ûªre in there?",8
39563,Leonard,11," No, our names are on the sign-in sheet.",8
39564,Penny,11, So erase them and walk out.,8
39565,Leonard,11, I can‰Ûªt do that.,8
39566,Howard,11, Can‰Ûªt do what?,8
39567,Leonard,11, She says take our names off the sign-in sheet and leave.,8
39568,Howard,11, We can‰Ûªt do that.,8
39569,Leonard,11, Yeah.,8
39570,Scene,11, Leonard‰Ûªs car.,8
39571,"Leonard, Howard and Raj (singing)",11," Jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle all the way. Oh, what fun it is to ride in a one-horse open sleigh, hey.",8
39572,Scene,11, Amy‰Ûªs apartment. ,8
39573,Raj,11," Mmm. Amy, that pudding was delicious.",8
39574,Sheldon,11, If you like raisins.,8
39575,Amy,11, Thank you. And it‰Ûªs figs.,8
39576,Sheldon,11," Oh. Oh, in that case, it was pretty good.",8
39577,Bernadette,11, You feeling okay? You hardly touched your goose.,8
39578,Howard,11, It smelled too much like blue jay.,8
39579,Dr Koothrappali,11, Can I help you clean up?,8
39580,Amy,11," Oh, you Heimliched a ball of wool out of me; you‰Ûªre good.",8
39581,Sheldon,11," Uh, what do you say we exchange gifts?",8
39582,Penny,11," Oh, Sheldon, we didn‰Ûªt bring any.",8
39583,Leonard,11, I thought you hate giving gifts.,8
39584,Sheldon,11," Yeah, I do. Which is why I got Amy this.",8
39585,Amy,11, You got me something?,8
39586,Sheldon,11," Oh, not just something, no. It‰Ûªs from the heart, it‰Ûªs holiday-themed, and I swallowed the gift receipt so you cannot return it.",8
39587,Amy,11, Look at you on Santa‰Ûªs lap. That‰Ûªs so sweet.,8
39588,Sheldon,11, Of course it is. It‰Ûªs the perfect gift. How are you feeling right now? Guilty? Sad? Wishing you were Jewish?,8
39589,Amy,11," No, I love it.",8
39590,Sheldon,11," Oh, really? Well, how about now? (On recording) Happy holidays to my dear Amy. I hope you treasure this as much as I treasure you. (Not on recording) And you got me nothing. Christmas is ruined. Let‰Ûªs never speak of it again. Well, this was fun.",8
39591,Amy,11," Actually, I did get you something.",8
39592,Sheldon,11, But what about our agreement?,8
39593,Amy,11," Well, you got me something. Here.",8
39594,Sheldon,11, Cookies?,8
39595,Amy,11, They‰Ûªre your Meemaw‰Ûªs Christmas cookies. I called and got the recipe.,8
39596,Sheldon,11, They‰Ûªre perfect. It tastes like her hugs.,8
39597,Amy,11," Merry Christmas, Sheldon.",8
39598,Sheldon,11," I can‰Ûªt believe this. You‰Ûªre happy, I‰Ûªm happy. Well, maybe a holiday that‰Ûªs all about giving isn‰Ûªt so‰Û_ Get your hand out of that box.",8
39599,Scene,11," The same, later.",8
39600,Amy,11, Okay. The next game is called Hot Boiled Beans.,8
39601,Penny,11, Of course it is.,8
39602,Amy,11," One person is sent out of the room while the others hide a small item. Then they invite the first person back by saying hot boiled beans and bacon for supper, hurry up before it gets cold.",8
39603,Raj,11," If you people think this is better than Tom Hanks-giving, you‰Ûªre all crazy.",8
39604,Scene,12, The apartment.,8
39605,Sheldon,12, What colour would you like to be?,8
39606,Leonard,12," Well, I‰Ûªd like to be green, but you know you always take it.",8
39607,Sheldon,12," That‰Ûªs not true. Any colour‰Ûªs fine with me. Yeah, I could be a-a combination of blue and yellow.",8
39608,Leonard,12, Blue and yellow make green.,8
39609,Sheldon,12," Well, then it‰Ûªs settled.",8
39610,Penny,12, Hi. Ready to go?,8
39611,Sheldon,12," Oh, good news, we ordered lunch, so we can all stay here and play Lord of the Rings Risk.",8
39612,Amy,12," Sheldon, we said that we would play games with you tonight.",8
39613,Sheldon,12," Oh, no, we‰Ûªll still be playing it tonight, this game can easily take eight hours.",8
39614,Penny,12," Sweetie, you really thought I‰Ûªd want to do this?",8
39615,Leonard,12, No.,8
39616,Penny,12," Well, did you tell him that?",8
39617,Leonard,12, Yes.,8
39618,Penny,12, Did you say it out loud with words?,8
39619,Leonard,12, No.,8
39620,Penny,12, I don‰Ûªt want to spend the whole day playing a board game.,8
39621,Sheldon,12," Yeah, well, you may change your mind when you hear that this is the new expanded edition which contains a more complete map of Middle Earth, now including the Haradwaith Territories.",8
39622,Amy,12, I will literally race you to the car.,8
39623,Leonard,12," No, no, no, come on, don‰Ûªt leave. Just try it.",8
39624,Penny,12," No. We‰Ûªre always doing what you guys want. Just once, it‰Ûªd be nice if you did something we wanted.",8
39625,Sheldon,12, You want to be green?,8
39626,Leonard,12," You know, they really have tried to like a lot of the same stuff we‰Ûªre into.",8
39627,Penny,12," Yeah, we do game nights and video game nights and we watch movies with director‰Ûªs commentary.",8
39628,Amy,12," Oh, my favourite, George Lucas can talk all the way through Star Wars, I say one word and I‰Ûªm banished to the kitchen.",8
39629,Penny,12," Yeah, today Amy and I are deciding what we‰Ûªre all gonna do.",8
39630,Leonard,12," You got it, you girls are in charge.",8
39631,Penny,12, Thank you.,8
39632,Amy,12, Sheldon?,8
39633,Sheldon,12," Fine. Now that we‰Ûªre not playing, you can be green.",8
39634,Leonard,12, Thank you.,8
39635,Sheldon,12," And since you‰Ûªre green this time, I can be it next time.",8
39636,Penny,12," All right, let‰Ûªs see. What‰Ûªs something fun the guys would never take us to do? Oh, I know, we could go horseback riding.",8
39637,Amy,12," I actually can‰Ûªt. My hips don‰Ûªt open wider than 22 degrees. I rode a very thin pony once. On the first bump, just popped right off.",8
39638,Penny,12," All right, well, what do you want to do?",8
39639,Amy,12, There‰Ûªs a craft and folk art museum on Wilshire.,8
39640,Penny,12," Well, that‰Ûªs Wilshire‰Ûªs problem. Come on, you know, there, there‰Ûªs got to be something fun we could do that the guys will hate.",8
39641,Leonard,12," Hang on, why do we have to hate it?",8
39642,Penny,12," Three words, Doctor Who convention.",8
39643,Leonard,12, I did not force you to go to that.,8
39644,Penny,12, You walked out of the house in a fez and bow tie. I went so you didn‰Ûªt get beat up.,8
39645,Leonard,12, I wasn‰Ûªt gonna get beat up.,8
39646,Penny,12," You were, but somehow I held myself back.",8
39647,Sheldon,12, You know what you could make us do? Ice-skating. The cold air will trigger Leonard‰Ûªs asthma and it plays right into my well-known fear of getting flattened by a Zamboni.,8
39648,Leonard,12, Now you‰Ûªre helping them find ways to make us miserable?,8
39649,Sheldon,12," Well, I‰Ûªm sorry, Leonard, I‰Ûªm a problem-solver, it‰Ûªs what I do.",8
39650,Amy,12, I actually can‰Ûªt go ice-skating. I have unnaturally brittle ankles.,8
39651,Penny,12, Is there any part of your body that‰Ûªs normal?,8
39652,Scene,12, Howard and Bernadette‰Ûªs apartment. ,8
39653,Raj,12," Oh, my God, oh, my God, oh, my God.",8
39654,Howard,12, Will you please relax?,8
39655,Raj,12," I can‰Ûªt take it, dude.",8
39656,Bernadette,12, You okay?,8
39657,Raj,12," No, I‰Ûªm not okay. I feel like I‰Ûªm gonna jump out of my skin.",8
39658,Bernadette,12, I told you not to wax down there. It‰Ûªs itchy when it grows back.,8
39659,Raj,12, I‰Ûªm worried about the New Horizons space probe.,8
39660,Bernadette,12, What‰Ûªs he talking about?,8
39661,Howard,12," Nine years ago he was part of a team that launched a spacecraft to collect data about Pluto, and it‰Ûªs finally close enough, so this morning it turned itself on.",8
39662,Raj,12, We hope. The signal has to travel over three billion miles. So it‰Ûªs gonna be hours before we know if it even survived.,8
39663,Howard,12, Now we get to see him flip out because he‰Ûªs worried it was demolished by space ice.,8
39664,Raj,12, Space ice is no joke. I can‰Ûªt even watch Frozen anymore.,8
39665,Scene,12, The apartment.,8
39666,Amy,12," Ooh, the philharmonic is playing Beethoven downtown.",8
39667,Sheldon,12," Before you say yes, it‰Ûªs not the movie about the big dog.",8
39668,Penny,12, How come we can‰Ûªt think of something we both want to do?,8
39669,Amy,12, Because you always pick what we do and I just go along with it.,8
39670,Leonard,12," Ah, interesting, we‰Ûªre being accused of making you do things you don‰Ûªt like, and here you are, doing the same thing to poor Amy.",8
39671,Sheldon,12, You should point out the hypocrisy of that.,8
39672,Leonard,12, That‰Ûªs what I was doing.,8
39673,Sheldon,12," Oh, that wasn‰Ûªt clear. Try it again, but this time drive it home with how do you like them apples, Missy?",8
39674,Penny,12," All right, keep thinking.",8
39675,Sheldon,12," You‰Ûªre making it too complicated. Why not stick to the basics? Go shopping for clothes while Leonard and I sit in those uncomfortable chairs and hold your purses, hmm? I know I‰Ûªd hate that. Leonard?",8
39676,Leonard,12," Well, yeah.",8
39677,Sheldon,12," Well, then, it‰Ûªs settled?",8
39678,Amy,12, What do you say? Sounds kind of perfect.,8
39679,Penny,12," It does, somehow he managed to take all the fun out of it.",8
39680,Sheldon,12," Well, once again, it‰Ûªs what I do.",8
39681,Scene,12, Howard and Bernadette‰Ûªs apartment.,8
39682,Raj,12," Oh, another two hours to go. The wait is killing me.",8
39683,Howard,12," I know. I get it. When I was in the Soyuz capsule returning from the space station, plummeting toward Earth at 17,000 miles per hour‰Û_",8
39684,Raj,12," Before you finish, is this a story about patience and waiting or just another reminder that you went to space?",8
39685,Howard,12, A story can do two things.,8
39686,Raj,12," Ugh, I feel like I‰Ûªm gonna have a heart attack.",8
39687,Howard,12," You work in pharmaceuticals, don‰Ûªt you have anything you can give him?",8
39688,Bernadette,12," All I have is our new urine flow drug. Won‰Ûªt help with his anxiety, but it‰Ûªs so strong, when he pees he‰Ûªll fly around the room like he‰Ûªs got a jet pack.",8
39689,Raj,12, I can‰Ûªt stop thinking about it.,8
39690,Bernadette,12," You know, worrying won‰Ûªt have any effect on what happens.",8
39691,Raj,12, I know.,8
39692,Howard,12, Maybe you need to do something more productive.,8
39693,Raj,12," Okay. If I make this shot in the trash can, the probe will have arrived in perfect working order.",8
39694,Howard,12," So, in addition to being crazy, you‰Ûªre resting the fate of the mission on your athletic prowess.",8
39695,Raj,12, Yes.,8
39696,Howard,12, The man who crashed his stationary bike.,8
39697,Raj,12," I didn‰Ûªt crash it, okay? My playlist was too up-tempo, I got light-headed and I fell off. Okay. It all comes down to this.",8
39698,Howard,12, You happy? Now you can relax.,8
39699,Raj,12, What kind of scientist are you? Everyone knows you got to make two out of three.,8
39700,Scene,12, A clothes shop.,8
39701,Leonard,12, This isn‰Ûªt so bad.,8
39702,Sheldon,12," That‰Ûªs easy for you to say. Your chair‰Ûªs not facing the lingerie section. Boy, that‰Ûªs a lot of panties.",8
39703,Amy,12, You guys comfy? This might take a while.,8
39704,Sheldon,12, I don‰Ûªt understand why women insist on making a big production out of buying clothes.,8
39705,Penny,12," No, you‰Ûªre right, we should do what you do. Have our mom send us pants from the Walmart in Houston.",8
39706,Sheldon,12, They have a man there who understands my personal style.,8
39707,Penny,12, Bye.,8
39708,Leonard,12," Uh, I‰Ûªve got some bad news. There‰Ûªs no cell service in here.",8
39709,Sheldon,12," Oh. Well, that‰Ûªs all right. There were plenty of ways to pass the time before smart phones were invented.",8
39710,Leonard,12, That‰Ûªs true.,8
39711,Sheldon,12, I‰Ûªll look them up. Son of a biscuit.,8
39712,Leonard,12," Sheldon, it‰Ûªs fine.",8
39713,Sheldon,12," No, it‰Ûªs not fine. What kind of store in the 21st century doesn‰Ûªt at least have Wi-Fi? I‰Ûªm going to call their corporate office. Son of a biscuit.",8
39714,Scene,12," The same, later.",8
39715,Sheldon,12," Let‰Ûªs see, my armies are going to attack the Shire from Buckland. And I roll a five and a three.",8
39716,Leonard,12," Okay. And to defend, I roll two sixes. I win.",8
39717,Sheldon,12," Boy, double-sixes again. You know, if I hadn‰Ûªt seen it with my own eyes, I wouldn‰Ûªt believe it. I wonder how long we‰Ûªre gonna be stuck here.",8
39718,Leonard,12," I don‰Ûªt know, but the girls do a lot for us. It‰Ûªs the least we can do.",8
39719,Sheldon,12," Oh, that‰Ûªs true. I suppose it‰Ûªs only fair we make compromises.",8
39720,Leonard,12," Look at you, being all mature.",8
39721,Sheldon,12," I don‰Ûªt know why you‰Ûªre so surprised. If there‰Ûªs one thing I know about after living with you for so many years, it‰Ûªs how to compromise.",8
39722,Leonard,12," I, I‰Ûªm sorry? You make compromises for me?",8
39723,Sheldon,12, All the time.,8
39724,Leonard,12," On Earth? In our lives? That, that, that we‰Ûªre living?",8
39725,Sheldon,12," Oh, yes. I, just yesterday, you had a, a big piece of lettuce stuck in your teeth at lunch. Did I say anything? No. I compromised and kept my mouth shut. Like you should‰Ûªve, because everyone was laughing at you.",8
39726,Leonard,12, That is not a compromise. A compromise is me driving you everywhere because you refuse to learn how.,8
39727,Sheldon,12," Oh, I learned how. Amy taught me.",8
39728,Leonard,12, What? Then. then why don‰Ûªt you do it?,8
39729,Sheldon,12," Uh, well, it‰Ûªs scary. And sometimes I get the pedals mixed up. But, more importantly, driving me to work is one of the things that gives your life purpose. I can‰Ûªt take that away from you, so what do I do? Oh, come on, I‰Ûªm practically feeding you the answer. I compromise.",8
39730,Scene,12, Raj‰Ûªs car.,8
39731,Raj,12," Hey, uh, thanks for keeping me company.",8
39732,Howard,12," I‰Ûªm happy to. I think getting out of the apartment will do you good. So, where we headed?",8
39733,Raj,12," If it‰Ûªs okay with you, I‰Ûªd like to go to temple.",8
39734,Howard,12," Buddy, trust me, you don‰Ûªt want to convert to Judaism. I mean, I know I make it look cool, but it‰Ûªs not all briskets and dreidels.",8
39735,Raj,12, I meant a Hindu temple.,8
39736,Howard,12," Oh. Okay. It‰Ûªs not like Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom, right? Some bald guy with horns isn‰Ûªt gonna rip my heart out.",8
39737,Raj,12," Dude, that movie‰Ûªs an imperialist fantasy that makes the followers of a beautiful and peaceful religion look like a bunch of bloodthirsty barbarians.",8
39738,Howard,12, You love that movie.,8
39739,Raj,12," Yeah, it‰Ûªs pretty great.",8
39740,Howard,12, I‰Ûªm surprised to see you suddenly get religious.,8
39741,Raj,12, Why?,8
39742,Howard,12," Well, because I‰Ûªve known you for ten years and you‰Ûªve never gone to temple, you never talked about believing in God, and last Diwali I watched you eat two pounds of sacred cow at a Brazilian steak house.",8
39743,Raj,12," Religion is a very personal thing. I do go to temple, I just, I don‰Ûªt talk about it.",8
39744,Howard,12," Yeah, but you‰Ûªre a scientist.",8
39745,Raj,12, So?,8
39746,Howard,12," So, as a scientist, you believe the way to understand the universe is through facts and evidence, and now you‰Ûªre counting on some blue chick with a hundred arms to help you?",8
39747,Raj,12, That is so offensive. Does everything you know about Hinduism come from Indiana Jones?,8
39748,Howard,12, No. There‰Ûªs also Apu from The Simpsons.,8
39749,Raj,12," Well, lots of scientists believe in God. Okay? Newton, uh, Faraday, uh, Pascal, all were believers. Even Einstein was famous for attacking quantum theory on the grounds that God does not play dice with the universe.",8
39750,Howard,12," Well, of course he believed in God. he slept with Marilyn Monroe.",8
39751,Raj,12, Actually there‰Ûªs no proof of that.,8
39752,Howard,12," You believe in your religion, I‰Ûªll believe in mine.",8
39753,Scene,12, The store changing rooms.,8
39754,Amy,12, How‰Ûªs it going in there?,8
39755,Penny,12," Uh, not really a great outfit for work, unless something opens up in the hookers and whores division. Hey, can I ask you something?",8
39756,Amy,12, Sure.,8
39757,Penny,12, Do I really force you to do things you don‰Ûªt want to?,8
39758,Amy,12," Yeah, but it‰Ûªs okay.",8
39759,Penny,12, How is it okay?,8
39760,Amy,12," I promised myself, if I ever got friends, I‰Ûªd do whatever they said. Really, I‰Ûªm lucky you found me before a cult did.",8
39761,Penny,12," Well, you know, that was a long time ago. You‰Ûªre a different woman now. You‰Ûªre smart, you‰Ûªve got great friends, you‰Ûªve got a boyfriend, you‰Ûªre pretty, you have zero fashion sense, but, anyway, tonight we‰Ûªre gonna do whatever you want.",8
39762,Amy,12, Really?,8
39763,Penny,12," Absolutely. You name it, we‰Ûªre doing it.",8
39764,Amy,12, Basket weaving at the craft museum.,8
39765,Penny,12," Well, you named it.",8
39766,Scene,12, The store.,8
39767,Sheldon,12," Oh, here‰Ûªs another one. I wish that the apple pancake mix was on the top shelf because it starts with an A, but I don‰Ûªt put it there because I don‰Ûªt want you breaking one of your little legs when you‰Ûªre supposed to be making my breakfast.",8
39768,Leonard,12, Is it my turn to talk about the compromises I make?,8
39769,Sheldon,12," I wasn‰Ûªt done, but go ahead. He said, compromising.",8
39770,Leonard,12," Because of you, I‰Ûªm not allowed to adjust the temperature in my own home. I‰Ûªm not allowed to whistle. I don‰Ûªt wear shoes that might squeak.",8
39771,Sheldon,12," Well, you‰Ûªre a physicist, not a circus clown.",8
39772,Leonard,12," Sheldon, do you realize I don‰Ûªt live with the woman I love because of you? No other reason. Just you.",8
39773,Sheldon,12, Is that true?,8
39774,Leonard,12," Yes, it‰Ûªs true. The last time I brought it up, you had an emotional breakdown and got on a train and ran away.",8
39775,Sheldon,12," Well, given my history on the subject, t seems a little reckless to bring it up now.",8
39776,Leonard,12, You have no idea how much you inconvenience the lives of everyone around you. It‰Ûªs exhausting.,8
39777,Sheldon,12," You know what? You think you‰Ûªre so tolerant, but the truth is you‰Ûªre mean to me a lot. Yeah, you think that I don‰Ûªt notice all those sarcastic comments and those eye rolls, but I do. Hmm? I have excellent peripheral vision. On a good day, I can see my ears.",8
39778,Leonard,12," Sheldon, I, I‰Ûªm sorry if I hurt your feelings. I‰Ûªve been holding a lot of this in for a while.",8
39779,Sheldon,12," Well, I‰Ûªm sorry, too. And if you want to live with Penny, then I think you should.",8
39780,Leonard,12, Do you mean that?,8
39781,Sheldon,12," Yes. Yeah, just put on your squeaky shoes and eee-eee-eee your way out of my life.",8
39782,Leonard,12," Come on, don‰Ûªt get upset.",8
39783,Sheldon,12, I‰Ûªm not upset. I‰Ûªm just imagining a world without my best friend in it.,8
39784,Leonard,12, Sheldon.,8
39785,Sheldon,12, It‰Ûªs okay.,8
39786,Leonard,12, I‰Ûªm not leaving your world. I‰Ûªm just talking about living across the hall.,8
39787,Sheldon,12," I understand. Either way, I want you to know that I‰Ûªm aware of how difficult I can be. So I just want to say thank you for putting up with me.",8
39788,Leonard,12, Buddy.,8
39789,Penny,12, How are you guys getting along? What? Why are there tears?,8
39790,Leonard,12, Everything‰Ûªs fine. We just started talking about living arrangements.,8
39791,Amy,12, Are you crazy? You know he‰Ûªs a flight risk.,8
39792,Sheldon,12, That‰Ûªs exactly what I told him.,8
39793,Penny,12," Sheldon, we know this is a sensitive subject, and Leonard‰Ûªs not gonna move out until you‰Ûªre ready.",8
39794,Sheldon,12," Well, what if you did it gradually?",8
39795,Leonard,12, All right. How about we start with two nights a week I live with Penny?,8
39796,Sheldon,12, How about one night and I let you whistle?,8
39797,Leonard,12, Okay.,8
39798,Sheldon,12, When I‰Ûªm not home.,8
39799,Leonard,12, You got it.,8
39800,Sheldon,12," There we go, compromising again. We really are the best.",8
39801,Scene,12, The temple car park.,8
39802,Howard,12," Here we go, my first Hindu temple.",8
39803,Raj,12," You see behind the fountain, that tower that looks like a pyramid? It‰Ûªs called a Sikhara. It symbolizes the, the connection between the human and the divine.",8
39804,Howard,12, Huh. I always thought it was mini golf.,8
39805,Raj,12, All right. Shall we?,8
39806,Howard,12," Yeah. Just, uh, is there anything I should know before I go in?",8
39807,Raj,12, Like what?,8
39808,Howard,12, Like am I dressed okay?,8
39809,Raj,12," Really? So every other place you‰Ûªve been, you thought this was fine?",8
39810,Howard,12," I know you‰Ûªre under a lot of pressure, so I‰Ûªm gonna let that pass.",8
39811,Raj,12," Sorry. You‰Ûªre right. I‰Ûªm so stressed. But you know what, whenever I walk into that temple I realize that whatever happens, it‰Ûªs okay. We‰Ûªre all part of an immense pattern, and though we can‰Ûªt understand it, we can be happy to know that it‰Ûªs, it‰Ûªs working its will through us.",8
39812,Howard,12, That‰Ûªs nice.,8
39813,Raj,12," Whether you call it God or the universe or the self, we‰Ûªre all interconnected, and that‰Ûªs just a beautiful‰Û_ Son of a bitch, that guy just dinged my car. S, seriously? You were just gonna drive away? Like my life isn‰Ûªt hard enough right now. A space probe might be destroyed, my parents are going through an awful divorce, the guy who cuts my dog‰Ûªs hair just gave her bangs.",8
39814,Howard,12, Raj.,8
39815,Raj,12, You saw her. She looks like Jim Carrey from Dumb and Dumber.,8
39816,Howard,12," Raj, you just got a text. The probe turned on. It‰Ûªs fine.",8
39817,Raj,12," Oh, good. Namaste, Grandpa.",8
39818,Scene,12, The craft museum. ,8
39819,Leonard,12," I thought this was gonna be boring, but it‰Ûªs actually kind of fun.",8
39820,Penny,12, Don‰Ûªt tell Amy that. We‰Ûªll be here every Sunday.,8
39821,Amy,12," Sheldon, that really is an excellent basket.",8
39822,Sheldon,12, It‰Ûªs not a basket. It‰Ûªs a soldier‰Ûªs helmet from 16th century China.,8
39823,Amy,12, Very nice.,8
39824,Leonard,12," Yeah, it looks great.",8
39825,Sheldon,12, I saw that.,8
39826,Scene,12, Penny‰Ûªs bedroom.,8
39827,Leonard,12," Well, roomie, it‰Ûªs only one night a week, but it‰Ûªs a start.",8
39828,Penny,12, I know. I‰Ûªm really proud of Sheldon.,8
39829,Leonard,12," Yeah, I‰Ûªm proud of him, too.",8
39830,Sheldon (in Penny‰Ûªs living room),12, Can you keep it down? Some of us are trying to sleep out here.,8
39831,Scene,13, The apartment.,8
39832,Leonard,13," Okay, we‰Ûªre headed out, see you later.",8
39833,Sheldon,13," Before you leave, could you test these noise-cancelling headphones?",8
39834,Leonard,13," Yeah, sure.",8
39835,Sheldon,13, Okay. Go ahead.,8
39836,Leonard,13," Hello, can you hear me? Sheldon, I haven‰Ûªt changed the filter in the water pitcher in two years.",8
39837,Penny,13," Uh, Bernadette‰Ûªs nickname for you is the virgin piÌ±a colada.",8
39838,Leonard,13, Your George Lucas autograph is really a me autograph.,8
39839,Penny,13," Yeah, once I was too lazy to walk across the hall, so I used your toothbrush.",8
39840,Leonard,13," Ooh, and one time when you were asleep, Amy totally took off her‰Û_ and that‰Ûªs why you‰Ûªre the best roommate ever.",8
39841,Sheldon,13," Aw, now I‰Ûªm sad I didn‰Ûªt hear it.",8
39842,Penny,13, So what do you need the headphones for?,8
39843,Sheldon,13," Well, I‰Ûªve been struggling for months to come up with a theory of dark matter that doesn‰Ûªt make protons decay. I‰Ûªm hoping to finally tackle it by optimising my work environment. See, I‰Ûªve got, uh, my tea is at the perfect sipping temperature. Uh, I have fleece-lined boxer shorts to keep my tushie toasty. And then, oh, last but not least, this inspirational cat poster improved with the reassuring face of physics renegade Richard Feynman.",8
39844,Penny,13, Is that why you had to take him to Office Depot last night?,8
39845,Leonard,13," I don‰Ûªt want to talk about it. There, the place is all yours.",8
39846,Penny,13," Yeah, have fun.",8
39847,Sheldon,13," Oh, I will, nothing more fun than a paradigm-shifting evening of science.",8
39848,Penny,13, And you thought it was soaping me up in the shower.,8
39849,Leonard,13, Bye.,8
39850,Sheldon,13, Okay. Here we go. Proton decay. Proton decay. (Time shift) Proton decay. Proton decay. (Time shift) Proton decay. Proton decay.,8
39851,Leonard,13," Hey, we‰Ûªre home. Any progress?",8
39852,Sheldon,13," How could there be, with these constant interruptions?",8
39853,Penny,13," I love him, but if he‰Ûªs broken, let‰Ûªs not get a new one.",8
39854,Scene,13, The apartment. ,8
39855,Leonard,13, What are you doing? It‰Ûªs time to go.,8
39856,Sheldon,13, I‰Ûªm not going to work today. And would you like to know why?,8
39857,Leonard,13," Ah, you‰Ûªre upset because you spent the whole night working on dark matter and didn‰Ûªt make a breakthrough, and now you‰Ûªre worried you made a huge mistake switching fields, and you‰Ûªre gonna sit around and sulk all day?",8
39858,Sheldon,13, Like a big old baby.,8
39859,Leonard,13, Call me if you need anything.,8
39860,Sheldon,13, I‰Ûªve been cooped up in here too long. Maybe I need some fresh air.,8
39861,Penny (off),13, Ugh! Ugh! Ugh! Ugh! ,8
39862,Sheldon,13," (Knock, knock, knock) Penny?",8
39863,Penny (off),13, Ugh!,8
39864,Sheldon,13," (Knock, knock, knock) Penny?",8
39865,Penny (off),13, Ugh!,8
39866,Sheldon,13," (Knock, knock, knock) Penny?",8
39867,Penny,13," Ugh, what?",8
39868,Sheldon,13, You sounded in distress. I was worried something unpleasant was happening to you. Like a murder. Or spontaneous coitus with Leonard.,8
39869,Penny,13," Oh, I‰Ûªm just doing this awful workout. I hate it.",8
39870,Sheldon,13," Well, if you hate it, then why are you doing it? Although I could ask the same question about coitus with Leonard.",8
39871,Penny,13," I don‰Ûªt know, I guess I like that I hate it. It makes me work harder.",8
39872,Sheldon,13, And to clarify?,8
39873,Penny,13," The exercise, Sheldon. Shouldn‰Ûªt you be getting ready for work?",8
39874,Sheldon,13, I‰Ûªm not going. Would you like to know why?,8
39875,Penny,13," Uh, you‰Ûªre sad about not getting anything done last night, so you‰Ûªre gonna sit around and pout about it?",8
39876,Sheldon,13," Boy, I‰Ûªm not nearly as mysterious as I think I am.",8
39877,Scene,13, The cafeteria.,8
39878,Howard,13, I invented a game. You want to play?,8
39879,Leonard,13, Sure.,8
39880,Howard,13," It‰Ûªs called Emily or Cinnamon. I give you actual quotes I‰Ûªve heard Raj say, and you guess if he was talking to his girlfriend or his dog.",8
39881,Raj,13," Go ahead, make fun. You can‰Ûªt embarrass me, I‰Ûªve got a beautiful girlfriend and a dog who loves me so much she drinks my bathwater.",8
39882,Howard,13," Okay, who was he talking to, Emily or Cinnamon? I want you to know, the bed feels so lonely when you‰Ûªre not in it.",8
39883,Raj,13, I may not be liking this game so much.,8
39884,Leonard,13, Cinnamon. Give me another one.,8
39885,Howard,13," Okay, Emily or Cinnamon? Check it out, I got us matching sweaters.",8
39886,Leonard,13," We all got the Christmas card, Cinnamon.",8
39887,Raj,13," You know, a man can care deeply about a woman and a pet. It‰Ûªs not strange.",8
39888,Leonard,13," Ooh, Emily. I heard him say that to Emily. Hey, I thought you were staying home.",8
39889,Sheldon,13," Yeah, I was, but after talking to Penny, I realised something. I, first, she‰Ûªs trying much harder to stay attractive in this relationship than you are. And second, the reason I may not be progressing in my research is I‰Ûªve created too pleasant of an environment for myself.",8
39890,Howard,13, What do you mean?,8
39891,Sheldon,13," According to a classic psychological experiment by Yerkes and Dodson, in order to maximize performance, one must create a state of productive anxiety. So I‰Ûªd like to ask you all to do something for me. Keep me on my toes. Just throw me off my game. Essentially, go out of your way to make my life miserable.",8
39892,Howard,13, Hold on. What‰Ûªs in it for us?,8
39893,Sheldon,13," Well, I suppose‰Û_",8
39894,Howard,13," Okay, we‰Ûªll do it.",8
39895,Scene,13, Amy‰Ûªs laboratory.,8
39896,Sheldon,13, Done.,8
39897,Amy,13," 33 seconds. Okay, that‰Ûªll be our baseline.",8
39898,Sheldon,13," You know, I don‰Ûªt want to tell you how to do your job, but when a mouse completes a maze, it gets a food pellet.",8
39899,Amy,13, It also gets its brain plucked out with tweezers.,8
39900,Sheldon,13, And his last meal was a food pellet? You‰Ûªre a monster.,8
39901,Amy,13," All right, next, we‰Ûªre gonna introduce an anxiety-inducing stimulus, measure your stress levels and see how it affects your problem-solving rate.",8
39902,Sheldon,13," Very well. And good luck, I‰Ûªm a pretty laid-back guy.",8
39903,Amy,13, Ready? Begin. Why‰Ûªd you pop it?,8
39904,Sheldon,13," I‰Ûªm sorry, I was aiming for your heart.",8
39905,Amy,13," Look, I know you don‰Ûªt like it, but that‰Ûªs the point of the experiment. I need to irritate you to find your optimal anxiety zone. And you said no to tickling, polka music or watching me eat a banana.",8
39906,Sheldon,13, Who eats them horizontally?,8
39907,Amy,13, My mother said that‰Ûªs how good girls do it.,8
39908,Sheldon,13, Perhaps this was a waste of time.,8
39909,Amy,13," Sheldon, you‰Ûªre a remarkable scientist. Just be patient, I‰Ûªm sure you‰Ûªll find the breakthrough you‰Ûªve been looking for.",8
39910,Sheldon,13, Thank you.,8
39911,Amy,13," And if you only do solid research instead of making a groundbreaking discovery, what does it matter?",8
39912,Sheldon,13," Only do solid research? I come to you for help, and you insult me? I thought the least that you would do would be‰Û_",8
39913,Amy,13," Look, your anxiety levels are right in the zone.",8
39914,Sheldon,13," Really? Oh, that‰Ûªs fantastic. Now, wait, they‰Ûªre dropping. Why are they dropping?",8
39915,Amy,13, Because you‰Ûªre happy they‰Ûªre elevated.,8
39916,Sheldon,13," Oh, that is infuriating. Ooh, look, they went back up again. Terrific. Oh, no, they went back down.",8
39917,Scene,13, The apartment.,8
39918,Raj,13," All right, guys, what game do you want to play?",8
39919,Howard,13, Let‰Ûªs see. How about Emily or Cinnamon?,8
39920,Raj,13," You know what? I think it‰Ûªs a little weird that you remember me saying all these things. Maybe the truth is, you‰Ûªre jealous of all my relationships.",8
39921,Howard,13," Oh, maybe I am. Who wouldn‰Ûªt want to be the girl, or possibly dog, to hear the words you‰Ûªre so lucky, you have the shiniest hair.",8
39922,Leonard,13," That is a tough one. Uh, I know he brushes both of them.",8
39923,Sheldon,13," Gentlemen, I have figured out the perfect way for you to irritate me. I‰Ûªd like you to be my intellectual sparring partners. From now on, when I make an assertion, I need you to challenge it.",8
39924,Leonard,13, So you just want us to disagree with whatever you say?,8
39925,Sheldon,13, Yes.,8
39926,Raj,13, And you think that‰Ûªs going to help?,8
39927,Sheldon,13, Yes.,8
39928,Howard,13," Well, I don‰Ûªt think that‰Ûªs gonna help at all.",8
39929,Sheldon,13," Oh, no, it will. See, by keeping my mind engaged, I‰Ûªll become more focused.",8
39930,Leonard,13," Howard‰Ûªs right, that‰Ûªll never work.",8
39931,Sheldon,13," Stop fighting me on the premise. It‰Ûªs scientifically valid. I‰Ûªm going to advance propositions, I just want you to challenge me.",8
39932,Raj,13, I don‰Ûªt think that‰Ûªs what you want at all.,8
39933,Sheldon,13," Why, of course it‰Ûªs what I want. Why would I say it‰Ûªs what I want if it‰Ûªs not what I want?",8
39934,Leonard,13," Because it is what you want, and it‰Ûªs not what you said.",8
39935,Sheldon,13," I ask you for one simple thing, and you can‰Ûªt even do it.",8
39936,Howard,13," Yes, we can.",8
39937,Sheldon,13," Yeah, well, then do it.",8
39938,Howard,13, Nah.,8
39939,Sheldon,13," You guys are the worst. Thank you, I think that was helpful.",8
39940,Scene,13, Penny‰Ûªs apartment. ,8
39941,Penny,13," So, whichever rep has the best sales for the quarter gets a trip for two to Hawaii.",8
39942,Amy,13, That would be so romantic for you and Leonard.,8
39943,Penny,13," Yeah, clearly you haven‰Ûªt seen him on the beach walking around with his metal detector.",8
39944,Amy,13," If I were going to Hawaii, I‰Ûªd spend all my time at the Keck Observatory. Did you know that the telescopes there have better resolution than the Hubble?",8
39945,Penny,13, Really? Want to go to Hawaii?,8
39946,Sheldon,13," (Knock, knock, knock) Ladies? (Knock, knock, knock) Ladies? (Knock, knock, knock) Ladies?",8
39947,Penny,13, Come in.,8
39948,Sheldon,13, Ladies.,8
39949,Penny,13, What‰Ûªs up?,8
39950,Sheldon,13," Well, as you may know, I‰Ûªve been experimenting with elevated anxiety levels, and I thought, what better way to increase my discomfort than to subject myself to an evening of tasteless uncensored crotch talk?",8
39951,Penny,13, What exactly do you think goes on here?,8
39952,Sheldon,13," Well, conversations that you wouldn‰Ûªt be comfortable having in front of the opposite sex. You know, who has the best cervix. Which sanitary napkin is all the rage right now. Men‰Ûªs buttocks, and how you want to pat and squeeze them.",8
39953,Bernadette,13, We were talking about Penny‰Ûªs job.,8
39954,Sheldon,13," And how difficult it is to do when she‰Ûªs bloated, cranky and crampy? Continue.",8
39955,Penny,13," Sheldon, we are just people. We talk about the same things you guys talk about.",8
39956,Sheldon,13," You talk about if werewolves can swim? See, Leonard says yes, but I say it depends on if the human could swim before he was bitten. What do you think?",8
39957,Penny,13, Let‰Ûªs just talk about our periods.,8
39958,Amy,13," No, hold on. All canines instinctively know how to swim. Why wouldn‰Ûªt a werewolf have the same abilities?",8
39959,Bernadette,13," Well, they‰Ûªre not a hundred percent wolf. They‰Ûªre a werewolf, that‰Ûªs only part wolf. It‰Ûªs like comparing apples to oranges.",8
39960,Sheldon,13," Thank you. Oh, and technically, it‰Ûªs apples that turn into were-oranges when the moon is full. Hey, this is fun. We should do it sometime when you aren‰Ûªt all PMS‰Ûªing. Bye.",8
39961,Scene,13, The apartment. ,8
39962,Leonard,13, What is going on?,8
39963,Sheldon,13," Oh. Uh, I need to keep my anxiety at the right level, so I‰Ûªm using Darth Vader, the Joker, and Godzilla‰Ûªs roar to keep me in that sweet spot. Uh, I tried including Taylor Swift in the mix, but turns out I love her.",8
39964,Leonard,13," Well, at least listen to it through headphones. I‰Ûªm trying to sleep. Good night.",8
39965,Sheldon,13," Boy, Taylor was right, haters gonna hate, hate, hate, hate, hate.",8
39966,Scene,13, Amy‰Ûªs apartment.,8
39967,Amy,13," You‰Ûªve been working so much lately, I‰Ûªm glad you didn‰Ûªt forget about date night.",8
39968,Sheldon,13, Of course.,8
39969,Amy,13, Sheldon.,8
39970,Sheldon,13, Yeah.,8
39971,Amy,13, Maybe you want to put the notebook away and talk to me.,8
39972,Sheldon,13, I can do both. My brain is working at optimal capacity. I can have a conversation with you and solve the dark matter proton decay problem at the same time.,8
39973,Amy,13, Fine. How was your day?,8
39974,Sheldon,13," Oh, you said it.",8
39975,Amy,13," Sheldon. Sheldon, I‰Ûªm worried about you. You‰Ûªre not eating, you haven‰Ûªt slept in days, and, to be honest, that cap is starting to smell.",8
39976,Sheldon,13, I know. It‰Ûªs replaced Godzilla as my principle source of anxiety.,8
39977,Scene,13, The apartment. ,8
39978,Howard,13," Okay, so it‰Ûªs one vote Emily, one vote Cinnamon. Penny, you‰Ûªre the tiebreaker.",8
39979,Penny,13, Say the quote again.,8
39980,Howard,13, It‰Ûªs just so perfect that we‰Ûªre both Libras.,8
39981,Penny,13," Wow, this is hard. I‰Ûªm gonna say Cinnamon.",8
39982,Howard,13, Yes.,8
39983,Penny,13, Yes.,8
39984,Raj,13, Come on.,8
39985,Howard,13," That was the last one, I promise. We won‰Ûªt play any more.",8
39986,Raj,13," Thank you. ‰Û÷Cause if she ever found out, it would hurt her feelings.",8
39987,Bernadette,13, Emily‰Ûªs feelings?,8
39988,Raj,13," Yes, Emily. Whatever. Where‰Ûªs Sheldon?",8
39989,Penny,13, Date night.,8
39990,Leonard,13," That can‰Ûªt be much fun for Amy. You know, at work today, he tried his first Red Bull.",8
39991,Bernadette,13, What happened?,8
39992,Leonard,13, He chased a squirrel around the quad for a while and then threw up in my car.,8
39993,Bernadette,13, Don‰Ûªt you think you should make him stop all this?,8
39994,Howard,13," I don‰Ûªt know, he‰Ûªs not really hurting anybody.",8
39995,Leonard,13, You didn‰Ûªt have to scoop vomit out of your glove compartment.,8
39996,Sheldon,13, He is getting a lot of work done. He had a pretty interesting take on proton decay.,8
39997,Raj,13," Wow, if he cracks that it‰Ûªs a game changer, guys. It‰Ûªll completely redefine our understanding of the physical universe.",8
39998,Howard,13," Hmm, it would. Okay, back to Emily or Cinnamon? How can such a little girl eat such a big steak?",8
39999,Scene,13, Amy‰Ûªs apartment.,8
40000,Amy,13," Sheldon, I want you to take that cap off.",8
40001,Sheldon,13," That nagging tone is helping my anxiety, yeah. But if you could maybe just go ten percent less shrill, that‰Ûªd really put the zip-a-dee in my doo-dah.",8
40002,Amy,13," I‰Ûªm sorry, but you know we agreed not to bring work to date night.",8
40003,Sheldon,13," There you go, perfect.",8
40004,Amy,13," Sheldon, stop it, I‰Ûªm not kidding. Take the cap off, and put the notebook away.",8
40005,Sheldon,13," But after months of struggling, I‰Ûªm finally making progress.",8
40006,Amy,13, You don‰Ûªt need to drive yourself crazy in order to be productive.,8
40007,Sheldon,13," Or do I, hmm? Sir Isaac Newton wrote his Principia while convinced he was an armadillo.",8
40008,Amy,13, That‰Ûªs not true.,8
40009,Sheldon,13," Yeah, well, maybe it is, maybe it isn‰Ûªt. I have been hallucinating lately.",8
40010,Amy,13," Sheldon, this has to stop. You need to get some sleep and take care of yourself.",8
40011,Sheldon,13," Amy, I have gotten more done in the last few days than I have since I made the switch to dark matter. What if I stop doing this, and it all goes away?",8
40012,Amy,13," Your thoughts and ideas come from you, not from your anxiety.",8
40013,Sheldon,13," Hmm, perhaps. But I‰Ûªm not taking the cap off.",8
40014,Amy,13," It‰Ûªs one thing to make yourself miserable, but you‰Ûªre making everyone around you miserable, too. Now, I‰Ûªm telling you for the last time, take the cap off.",8
40015,Sheldon,13," Oh, really? What if I don‰Ûªt? And before you answer that, can I have my dessert?",8
40016,Scene,13, A bus.,8
40017,Sheldon,13," And then she threw me out. Me, her very own boyfriend. When all I‰Ûªve done is try to help humanity reach of the world we live in.",8
40018,Man,13," Yeah, well, women, what are you gonna do?",8
40019,Sheldon,13," I knew you‰Ûªd understand, Armadillo Isaac Newton.",8
40020,Scene,13, Sheldon‰Ûªs bedroom.,8
40021,Penny,13, Okay.,8
40022,Leonard,13, Here we are.,8
40023,Sheldon,13, Hey. What are you trying to pull? The president of science isn‰Ûªt in here.,8
40024,Leonard,13," You lie down, he‰Ûªll be here in a minute.",8
40025,Sheldon,13," Okay. Hey, I thought you were trying to trick me.",8
40026,Penny,13," Now, you just get comfortable.",8
40027,Sheldon,13," No, no, comfort is the enemy. You know what‰Ûªs comfortable? Slippers and blankets and panda bears. Imagine a panda bear with Richard Feynman‰Ûªs face on it. Warm up the car, Leonard, it‰Ûªs poster time.",8
40028,Leonard,13, Maybe in the morning.,8
40029,Penny,13," Yeah, you get some sleep.",8
40030,Sheldon,13," No, I don‰Ûªt want to go to sleep, you can‰Ûªt make me.",8
40031,Penny,13," You‰Ûªre right, we can‰Ûªt.",8
40032,Sheldon,13," Yeah, darn straight, you can‰Ûªt. Try to tell a grown man to go to sleep.",8
40033,Penny (singing),13," Soft kitty, warm kitty.",8
40034,Leonard (singing),13, Little ball of fur.,8
40035,Sheldon,13, That‰Ûªs not gonna work.,8
40036,Penny (singing),13," Happy kitty, sleepy kitty.",8
40037,Together (singing),13," Purr, purr, purr.",8
40038,Leonard,13," You know, he can be a lot of trouble, but when I see him lying here asleep like this, I just think how easy it would be to hold a pillow over his face.",8
40039,Penny,13, Mmmm.,8
40040,Scene,13, The cafeteria.,8
40041,Howard,13, You look like you got some rest.,8
40042,Sheldon,13," Oh, I‰Ûªm feeling much better. And I‰Ûªve also been continuing to make progress without artificially raising my anxiety levels.",8
40043,Leonard,13," I turned on the heat in my car and some vomit came out, so my levels, right up there.",8
40044,Raj,13," Hey, guys. Mind if Emily joins us for lunch?",8
40045,Leonard,13," Yeah, sure.",8
40046,Howard,13," Yeah, no problem.",8
40047,Sheldon,13, Of course not.,8
40048,Emily,13, So I hear you guys have been playing a little game.,8
40049,Howard,13," Well, um, we were just kidding around.",8
40050,Emily,13," Well, you may think it‰Ûªs funny that Raj is sweet and sensitive, but I think it‰Ûªs sexy. Ugh, why is there dog hair in your mouth?",8
40051,Scene,14, Penny‰Ûªs apartment.,8
40052,Penny,14," So, tell me about your day, how‰Ûªs it going with the particle detector?",8
40053,Leonard,14," Wow, you remember that?",8
40054,Penny,14," Yeah, I listen to what you say. You‰Ûªre building a particle detector using superfluid helium.",8
40055,Leonard,14," You know, when you talk like that, I want to take you right here on this table.",8
40056,Penny,14," And you know from past experience this table cannot support both our weight. So, how‰Ûªs the detector going?",8
40057,Leonard,14," Well, it‰Ûªs tricky working with superfluids. Whatever container you put them in, they kind of creep up the sides and crawl out all on their own.",8
40058,Penny,14, Kind of like Sheldon‰Ûªs ant farm.,8
40059,Leonard,14," Exactly, except you don‰Ûªt have a lunatic running around, yelling, I fed you sugar water, why are you biting me? Come on, this is boring, you really want to talk about this?",8
40060,Penny,14," No, I do. I didn‰Ûªt write superfluid helium on this napkin for nothing.",8
40061,Leonard,14," Okay, well, this is cool. Uh, there‰Ûªs a thing called superfluid vacuum theory, where empty space is imagined as a superfluid with all of its qualities, viscosity, density, surface tension‰Û_",8
40062,Penny,14," Hey, if you‰Ûªre pausing for dramatic effect, I‰Ûªd keep it moving.",8
40063,Leonard,14," No, no. People don‰Ûªt talk about surface tension. If you imagine our three-space as the surface of an N-dimensional superfluid bubble‰Û_ This is exciting. This is really exciting. I have to go find Sheldon.",8
40064,Penny,14," Okay, well, if you find him, use the kitchen island, that coffee table will not support both of you.",8
40065,Scene,14, The apartment.,8
40066,Leonard,14, Which means a spherical multidimensional superfluid shows the same negative-energy density as space-time. So what do you think? What do you think? So what do you think?,8
40067,Sheldon,14, Hmm.,8
40068,Leonard,14, What? Is it wrong? Have you seen it somewhere else?,8
40069,Sheldon,14, Hmm.,8
40070,Leonard,14," I know this isn‰Ûªt my area, and I could never do the math like you can, but could this be something?",8
40071,Sheldon,14," Well, you could have set Newton‰Ûªs gravitational constant to one. And, ugh, the whole thing reeks of blueberry. You know I can‰Ûªt stand these scented markers.",8
40072,Leonard,14," No one told you to taste them. Come on, is, is this good or not?",8
40073,Sheldon,14, It‰Ûªs good.,8
40074,Leonard,14, Really?,8
40075,Sheldon,14, I like it. I think you‰Ûªre on to something.,8
40076,Leonard,14, You do? You‰Ûªre not messing with me?,8
40077,Sheldon,14," Not at all. In fact, I have got something for just such an occasion. I was starting to think I might never get a chance to give it to you. Good job.",8
40078,Leonard,14, You‰Ûªre giving me a sticker?,8
40079,Sheldon,14, Not just a sticker. That is a sticker of a kitty saying me-wow.,8
40080,Leonard,14, I‰Ûªm not a preschooler.,8
40081,Sheldon,14," Fine, I‰Ûªll take it back.",8
40082,Leonard,14, I earned this. Back off.,8
40083,Scene,14, The apartment.,8
40084,Leonard,14, You‰Ûªre still awake?,8
40085,Sheldon,14," For a man whose last observation was our universe may be the surface of a multidimensional supercooled liquid, you‰Ûªre still awake seems like quite the sophomore slump.",8
40086,Leonard,14, You worked out all the math.,8
40087,Sheldon,14," Oh, I did more than work out all the math. I wrote a paper.",8
40088,Leonard,14, You wrote a paper on my idea?,8
40089,Sheldon,14, I wrote a paper on our idea.,8
40090,Leonard,14, When did my idea become our idea?,8
40091,Sheldon,14, When I mixed it with Sheldony goodness and cooked it in the Easy-Bake oven of my mind.,8
40092,Leonard,14, This is good. Our idea is really good.,8
40093,Sheldon,14," Well, the lightbulb in this oven is ridiculously bright.",8
40094,Leonard,14," You know, if no one‰Ûªs thought of this, yet, this could be a big deal.",8
40095,Sheldon,14," Only way we‰Ûªll know for sure is if we post it online to the pre-print server. I have it ready to go, but I wasn‰Ûªt gonna do it without you.",8
40096,Leonard,14," Wow, it‰Ûªs all happening so fast. Should we just sleep on it?",8
40097,Sheldon,14," We could, but we always run the risk of someone else beating us to the punch.",8
40098,Leonard,14, You‰Ûªre sure it‰Ûªs good?,8
40099,Sheldon,14, My name is right on there with yours. That is a surefire mark of quality. That might as well say directed by Joss Whedon.,8
40100,Leonard,14," Okay, partner, let‰Ûªs do it.",8
40101,Sheldon,14, Come on. Click the mouse with me.,8
40102,Leonard,14," One, two three.",8
40103,Together,14, Click.,8
40104,Leonard,14," Well, we did it.",8
40105,Sheldon,14," Yes, we did, my friend.",8
40106,Leonard,14, Is your tongue blue?,8
40107,Sheldon,14, I don‰Ûªt want to talk about it.,8
40108,Scene,14, Penny‰Ûªs apartment. ,8
40109,Bernadette,14," Okay, movie night, what do you want to watch?",8
40110,Amy,14, Whatever happened to that ape movie you were in?,8
40111,Penny,14," Oh, God. Probably nothing. I think I saw the director twirling a sign outside the Verizon store.",8
40112,Bernadette,14, Search for it.,8
40113,Penny,14," What, no, why?",8
40114,Bernadette,14, ‰Û÷Cause it would be fun to watch.,8
40115,Penny,14, It would be humiliating.,8
40116,Bernadette,14," Well, now we have two reasons.",8
40117,Amy,14, They have it.,8
40118,Bernadette,14," Please, can we watch it?",8
40119,Amy,14, Please?,8
40120,Penny,14," Fine, but I‰Ûªm telling you, it‰Ûªs terrible.",8
40121,Amy,14, Have you even seen it?,8
40122,Penny,14, No.,8
40123,Bernadette,14," Well, maybe it turned out better than you think.",8
40124,Voice on TV,14," Bananas, get your fresh bananas.",8
40125,Bernadette,14," Ho-ho, it really didn‰Ûªt.",8
40126,Scene,14, Leonard‰Ûªs laboratory.,8
40127,Leonard,14," Sheldon, this is superfluid helium. Put this in your mouth, your tongue will freeze and break off.",8
40128,Sheldon,14, Does it smell like blueberries?,8
40129,Leonard,14, No.,8
40130,Sheldon,14, Then we‰Ûªre probably okay.,8
40131,Howard,14," Hey, your paper got mentioned on the Quantum Diaries physics blog.",8
40132,Leonard,14, Really? What‰Ûªd they say?,8
40133,Howard,14," Uh, it‰Ûªs basically a summary of the theory, but there‰Ûªs a bunch of positive comments on the message board.",8
40134,Leonard,14," Let me see, let me see. One calls it insightful and innovative. We‰Ûªre insightful and innovative.",8
40135,Sheldon,14," Oh, nice to meet you, Mr. Insightful.",8
40136,Leonard,14," Oh, the pleasure is mine, Mr. Innovative. Uh, another one says the concept shows some real out-of-the-box thinking. Do you hear that, Mr. Out-Of-The?",8
40137,Sheldon,14," I do, indeed, Mr. Box-Thinking.",8
40138,Howard,14," How are you today, Mr. Can-You-Believe-These-Jack-Asses?",8
40139,Raj,14," Just dandy, Mr I-Wish-I-Was-Better-At-Improv.",8
40140,Sheldon,14, Read another one.,8
40141,Leonard,14," Okay, okay. Uh, the analogy between space-time and a supercooled fluid is either meaningless or false. I wish this blog would devote itself to real science instead of wasting our time with crackpot wannabe theoreticians in a rush to publish.",8
40142,Sheldon,14, Who wrote that?,8
40143,Leonard,14," It‰Ûªs anonymous, and user name General Relativity.",8
40144,Sheldon,14," Well, I‰Ûªm responding to it.",8
40145,Leonard,14," Uh, don‰Ûªt lower yourself to their level.",8
40146,Sheldon,14," Look, I am simply going to defend our work, scientist to scientist. And failing that, suggest that his mother enjoys a string of both human and non-human lovers.",8
40147,Leonard,14," Sheldon, my name‰Ûªs on that paper, too. There‰Ûªs no upside to doing this.",8
40148,Sheldon,14, He just left another comment.,8
40149,Raj,14, What does it say?,8
40150,Leonard,14," Upon review, I‰Ûªve changed my mind about the Cooper-Hofstadter hypothesis that space-time is like a superfluid. In fact, it‰Ûªs inspired me to come up with my own theory. Maybe space-time is like two clowns with their heads in a bucket, much like Cooper and Hofstadter.",8
40151,Sheldon,14, Can I respond now?,8
40152,Leonard,14, Do it.,8
40153,Sheldon,14," You mess with the bull, you get the horns. I‰Ûªm about to show this guy just how horny I can be.",8
40154,Leonard,14, Somebody else do it.,8
40155,Scene,14, Penny‰Ûªs apartment.,8
40156,Penny (on television),14," Doctor, please help me. I think I might be turning into a killer gorilla.",8
40157,Doctor,14, Why do you think you‰Ûªre turning into a killer gorilla and not just a regular gorilla?,8
40158,Penny (on television),14," Because regular gorillas are vegetarians, and I just bit the fingers off your receptionist.",8
40159,Penny,14," Okay, we‰Ûªve seen plenty.",8
40160,Bernadette,14," No, give me the remote.",8
40161,Amy,14, Careful. She‰Ûªll bite your fingers off.,8
40162,Penny,14," Okay, well, I‰Ûªve been poking around the internet, and I think I found something we‰Ûªll enjoy watching even more.",8
40163,Amy,14, What is it?,8
40164,Penny,14," Oh, just a video of Bernadette in a beauty pageant.",8
40165,Amy,14, What?,8
40166,Bernadette,14," Okay, I learned my lesson. Making fun of people is wrong.",8
40167,Amy,14, I haven‰Ûªt learned my lesson. Play it. Play it.,8
40168,Bernadette (on screen),14," Hi. I‰Ûªm Bernadette Maryann Rostenkowski from Yorba Linda, California.",8
40169,Penny,14, You look like a talking cupcake.,8
40170,Bernadette (on screen),14," And you should pick me for Miss California Quiznos 1999, because I want to (singing) tell you what I want, what I really really want, l tell you what I want, what I really really want, I wanna, I wanna, I wanna, I wanna Really, really, really be Miss California Quiznos 1999.",8
40171,Amy,14, Play it again. Play it again.,8
40172,Scene,14, The apartment. ,8
40173,Raj,14, Did he respond yet?,8
40174,Sheldon,14," Hmm. No, not yet.",8
40175,Leonard,14," Well, maybe we shouldn‰Ûªt have sunk to his level.",8
40176,Howard,14, It wasn‰Ûªt that bad.,8
40177,Leonard,14, Read it back one more time.,8
40178,Sheldon,14," My good sir, we are neither crackpots nor wannabes. In fact, we are experts in our fields. And while you hide behind your anonymity, we stand behind our paper. And later tonight, your mother.",8
40179,Leonard,14, And you don‰Ûªt think that‰Ûªs too rough?,8
40180,Sheldon,14, We‰Ûªre just standing behind her. It‰Ûªs not like we‰Ûªre gonna say boo and scare her.,8
40181,Scene,14, Penny‰Ûªs apartment. ,8
40182,Penny,14, How could you not tell us you were in beauty pageants?,8
40183,Bernadette,14, ‰Û÷Cause it‰Ûªs embarrassing.,8
40184,Penny,14, It is; it truly is.,8
40185,Bernadette,14," Yeah, well, Amy writes Little House on the Prairie fan fiction about herself and posts it on the Internet.",8
40186,Penny,14, No.,8
40187,Amy,14, Why? What did I do?,8
40188,Bernadette,14," Sorry, I had to get the spotlight off me, and tearing down other women is part of my pageant training.",8
40189,Penny,14, Okay. We are reading that right now.,8
40190,Amy,14," No, please don‰Ûªt.",8
40191,Bernadette,14, We got embarrassed tonight. Come on.,8
40192,Amy,14, But it‰Ûªs personal.,8
40193,Penny,14, Why? Is it about you and Sheldon?,8
40194,Amy,14, No.,8
40195,Penny,14," Oh, my God, it‰Ûªs about her and Sheldon.",8
40196,Amy,14," It‰Ûªs not about me and Sheldon. It‰Ûªs about a young woman in the 1800s named Amelia, and the time-traveling physicist named Cooper she falls in love with.",8
40197,Penny,14, Please show us?,8
40198,Bernadette,14, Please?,8
40199,Amy,14, No.,8
40200,Penny,14, You know I‰Ûªm gonna read it either way.,8
40201,Amy,14, Good luck finding it.,8
40202,Penny,14," Amelia and the time-trav‰Û_ found it. It was just past dawn on the prairie, and like every morning, Amelia prepared to do her chores. Except something about this morning felt different.",8
40203,Bernadette,14, Why? Why did it feel different?,8
40204,Penny,14," Maybe it was the first whisper of winter in the air, or maybe it was the unconscious handsome man with porcelain skin and curious clothing she was about to discover lying in the field. A man who would open her mind to new possibilities and her body to new feelings.",8
40205,Amy,14," You know, there was a time when I was alone and had no friends. I‰Ûªm starting to miss that.",8
40206,Scene,14, The apartment. ,8
40207,Sheldon,14, He still hasn‰Ûªt responded. What‰Ûªs taking him so long?,8
40208,Leonard,14, Do you really want him to write back?,8
40209,Sheldon,14," Yeah, I do. Then no matter how he responds, I am going to destroy him with a picture of a bored cat saying oh, really?",8
40210,Leonard,14, Me-wow.,8
40211,Howard,14, What are you doing?,8
40212,Raj,14," I‰Ûªve, uh, created some other user accounts so I can post positive comments about their paper.",8
40213,Howard,14, This wee li‰Ûªl bairn of a theory nearly blew my kilt off.,8
40214,Raj,14, No. You have to read it how Dr. Angus McDougal of the University of Edinburgh would. This wee li‰Ûªl bairn of a theory nearly blew me kilt off.,8
40215,Sheldon,14," He wrote back. Cooper and Hofstadter resorting to juvenile attempts at humour is proof they have nothing to back up their ridiculous paper. It should come as no surprise given they work at Cal Tech, essentially a technical school, where even the physicists are basically engineers. Engineers? Do you know how insulting that is?",8
40216,Howard,14, Yes.,8
40217,Raj,14," Guys, this person‰Ûªs just going out of their way to get a rise out of you.",8
40218,Sheldon,14," Yeah, but it‰Ûªs still so aggravating.",8
40219,Raj,14," Yeah, well, all the other comments said really nice things. Focus on those.",8
40220,Howard,14," Yeah. Dr. Dmitri Plancovik of Moscow University said dis paper great, I love it more than wodka.",8
40221,Raj,14, See? Better with the accent.,8
40222,Sheldon,14, And send.,8
40223,Leonard,14, What did you write?,8
40224,Sheldon,14, I‰Ûªm done hiding from bullies. I‰Ûªm taking this into the real world.,8
40225,Leonard,14, What does that mean?,8
40226,Sheldon,14," I told him we‰Ûªll meet him face-to-face anytime, anywhere.",8
40227,Leonard,14, Are you crazy? You don‰Ûªt know who this person is. Delete that.,8
40228,Raj,14," Come on, Sheldon!",8
40229,Sheldon,14," Oh, okay, okay, calm down. (Skype tone) It‰Ûªs him. He‰Ûªs trying to video chat. Perhaps I shouldn‰Ûªt have taken this into the real world.",8
40230,Leonard,14," Oh, really?",8
40231,Scene,14, Penny‰Ûªs apartment. ,8
40232,Penny,14," ‰ÛÏTime travel? I don‰Ûªt understand,‰Û said Amelia. Cooper stared at her. ‰Û÷Which word don‰Ûªt you understand, time or travel?‰Û",8
40233,Bernadette,14," Wow, even in your fantasies Sheldon‰Ûªs kind of exhausting.",8
40234,Amy,14," He‰Ûªs like that in the beginning, so she can change him. It‰Ûªs called good writing. And wishful thinking.",8
40235,Penny,14," It stung Amelia when he spoke to her this way. In her little one-room schoolhouse, she was always the smartest student, regularly besting the boys in her class, but this was no boy in front of her, this was a man.",8
40236,Bernadette,14, Here we go.,8
40237,Penny,14," Cooper told Amelia about all the strange and incredible things the future would hold, like computers and living past 30. He asked her if she had any questions. All she longed to ask was if his heart was beating as fast as hers, but she was too afraid to hear the answer.",8
40238,Bernadette,14," Oh, Amelia.",8
40239,Penny,14," So instead she asked if, in the future, Montana ever became a state.",8
40240,Amy,14, In the 1800s that was considered flirting.,8
40241,Scene,14, The apartment. ,8
40242,Raj,14, I‰Ûªm so sick of people being mean on the Internet.,8
40243,Howard,14," Well, I think the anonymity makes everyone feel like they can say things they‰Ûªd never say to your face.",8
40244,Sheldon,14, Interesting. I can‰Ûªt think of a single thing I wouldn‰Ûªt say to someone‰Ûªs face.,8
40245,Leonard,14, Never noticed that about you.,8
40246,Raj,14," You know what? At least you guys did something. You know, you, you had a theory, you wrote a paper, you made an actual contribution. All guys like this do is just stand on other people‰Ûªs work.",8
40247,Sheldon,14, He‰Ûªs right. I say we call this person back. We‰Ûªve got no reason to hide.,8
40248,Leonard,14," All right, do it. Call him. Let‰Ûªs find out what this loser‰Ûªs ever accomplished.",8
40249,Sheldon,14," Click it with me. One, two, three, click.",8
40250,Stephen Hawking,14," Well, hello there.",8
40251,Sheldon,14, Professor Hawking?,8
40252,Stephen Hawking,14," Oh, brother, you should see the look on your faces.",8
40253,Leonard,14, You really didn‰Ûªt like our paper?,8
40254,Stephen Hawking,14, I like your paper very much. The premise is intriguing.,8
40255,Sheldon,14, Then why are you attacking us?,8
40256,Stephen Hawking,14," If you were sitting in a chair for 40 years, you‰Ûªd get bored, too. Anyway, got to go. I promised to help the neighbour kid with his maths homework. Ciao.",8
40257,Leonard,14, Stephen Hawking liked our paper. Said the premise is intriguing.,8
40258,Sheldon,14," Good to see you again, Mr. Stephen-Hawking Liked-Our-Paper.",8
40259,Leonard,14," And you as well, Mr. Our-Premise-Is-Intriguing.",8
40260,Howard,14," How do you do, Mr. I‰Ûªll-Admit-That‰Ûªs-Pretty-Cool?",8
40261,Raj,14," Yeah, you keep setting me up for failure.",8
40262,Scene,14, Penny‰Ûªs apartment. ,8
40263,Penny,14," With a heavy heart, Amelia stood before the newly repaired time machine. She regretted giving Cooper the part he needed.",8
40264,Bernadette,14, Because she wanted him to give her the part she needed.,8
40265,Amy,14," Okay, that‰Ûªs enough.",8
40266,Penny,14," What? No, I really want to know what happens, and Bernadette really, really, really wants to know what happens.",8
40267,Amy,14, You‰Ûªre just making fun of me.,8
40268,Bernadette,14, I was just kidding. I‰Ûªm sorry. And the story‰Ûªs really good.,8
40269,Penny,14," No, it is. Does he stay? Do they kiss? Does she find out about Montana?",8
40270,Bernadette,14, Please?,8
40271,Amy,14," Fine. As Cooper prepared to depart, tears filled Amelia‰Ûªs eyes. He took her hand in his and said, ‰ÛÏI can‰Ûªt stay, but I will never forget you.‰Û He brushed his fingers against her cheek, then quickly stepped into the machine. ‰ÛÏPlease don‰Ûªt go,‰Û she whispered. But it was too late. The engine hummed to life.",8
40272,Bernadette,14, But they didn‰Ûªt even kiss.,8
40273,Amy,14," She turned away, wiping her eyes. She couldn‰Ûªt bear to watch her one chance at true love disappear forever. Then she felt a strong hand on her shoulder spin her around. It was Cooper.",8
40274,Penny,14, Yes.,8
40275,Amy,14," ‰ÛÏWhat about the future?‰Û asked Amelia. He looked deeply into her eyes and whispered, ‰ÛÏThere is no future without you.‰Û He pulled her in close. She began to tremble all over. She felt his warm breath‰Û_",8
40276,Leonard,14, You will not believe what Stephen Hawking just said.,8
40277,Penny,14, Get out!,8
40278,Bernadette,14, Not now!,8
40279,Scene,14, An 1800‰Ûªs house. ,8
40280,Amelia,14, Is the water warm enough?,8
40281,Cooper,14," Given the fact that you took the time to build a wood fire, draw the water from the well and heat it, it would be rude to complain. But since you asked, it‰Ûªs a little nippy.",8
40282,Amelia,14, I can fix that. I couldn‰Ûªt help but notice your unusual undergarments.,8
40283,Cooper,14," They‰Ûªre not undergarments. They‰Ûªre Underoos. Where I come from, they‰Ûªre known as underwear that‰Ûªs fun to wear.",8
40284,Amelia,14, And what‰Ûªs the significance of the spider?,8
40285,Cooper,14," Oh, that represents Spider-Man. He does whatever a spider can.",8
40286,Amelia,14," There‰Ûªs a lot of rhyming in the future, isn‰Ûªt there?",8
40287,Leonard (in bed),14, You‰Ûªre right. This is even weirder than I thought.,8
40288,Penny,14, You want me to stop reading?,8
40289,Leonard,14," Are you kidding? No, no.",8
40290,Penny,14, As he stood for Amelia to dry him‰Û_,8
40291,Amelia,14," So, tell me, Cooper, are the ways of physical love different in the future?",8
40292,Leonard,14," Yeah, okay, I‰Ûªm good.",8
40293,Scene,15, Amy‰Ûªs laboratory.,8
40294,Sheldon,15," I‰Ûªve invented a science joke, would you like to hear it?",8
40295,Amy,15, Sure.,8
40296,Sheldon,15, How many Edisons does it take to screw in a light bulb?,8
40297,Amy,15, How many?,8
40298,Sheldon,15, Who cares? He stole the idea and doesn‰Ûªt deserve his own joke.,8
40299,Amy,15, Is that really true?,8
40300,Sheldon,15," Of course, that‰Ûªs how you know it‰Ûªs a good joke. It not only entertains, it informs.",8
40301,Barry,15," Hey, sowwy to intewupt.",8
40302,Sheldon,15," Uh, Barry, uh, how many Edisons does it take to screw in a light bulb?",8
40303,Barry,15, Did you know Edison didn‰Ûªt actuawy invent the wight bulb?,8
40304,Sheldon,15," What do you want, Barry?",8
40305,Barry,15, Just wanted to dwop this off as a wittle thank you for Amy.,8
40306,Amy,15, What‰Ûªs this for?,8
40307,Barry,15, Your idea weawy hewped me out. My wight-cone quantization paper‰Ûªs onwine alweady. The wesponse has been amazing.,8
40308,Amy,15," Well, that‰Ûªs fascinating. I can‰Ûªt wait to read it.",8
40309,Sheldon,15," Oh, no, me as well. Uh, please e-mail it to Sheldon at bazinga dot biz. Why dot biz? Because I just gave you the business. And also bazinga dot com was taken.",8
40310,Barry,15," Anyway, thanks again. Cooper, suck eggs.",8
40311,Sheldon,15, Since when do you help out Barry Kripke?,8
40312,Amy,15," Well, I‰Ûªd been thinking about a cellular automata approach to neuronal connectivity, and I thought it might have some interesting applications to string theory, it‰Ûªs not a big deal.",8
40313,Sheldon,15," Oh, really? When I was doing string theory and hit a dead end, why didn‰Ûªt you try to help me?",8
40314,Amy,15," I did. You said the only math biologists know is if you have three frogs and one hops away, that leaves two frogs.",8
40315,Sheldon,15," That‰Ûªs pretty funny, that does sound like me. But that doesn‰Ûªt mean that you should be standing on street corners handing out your math to whatever guy comes along.",8
40316,Amy,15," Sheldon, we‰Ûªre all scientists. I helped out a fellow colleague. You‰Ûªre being petty.",8
40317,Sheldon,15," I‰Ûªm being petty? You know Barry and I have a professional rivalry. You heard him, he told me to suck eggs. If we were friends, he would have suggested I suck something more pleasant. Why are you laughing? Did you learn something?",8
40318,Scene,15, Howard and Bernadette‰Ûªs apartment.,8
40319,Howard (on phone),15," Okay, Ma. Say hi to Aunt Gladys. Yeah, I love you, too. Bye.",8
40320,Bernadette,15, Your mom having fun in Florida?,8
40321,Howard,15," Mmm, she loves it. She finally found a place where everyone talks about how sweaty they are. Anyway, she wants us to go to the house and check in on Stuart because he might be lonely.",8
40322,Bernadette,15, She‰Ûªs just being nice.,8
40323,Howard,15," Well, I‰Ûªm her son, how come she doesn‰Ûªt send someone to check on me if I‰Ûªm lonely?",8
40324,Bernadette,15, Because you have a wife.,8
40325,Howard,15," Yeah, well, sometimes you work late.",8
40326,Bernadette,15," I know you don‰Ûªt like Stuart being in the house, but the store‰Ûªs about to reopen, I‰Ûªm sure he‰Ûªll get back on his feet.",8
40327,Howard,15, That would be great. I‰Ûªd love for things between me and Mom to get back to normal.,8
40328,Bernadette,15," Well, normal‰Ûªs a strong word, but sure.",8
40329,Scene,15, The laundry room.,8
40330,Penny,15, Hey.,8
40331,Sheldon,15, Hello.,8
40332,Penny,15, You okay?,8
40333,Sheldon,15," If I was okay, I would‰Ûªve said hello, and not the much more ominous hello.",8
40334,Penny,15, What‰Ûªs going on?,8
40335,Sheldon,15, I‰Ûªm mad at Amy.,8
40336,Penny,15," Did she leave pit stains in your favourite crop top, too?",8
40337,Sheldon,15, No. She helped Barry Kripke make an advancement in string theory.,8
40338,Penny,15," Oh, that sounds like a good thing.",8
40339,Sheldon,15," Well, it would be, except that I left string theory because I decided it was a dead end. Yeah, and then she went behind my back to help someone else prove me wrong. My rival, no less. I‰Ûªm sorry you had to see that.",8
40340,Penny,15, I‰Ûªm sorry I didn‰Ûªt have a camera.,8
40341,Sheldon,15, Why would she do this to me?,8
40342,Penny,15," Well, I‰Ûªm sure she didn‰Ûªt upset you on purpose. Besides, aren‰Ûªt you the one who says there‰Ûªs nothing more important than the advancement of science?",8
40343,Sheldon,15," No, I said there‰Ûªs nothing more important than me advancing science.",8
40344,Penny,15," All right, well, if I‰Ûªm understanding this right, and all she did was help out another scientist, I‰Ûªm thinking you might have to let this one go.",8
40345,Sheldon,15," Ugh, let it go. I have heard that my whole life. Every time something upsets me somebody says, let it go, you know, like it‰Ûªs my fault, and it‰Ûªs not okay to feel the way I feel.",8
40346,Penny,15," I don‰Ûªt know what to tell you. I mean, why don‰Ûªt you talk to her?",8
40347,Sheldon,15," Is that all you have? Shopworn tidbits like talk to her and let it go? Gee, Penny, life‰Ûªs giving me lemons. What should I do?",8
40348,Penny,15," Well, you could shove them somewhere.",8
40349,Sheldon,15," Okay, now you‰Ûªre getting creative.",8
40350,Scene,15, The comic book store. ,8
40351,Stuart,15, Thanks again for your help.,8
40352,Leonard,15, No problem.,8
40353,Raj,15, Our pleasure.,8
40354,Leonard,15, The place really looks great.,8
40355,Raj,15," Yeah, you should have burned it down years ago.",8
40356,Stuart,15, I keep telling you I didn‰Ûªt burn it down.,8
40357,Leonard,15," We know, we know, because burning something down for the insurance money is a crime.",8
40358,Bernadette,15," Stuart, this place looks amazing.",8
40359,Stuart,15, Thanks.,8
40360,Howard,15, You really did a nice job.,8
40361,Stuart,15, And thank you for putting up with me staying at your mom‰Ûªs through all this. I couldn‰Ûªt have done it otherwise.,8
40362,Howard,15," I appreciate that, and I‰Ûªm glad you were able to‰Û_ is that my mother‰Ûªs furniture?",8
40363,Stuart,15," Yeah, she said I could use it. Doesn‰Ûªt it look great?",8
40364,Howard,15, Not as great as it looks in the den where it belongs.,8
40365,Bernadette,15, Howie.,8
40366,Howard,15, Why don‰Ûªt you just clean out the whole room? Take the string art clown I made her in third grade and the ribbon I got in swim class for putting my face in the water.,8
40367,Stuart,15, What is your problem? She said it was okay.,8
40368,Howard,15," Well, I‰Ûªm her son, and I say it‰Ûªs not okay.",8
40369,Stuart,15," Some son, looks like you spent ten minutes on that clown art.",8
40370,Howard,15," Well, maybe I should‰Ûªve gone to a fancy art school like you. Then I could run a failed comic shop and mooch off some guy‰Ûªs mother.",8
40371,Bernadette,15, Why don‰Ûªt we leave so you can cool off?,8
40372,Stuart,15, I think that‰Ûªs a good idea. Take him out of my store.,8
40373,Howard,15, Your store? My mother gave you the money to reopen. I‰Ûªm not going anywhere.,8
40374,Leonard,15, Why don‰Ûªt we go get the food for the party.,8
40375,Stuart,15, Thank you.,8
40376,Raj,15," Smart, looks like we‰Ûªre being helpful.",8
40377,Leonard,15," Mmm, when really we‰Ûªre just exiting an uncomfortable situation.",8
40378,Scene,15, Penny‰Ûªs apartment.,8
40379,Sheldon,15," Kripke, you know, of all the people, Barry Kripke. I‰Ûªm so‰Û_ Are you folding that like a crazy person to get me to do it for you?",8
40380,Penny,15, No.,8
40381,Sheldon,15," Oh, give me that. Just out of curiosity, if I were to let something go, how would I do that?",8
40382,Penny,15," I don‰Ûªt know, just think about something else.",8
40383,Sheldon,15, Can I think about the spiny anteater?,8
40384,Penny,15, Sure.,8
40385,Sheldon,15, The spiny anteater never went behind my back and worked with Barry Kripke. That didn‰Ûªt help at all.,8
40386,Penny,15," You know, some people try visualization.",8
40387,Sheldon,15, How does that work?,8
40388,Penny,15," Okay, imagine your problems are a pen.",8
40389,Sheldon,15, Okay.,8
40390,Penny,15, Now imagine you‰Ûªre holding that pen.,8
40391,Sheldon,15, Okay.,8
40392,Penny,15, Now open your hand and let it go.,8
40393,Sheldon,15, But I just got this pen. It‰Ûªs got my initials on it and everything. Look.,8
40394,Penny,15," Sheldon, this isn‰Ûªt that hard.",8
40395,Sheldon,15, I may have a better way that you can teach me.,8
40396,Penny,15, How?,8
40397,Sheldon,15, What if I told you that over the past few months Amy has secretly been giving you little puzzles to test your intelligence against chimpanzees in her lab?,8
40398,Penny,15, What? She didn‰Ûªt give me any puzzles.,8
40399,Sheldon,15, Are you sure?,8
40400,Amy (in flashback),15," Boy, I just can‰Ûªt seem to get these scissors back together. Can you do it?",8
40401,Amy (in flashback),15," Darn it. There‰Ûªs something in my eye, and I need to sort these coins by size. Can you help?",8
40402,Amy (in flashback),15," Penny? I really want to eat this banana, but it‰Ûªs stuck inside this bamboo puzzle box.",8
40403,Penny,15, Son of a bitch.,8
40404,Sheldon,15," Okay, that‰Ûªs great. Now, let it go.",8
40405,Penny,15, I can‰Ûªt believe you were testing me against a chimp.,8
40406,Sheldon,15," Well, excuse me, Amy was testing you. I was rooting for you. Good job on that banana box, by the way.",8
40407,Penny,15, Why would she even do this?,8
40408,Sheldon,15," She‰Ûªs been conducting an experiment on apes where they‰Ûªre given various puzzles to solve. I was surprised at the complexity of the puzzles and thought some humans wouldn‰Ûªt be able to solve them. That‰Ûªs when Amy said, want to make this interesting?",8
40409,Penny,15, Make this interesting? You bet money on me?,8
40410,Sheldon,15," No, no. We designed an experiment involving you. See? Now, isn‰Ûªt that interesting?",8
40411,Penny,15, It‰Ûªs not interesting. It‰Ûªs incredibly insulting.,8
40412,Sheldon,15," Okay, maybe this will help. Imagine you‰Ûªre holding a pen. Before you go too far, not a special pen with your initials engraved on it, that‰Ûªll make the next part really hard.",8
40413,Penny,15," Oh, my, that‰Ûªs it. Get out.",8
40414,Sheldon,15," I don‰Ûªt understand why you‰Ûªre mad at me. You should be mad at Amy. Like I was this afternoon. Hey, look at that, I let it go.",8
40415,Penny,15, Get out.,8
40416,Sheldon,15, Penny?,8
40417,Penny,15, What?,8
40418,Sheldon,15, I think I left my pen in there.,8
40419,Scene,15, The comic book store. ,8
40420,Bernadette,15," I understand why you‰Ûªre upset, but he worked really hard to get the store ready. And it‰Ûªs just furniture.",8
40421,Howard,15," It‰Ûªs my mom‰Ûªs furniture. It belongs in the house I grew up in, next to that pile of TV Guides and in plain view of what, for a ten-year-old, was a quality piece of string art.",8
40422,Bernadette,15," Howie, if the store succeeds, Stuart has a source of income, and he can move out of your mother‰Ûªs house. Seems like some old furniture is a reasonable price to pay for that.",8
40423,Howard,15, That is a good point. But I didn‰Ûªt marry you for good points. I married you to blindly support me no matter how ridiculous I‰Ûªm being.,8
40424,Bernadette,15, This is why I had to rewrite our wedding vows.,8
40425,Scene,15, A deli.,8
40426,Leonard,15," Hi, we‰Ûªre here to pick up an order for Comic Center.",8
40427,Waitress,15," Sure, let me go check on that.",8
40428,Raj,15," Dude, I, I think that‰Ûªs Nathan Fillion.",8
40429,Leonard,15," Oh yeah, look at that.",8
40430,Raj,15," And he‰Ûªs picking the tomatoes out of his salad just like I do. I always did feel a connection with him. Oh, I have got an idea.",8
40431,Leonard,15, We‰Ûªre not selling his tomatoes on eBay.,8
40432,Raj,15," No, if we got Captain Reynolds from Firefly to do a signing at Stuart‰Ûªs store, that would be amazing.",8
40433,Leonard,15, That would be great.,8
40434,Raj,15, So should we go talk to him?,8
40435,Leonard,15," I don‰Ûªt know. I mean, if he‰Ûªs not nice, it‰Ûªs gonna make it hard for me to watch him in anything again.",8
40436,Raj,15," What? The, the guy who plays Jon Snow was a jerk. We still watch Game of Thrones.",8
40437,Leonard,15, He was a jerk because you rear-ended him.,8
40438,Raj,15," I was distracted. It‰Ûªs weird seeing a member of the Night‰Ûªs Watch with a kayak strapped to his car. Come on. Hi, excuse me, s, sorry, I, I don‰Ûªt mean to bother you, but we‰Ûªre just really big fans of Firefly. And Dr. Horrible.",8
40439,Nathan Fillion,15," Oh, uh, I think you made a mistake. I‰Ûªm not an actor.",8
40440,Raj,15," Don‰Ûªt say that. I mean, you‰Ûªre not Dame Judi Dench, but you‰Ûªre pretty great.",8
40441,Nathan Fillion,15," Oh, yeah, I get it, you think I‰Ûªm Nathan Fillion, but I‰Ûªm not. So if you don‰Ûªt mind, I would just love to eat my lunch.",8
40442,Leonard,15, Come on. Sorry to bother you.,8
40443,Raj,15," Don‰Ûªt know why he‰Ûªs so grumpy. I got mistaken for that guy in Life of Pi once, and I‰Ûªm still floating.",8
40444,Scene,15, The hallway.,8
40445,Amy,15," Sheldon, it‰Ûªs me.",8
40446,Penny,15," Oh, hey. Did you see that? I, I figured out how to open the door all by myself. Maybe I‰Ûªll fling some faeces around my cage to celebrate.",8
40447,Amy,15, What are you talking about?,8
40448,Penny,15, I know you‰Ûªve been giving me secret puzzle tests.,8
40449,Amy,15," Sheldon, open the door.",8
40450,Sheldon,15, I can‰Ûªt. I‰Ûªm naked.,8
40451,Amy,15, I just saw you.,8
40452,Sheldon,15, Hang on.,8
40453,Penny,15, Open the door now.,8
40454,Amy,15," Oh, hey.",8
40455,Penny,15, Pull up your pants.,8
40456,Amy,15," It‰Ûªs not a big deal. I run tests like this on undergrads all the time. If you fill out some paperwork at the university, I can get you five dollars.",8
40457,Penny,15, I don‰Ûªt want five dollars. I want my dignity.,8
40458,Amy,15," So what are we talking, like, ten bucks?",8
40459,Scene,15, The deli.,8
40460,Leonard,15, Thank you.,8
40461,Raj,15, Thanks.,8
40462,Leonard,15, Sorry again.,8
40463,Nathan Fillion,15, No problem.,8
40464,Raj,15," Are you sure you‰Ûªre not him? Uh, you can tell us. We‰Ûªre scientists, not crazy fanboys.",8
40465,Nathan Fillion,15," All right, fine. I‰Ûªm him.",8
40466,Raj,15," And you‰Ûªre eating alone at a deli. I don‰Ûªt buy it, you‰Ûªre not him.",8
40467,Nathan Fillion,15," I just wanted to eat my lunch in peace. But I really am him. And thank you very much for being a fan. If you want, uh, let‰Ûªs take a picture.",8
40468,Leonard,15, That would be great.,8
40469,Raj,15, Great.,8
40470,Leonard,15," Yeah, thank you.",8
40471,Nathan Fillion,15, You bet.,8
40472,Raj,15," Wait, hang on. If you‰Ûªre really Nathan Fillion, what‰Ûªs the line from Firefly about your bonnet?",8
40473,Nathan Fillion,15," I swear by my pretty floral bonnet, I will end you.",8
40474,Leonard,15," That‰Ûªs it, that‰Ûªs the line.",8
40475,Raj,15," Although, I knew the line, doesn‰Ûªt make me Nathan Fillion.",8
40476,Nathan Fillion,15, Do you want the picture or not?,8
40477,Raj,15, I want a picture with Nathan Fillion.,8
40478,Nathan,15, How about a picture with a guy who looks like Nathan Fillion but a little more annoyed than Nathan Fillion usually is?,8
40479,Leonard,15, What do you think?,8
40480,Raj,15," Ah, it‰Ûªs good enough for Facebook.",8
40481,Scene,15, The comic book store.,8
40482,Leonard,15, I can‰Ûªt believe they did that.,8
40483,Penny,15," I know, it‰Ûªs so insulting. At one point, they had me figure out how to get a banana out of a puzzle box.",8
40484,Leonard,15," Wait, Sheldon gave me a banana in a box. He was testing me, too.",8
40485,Penny,15, Unbelievable.,8
40486,Leonard,15, And how could a chimp even solve that? That was impossible.,8
40487,Penny,15, Really? You couldn‰Ûªt get it out?,8
40488,Sheldon,15, Thank you.,8
40489,Amy,15," Wow, the store looks great.",8
40490,Leonard,15, So you guys were testing us both? What is the matter with you?,8
40491,Penny,15," Eh, what‰Ûªs the matter with them is they think they‰Ûªre so smart they don‰Ûªt care if they hurt other people‰Ûªs feelings.",8
40492,Amy,15, That‰Ûªs not true.,8
40493,Sheldon,15, That sounds like us. I still don‰Ûªt understand why you‰Ûªre upset. You solved every puzzle faster than all of the chimps.,8
40494,Amy,15," Well, except Barnabas, but he was on Adderall.",8
40495,Howard,15," I‰Ûªm sorry, but it‰Ûªs making me crazy.",8
40496,Bernadette,15, Can you please just let it go?,8
40497,Sheldon,15," Oh, I can help you with that. Imagine you‰Ûªre holding an ordinary pen. While your favourite pen is safe and secure in your pocket.",8
40498,Howard,15, Hold that thought. (On phone) Hello?,8
40499,Amy,15, How can I make this up to you?,8
40500,Penny,15, The answer‰Ûªs in this puzzle box. Let‰Ûªs see if you can open it.,8
40501,Stuart,15, You could have at least warned him about the furniture.,8
40502,Raj,15, That‰Ûªs what I said when we moved it.,8
40503,Bernadette,15, You helped him?,8
40504,Raj,15," No, Stuart picked out those throw pillows all on his own.",8
40505,Leonard,15," Hey, you okay?",8
40506,Howard,15, No.,8
40507,Leonard,15, What‰Ûªs wrong?,8
40508,Howard,15, My mom died.,8
40509,Bernadette,15, What?,8
40510,Howard,15," Uh, that was my aunt. Ma took a nap. She never woke up.",8
40511,Bernadette,15," Oh, my God, Howie.",8
40512,Leonard,15, I‰Ûªm so sorry.,8
40513,Raj,15, What can we do?,8
40514,Howard,15, I don‰Ûªt know.,8
40515,Sheldon,15, May I say something?,8
40516,Leonard,15," Not right now, Sheldon.",8
40517,Sheldon,15, But I think it would be comforting.,8
40518,Leonard,15, Buddy.,8
40519,Howard,15," No, it‰Ûªs okay. What?",8
40520,Sheldon,15," When I lost my own father, I didn‰Ûªt have any friends to help me through it. You do.",8
40521,Penny,15, I really thought he was gonna say let it go.,8
40522,Scene,15, The apartment.,8
40523,Raj (on phone),15," Okay, thanks, Bernadette. Travel safe. Okay, bye. Well, they‰Ûªve booked a flight. They‰Ûªre heading to the airport now.",8
40524,Penny,15, How‰Ûªs Howard holding up?,8
40525,Raj,15, He‰Ûªs hanging in there.,8
40526,Leonard,15," How are you doing, Stuart?",8
40527,Stuart,15," Still can‰Ûªt believe she‰Ûªs gone. I mean, that woman took me in. If it wasn‰Ûªt for her, I, I would have been homeless.",8
40528,Amy,15, One of us would have taken you in.,8
40529,Stuart,15," Yeah, I don‰Ûªt recall any offers. But, you know what, uh, I, I‰Ûªm glad it worked out the way it did because I got to know this wonderful person.",8
40530,Raj,15," Yeah. Mrs. Wolowitz was pretty special. When I first moved to America, Howard was my only friend and she made me feel so welcome in her home. Which says a lot, because, those first few years, she thought I was the gardener.",8
40531,Penny,15," Whenever I saw her, she‰Ûªd say I was too skinny and try and feed me.",8
40532,Amy,15," She did that to me, too.",8
40533,Penny,15, Don‰Ûªt take this away from me.,8
40534,Sheldon,15," I didn‰Ûªt care for her yelling. But now that I‰Ûªm not going to hear it again, I‰Ûªm sad.",8
40535,Leonard,15," If you want, I can yell at you later.",8
40536,Sheldon,15, It won‰Ûªt be as good.,8
40537,Leonard,15, Let‰Ûªs have a toast. To Mrs. Wolowitz. A loving mother to all of us. We‰Ûªll miss you.,8
40538,Scene,16, The apartment.,8
40539,Amy,16, I just read about an experiment designed to see if you could make two people fall in love in a matter of hours.,8
40540,Leonard,16, That doesn‰Ûªt sound right. My research has shown that it takes three to five years of shameless begging.,8
40541,Penny,16," Honey, neither of us comes off good in that story.",8
40542,Raj,16," Yeah, I, I, I saw that article you‰Ûªre talking about. Uh, the participants ask each other a series of questions designed to promote intimacy.",8
40543,Amy,16, And then they finish it off by staring into each other‰Ûªs eyes for four minutes.,8
40544,Sheldon,16," Oh, that‰Ûªs nonsense. I proclaimed my love for you. And the last time I looked into your eyes was when you thought you had conjunctivitis.",8
40545,Amy,16," Other than the fact that I had it, that was a magical night.",8
40546,Penny,16," Raj, would you ever try an experiment like that with Emily?",8
40547,Raj,16, What? I don‰Ûªt need science to win her heart. I have my family‰Ûªs wealth for that.,8
40548,Leonard,16," I‰Ûªm telling you, you can‰Ûªt create love in a few hours. Right?",8
40549,Penny,16," Oh, careful. You‰Ûªre poking at the whole foundation of The Bachelor.",8
40550,Sheldon,16," Yeah, but we don‰Ûªt have to debate this. We‰Ûªre scientists. We can conduct our own research. I propose that we imprison two street people and‰Û_",8
40551,Amy,16, No.,8
40552,Sheldon,16, You didn‰Ûªt even let me finish.,8
40553,Amy,16, Forget it.,8
40554,Sheldon,16," So, you can experiment on all the apes you want. But I want to manipulate the emotions of two captive human beings, suddenly I‰Ûªm the monster.",8
40555,Raj,16, Why don‰Ûªt you just do the test?,8
40556,Sheldon,16," In the interest of science, I‰Ûªd be willing to.",8
40557,Penny,16, What? You‰Ûªre okay with an experiment where you have to answer awkward questions about your innermost feelings?,8
40558,Sheldon,16, Yes.,8
40559,Penny,16," Please, can I do it with him? Please?",8
40560,Leonard,16," I‰Ûªve been listening to Sheldon‰Ûªs feelings on things for ten years. Tag, you‰Ûªre it.",8
40561,Raj,16," Yeah, but what if the experiment works?",8
40562,Penny,16, I‰Ûªm not gonna fall in love with Sheldon.,8
40563,Amy,16," That‰Ûªs what I said. Before I knew it, he pontificated his way right into my heart.",8
40564,Sheldon,16," Uh, fun fact, pontificate comes from the Latin word pontifex, which means bridge builder or Pope.",8
40565,Leonard,16, In love yet?,8
40566,Scene,16, The hallway. ,8
40567,Sheldon,16," Just out of curiosity, Penny, if this experiment does make us fall in love, would you drive me to Lake Geneva, Wisconsin for Gary Con? It‰Ûªs the only convention celebrating the life and work of Gary Gygax, the co-creator of Dungeons and Dragons.",8
40568,Penny,16," You know what? I can honestly say if we fall in love, not only will I drive you there, I will buy you all the dragon T-shirts you want.",8
40569,Sheldon,16," Okay, babe, let‰Ûªs do this.",8
40570,Scene,16, The apartment.,8
40571,Raj,16," You guys are really being calm about Penny and Sheldon doing this thing. If it were me I‰Ûªd, I‰Ûªd be a little nervous.",8
40572,Amy,16, Why?,8
40573,Raj,16," Well, even if the study‰Ûªs nonsense, I don‰Ûªt believe in tempting fate. Same reason I wouldn‰Ûªt use a Ouija board, or pick a fight with an Asian guy. He probably doesn‰Ûªt know karate, but why risk it?",8
40574,Amy,16, I think we‰Ûªre safe.,8
40575,Raj,16," Well, that‰Ûªs what the bullies at Bruce Lee‰Ûªs high school thought. And then, bam. Karate.",8
40576,Leonard,16," Well, are we just gonna sit here while they do the experiment?",8
40577,Amy,16, The two of us could do it.,8
40578,Leonard,16," Yeah, sure, that might be fun.",8
40579,Amy,16, What‰Ûªs the first question?,8
40580,Raj,16," Hang on. Okay. Given the choice of anyone in the world, whom would you want as a dinner guest?",8
40581,Leonard,16, Hmm. I can honestly say Penny.,8
40582,Amy,16," Oh, then I choose a janitor, ‰Ûªcause I‰Ûªm about to throw up.",8
40583,Leonard,16, I‰Ûªm in love. Let‰Ûªs do something else.,8
40584,Raj,16," Ooh, uh, Emily gets off work soon. Why don‰Ûªt the four of us go out?",8
40585,Leonard,16, Okay.,8
40586,Amy,16, Sounds good.,8
40587,Leonard,16, Should we call Howard and Bernadette?,8
40588,Raj,16," I don‰Ûªt know what time their plane gets in, but let me, let me shoot them a text.",8
40589,Amy,16, Did he say anything about the funeral?,8
40590,Raj,16," Not much, but he seemed to be in a pretty good place.",8
40591,Scene,16, An airport baggage desk.,8
40592,Howard,16, Are you kidding me? You lost my mother‰Ûªs ashes?,8
40593,Baggage Clerk,16," No, I‰Ûªm just saying that sometimes bags are misrouted.",8
40594,Howard,16," All right, fine. Where did you misroute the only woman who ever loved me? The first, well,",8
40595,Clerk,16," I just need some information. Uh, what‰Ûªs the flight number?",8
40596,Bernadette,16, Eight sixteen.,8
40597,Howard,16, I really did mean first.,8
40598,Bernadette,16, Just drop it.,8
40599,Clerk,16, And can you describe the bag?,8
40600,Bernadette,16," Um, well, it‰Ûªs, uh, black. There‰Ûªs a red ribbon tied to the handle.",8
40601,Howard,16, The world‰Ûªs greatest mom is in the shoe compartment.,8
40602,Scene,16, Penny‰Ûªs apartment.,8
40603,Sheldon,16, You ready to begin?,8
40604,Penny,16, Yup. Be right there. I assume you don‰Ûªt want wine.,8
40605,Sheldon,16, Correct. You‰Ûªre not supposed to drink alcohol when operating heavy machinery.,8
40606,Penny,16, What heavy machinery? Let‰Ûªs just start.,8
40607,Sheldon,16," Well, as a Texas gentleman, I‰Ûªm inclined to say ladies first. Although, I‰Ûªm concerned that level of politeness and charm might make you fall in love with me before the test even begins. Perhaps we should flip a coin. Or if you‰Ûªre familiar with the rules of Rock, Paper, Scissors‰Û_",8
40608,Penny,16," Question one. Given the choice of anyone in the world, whom would you want as a dinner guest?",8
40609,Sheldon,16, Hmm. Living or dead?,8
40610,Penny,16, Just says anyone in the world. I guess that means living.,8
40611,Sheldon,16," Ah, that‰Ûªs just as well. As much as I‰Ûªd love to meet Euclid, inventor of the geometric proof, he probably wore sandals and I cannot look at toes during dinner. Oh, I know, the person I‰Ûªd most like to have dinner with is myself.",8
40612,Penny,16, You sure that‰Ûªs your choice? ‰Û÷Cause I‰Ûªve had that dinner.,8
40613,Sheldon,16," Well, I haven‰Ûªt. And while they say never meet your heroes, I just don‰Ûªt see how I could disappoint. Who would you choose?",8
40614,Penny,16," Robert Downey, Jr.",8
40615,Sheldon,16," Oh, I didn‰Ûªt think of Iron Man. You know, maybe after myself and I have dinner, we can meet you two for dessert.",8
40616,Scene,16, Raj‰Ûªs car.,8
40617,Raj,16," So, what do you guys want to do?",8
40618,Amy,16," Well, we‰Ûªre the ones tagging along, you pick.",8
40619,Emily,16," Ooh, have you ever been to an escape room?",8
40620,Leonard,16, What‰Ûªs that?,8
40621,Emily,16," Um, it‰Ûªs kind of like interactive theatre, except you have to solve puzzles in a certain amount of time to get out. There‰Ûªs one downtown where they trap you in a room with a zombie.",8
40622,Raj,16," Oh, so kind of like what‰Ûªs happening with Penny right now.",8
40623,Scene,16, Penny‰Ûªs apartment.,8
40624,Sheldon,16, What would constitute a perfect day for you?,8
40625,Penny,16," Uh, well, I‰Ûªd probably sleep in, do a little yoga, then lie on the beach while cute cabana boys brought me drinks and probably get a massage and then cap off the night with some dancing.",8
40626,Sheldon,16, That‰Ûªs it?,8
40627,Penny,16," Yeah, why?",8
40628,Sheldon,16, You didn‰Ûªt mention Leonard.,8
40629,Penny,16, He‰Ûªs there.,8
40630,Sheldon,16," I don‰Ûªt think so. Leonard can‰Ûªt stand yoga, the beach, massages or dancing.",8
40631,Penny,16," Yeah, well, he brought a book, okay? What‰Ûªs yours?",8
40632,Sheldon,16," Uh, I wake up. Uh, I enjoy some French toast with butter and syrup. Uh, then a wormhole opens, and whisks me millions of years into the future where my towering intellect is used to save the last remnants of mankind from a predatory alien race.",8
40633,Penny,16," Interesting, you didn‰Ûªt mention Amy.",8
40634,Sheldon,16, Who do you think made the French toast with butter and syrup?,8
40635,Scene,16, An escape room.,8
40636,Woman in lab coat,16," You‰Ûªre about to enter the lab of the late Dr. David Saltzberg. While conducting studies on slowing the aging process, there was a catastrophic accident and he died. Or did he?",8
40637,Leonard,16, Ladies?,8
40638,Emily,16, Are you being polite or scared?,8
40639,Leonard,16, Yup.,8
40640,Emily,16," Ah, what a room!",8
40641,Amy,16, Oh.,8
40642,Leonard,16, This is cool.,8
40643,Amy,16," So, how do we start?",8
40644,Emily,16, We have to look for the clues hidden around the room.,8
40645,Raj,16," Uh, wasn‰Ûªt there supposed to be a zombie?",8
40646,Zombie,16, Uuuuuuuh!,8
40647,Raj,16," Ooh. Okay, let‰Ûªs hope one of the clues is written on a pair of clean underwear.",8
40648,Scene,16, The Baggage Claim.,8
40649,Clerk,16," Mr. and Mrs. Wolowitz? As far as I can tell, your bag arrived in Los Angeles.",8
40650,Bernadette,16," So, where is it?",8
40651,Clerk,16," I don‰Ûªt know, perhaps somebody took it off the carousel by mistake?",8
40652,Howard,16," So, some stranger has my mom? Is that what you‰Ûªre telling me? My poor mother can be anywhere in Los Angeles right now?",8
40653,Clerk,16," I, I wish I was telling you that. Um, but the passenger could‰Ûªve gotten on an international flight.",8
40654,Howard,16," Oh, okay, great. So, your entire job is to find lost luggage, and you‰Ûªve narrowed down the location of my mother to the planet Earth.",8
40655,Clerk,16," I‰Ûªm sorry. W, would 500 frequent-flyer miles help? That could get you to Sacramento.",8
40656,Scene,16, Penny‰Ûªs apartment.,8
40657,Sheldon,16," If you could wake up tomorrow having gained any one quality or ability, what would it be?",8
40658,Penny,16," Well, not to steal from the Bible, but turning water into wine sounds pretty good.",8
40659,Sheldon,16, I don‰Ûªt think you‰Ûªre taking this seriously.,8
40660,Penny,16," Come on, I‰Ûªm just having some fun with you.",8
40661,Sheldon,16, I believe what you‰Ûªre doing is using humour to avoid vulnerability.,8
40662,Penny,16," Fine. Honestly, if I could have one quality, I wish I could be as smart as you guys.",8
40663,Sheldon,16, Ha. Keep dreaming.,8
40664,Penny,16, Sheldon.,8
40665,Shedon,16," I‰Ûªm sorry. That was me having fun with you. Look, you may not be as, as academically inclined as are we. Yes, that‰Ûªs how you say it. But, you possess an intelligence I envy. Which leads me to my answer. I would choose the ability to read people‰Ûªs minds.",8
40666,Penny,16," Well, I can‰Ûªt read people‰Ûªs minds. Actually, that‰Ûªs not true, I can read men‰Ûªs minds, but only ‰Ûªcause it‰Ûªs usually the one thing.",8
40667,Sheldon,16, When are we going to get robot eyes?,8
40668,Penny,16, You‰Ûªre all alike.,8
40669,Sheldon,16," Well, what I meant was I often misinterpret how others are feeling. Like, I can‰Ûªt always tell if someone is only joking or laughing at me. You know, like, uh, if they‰Ûªre mad at something I‰Ûªve done or just in a bad mood. It, it‰Ûªs incredibly stressful.",8
40670,Penny,16, Really? You always seem so confident.,8
40671,Sheldon,16," Well, I‰Ûªm not. And if I could read people‰Ûªs minds, life would be so much simpler.",8
40672,Penny,16," Well, now I wish I had the ability to make that stuff easier for you.",8
40673,Sheldon,16, Thank you.,8
40674,Penny,16," Wow, I just felt this wave of affection for you.",8
40675,Sheldon,16, You sure it‰Ûªs not too much Bible juice?,8
40676,Penny,16, And the wave is gone.,8
40677,Scene,16, The escape room.,8
40678,Zombie,16, Brains!,8
40679,Amy,16," Keep it down, we‰Ûªre working here.",8
40680,Raj,16," Okay, we‰Ûªve got the cipher decoded.",8
40681,Emily,16, How‰Ûªs it going with the globe?,8
40682,Amy,16, We used the coordinates to locate the cities.,8
40683,Leonard,16, I‰Ûªm putting the city names in the grid now. I‰Ûªm sure that‰Ûªll give us the code to the safe.,8
40684,Zombie,16, Solve puzzle too fast! Slow down!,8
40685,Leonard,16, Yup. Got the code.,8
40686,Zombie,16," Just saying, no refund for finish early!",8
40687,Scene,16, The baggage check.,8
40688,Bernadette,16," Sure you don‰Ûªt want to go home? When the bag‰Ûªs returned, they‰Ûªll deliver it to us.",8
40689,Howard,16," No, I‰Ûªm not leaving without her.",8
40690,Bernadette,16," All right, we‰Ûªll wait.",8
40691,Howard,16, I could‰Ûªve driven her.,8
40692,Bernadette,16, What?,8
40693,Howard,16, The day she left for Florida. She asked me to drive her to the airport. I was too busy. And I made her take a cab. I was too busy.,8
40694,Bernadette,16, There‰Ûªs no way you could‰Ûªve known. Be right back. Excuse me?,8
40695,Clerk,16, Yes?,8
40696,Bernadette,16," You better find my husband‰Ûªs mother ‰Ûªcause one way or another, w e‰Ûªre walking out of this airport with a dead woman.",8
40697,Scene,16, The escape room.,8
40698,Leonard,16, Which book are we looking for?,8
40699,Raj,16," Uh, Origin of Species.",8
40700,Leonard,16, Here it is. There‰Ûªs a black light.,8
40701,Emily,16," Oh, hang on.",8
40702,Raj,16," Oh, okay. Uh, brothers and sisters I have none, but this man‰Ûªs father is my father‰Ûªs son. Who am I looking at? Yeah, yeah, we get it, you want brains. Calm down.",8
40703,Amy,16," Well, if I don‰Ûªt have a brother, my father‰Ûªs son is me. And if I‰Ûªm this man‰Ûªs father, then he‰Ûªs my son. The answer‰Ûªs son.",8
40704,Emily,16, Ooh. There‰Ûªs a picture of the sun over there.,8
40705,Leonard,16, I bet the key‰Ûªs behind it.,8
40706,Zombie,16, Could be somewhere else.,8
40707,Emily,16," Oh, got the key.",8
40708,Amy,16," So, that‰Ûªs the key to the door? That‰Ûªs it?",8
40709,Leonard,16, We spent two hundred dollars on six minutes of fun?,8
40710,Raj,16," It‰Ûªs like when you bought that remote-controlled helicopter, and it just flew away.",8
40711,Emily,16," Sorry, guys. Really thought the puzzles would be better.",8
40712,Amy,16," Well, to be fair, we do all have advanced degrees.",8
40713,Zombie,16, Remember that before you post on Yelp.,8
40714,Scene,16, Penny‰Ûªs apartment.,8
40715,Penny,16," If you were to die this evening with no opportunity to communicate with anyone, what would you most regret not having told someone?",8
40716,Sheldon,16," So, it would be today? Huh. Well, I suppose there‰Ûªs something satisfying about dying on my birthday.",8
40717,Penny,16, Today‰Ûªs your birthday?,8
40718,Sheldon,16, Yes.,8
40719,Penny,16," Well, that‰Ûªs always been a secret. Not even Amy knows.",8
40720,Sheldon,16," Well, I don‰Ûªt enjoy presents. And the thought of people jumping out and yelling surprise fills me with more dread than the words George Lucas Director‰Ûªs Cut.",8
40721,Penny,16," So, why did you finally tell me?",8
40722,Sheldon,16, The point of the experiment is to be completely honest with each other.,8
40723,Penny,16," Well, thank you for sharing it with me. I won‰Ûªt tell anyone.",8
40724,Sheldon,16, Thank you.,8
40725,Penny,16, That is so funny. I never would have pegged you for a Pisces.,8
40726,Sheldon,16, You‰Ûªre making it difficult to love you right now.,8
40727,Scene,16, The baggage check.,8
40728,Clerk,16," Great news, your bag was returned.",8
40729,Howard,16," Oh, thank God. It‰Ûªs okay, she‰Ûªs here. Ma‰Ûªs here.",8
40730,Bernadette,16," Okay, thank you so much.",8
40731,Howard,16, Ma? I‰Ûªm sorry I didn‰Ûªt take you to the airport. I just want you to know that I‰Ûªll never forgive myself for being so selfish. And I promise to keep you close for the rest of my life.,8
40732,Bernadette,16," Oh, no. That thing‰Ûªs gonna end up in my bedroom.",8
40733,Scene,16, Penny‰Ûªs apartment.,8
40734,Sheldon,16, That‰Ûªs it. We‰Ûªre done with the questions.,8
40735,Penny,16, All that‰Ûªs left to do is stare into each other‰Ûªs eyes for four minutes without talking.,8
40736,Sheldon,16," Okay. Wait, hang on. Bladder check. We‰Ûªre good to go.",8
40737,Penny,16, You ready?,8
40738,Sheldon,16, Yes.,8
40739,Penny,16, And begin. This is kind of creepy.,8
40740,Sheldon,16, We‰Ûªre not supposed to talk during this part.,8
40741,Penny,16, Sorry.,8
40742,Sheldon,16, This is kind of creepy.,8
40743,Penny,16, Do you want to stop? I know you have trouble with eye contact.,8
40744,Sheldon,16," Well, you have a brown fleck in your right iris that looks like a Formula One race car. So I‰Ûªm just concentrating on that. Plus, it‰Ûªs easier around people that I‰Ûªm comfortable with.",8
40745,Penny,16," Aw, sweetie, I‰Ûªm comfortable around you, too.",8
40746,Sheldon,16," Of course you are, I‰Ûªm warm and soothing. I‰Ûªm like a human bowl of tomato soup.",8
40747,Penny,16, I meant more like a little brother.,8
40748,Sheldon,16," Oh. Well, I suppose I do think of you as a sister. And sometimes, a mother.",8
40749,Penny,16, It‰Ûªs getting creepy again.,8
40750,Sheldon,16, What?,8
40751,Penny,16, Just thinking about the day I met you and Leonard.,8
40752,Sheldon,16, It was a Monday afternoon. You joined us for Indian food.,8
40753,Penny,16, Can you believe it‰Ûªs been eight years?,8
40754,Sheldon,16," Yeah, and you‰Ûªre still eating our food.",8
40755,Penny,16, I can‰Ûªt remember a time you guys weren‰Ûªt in my life.,8
40756,Sheldon,16," I remember it perfectly. But I have an eidetic memory. If you‰Ûªre interested, I also remember how much you owe us for the food.",8
40757,Penny,16, That‰Ûªs it. That wasn‰Ûªt so bad.,8
40758,Sheldon,16," No, it wasn‰Ûªt. Uh, now let‰Ûªs tabulate the results of the experiment. I think it‰Ûªs safe to say that you‰Ûªre not in love with me and I‰Ûªm not in love with you. And psychology has once again proved itself the doofus of the sciences.",8
40759,Penny,16," Well, maybe. But I‰Ûªm still glad we did it. I do feel closer to you.",8
40760,Sheldon,16," And I, you. And yes, that‰Ûªs how you say that. Yeah, so, given our newfound intimacy, I‰Ûªd say we have some hard choices to make.",8
40761,Penny,16, Like what?,8
40762,Sheldon,16," Gary Con, do we fly or drive? Do we wear costumes? And if so, who gets to be Gary?",8
40763,Scene,16, The hallway.,8
40764,Sheldon,16, Thank you for walking me home.,8
40765,Penny,16, I just want to make sure you get there safe.,8
40766,Sheldon,16," Well, this is me. It‰Ûªs been a very interesting evening.",8
40767,Penny,16, It really has.,8
40768,All,16, SURPRISE!,8
40769,Sheldon,16, Aah! And after I let you be Gary.,8
40770,Scene,17, The stairwell.,8
40771,Leonard,17," I was unstoppable. I mean, I was, I was on fire. It was like my mind and my body were totally connected, like, like athletes must feel when they‰Ûªre in the zone.",8
40772,Penny,17," Again, it was miniature golf.",8
40773,Leonard,17," Admit it, you‰Ûªre a little turned on.",8
40774,Penny,17, You can‰Ûªt be this proud.,8
40775,Leonard,17, Why not?,8
40776,Penny,17, Because I beat you.,8
40777,Leonard,17, Hey.,8
40778,Penny,17, Hi.,8
40779,Sheldon,17," Oh, good. You‰Ûªre back.",8
40780,Amy,17, We have some exciting news.,8
40781,Leonard,17, Okay.,8
40782,Sheldon,17," As you know, Amy and I have been together a long time, and a lot of things I never thought possible now seem possible.",8
40783,Penny,17, Okay.,8
40784,Amy,17," After a careful evaluation of our relationship, we decided that the time was right to take a step forward.",8
40785,Leonard,17, Okay.,8
40786,Sheldon,17, Do you want to say it?,8
40787,Amy,17, Let‰Ûªs say it together.,8
40788,Together,17, We‰Ûªre getting a turtle.,8
40789,Penny,17, This is why I‰Ûªve been saying we should keep champagne on ice.,8
40790,Sheldon,17, Sarcasm?,8
40791,Amy,17, Yes.,8
40792,Sheldon,17," Okay. That was tricky, ‰Ûªcause when it comes to alcohol, she generally means business.",8
40793,Leonard,17," Well, we‰Ûªre, we‰Ûªre very happy for you.",8
40794,Penny,17, Yes.,8
40795,Amy,17, Thank you. Acquiring a joint pet is a big step for us.,8
40796,Sheldon,17," No. It‰Ûªs true. It means that we care so much about each other, there‰Ûªs enough left over for an eight-ounce reptile.",8
40797,Leonard,17, Why a turtle?,8
40798,Sheldon,17," After much deliberation, we‰Ûªve determined that a turtle is the ideal pet. They don‰Ûªt shed fur, they don‰Ûªt make noise.",8
40799,Amy,17," For Halloween, we can dress him as a cobblestone.",8
40800,Sheldon,17," Yeah. And if he ever goes berserk, I know I can outrun him. Coincidentally, that‰Ûªs also why I chose you as a roommate.",8
40801,Leonard,17," Well, congratulations. Who would‰Ûªve thought you two would be the first in our group to start a family?",8
40802,Penny,17, Mm-hmm.,8
40803,Amy,17, That‰Ûªs what I said.,8
40804,Scene,17, Emily‰Ûªs apartment.,8
40805,Raj,17," So, where‰Ûªs your roommate tonight?",8
40806,Emily,17," Well, I thought it was a little unfair that she‰Ûªs always here, and you never get a chance to stay over, so I killed her.",8
40807,Raj,17," But remember our agreement? You can joke about murdering people, but you have to say just kidding.",8
40808,Emily,17," And the more important thing to remember is that I‰Ûªd never hurt you. Oh, crap. I have to run over to the hospital and check on a patient.",8
40809,Raj,17, That‰Ûªs okay. I can come back later.,8
40810,Emily,17," No. No, don‰Ûªt be silly. I won‰Ûªt be gone long. Just stay here.",8
40811,Raj,17," Okay, cool. Oh, and you‰Ûªre sure your roommate‰Ûªs not gonna come back while I‰Ûªm here alone, right? ‰Û÷Cause that‰Ûªll be awkward.",8
40812,Emily,17," Oh, don‰Ûªt worry. She‰Ûªs in Palm Springs.",8
40813,Raj,17," Oh, good.",8
40814,Emily,17," Well, her torso is. Just kidding. I put her in a wood chipper.",8
40815,Scene,17, A pet store.,8
40816,Sheldon,17," Oh, dear Lord. Oh, dear Lord.",8
40817,Amy,17, It‰Ûªs okay. You made it. We‰Ûªre fine.,8
40818,Sheldon,17, That was a lot of puppies.,8
40819,Amy,17," Let‰Ûªs forget about them, and pick ourselves out a nice turtle. Oh, how about this one up on the log?",8
40820,Sheldon,17," Oh, I don‰Ûªt know. He kind of looks like a jerk. How about this one?",8
40821,Amy,17," Well, he‰Ûªs barely moving. He looks half dead.",8
40822,Sheldon,17," I know. I like him, too. Hi, little guy. How‰Ûªd you like to come home with us? You‰Ûªll be living with me because we don‰Ûªt live in the same house.",8
40823,Amy,17," But that‰Ûªs not your fault. Like you, we‰Ûªre taking it ridiculously slow. You‰Ûªll stay with me when he‰Ûªs at Comic-Con or away for work.",8
40824,Sheldon,17, Or if they accept Daddy‰Ûªs application to live on Mars.,8
40825,Amy,17, What are you talking about?,8
40826,Sheldon,17," Oh, there‰Ûªs this company that‰Ûªs attempting to establish a colony on Mars, and I applied to be among the first to go. What should we name him? You know, I came in thinking Seth, but he kind of looks Italian.",8
40827,Amy,17," You applied for a mission to be a colonist on another planet, and couldn‰Ûªt be bothered to tell me?",8
40828,Sheldon,17, Would you have approved?,8
40829,Amy,17, Of course not.,8
40830,Sheldon,17," Well, based on your reaction, it looks like I made the right choice. Isn‰Ûªt that right, Giuseppe?",8
40831,Scene,17, The apartment.,8
40832,Leonard,17," Hey, hey. Listen, I, I have a little confession to make.",8
40833,Penny,17," Aw, is this your first time?",8
40834,Leonard,17," No, I got you something for Valentine‰Ûªs Day, and I was too embarrassed to give it to you.",8
40835,Penny,17," Well, why?",8
40836,Leonard,17," Well, ‰Ûªcause I got it at the dirty store.",8
40837,Penny,17, You went to the dirty store without me?,8
40838,Leonard,17, In sunglasses and a hat after I parked two blocks away.,8
40839,Penny,17," Well, get it. Get it for me.",8
40840,Leonard,17, Yeah?,8
40841,Penny,17, Yeah.,8
40842,Leonard,17," Okay, uh, well, I hope it‰Ûªs fun. I mean, it, it comes with paints, and, and it‰Ûªs kind of creative and artistic.",8
40843,Penny,17," Okay, did you go to the dirty store or Michaels?",8
40844,Leonard,17," No, no. We cover ourselves in body paint, and then, then we get on this big canvas and do our thing.",8
40845,Penny,17," Whoa, that‰Ûªs kind of a big step for a guy who only recently agreed to take his socks off.",8
40846,Leonard,17, You‰Ûªre making fun of me. Forget it.,8
40847,Penny,17," No. No, come on, I want to do it.",8
40848,Leonard,17, Really?,8
40849,Penny,17," Yeah, let‰Ûªs you, me, and your very, very pale feet make some art. Hey, when you got back to this store, I want to go with you.",8
40850,Leonard,17," Okay, but it‰Ûªs a drive, the one I went to is in San Diego.",8
40851,Scene,17, Howard and Bernadette‰Ûªs apartment.,8
40852,Howard,17, How are the taxes going?,8
40853,Bernadette,17, Okay. But you got a lot of receipts for the Lego store in here.,8
40854,Howard,17, Those are business expenses. You can write those off.,8
40855,Bernadette,17, A two hundred dollar R2-D2 is a business expense?,8
40856,Howard,17," Oh, Bernie, you‰Ûªre gonna have to sound a lot more confident when we get audited. (On phone) Hey, what‰Ûªs up?",8
40857,Raj,17," Oh, Emily ran back to the hospital, so I‰Ûªm just hanging out at her place. What are you, uh, what are you doing?",8
40858,Howard,17, Just playing video games while Bernie does the taxes.,8
40859,Raj,17," What are you, a little kid? Is she gonna cut your dinner into little pieces, too?",8
40860,Howard,17," She doesn‰Ûªt have to, I filled up on jelly beans.",8
40861,Raj,17," So, uh, what game are you‰Û_ Oh. Crap.",8
40862,Howard,17, What‰Ûªs wrong?,8
40863,Raj,17, I can‰Ûªt get Emily‰Ûªs night-stand to close.,8
40864,Howard,17, So?,8
40865,Raj,17, She‰Ûªs gonna know I was looking in it.,8
40866,Howard,17, Why were you looking in it?,8
40867,Raj,17," Well, there‰Ûªs a question I better have a good answer to before she gets back.",8
40868,Howard,17," Okay, calm down. There‰Ûªs probably something jammed behind it. Just, uh, pull it out and see what‰Ûªs there.",8
40869,Raj,17," Hang on. Oh no. Oh, no. Oh, God, no.",8
40870,Howard,17," You know what, you sound busy, I‰Ûªm gonna let you go.",8
40871,Raj,17," Dude, the whole front came off. Now she‰Ûªs gonna know I was snooping.",8
40872,Bernadette,17, What‰Ûªs happening?,8
40873,Howard,17, Raj was snooping through Emily‰Ûªs drawers and broke one.,8
40874,Bernadette,17, Aw. I‰Ûªm gonna miss her.,8
40875,Scene,17, Penny‰Ûªs bedroom.,8
40876,Penny,17, So what do you think?,8
40877,Leonard,17," I thought it‰Ûªd be a little more, just more.",8
40878,Penny,17," I‰Ûªm not even sure why we were out of breath. Uh, I mean, did we move at all?",8
40879,Leonard,17," Maybe along the z-axis, but x and y are looking pretty sad.",8
40880,Penny,17," Okay, come on. We are not old boring people. We can do better than this.",8
40881,Leonard,17," Uh, Th, that‰Ûªs true. How late did we stay up last night?",8
40882,Penny,17, Almost 1am.,8
40883,Leonard,17," Damn straight, almost 1am. And we weren‰Ûªt even watching TV. We were watching Netflix, like the kids do.",8
40884,Penny,17," Yeah, is it a comedy? Is it a drama? Nobody knows. Now, come on. We are gonna do this.",8
40885,Leonard,17," Yeah. You get the paint, I‰Ûªll rest for 30 to 40 minutes, and then we do this.",8
40886,Scene,17, The stairwell. ,8
40887,Sheldon,17, I can‰Ûªt believe you almost had me bring a wild animal into my home.,8
40888,Amy,17, No one told you to poke the turtle‰Ûªs face.,8
40889,Sheldon,17, I was playing Got Your Nose. That‰Ûªs how you get children to like you.,8
40890,Amy,17," I‰Ûªm surprised you even care if he likes you, since you‰Ûªre planning on leaving the planet the first chance you get.",8
40891,Sheldon,17," Ugh, this again. Amy, I‰Ûªve already had one new hole torn in my body today. I don‰Ûªt need another one.",8
40892,Amy,17," Sheldon, I know the odds of you even going to Mars are incredibly small, but it still hurts that you would volunteer for something that would take you away from me forever.",8
40893,Sheldon,17, So you‰Ûªre saying you wouldn‰Ûªt leave me for the chance to be one of the first humans to colonize another planet?,8
40894,Amy,17, I would at least mention it before filling out the application.,8
40895,Sheldon,17," Huh, that‰Ûªs exactly what Leonard, Wolowitz, Koothrappali, Bernadette and Penny said.",8
40896,Amy,17," And who says you could even survive an interplanetary mission, anyway? You could barely survive a tiny turtle bite.",8
40897,Sheldon,17," First of all, this has only made me stronger. But beyond that, all I did was fill out an application.",8
40898,Amy,17," You know what? Go to Mars, Sheldon.",8
40899,Sheldon,17, Is there anything I can do to cheer you up?,8
40900,Amy,17, No. Forget it.,8
40901,Sheldon,17, What if I play the Star Trek theme on my nose?,8
40902,Amy,17, Please don‰Ûªt.,8
40903,Sheldon,17," Yep, you‰Ûªre mad.",8
40904,Scene,17, Howard and Bernadette‰Ûªs apartment. Howard is on the phone to Raj.,8
40905,Howard,17," Okay, let me see the damage.",8
40906,Raj,17, Hang on.,8
40907,Howard,17," Well, I think you broke the dowels. You‰Ûªre not gonna have time to glue it back on, you‰Ûªll have to nail it.",8
40908,Raj,17, With what?,8
40909,Howard,17, Does she have any pillows or wine glasses?,8
40910,Raj,17, She does.,8
40911,Howard,17, Great. Neither of those. Try a hammer.,8
40912,Raj,17, Did that feel good? You feel like a big man now?,8
40913,Scene,17, The apartment. ,8
40914,Sheldon,17," I was going to make you red zinger, but since Mars is the red planet, I went with peppermint.",8
40915,Amy,17, Why do you even want to do this?,8
40916,Sheldon,17," Actually, as part of the application, I was required to make a short video answering that very question. You want to see it?",8
40917,Amy,17, Can‰Ûªt you just tell me?,8
40918,Sheldon,17, But I made a video.,8
40919,Sheldon (on video),17," I‰Ûªm Dr. Sheldon Cooper, and I‰Ûªd like to tell you why I should be chosen to go to Mars. I‰Ûªm exceedingly smart. I graduated college at 14. While my brother was getting an STD I was getting a PhD. Penicillin can‰Ûªt take this away. Being in close quarters, cleanliness is important and my hygiene is impeccable. In fact, animals don‰Ûªt trust me because I smell like nothing. Literally nothing. During the seven-month space flight, I can keep up morale with my wacky sense of humour. Hey, Leonard, is there any peanut brittle left in that can?",8
40920,Leonard (on video),17, You mean this weirdly suspicious one?,8
40921,Sheldon (on video),17, Yes. Open it and check.,8
40922,Leonard (on video),17, I don‰Ûªt get it. There‰Ûªs actually peanut brittle in‰Û_ Please go to Mars.,8
40923,Sheldon (on video),17," But on a more serious note, the most important reason I want to go to Mars is that I believe, as a scientist, it‰Ûªs my duty to push the boundaries of human knowledge forward. Now, I know that life on Mars will be difficult. But life here on Earth is no picnic. Also, picnics are no picnic. Where should we go for lunch? Oh, I know, the ground. In conclusion, thank you for considering me for this journey of a lifetime. To Mars.",8
40924,Sheldon,17," Afterwards, Leonard blew his nose, and pie came out.",8
40925,Scene,17, Penny‰Ûªs bathroom.,8
40926,Leonard,17," Right there, right there, Oh, God, that‰Ûªs it.",8
40927,Penny,17, How did you get paint in your eye?,8
40928,Leonard,17, Because you wouldn‰Ûªt let me wear safety goggles.,8
40929,Scene,17, Emily‰Ûªs bedroom. Raj is still on the phone with Howard.,8
40930,Raj,17," This looks terrible. She, she‰Ûªs gonna know.",8
40931,Howard,17, It‰Ûªs fine. You just need two more nails.,8
40932,Raj,17," Okay, where should I put them?",8
40933,Howard,17, In Emily‰Ûªs eyes.,8
40934,Raj,17, You‰Ûªre not helping.,8
40935,Bernadette,17," Well, maybe this is what you get for snooping.",8
40936,Raj,17," You know, it, it‰Ûªs bad enough that I have to deal with this‰Û_",8
40937,Emily,17, Raj? I‰Ûªm back.,8
40938,Raj,17," Oh, no. Hey.",8
40939,Emily,17, Hi.,8
40940,Raj,17, How was the hospital?,8
40941,Emily,17, Fine. What were you doing in there?,8
40942,Raj,17," Uh w, well, okay, look, I, I don‰Ûªt want to lie to you. I got curious, I was looking around and I broke the drawer on your night stand.",8
40943,Emily,17, You were looking in my night stand?,8
40944,Raj,17, Yeah.,8
40945,Emily,17," So, the first time I leave you alone, you snoop on me?",8
40946,Raj,17, You‰Ûªve never snooped around my apartment?,8
40947,Emily,17, No.,8
40948,Raj,17," Come on, think back. It would really help if you had.",8
40949,Emily,17, I can‰Ûªt believe you don‰Ûªt trust me.,8
40950,Bernadette,17, She sounds really mad.,8
40951,Howard,17, We should hang up.,8
40952,Bernadette,17," Yeah, we should.",8
40953,Howard,17," But we‰Ûªre not going to, are we?",8
40954,Bernadette,17, Not a chance.,8
40955,Howard,17, What happened to snooping is wrong?,8
40956,Bernadette,17," Howard, you‰Ûªre going to jail for tax fraud. Who cares?",8
40957,Scene,17, Penny‰Ûªs bedroom.,8
40958,Leonard,17," Well, we did it.",8
40959,Penny,17, We sure did.,8
40960,Leonard,17," I mean, I was on fire. I, I was in the zone, like an athlete.",8
40961,Penny,17," Sweetie, I beat you at this, too.",8
40962,Leonard,17," So, where do we want to hang it?",8
40963,Penny,17, What? Are you kidding? We‰Ûªre not hanging it.,8
40964,Leonard,17, But it‰Ûªs an expression of our love.,8
40965,Penny,17, And our butts. Not hanging it.,8
40966,Leonard,17, Seems a shame to throw it away.,8
40967,Penny,17," Yeah. We could give it to Sheldon, and tell him William Shatner painted it.",8
40968,Leonard,17," God, I love you. I love you so much.",8
40969,Scene,17, The apartment. ,8
40970,Amy,17, I think I‰Ûªm gonna go home.,8
40971,Sheldon,17, Why? I really don‰Ûªt understand what‰Ûªs happening here.,8
40972,Amy,17," You know, Sheldon, at any other time, learning that you had plans to go live on Mars would be a slow news day. But a couple of hours ago, we were getting a turtle. And silly as it sounds, I thought that meant something.",8
40973,Sheldon,17," Amy. Oh, why didn‰Ûªt I give her Sleepy Time tea? Amy, wait. Getting a turtle meant a great deal to me, too.",8
40974,Amy,17, Sure. Unless something better comes along.,8
40975,Sheldon,17, Do you want me to withdraw my application?,8
40976,Amy,17, What I want is for us to be planning our future together.,8
40977,Sheldon,17," And in that future, are we on the same planet? Because I‰Ûªve seen people make the long-distance thing work.",8
40978,Amy,17, We‰Ûªre on the same planet.,8
40979,Sheldon,17, Okay. Does that planet have to be Earth?,8
40980,Amy,17, Are you asking me to go to Mars with you?,8
40981,Sheldon,17," I am. Yeah, if I‰Ûªm going to a barren, lifeless environment where the chances of survival are slim to none, I want you there with me. Why don‰Ûªt we go back to the apartment, and fill out your application?",8
40982,Amy,17, Okay. I suppose being the first people on a new planet would be incredibly exciting.,8
40983,Sheldon,17," Oh, I know. We could be the first to plant a flag on Mars. We could be the first to watch Mars Attacks! on Mars. We could be the first to say good lord, what on Mars are you talking about?",8
40984,Amy,17," You know, we could also be the first people to procreate on Mars.",8
40985,Sheldon,17," You just can‰Ûªt keep it in your space pants, can you?",8
40986,Amy,17," Think about it. If we had a family there, our kids would be Martians.",8
40987,Sheldon,17," They would, wouldn‰Ûªt they? We could give them cool Martian names. And we could teach them about Martian history. Like, who planted those flags? And, uh, where did that copy of Mars Attacks! come from?",8
40988,Amy,17," I guess we‰Ûªll have to make a new video together, as a couple.",8
40989,Sheldon,17," Good idea. And since you‰Ûªve had such a rough day, I‰Ûªm gonna let you throw the pie in Leonard‰Ûªs face.",8
40990,Scene,17, Emily‰Ûªs bedroom.,8
40991,Raj,17, Thank you for forgiving me.,8
40992,Emily,17," That‰Ûªs okay. At some point, we were bound to have our first fight.",8
40993,Raj,17," Well, it almost happened when you called my apple pie crust doughy, but the truth is you were right, and I was just angry at myself.",8
40994,Emily,17, Can I ask you one thing?,8
40995,Raj,17, Of course. What?,8
40996,Emily,17, Did you look in my closet?,8
40997,Raj,17, No. Just the drawer.,8
40998,Emily,17, You promise you didn‰Ûªt look in the closet?,8
40999,Raj,17," I promise. Why, what‰Ûªs in there?",8
41000,Emily,17, Don‰Ûªt worry about it. Good night.,8
41001,Scene,18, The lobby.,8
41002,Sheldon,18," Two one six four two zero one nine eight nine. And that, little lady, is pi to a thousand places.",8
41003,Amy,18," I‰Ûªd say I‰Ûªm sorry I asked, except I didn‰Ûªt.",8
41004,Sheldon,18," Oh, look, it‰Ûªs the Scientific American that covered the paper Leonard and I wrote.",8
41005,Amy,18," Oh, let me see.",8
41006,Sheldon,18, I have mixed feelings about doing interviews. I like the part where I talk. I do not like the part where the other man talks.,8
41007,Amy,18," Sheldon, this article doesn‰Ûªt mention Leonard at all.",8
41008,Sheldon,18," Well, that can‰Ûªt be right.",8
41009,Amy,18, It only refers to Dr. Cooper and his team. Did you even talk about him?,8
41010,Sheldon,18, All I did was answer a few questions about the theory. And then expressed my gratitude that Scientific American doesn‰Ûªt include any of those smelly perfume cards.,8
41011,Amy,18, Poor Leonard.,8
41012,Sheldon,18, Why? The theory he came up with just got mentioned in Scientific American. He ought to be thrilled.,8
41013,Amy,18, He might not be.,8
41014,Sheldon,18," Oh, maybe you‰Ûªre right. He is kind of a lump.",8
41015,Amy,18, Think about it. How would you feel if you were referred to as part of Leonard‰Ûªs team?,8
41016,Sheldon,18," Oh, I‰Ûªd be incensed.",8
41017,Amy,18, So you see what I‰Ûªm getting at?,8
41018,Sheldon,18, Squeaky wheel gets the grease?,8
41019,Amy,18, No.,8
41020,Sheldon,18, Grass is always greener?,8
41021,Amy,18, Try again.,8
41022,Sheldon,18," Well, I don‰Ûªt know, we‰Ûªre all Groot? Just tell me.",8
41023,Amy,18," Leonard is as much a part of this paper as you are, and he was overlooked. He‰Ûªs going to feel bad.",8
41024,Sheldon,18, But it wasn‰Ûªt my fault. I didn‰Ûªt exclude him. And I didn‰Ûªt write the article.,8
41025,Amy,18, Remember that time you didn‰Ûªt get picked to pull the sword out of the stone at Disneyland and they let that other kid do it?,8
41026,Sheldon,18," Oh, that kid. Poor Leonard.",8
41027,Amy,18, Exactly.,8
41028,Sheldon,18," For the record, that kid was a terrible choice. If you cry when you drop your churro, you do not have what it takes to rule England.",8
41029,Scene,18, Howard‰Ûªs car.,8
41030,Howard,18, Thanks for helping us sort through all my mom‰Ûªs stuff.,8
41031,Raj,18," Of course. I know what it‰Ûªs like having to go through a loved one‰Ûªs possessions. My uncle was a worshipper of Krishna. But after he died, you know what we found? A statue of Shiva. It may not be Crips and Bloods, okay? But in India, it‰Ûªs a thing.",8
41032,Bernadette,18," Well, it‰Ûªll be good that you‰Ûªre there. Howard‰Ûªs been having trouble deciding what to keep and what to let go.",8
41033,Howard,18," Well, it‰Ûªs hard. A lot of Ma‰Ûªs stuff brings back fond memories.",8
41034,Bernadette,18, Is that why you couldn‰Ûªt get rid of her drawer full of ketchup packets?,8
41035,Howard,18," Yes. It reminds me of us eating out and her saying quick, nobody‰Ûªs looking, fill your pockets with ketchup.",8
41036,Scene,18, The apartment.,8
41037,Sheldon,18, Leonard? Have you ever noticed that only my name is on the cable bill?,8
41038,Leonard,18, Yeah.,8
41039,Sheldon,18," Good, good. And your name is on the electric bill and mine isn‰Ûªt. And I‰Ûªm okay with that.",8
41040,Leonard,18," Actually, your name is on the electric bill.",8
41041,Sheldon,18," Oh, right. This is a disaster.",8
41042,Leonard,18, I don‰Ûªt even know what you‰Ûªre talking about and I agree.,8
41043,Sheldon,18," Okay, I have to tell you something, but you‰Ûªre not going to like it.",8
41044,Leonard,18, What‰Ûªs going on?,8
41045,Sheldon,18, An article was just published in Scientific American about our theory.,8
41046,Leonard,18, Did they hate it?,8
41047,Sheldon,18," No. No, they loved it. They, uh, couldn‰Ûªt say enough nice things about it.",8
41048,Leonard,18, So what‰Ûªs the problem?,8
41049,Sheldon,18, You know how the PennySaver only has my name‰Û_,8
41050,Leonard,18, Sheldon.,8
41051,Sheldon,18, They didn‰Ûªt mention you in the article. Only me.,8
41052,Leonard,18, Really?,8
41053,Sheldon,18," I know. It‰Ûªs not fair. Let the anger go, buddy. You just, you relax all your muscles. Except for your pubococcygeus and anal sphincter. Let‰Ûªs keep those tight.",8
41054,Leonard,18," Uh, that, that‰Ûªs not necessary.",8
41055,Sheldon,18," It is. They‰Ûªre what hold back the urine and the faeces. Look, maybe, maybe you shouldn‰Ûªt read it. It‰Ûªll only make you feel worse.",8
41056,Leonard,18, Cooper and his team?,8
41057,Sheldon,18, You should know I had nothing to do with that.,8
41058,Leonard,18," Uh, at least they‰Ûªre talking about the theory. I mean, that‰Ûªs what‰Ûªs important.",8
41059,Sheldon,18," You know, you‰Ûªre right. Yeah. You know, it‰Ûªs like when Stan Lee and Steve Ditko created Spider-Man. Stan Lee may get all the credit, but Steve Ditko knows he was just as important. Even though Stan Lee gets to be in all the Marvel movies. And. and he‰Ûªs far richer. And he‰Ûªs a household name, you know? Whereas, you know, you say Ditko, and that sounds like a company that makes Dits.",8
41060,Leonard,18, That‰Ûªs not helping.,8
41061,Sheldon,18," Well, I‰Ûªd give more examples, but, well, everyone in your position‰Ûªs so forgettable.",8
41062,Scene,18, Mrs Wolowitz‰Ûªs House.,8
41063,Howard,18," Stuart, we‰Ûªre here.",8
41064,Raj,18, It‰Ûªs nice of you to let him keep staying at your mom‰Ûªs house.,8
41065,Howard,18," Yeah, well, I tried putting him out on the curb, but nobody took him.",8
41066,Stuart,18," Hey. Just so you know, the power‰Ûªs out.",8
41067,Bernadette,18, What happened?,8
41068,Stuart,18," I called, they said a transformer blew. It‰Ûªs the whole block. Should be fixed by tomorrow.",8
41069,Howard,18," Wait, when did it go out?",8
41070,Stuart,18, In the middle of the night.,8
41071,Howard,18," Oh, my God.",8
41072,Bernadette,18," Howie, what‰Ûªs wrong?",8
41073,Howard,18, It‰Ûªs all defrosting.,8
41074,Bernadette,18, It‰Ûªs okay. It‰Ûªs just food.,8
41075,Howard,18," It‰Ûªs not just food. This is the last food my mother ever made. This is her last brisket. This is her last meatloaf. This is her last. I have no idea what this is, but it‰Ûªs the last one.",8
41076,Raj,18, Everything okay?,8
41077,Howard,18, No. All Ma‰Ûªs food is gonna be ruined.,8
41078,Bernadette,18," Well, why don‰Ûªt we take it home and put it in our freezer?",8
41079,Raj,18," You don‰Ûªt want to do that. Refreezing not only removes moisture, but it creates ice crystals in the fibres of the meat that can compromise its taste and texture. What? I saw a teachable moment. I dropped some culinary science.",8
41080,Bernadette,18, What should we do?,8
41081,Howard,18, I‰Ûªll tell you exactly what we‰Ûªre gonna do. We‰Ûªre gonna eat it.,8
41082,Bernadette,18," There‰Ûªs, like, twenty pounds of food in there.",8
41083,Howard,18, All you said was I had to get rid of things. You didn‰Ûªt say they couldn‰Ûªt pass through my colon first.,8
41084,Bernadette,18, Howie.,8
41085,Howard,18, Okay. Then how about this? Let‰Ûªs invite everyone over to dinner. It‰Ûªll be like Ma‰Ûªs feeding us one last time.,8
41086,Bernadette,18, I love that.,8
41087,Raj,18," Me, too. Oh, look, we‰Ûªve got enough ketchup to cover every ounce of it.",8
41088,Scene,18, Penny‰Ûªs apartment.,8
41089,Penny,18," I mean, who even reads Scientific American?",8
41090,Leonard,18, It‰Ûªs kind of a big deal.,8
41091,Penny,18," If it‰Ûªs such a big deal, how come the biggest celebrity they could get for the cover is a molecule?",8
41092,Leonard,18, Can we please just stop talking about it?,8
41093,Penny,18, I‰Ûªm sorry. What can I do?,8
41094,Leonard,18," Nothing, I‰Ûªm fine.",8
41095,Penny,18," No, no. I‰Ûªm gonna cheer you up. Here we go.",8
41096,Leonard,18, What are we doing?,8
41097,Penny,18, I am taking you shopping.,8
41098,Leonard,18, Oh.,8
41099,Penny,18," My baby is sad, and I‰Ûªm gonna make him happy again.",8
41100,Leonard,18," Look, I know shopping cheers you up, but it‰Ûªs just not really my thing.",8
41101,Penny,18," Well, what about this helicopter you control with an iPad?",8
41102,Leonard,18, Does it have a camera in it?,8
41103,Penny,18, It does have a camera in it.,8
41104,Leonard,18, Baby‰Ûªs listening.,8
41105,Sheldon,18," (Knock, knock, knock) Leonard? (Knock, knock, knock) Leonard? (Knock, knock, knock) Leonard?",8
41106,Leonard,18, What?,8
41107,Sheldon,18, I spoke to the reporter at the magazine.,8
41108,Leonard,18, What happened? Did you tell him it was my idea?,8
41109,Sheldon,18, I did.,8
41110,Leonard,18, Thank you. What did he say?,8
41111,Sheldon,18, He said they made the editorial decision to only cite the lead scientist.,8
41112,Leonard,18, Why did he think you‰Ûªre the lead scientist? It was my idea.,8
41113,Penny,18," You know, for an extra four bucks, I can have this thing here tomorrow.",8
41114,Sheldon,18," Well, I know it was your idea, but the reporter said he‰Ûªs been following my work for a while, and the only reason they even mentioned it in the magazine is ‰Ûªcause my name is on it.",8
41115,Penny,18, You know what? I did it. What‰Ûªs four bucks?,8
41116,Leonard,18," If you‰Ûªre trying to make me feel better, it‰Ûªs not working.",8
41117,Sheldon,18, Well then what if I told you that I added your name to the cable bill?,8
41118,Leonard,18, No.,8
41119,Sheldon,18," Oh. That‰Ûªs just as well. They had me on hold for 20 minutes and I hung up. (Knock, knock, knock) Leonard? (Knock, knock, knock) Leonard? (Knock, knock, knock) Leonard? Also, Wolowitz invited us all to dinner, so I‰Ûªm ready whenever you are.",8
41120,Scene,18, Amy‰Ûªs car.,8
41121,Sheldon,18, All he had was an idea.,8
41122,Amy,18," Well, that is an important part.",8
41123,Sheldon,18," Oh, please. I have ideas all day long. Reverse SeaWorld where dolphins are allowed to pet people. A new clothing size between medium and large called Marge. Snow White retold from the point of view of Sneezy. Why won‰Ûªt Doc prescribe him something? We finally find out.",8
41124,Amy,18, But Leonard‰Ûªs idea was good.,8
41125,Sheldon,18," Fine. Then Grumpy, what‰Ûªs he so grumpy about? Maybe his girlfriend won‰Ûªt take his side.",8
41126,Scene,18, Penny‰Ûªs car.,8
41127,Leonard,18, I‰Ûªm the one who thought of it.,8
41128,Penny,18," Well, didn‰Ûªt he do a lot of the work?",8
41129,Leonard,18, Yeah. But now he‰Ûªs happy to let people think he‰Ûªs responsible for everything.,8
41130,Penny,18, And that‰Ûªs why you get an iPad helicopter.,8
41131,Scene,18, Amy‰Ûªs car.,8
41132,Sheldon,18, Is it my fault I have a much bigger reputation than he does?,8
41133,Amy,18, It‰Ûªs not your fault.,8
41134,Sheldon,18, Is it my fault that my name came first on the paper alphabetically?,8
41135,Amy,18, Not your fault.,8
41136,Sheldon,18, Is it my fault that when the reporter cited me as the lead scientist I didn‰Ûªt correct him?,8
41137,Amy,18," Hey, look at that pretty bird.",8
41138,Scene,18, Penny‰Ûªs car.,8
41139,Leonard,18, He always needs all the attention. He‰Ûªs such a baby.,8
41140,Penny,18," I know, I know.",8
41141,Leonard,18," I swear, he is never ever playing with my helicopter.",8
41142,Scene,18, Mrs Wolowitz‰Ûªs kitchen.,8
41143,Raj,18," Okay, I‰Ûªll start heating some of this stuff up.",8
41144,Bernadette,18, Thanks.,8
41145,Howard,18," Oh, man. This is the boutonniere from my high school prom. A piece of cake from my Bar Mitzvah.",8
41146,Bernadette,18, Did she throw anything away?,8
41147,Howard,18," No. If I find my foreskin, I‰Ûªm gonna kill myself.",8
41148,Raj,18," Okay, so we‰Ûªve got, um, three briskets, four meatloafs, one lasagna.",8
41149,Howard,18," No, that‰Ûªs noodle kugel.",8
41150,Raj,18," One Jewish lasagna, two pound cakes that are about eight pounds each, and one giant container of matzoh ball soup.",8
41151,Howard,18," Ma always kept it on hand, in case I got sick. She thought she could cure anything with her cooking. Even the time I got food poisoning. From her cooking.",8
41152,Bernadette,18, You okay?,8
41153,Howard,18," Yeah, I‰Ûªm okay. Let‰Ûªs get started.",8
41154,Raj,18, You got it.,8
41155,Howard,18, I‰Ûªm never gonna talk to her again.,8
41156,Bernadette,18, Should we tell everyone not to come?,8
41157,Howard,18, No. I want to do this.,8
41158,Bernadette,18," Okay. Well, I‰Ûªll keep it together if you can.",8
41159,Howard,18, Okay.,8
41160,Raj,18, I‰Ûªm not making any promises.,8
41161,Scene,18, Mrs Wolowitz‰Ûªs living room.,8
41162,Stuart,18, Glad you guys could make it.,8
41163,Leonard,18, Of course.,8
41164,Penny,18," Wow, it looks really pretty in here.",8
41165,Stuart,18," Yeah, turns out half a dozen menorahs really sets a mood.",8
41166,Leonard,18," So, Stuart, have you thought about what you‰Ûªd do if Howard sells the house?",8
41167,Stuart,18, And there goes the mood.,8
41168,Sheldon,18," Hi. Hello. Oh, and a special hello to Leonard, who needs to be mentioned by name.",8
41169,Leonard,18, Subtle.,8
41170,Sheldon,18," But you got it, right?",8
41171,Howard,18," Hey, guys.",8
41172,All,18, Hey. Hi. Hello.,8
41173,Howard,18," I just want everyone to know, uh, tonight‰Ûªs not a sad occasion.",8
41174,Bernadette,18," Yeah, we just want to have the kind of dinner that we‰Ûªve all had here so many times before.",8
41175,Howard,18," Good food, good friends, and sometime around midnight, heartburn that makes you pray for death.",8
41176,Amy,18, Do you need any help in the kitchen?,8
41177,Bernadette,18," No, we got it. You guys make yourselves comfortable.",8
41178,Penny,18," All right, hey, you two, we‰Ûªre here for Howard right now, okay?",8
41179,Amy,18," Yes, so please behave yourselves.",8
41180,Leonard,18, Fine.,8
41181,Sheldon,18, Of course.,8
41182,Stuart,18," So I heard you two, uh, wrote a paper together. How‰Ûªs that going?",8
41183,Scene,18, Mrs Wolowitz‰Ûªs dining room.,8
41184,Penny,18, This food is amazing.,8
41185,Raj,18," Mm, and not a vegetable in sight.",8
41186,Howard,18, That‰Ûªs not true. We‰Ûªve got tomatoes right here.,8
41187,Amy,18, All these bright people sitting around a table by candlelight. Feels like we could be an 18th century French salon.,8
41188,Sheldon,18," Indeed. Penny, a salon is a gathering where intellectuals entertained each other with sparkling conversations about issues of the day.",8
41189,Penny,18," Oh, so it‰Ûªs like The View.",8
41190,Amy,18," Sheldon, The View is a daytime talk show hosted by women.",8
41191,Penny,18, Shut up.,8
41192,Raj,18, I would like to propose a salon topic.,8
41193,Amy,18," Ooh, please do, Rajesh.",8
41194,Raj,18, The lead in The Hunger Games is a woman. Marvel has made Tor a female.,8
41195,Penny,18," Wait, who‰Ûªs Tor?",8
41196,Raj,18," You know, Tor, the God of Tunder. As I was saying, is this a sign that our society is approaching gender equality?",8
41197,Howard,18, Certainly a lot more women are reading comic books now.,8
41198,Stuart,18," It‰Ûªs true. At the store, I had to put a seat on the toilet.",8
41199,Amy,18, We won‰Ûªt know if there‰Ûªs equality until female Thor has a baby and the Avengers are cool with her pumping breast milk at work.,8
41200,Howard,18, I wonder if only a baby who is worthy can suckle at the bosom of Thor.,8
41201,Penny,18," Okay, new salon topic. Salons, dumb thing from a long time ago or interesting thing made dumb by talking about superheroes? Discuss.",8
41202,Sheldon,18, I don‰Ûªt believe it matters what the topic is. What‰Ûªs crucial for a salon is that we conduct the discussion in an elevated and insightful way. It‰Ûªs all about the execution.,8
41203,Leonard,18," Of course you‰Ûªd focus on that rather than the inspiration. Uh, new salon topic. What‰Ûªs more important, an idea or its execution?",8
41204,Bernadette,18," Oh, that‰Ûªs fine.",8
41205,Sheldon,18," Yeah, good for you, Leonard. That‰Ûªs a lovely little notion. Kind of like, I wish I could talk to my uncle in Chicago. Yeah, now stand back while I invent the telephone. Hello? Oh, hold on. Leonard, it‰Ûªs your uncle. He says you just got burned.",8
41206,Amy,18, Sheldon.,8
41207,Penny,18, Guys.,8
41208,Leonard,18," No, it‰Ûªs okay. We‰Ûªre all adults trying to have an intelligent discussion. At least I am. Howard, what do you think?",8
41209,Howard,18," Well, I guess, as an engineer, I lean towards execution. I spend my days trying to take ideas and make them real.",8
41210,Sheldon,18," Well said, old chap. I thought eloquence had died, here it stands before us. Starting today, it‰Ûªll go Gettysburg Address, I have a dream, and what he just said.",8
41211,Leonard,18," Oh, now he‰Ûªs a genius? All you ever do is make fun of him and engineering.",8
41212,Sheldon,18," Leonard, please. His mother just died.",8
41213,Leonard,18, You‰Ûªre being ridiculous.,8
41214,Sheldon,18," Yeah, so are you.",8
41215,Penny,18," Guys, if I wanted to hear people be bitchy, I‰Ûªd go to my real salon.",8
41216,Sheldon,18," Leonard, lots of people could‰Ûªve had that idea, but very few people could‰Ûªve worked out the math the way I did.",8
41217,Leonard,18," Lots of people also didn‰Ûªt have that idea, like everyone in the entire world except for me.",8
41218,Sheldon,18," Oh, well, apparently Leonard thinks he‰Ûªs better than everyone in the whole world, including those fighting for our freedom. Yeah, well, I don‰Ûªt know about you, but I support our boys overseas.",8
41219,Amy,18, And girls.,8
41220,Sheldon,18," Hey, you already ruined Thor, give it a rest.",8
41221,Leonard,18, So I‰Ûªm just supposed to be okay with you hogging all the credit?,8
41222,Sheldon,18, I didn‰Ûªt hog anything. Unlike you and that weird lasagna with raisins in it.,8
41223,Leonard,18, You want some of this? I‰Ûªll give you some.,8
41224,Bernadette,18," Hey. Sheldon, Leonard, living room, right now!",8
41225,Sheldon,18," She said my name first, that must kill you.",8
41226,Bernadette (off),18," I don‰Ûªt know what you think you‰Ûªre doing, but this is a very difficult time for my husband. We‰Ûªre eating the last food his mother ever made, and you were gonna throw it at each other like children? Whatever it is you‰Ûªre fighting about, put it aside, go back in there and be a good friend to Howard or there‰Ûªs no dessert for either of you. Look at me when I‰Ûªm talking to you. And don‰Ûªt think‰Û_",8
41227,Howard,18, You guys ever notice sometimes Bernadette sounds like my mom?,8
41228,Amy,18, I don‰Ûªt hear it.,8
41229,Raj,18," No, not at all.",8
41230,Scene,18, Mrs Wolowitz‰Ûªs living room.,8
41231,Penny,18, I don‰Ûªt think I‰Ûªve eaten that much in my entire life.,8
41232,Howard,18, It‰Ûªs why my people wandered the desert for 40 years. Took that long to walk it off.,8
41233,Sheldon,18," You see, Penny, the Israelites were in the desert‰Û_",8
41234,Penny,18, Shut up.,8
41235,Ra,18, So glad you two are done fighting.,8
41236,Leonard,18," Right now, I‰Ûªm just trying to burp without throwing up.",8
41237,Sheldon,18, Hang on. Physics Today mentioned the paper.,8
41238,Stuart,18, What‰Ûªd they say?,8
41239,Amy,18, Who cares? Did they mention Leonard?,8
41240,Sheldon,18, They did.,8
41241,All,18, Yay.,8
41242,Bernadette,18," Good news, I found more Tums.",8
41243,All,18, Yay.,8
41244,Scene,19, The apartment. ,8
41245,Sheldon,19," Leonard, I‰Ûªve been working on an opening joke for our lecture at Berkeley.",8
41246,Leonard,19," Oh, I like to laugh. But say it anyway.",8
41247,Sheldon,19," Okay, um, what do you say to a graduate of the UC Berkeley physics department? I‰Ûªll have fries with that. Because his education hasn‰Ûªt prepared him for a career in the sciences.",8
41248,Penny,19," You know, when they chase you out of there, you only have to run faster than Sheldon.",8
41249,Amy,19, Are you all set for your trip?,8
41250,Sheldon,19," Yeah, I think so. I just restocked the old PRK.",8
41251,Penny,19, PRK?,8
41252,Leonard,19, Public restroom kit. Everything a boy needs for making pee pee in new and strange places.,8
41253,Sheldon,19, I don‰Ûªt see what‰Ûªs crazy about bringing a backpack with your own toilet paper and Purell.,8
41254,Leonard,19, Keep going.,8
41255,Sheldon,19," And rubber gloves, uh, air freshener. Um, noise-cancelling headphones. Oh, danger whistle. Um, pepper spray. Ooh, a multi-language occupied sign. Uh, let‰Ûªs see, we have seat protectors, uh, booties for my shoes, a clothespin for my nose. Oh, and a mirror on a stick, so I can make sure the person in the stall next to me isn‰Ûªt some kind of weirdo.",8
41256,Penny,19, You still worried some Berkeley girl is gonna steal him away?,8
41257,Amy,19," Yes, who do you think gave him the danger whistle?",8
41258,Scene,19, Leonard‰Ûªs car.,8
41259,Sheldon,19, Would you like to play a physics car game I invented called I Can‰Ûªt Spy? It‰Ûªs all the nail-biting tension of I Spy but the added fun of subatomic particles and waves outside the visible spectrum.,8
41260,Leonard,19," If it‰Ûªs half as much fun as One Times Ten to the Fourth Bottles of Beer on the Wall, I‰Ûªm in.",8
41261,Sheldon,19," I‰Ûªll begin. Uh, I can‰Ûªt spy with my little eye something passing right through us.",8
41262,Leonard,19, That soy Frappuccino I had.,8
41263,Sheldon,19, Will you please play the game? I can‰Ûªt spy with my little eye something passing right through us.,8
41264,Leonard,19," I don‰Ûªt know, um, if 65 billion solar neutrinos pass through a square centimetre every second, given the surface area of this car is about 60,000 square centimetres, that means 3.9 times ten to the 15th solar neutrinos?",8
41265,Sheldon,19, I don‰Ûªt want to play anymore.,8
41266,Leonard,19, We haven‰Ûªt been on a road trip in a while. This is fun.,8
41267,Sheldon,19," We get it, you won the game. Stop bragging.",8
41268,Leonard,19," No, listen, we wrote a paper together. Now we get to go to a university and talk about it? That‰Ûªs pretty cool.",8
41269,Sheldon,19," I suppose it is. In fact, if you‰Ûªd like to celebrate with a little music, I‰Ûªd be okay with that.",8
41270,Leonard,19, What? This road trip just got crazy.,8
41271,Sheldon,19," Play that funky music, white boy.",8
41272,Leonard,19, I‰Ûªm surprised you know that reference.,8
41273,Sheldon,19, What reference?,8
41274,Scene,19, Mrs Wolowitz‰Ûªs house.,8
41275,Bernadette,19," So, I put stickers on everything we‰Ûªre gonna sell. We just need help taking it all out to the driveway.",8
41276,Amy,19, Can I be in charge of pricing? I‰Ûªve been going to garage sales my whole life. Can you believe I got these pantyhose for a nickel?,8
41277,Howard,19," All right, Amy‰Ûªs in charge of pricing and being 75.",8
41278,Raj,19," Hey, Penny, can you give me a hand with this?",8
41279,Penny,19," Sure. Oh, we had one of these growing up. I used to play all the time.",8
41280,Raj,19," Oh, yeah? I love Ping-Pong.",8
41281,Penny,19," Oh, I meant beer pong.",8
41282,Amy,19," I had a table, too, but I didn‰Ûªt have any friends, so all I did was serve.",8
41283,Bernadette,19," You know, you can leave one side up and play against it.",8
41284,Amy,19," And if I had a friend, they might have told me that.",8
41285,Howard,19, Excuse me. Why is there a sticker on this? It‰Ûªs my TARDIS from Doctor Who. I was planning on moving it in the house.,8
41286,Bernadette,19, I think you just answered your own question.,8
41287,Howard,19," Come on, one day, this may double in value and be worth half what I paid for it.",8
41288,Bernadette,19," Sweetie, we have a lot to do. We don‰Ûªt need to decide this right now.",8
41289,Howard,19," Well, I guess as long as you‰Ûªre keeping an open mind.",8
41290,Bernadette,19, Of course.,8
41291,Scene,19," Leonard‰Ûªs car. ‰ÛÏPlay that funky music, white boy‰Û is playing on the stereo.",8
41292,Sheldon,19," So they‰Ûªre requesting that the white boy play the funky music, yes?",8
41293,Leonard,19, Yes.,8
41294,Sheldon,19, And this music we‰Ûªre listening to right now is funky as well?,8
41295,Leonard,19, Sure.,8
41296,Sheldon,19, Let me ask you this. Do you think this song is the music the white boy ultimately plays?,8
41297,Leonard,19, It could be.,8
41298,Sheldon,19," So it‰Ûªs like the musical equivalent of Russell‰Ûªs Paradox, the question of whether the set of all sets that don‰Ûªt contain themselves as members contains itself?",8
41299,Leonard,19, Exactly.,8
41300,Sheldon,19, Well then I hate it. Music should just be fun.,8
41301,Leonard,19, Making great time. Gonna be there pretty early.,8
41302,Sheldon,19, Will our hotel room be ready?,8
41303,Leonard,19, I doubt it.,8
41304,Sheldon,19, Aren‰Ûªt you worried that sitting in the lobby for a long period of time might attract the attention of the hotel detective?,8
41305,Leonard,19," If we do, we‰Ûªll just tell him to hit the bricks, see?",8
41306,Sheldon,19," Seems a little confrontational, but all right. You know, we won‰Ûªt be very far from Skywalker Ranch.",8
41307,Leonard,19," Oh, that‰Ûªs true. It‰Ûªs not like we can get in there.",8
41308,Sheldon,19, Why not?,8
41309,Leonard,19, I don‰Ûªt think George Lucas put his headquarters in the middle of nowhere because he wanted people dropping in.,8
41310,Sheldon,19," Yoda‰Ûªs swamp was in the middle of nowhere. Tatooine was in the middle of nowhere. Hoth was in the middle of nowhere. That‰Ûªs code, Leonard. He wants us to drop in.",8
41311,Leonard,19," We do have time. I mean, we could drive by and just look at it.",8
41312,Sheldon,19," Yes. Oh, I‰Ûªm so excited. And I just can‰Ûªt hide it.",8
41313,Leonard,19," I‰Ûªm about to lose control, and I think I like it.",8
41314,Sheldon,19, What are you talking about?,8
41315,Scene,19, Mrs Wolowitz‰Ûªs house. ,8
41316,Penny,19, So when do you guys think you‰Ûªre gonna move in?,8
41317,Howard,19, We‰Ûªre still figuring how much remodeling we want to do.,8
41318,Bernadette,19, It‰Ûªs tricky finding the right balance between tasteful modern and Jewish mother tchotchke crapfest.,8
41319,Amy,19, Have you made a decision about the TARDIS? I think I can sell it if we call it Big British Porta-Potty.,8
41320,Howard,19," We‰Ûªre not selling it, it‰Ûªs mine.",8
41321,Bernadette,19, You can‰Ûªt just decide. How about I arm-wrestle you?,8
41322,Howard,19, That‰Ûªs not fair. It‰Ûªs like me challenging you to a sexy pants contest.,8
41323,Raj,19, You could play Ping-Pong for it.,8
41324,Howard,19, I would do that.,8
41325,Bernadette,19, How is that fair? You grew up with a table.,8
41326,Howard,19," Yes, but I mostly used it as a battlefield in an ongoing war between the Transformers and the ThunderCats for control of a bra I had found in the woods.",8
41327,Penny,19," Bernadette, for every episode of Doctor Who Leonard has made me sit through, I will play on your behalf and send that TARDIS back to Gallifrey, where I hate that I know it belongs.",8
41328,Bernadette,19," Yes, Penny plays for me.",8
41329,Howard,19," That‰Ûªs not fair, she has upper body muscles.",8
41330,Raj,19," Dude, three-time Sanskriti School for Well-Born Boys badminton champion.",8
41331,Howard,19," That‰Ûªs right, okay, Raj can play for me.",8
41332,Amy,19," Ooh, you just chose champions. It‰Ûªs like we‰Ûªre re-enacting the ancient German practice of trial by combat.",8
41333,Penny,19," Yeah, it‰Ûªs also like when the Mountain fought the Red Viper in Game of Thrones.",8
41334,Bernadette,19," Leonard makes you watch that, too?",8
41335,Penny,19," No, no, I like that show. It‰Ûªs got dragons and people doing it.",8
41336,Howard,19, So it‰Ûªs settled. The fate of Doctor Who‰Ûªs TARDIS will be decided by a Game of Thrones inspired death-match on the battlefield of ThunderCats versus Transformers.,8
41337,Amy,19," If you still have that bra, I‰Ûªll give you a nickel for it.",8
41338,Scene,19, Leonard‰Ûªs car. ,8
41339,Sheldon,19, There it is. It‰Ûªs just a gate. On a road.,8
41340,Leonard,19, Wasn‰Ûªt even that hard to find.,8
41341,Sheldon,19, This is so amazing.,8
41342,Leonard,19, I know. You want to get a picture?,8
41343,Sheldon,19, I want more than a picture. I want to go in.,8
41344,Leonard,19," Well, so do I, but they‰Ûªll never let us.",8
41345,Sheldon,19, Is that the attitude that helped you get Penny?,8
41346,Leonard,19," No, but I don‰Ûªt have three years to make that gate feel sorry for me.",8
41347,Sheldon,19," There‰Ûªs a speaker box. Drive up, push the button, and let‰Ûªs see what happens.",8
41348,Leonard,19," Okay, yeah. What do we have to lose? I‰Ûªm a little nervous.",8
41349,Sheldon,19," Well, get over it. Confidence is key in these situations.",8
41350,Leonard,19, Right.,8
41351,Sheldon,19," You pushed it, are you out of your mind?",8
41352,Voice,19, May I help you?,8
41353,Leonard,19," Um, uh, uh, uh, we don‰Ûªt have an appointment, and, and we don‰Ûªt belong here, but we, we‰Ûªre, like, crazy-big fans. I mean uh, buh, buh, crazy for Star Wars crazy, not crazy like we have a backpack full of duct tape, although we do have a backpack that you really don‰Ûªt want to look in.",8
41354,Sheldon,19, You‰Ûªre blowing it. We want to meet George Lucas and become his friends and play with him.,8
41355,Voice,19," Hello? This speaker‰Ûªs not working, just pull up.",8
41356,Leonard,19, And that‰Ûªs how it‰Ûªs done.,8
41357,Scene,19," The same, further inside the ranch. ",8
41358,Sheldon,19," All right, we‰Ûªve defeated the first challenge. Now we must steel ourselves to face the monster who defends the gate.",8
41359,Leonard,19," We‰Ûªre trying to get past a security guard, not rescue Zelda.",8
41360,Sheldon,19," I think what really needs to be rescued is your sense of whimsy, but one quest at a time. So what‰Ûªs the plan?",8
41361,Leonard,19," Uh, I‰Ûªm just gonna be honest with the guy.",8
41362,Sheldon,19, Honesty will never get us in.,8
41363,Leonard,19," Well, what‰Ûªs your plan?",8
41364,Sheldon,19," All right, my plan is predicated on the assumption that they have a nurse‰Ûªs office and your willingness to be lightly stabbed.",8
41365,Security Guard,19, Who are you here to see?,8
41366,Leonard,19," Uh, I‰Ûªm just gonna tell you the truth.",8
41367,Sheldon,19," Oh, you are killing me.",8
41368,Leonard,19," We don‰Ûªt have an appointment. We, we‰Ûªre just fans of Mr. Lucas‰Ûªs work, and we thought we‰Ûªd take a shot and see if we could get in and look around.",8
41369,Security Guard,19," Sorry, guys, we get this a lot. Can‰Ûªt let you in.",8
41370,Sheldon,19, What if I told you that I was the voice of Yoda? A recording session I must attend.,8
41371,Leonard,19," I‰Ûªm sorry, don‰Ûªt listen to him. We‰Ûªre actually physicists. We‰Ûªre giving a lecture at Berkeley later today. We just, we had some time to kill.",8
41372,Security Guard,19," Hey, listen, you seem like decent guys. I can‰Ûªt let you in, but I got some hats and T-shirts I can give you.",8
41373,Leonard,19, Thank you so much. See? Maybe honesty is the best‰Û_ What are you doing?,8
41374,Sheldon,19," Shedding the yoke of my oppressors, you blind, sad little man.",8
41375,Security Guard,19," Don‰Ûªt move. Code A-A-23, A-A-23.",8
41376,Voice,19, Copy.,8
41377,Sheldon,19," I can see the ranch, Leonard. Oh, it‰Ûªs rustic, it‰Ûªs lovely. I‰Ûªd take a picture, but people are chasing me. I‰Ûªm gonna make it. I‰Ûªm gonna make it. They have Tasers, but they wouldn‰Ûªt dare use‰Û_ Aaaaaaagh!",8
41378,Scene,19, Mrs Wolowitz‰Ûªs house. ,8
41379,Howard,19," Come on, Raj. You are the King Kong of Ping-Pong. You are the menace of table tennis. Put her away, ‰Ûªcause I don‰Ûªt have a third one. Yes. Woo.",8
41380,Amy,19," Rajesh eight, Penny four.",8
41381,Penny,19," Sorry, he‰Ûªs really good.",8
41382,Bernadette,19," Hey, Raj. if Howard can‰Ûªt keep the TARDIS, how great would it look at your place?",8
41383,Raj,19, What?,8
41384,Howard,19," Yeah, what?",8
41385,Bernadette,19," I don‰Ûªt know much about Doctor Who, but if, um, you were to put this right outside your front door and open up the back, it would be like your entire apartment was the inside of the TARDIS, which is pretty cool ‰Ûªcause on the show, the inside of the TARDIS is bigger than the outside. But then again, I don‰Ûªt know much about<i> Doctor Who.",8
41386,Howard,19," Don‰Ûªt listen to her. You and I go way back, we‰Ûªre like brothers.",8
41387,Raj,19," We are. We are. Oh, no. What a terrible serve. Sorry, brother.",8
41388,Amy,19, Eight-five.,8
41389,Howard,19," This is ridiculous. I want a new champion. Amy, were you serious about being able to serve?",8
41390,Amy,19," Uh, it, it‰Ûªs been a long time. I don‰Ûªt know. I‰Ûªm probably pretty rusty.",8
41391,Penny,19, Wow.,8
41392,Howard,19, She‰Ûªs my champion.,8
41393,Bernadette,19," Well, if you can switch champions, so can I. I want Raj.",8
41394,Penny,19, Hey.,8
41395,Bernadette,19," Oh, come on, like you even care.",8
41396,Penny,19," I care. Oh, wait, no, I don‰Ûªt. Good luck, Raj.",8
41397,Howard,19," You know, I thought our friendship meant more to you.",8
41398,Raj,19, So did I.,8
41399,Scene,19, An office in Skywalker Ranch. ,8
41400,Sheldon,19, Do you think they‰Ûªre gonna call the police?,8
41401,Leonard,19, I don‰Ûªt know. Maybe they‰Ûªll call Imperial Officers to take us to a holding cell on the Death Star.,8
41402,Sheldon,19," Oh, I think that‰Ûªs below the pay grade of an Imperial Officer. Stormtroopers are really the ones who‰Û_",8
41403,Leonard,19," Oh, shut up.",8
41404,Nerdy Guy,19," He‰Ûªs right. Uh, Stormtroopers actually combine both the function of infantry and military police.",8
41405,Leonard,19," Uh-huh, I‰Ûªm normally very nice, but you shut up, too.",8
41406,Sheldon,19," So, what are you in for?",8
41407,Nerdy Guy,19," Honestly, I just wanted to meet Mr. Lucas and say thank you. You know, growing up, the movies had such an impact on my life. I never really fit in anywhere. Till I discovered the worlds he created and finally found a place where I belong.",8
41408,Sheldon,19, But why are you here?,8
41409,Nerdy Guy,19," Oh, I, uh, I hopped a fence, and they caught me in the sculpture gallery making out with a Chewbacca statue.",8
41410,Sheldon,19," Excuse me. Leonard, they have a sculpture gallery.",8
41411,Security Guard,19," All right, I talked to my supervisor, and we‰Ûªre gonna let you go with a warning. But if you ever come back, we will call the police and press charges.",8
41412,Leonard,19, We understand. Thank you so much.,8
41413,Nerdy Guy,19," Uh, what about me?",8
41414,Security Guard,19," No, you‰Ûªre not going anywhere, kissy face. Let‰Ûªs go. I have to take your picture to post at the guard gate.",8
41415,Sheldon,19," Uh, one question about that picture. Can it be with George Lucas? Ooh, grumpy you are.",8
41416,Scene,19, Mrs Wolowitz‰Ûªs house.,8
41417,Howard,19," Okay, this is the match that decides it all. First to 11 wins. Serve switches every five points. And just so you know, when this started, I was going to put the TARDIS in a discreet corner of the house, but I‰Ûªve since turned mean, and now it‰Ûªs going right in the middle of the living room on a rotating platform with a sign that says suck it. Game on.",8
41418,Bernadette,19," Except, Raj is gonna win. Isn‰Ûªt that right, Raj?",8
41419,Raj,19," Uh, yeah, I mean, her serve was pretty good.",8
41420,Bernadette,19," Come on, get in her head. Be intimidating.",8
41421,Raj,19," Okay, uh, I‰Ûªm gonna own you, bitch.",8
41422,Penny,19, Whoa.,8
41423,Bernadette,19, Hey.,8
41424,Amy,19, That‰Ûªs not nice.,8
41425,Raj,19, Let‰Ûªs just play.,8
41426,Howard,19," One-zero. Two. Three. Four. Five-nothing. Wait, did you play badminton or sad-minton?",8
41427,Bernadette,19," Don‰Ûªt listen to him, all she‰Ûªs got is a serve. Now, grab a fresh tampon and put her away.",8
41428,Raj,19," What, and that‰Ûªs not offensive? Where‰Ûªs the line?",8
41429,Penny,19, It‰Ûªs in your purse. Play.,8
41430,Bernadette,19, One-five. Two-five. Three-five. Four-five. Five-five.,8
41431,Howard,19, Six. Seven. Eight. Nine. Ten-five.,8
41432,Bernadette,19, Six. Seven. Eight. Nine. Ten-ten.,8
41433,Amy,19," Well, that was an exciting 40 seconds.",8
41434,Howard,19," It was, and now the serve is back to you, and the game is over.",8
41435,Bernadette,19," You know, Amy, I, uh, can‰Ûªt help but wonder how Sheldon would react if the TARDIS was at your place.",8
41436,Howard,19," Don‰Ûªt listen to her, just hit the ball.",8
41437,Amy,19, Keep talking.,8
41438,Scene,19, Amy‰Ûªs apartment. ,8
41439,Bernadette,19," If this doesn‰Ûªt get him into your bedroom, nothing will.",8
41440,Scene,19, The stairwell.,8
41441,Sheldon,19, Are you still mad at me?,8
41442,Leonard,19," Yes, we missed our lecture, we were almost arrested, and you got me locked in a room with a man who forced his tongue down the throat of a stuffed Wookiee.",8
41443,Sheldon,19," Boy, some people are just glass-half-empty.",8
41444,Leonard,19," The glass is empty, Sheldon. It‰Ûªs completely empty. If you gave that glass to a man who was dying of thirst, he would be dead, do you know why?",8
41445,Sheldon,19," Before I answer, was he a smoker? I think you‰Ûªre looking at this all wrong.",8
41446,Leonard,19," Fine, then tell me how I should be looking at it.",8
41447,Sheldon,19," Well, not only did we go to Skywalker Ranch, we got in. And no one we know can say that. And for all the times you find me irritating, today you got to watch someone shoot me with a Taser.",8
41448,Leonard,19, That part was pretty good.,8
41449,Sheldon,19, See?,8
41450,Leonard,19, You did flop around a lot.,8
41451,Sheldon,19, I‰Ûªll take your word for it. I was too busy trying not to defecate.,8
41452,Leonard,19," You know, when they were escorting us to the detaining room, I looked through a door, and I‰Ûªm pretty sure I saw a display case with the Ark of the Covenant.",8
41453,Sheldon,19, That‰Ûªs amazing.,8
41454,Leonard,19, I know.,8
41455,Sheldon,19," And I saw Jabba the Hutt riding by on a motorcycle. Although that was right after the Tasing, so who can say for sure?",8
41456,Leonard,19, I guess this could count as an adventure.,8
41457,Sheldon,19," It was. And even though we‰Ûªre not allowed back there, they can never take today away from us. Unlike my sense of smell, which hasn‰Ûªt returned since the Tasing. No, I got nothing.",8
41458,Scene,19, Amy‰Ûªs bedroom. ,8
41459,Sheldon,19," Amy, the Daleks are right on my tail, quick, we need to reset the time circuits. Oh, no, I left my sonic screwdriver behind.",8
41460,Amy,19, Really should have thought this through.,8
41461,Scene,20, The cafeteria.,8
41462,Raj,20, You‰Ûªre wrong.,8
41463,Howard,20," No, I‰Ûªm not.",8
41464,Raj,20," Yes, you are.",8
41465,Howard,20," No, I‰Ûªm not. Settle this. Those little animated pictures on the Internet, are they called gifs or jifs?",8
41466,Leonard,20," Well, the G stands for graphics. That‰Ûªs a hard G, so I‰Ûªd say gif.",8
41467,Raj,20, The guy who invented it says it‰Ûªs jif.,8
41468,Howard,20," I‰Ûªm sorry, do you mean the guy or the juy?",8
41469,Sheldon,20," Well, I‰Ûªll give you three guesses why I‰Ûªm so irritated.",8
41470,Howard,20, Something happened different from the way you wanted it.,8
41471,Sheldon,20," I guess news travels fast. It‰Ûªs true, a select group of scientists was invited to a weekend symposium at a former home of Richard Feynman, and I wasn‰Ûªt included.",8
41472,Leonard,20," Oh, Sheldon, I‰Ûªm sure it‰Ûªs not because they don‰Ûªt think you‰Ûªre an elite scientist.",8
41473,Howard,20," Yeah, I bet you anything it‰Ûªs just ‰Ûªcause you‰Ûªre a pain in the ass.",8
41474,Sheldon,20, You‰Ûªre just saying that to make me feel better.,8
41475,Leonard,20," Look, you can spend the rest of the day being bitter about this.",8
41476,Sheldon,20, Agreed.,8
41477,Leonard,20," I was gonna say or, but why bother?",8
41478,Scene,20, Mrs Wolowitz‰Ûªs house.,8
41479,Bernadette,20," Hey, Raj.",8
41480,Raj,20," Hey, I got you a little gift.",8
41481,Bernadette,20," Oh, that‰Ûªs a lot of Girl Scout Cookies.",8
41482,Raj,20," You know me. I‰Ûªm from India. I can‰Ûªt resist children begging. So, how‰Ûªs it going with the title to the house?",8
41483,Howard,20," Great, it‰Ûªs all done. The lawyer tracked down my father and got him to sign it over. I didn‰Ûªt have to meet him, I didn‰Ûªt have to talk to him, I don‰Ûªt even know where he is.",8
41484,Raj,20," Wow, so you‰Ûªre not curious at all?",8
41485,Howard,20, Nope.,8
41486,Raj,20," Hmm. What if he‰Ûªs in prison? What if he‰Ûªs a spy? What if he‰Ûªs in a Beatles cover band? I‰Ûªm just saying, if he‰Ûªs got your nose and haircut, he‰Ûªd make a killer Ringo.",8
41487,Scene,20, Penny‰Ûªs apartment.,8
41488,Wil Wheaton,20, Thanks again for agreeing to do this.,8
41489,Penny,20," Oh, it‰Ûªs cool, I‰Ûªve never been on a podcast before.",8
41490,Leonard,20," Well, you picked a good one to start. Wil‰Ûªs had lots of great guests. Jonathan Frakes, Brent Spiner, Michael Dorn, Gates McFadden.",8
41491,Penny,20, Those are Star Trek people.,8
41492,Leonard,20, Yes.,8
41493,Penny,20, I only figured that out because I‰Ûªve never heard of any of them.,8
41494,Wil,20, I deserve that. I invited you on my show and I drove here.,8
41495,Penny,20, Sorry.,8
41496,Wil,20," Okay, so, this is basically gonna be just like a little talk show. Uh, we‰Ûªre gonna take some calls, we‰Ûªll talk about what it was like on the set of Serial Ape-ist 2. It should be really fun.",8
41497,Leonard,20, This is exciting.,8
41498,Penny,20," Yeah, so, how many people listen?",8
41499,Wil,20," Most people download it later, but usually a few thousand people listen live.",8
41500,Penny,20, What? A few thousand people listen to you talk about nerd stuff?,8
41501,Wil,20," Again, right in the ears, straight to the feelings.",8
41502,Scene,20, The apartment. ,8
41503,Amy,20, Can you please pass the salt?,8
41504,Sheldon,20, Sure. It‰Ûªs not like I was invited to Richard Feynman‰Ûªs house and have anything better to do.,8
41505,Amy,20, Is this how the rest of the night‰Ûªs going to be?,8
41506,Sheldon,20," I don‰Ûªt know the future. Do you think there‰Ûªs a chance that an asteroid could hit the Earth, destroying Feynman‰Ûªs house and everyone in it?",8
41507,Amy,20," No, Sheldon.",8
41508,Sheldon,20," Then buckle up, you‰Ûªre in for a cranky night.",8
41509,Amy,20," According to the codicil of the Relationship Agreement which you insisted upon, we‰Ûªre not allowed to pout or be moody on date night.",8
41510,Sheldon,20, You know I just put that in because of uterus stuff.,8
41511,Amy,20," Well, it applies to you, too.",8
41512,Sheldon,20," I was afraid you might bring this up, so I have a work-around. There you go. As far as you‰Ûªre concerned, I‰Ûªm smiling. Although, I must admit, I‰Ûªm smiling a little bit at the moment because this loophole is so brilliant.",8
41513,Scene,20, Mrs Wolowitz‰Ûªs house.,8
41514,Raj,20," So, Bernadette, have you thought about how you‰Ûªre going to redecorate this place?",8
41515,Bernadette,20," You know, I‰Ûªm thinking ripping up the carpets, maybe lose the wallpaper, all new light fixtures.",8
41516,Raj,20," You know, if you knocked out this wall, it would give you an open floor plan, and then, it‰Ûªs a little scary, but could be fun, indoor fire pit.",8
41517,Howard,20," Hey, I grew up in this house, okay? No one‰Ûªs knocking anything down.",8
41518,Bernadette,20," Okay, okay. When he‰Ûªs at Comic-Con, I‰Ûªm bringing in a wrecking ball.",8
41519,Howard (answering door),20, Can I help you?,8
41520,Guy at door,20, Hi. Are you Howard Wolowitz?,8
41521,Howard,20, Yes.,8
41522,Guy,20," Um, this is a little weird, but a lawyer was trying to contact my father, because his name was still on the title for this house.",8
41523,Howard,20," Wuh, uh, who‰Ûªs your father?",8
41524,Guy,20, Sam Wolowitz.,8
41525,Howard,20, Sam Wolowitz is my father.,8
41526,Guy,20, I know.,8
41527,Howard,20," Well, wait, so if we have the same father, are, are you saying you‰Ûªre my half-brother?",8
41528,Guy,20, I think so.,8
41529,Howard,20," Bernadette, weird things are happening out here.",8
41530,Scene,20, Penny‰Ûªs apartment. ,8
41531,Wil,20," Uh, spoiler alert, after the monkey sees, it kills.",8
41532,Leonard,20, Psst.,8
41533,Wil,20," I‰Ûªve just been handed a note. I‰Ûªm going to read it. Wil, do you want more Diet Coke? Also, we have juice.",8
41534,Leonard,20," I, I didn‰Ûªt want to interrupt.",8
41535,Wil,20," Uh, that voice you just heard belongs to Leonard, Penny‰Ûªs fiancÌ©. Uh, Leonard, why don‰Ûªt you grab some headphones and join us?",8
41536,Leonard,20, Really?,8
41537,Wil,20, Yeah.,8
41538,Leonard,20," Hey, great.",8
41539,Wil,20," So, while Leonard gets set up, let‰Ûªs take a call. Hello, caller, you are on with Penny and Wil from Serial Ape-ist 2.",8
41540,Caller,20," I don‰Ûªt have a question. I just want to say I‰Ûªm a big fan of the movie. I‰Ûªve seen it, like, ten times.",8
41541,Penny,20," Okay, well, I‰Ûªll apologize for the first time, but the other nine are on you.",8
41542,Wil,20," Thanks a lot, caller. You know that the movie actually has a little bit of a cult following.",8
41543,Penny,20, Really?,8
41544,Wil,20," Yeah. I was at a science-fiction convention, and I saw a woman dressed as your half-ape character.",8
41545,Leonard,20," Oh, if she was with an Indian guy dressed like a banana, that was just my friends, Howard and Raj.",8
41546,Wil,20," All right, it‰Ûªs time for a very special guest caller, a friend of mine, who you probably know as the director of such movies as Clerks, or from podcasts and books where he often reminds you that he‰Ûªs the guy who directed Clerks. Hello, Kevin Smith.",8
41547,Kevn,20," Hey, man, yo, is everything okay, Wil? ‰Û÷Cause it‰Ûªs been, like, two minutes and you haven‰Ûªt even brought up Stand By Me.",8
41548,Penny,20," Hey, Kevin. It‰Ûªs really exciting to talk to you.",8
41549,Leonard,20, It really is.,8
41550,Kevin,20," Oh, you guys are very sweet. So, Penny, listen, I saw your movie.",8
41551,Penny,20," Oh, wow. I wish it was better.",8
41552,Wil,20," Oh, don‰Ûªt worry about it. Have you seen some of Kevin‰Ûªs films?",8
41553,Kevin,20," You‰Ûªre cruisin‰Ûª for a beatin‰Ûª, Wheaton. Anyway, man, I dug the ape movie, Penny. And I thought you were, like, really great in it.",8
41554,Penny,20, Aw.,8
41555,Wil,20," You know, I‰Ûªm in the movie, too.",8
41556,Kevin,20," Yeah, whatever. Penny. Penny, how come you‰Ûªre not in more stuff, man? I‰Ûªd cast you in a minute.",8
41557,Penny,20, Seriously?,8
41558,Kevin,20," Oh, yeah, man. I‰Ûªm actually in pre-production on a movie right now. Way different than anything I‰Ûªve ever done before. It‰Ûªs called Clerks 3. You should come over and read for a part.",8
41559,Penny,20," Oh, my, I would love that.",8
41560,Leonard,20, You have a new job.,8
41561,Penny,20," Well, maybe I can do both.",8
41562,Leonard,20, I don‰Ûªt think you can do both.,8
41563,Penny,20, I don‰Ûªt think I asked you.,8
41564,Kevin,20," Yeah, you tell him, Penny.",8
41565,Leonard,20," Stay out of it, Kevin Smith.",8
41566,Scene,20, The apartment. ,8
41567,Sheldon,20, Do you think there comes a point in life when it stops feeling bad to be left out of things?,8
41568,Amy,20, Probably not. It‰Ûªs an evolutionary advantage to be included in group activities.,8
41569,Sheldon,20," You know what? I used to be a fan of evolution, but I‰Ûªve since evolved, and now I think it‰Ûªs dumb.",8
41570,Amy,20, Being left out is a terrible feeling. No one understands that better than I do.,8
41571,Sheldon,20," Hey, look at that. Even in your example, you‰Ûªre all by yourself.",8
41572,Amy,20," When there was a lice epidemic at my school, everybody got it except me. I tried to fool everyone by sprinkling sugar in my hair, but I just got attacked by bees.",8
41573,Sheldon,20," I can just picture them all right now at Feynman‰Ûªs house, probably discussing Schrodinger and at the same time, not discussing Schrodinger. See? They‰Ûªre missing out on hilarious jokes like that.",8
41574,Amy,20," And at the same time, not.",8
41575,Sheldon,20, It reminds me of when my stupid brother and sister would build forts in the living room and wouldn‰Ûªt let me in. I hated that so much.,8
41576,Amy,20," You know, there‰Ûªs nothing I can do about getting you invited to the symposium, but if you wanted, we could build a fort.",8
41577,Sheldon,20, Isn‰Ûªt that a little juvenile?,8
41578,Amy,20, More juvenile than this?,8
41579,Sheldon,20, I‰Ûªll get the blankets. You Google how to have childlike fun.,8
41580,Scene,20, Mrs Wolowitz‰Ûªs house.,8
41581,Howard,20," You know what, I‰Ûªm being a bad host. Let me get some more coffee.",8
41582,Bernadette,20," Oh, let me do it, Howard.",8
41583,Howard,20," No, I got it.",8
41584,Bernadette,20," So, Josh, what do you do?",8
41585,Josh,20, I‰Ûªm studying oceanography down in San Diego.,8
41586,Bernadette,20," Oh, how nice. I loved Finding Nemo.",8
41587,Raj,20, Enough chitchat. How do we know you are who you say you are?,8
41588,Josh,20, Why would I lie?,8
41589,Raj,20," Okay, you got me there. You here looking for money?",8
41590,Josh,20, No.,8
41591,Raj,20," A kidney, cornea, piece of his liver?",8
41592,Josh,20, No.,8
41593,Raj,20, You‰Ûªre in a Beatles cover band and you need Howard to replace your dad as Ringo.,8
41594,Bernadette,20, Why don‰Ûªt you help with the coffee?,8
41595,Raj,20," Okay, but something smells fishy. And not just because you work around sea animals. That actually sounds interesting, and I‰Ûªd like to learn more about it. Hey, you okay?",8
41596,Howard,20," Not really. This guy shows up out of the blue, and now I have a brother? My father has another family?",8
41597,Raj,20, I get it. What do you want to do?,8
41598,Howard,20," I don‰Ûªt know. I, I‰Ûªd just like him to go away. I can‰Ûªt deal with this.",8
41599,Raj,20," All right, I‰Ûªve got your back.",8
41600,Howard,20," Thank you. Come on. And I‰Ûªd like to point out, this wall just provided a lot of privacy.",8
41601,Josh,20, I can‰Ûªt believe my brother‰Ûªs an astronaut. That‰Ûªs amazing. What was it like?,8
41602,Raj,20," Listen, dude, it‰Ûªs time for you to hit the road.",8
41603,Howard,20," Hey, hey, the young man asked a good question.",8
41604,Scene,20, Penny‰Ûªs apartment. ,8
41605,Wil,20," So, for those of you just tuning in, we are listening to a really fun fight between my co-star‰Û_",8
41606,Leonard,20," No, no, no. We‰Ûªre not fighting, we‰Ûªre just having a conversation.",8
41607,Wil,20," All right. We‰Ûªre listening to a really fun conversation between my co-star from Serial Ape-ist 2 and her fiancÌ©, who doesn‰Ûªt believe women should have dreams.",8
41608,Leonard,20, Give me back that juice.,8
41609,Penny,20, What is the harm if I audition?,8
41610,Leonard,20," Well, what if you get it?",8
41611,Penny,20," I don‰Ûªt know, I make a movie, become rich and famous, win an Oscar, a Golden Globe and live an incredibly wonderful life.",8
41612,Leonard,20, From a Kevin Smith movie?,8
41613,Kevin,20," Oh, I‰Ûªm hanging up now.",8
41614,Wil,20," Don‰Ûªt you listen to him, buddy. You‰Ûªre awesome. You‰Ûªre one of the greatest directors of our time.",8
41615,Kevin,20," I don‰Ûªt have a part for you, Wheaton.",8
41616,Wil,20, And that was Kevin Smith.,8
41617,Penny,20, Thanks a lot.,8
41618,Leonard,20, I‰Ûªm just trying to protect you. How many times did I see you get your heart broken trying to make it as an actress?,8
41619,Penny,20," Okay, instead of protecting me, why don‰Ûªt you try being excited when something good happens?",8
41620,Leonard,20, I‰Ûªm always excited for you. I‰Ûªm excited that you found this new job where you‰Ûªre making decent money.,8
41621,Penny,20, Decent? I make twice what you make.,8
41622,Leonard,20," Wait, twice?",8
41623,Penny,20, Yeah.,8
41624,Leonard,20," Like, times two twice?",8
41625,Wil,20," For those of you at home, Leonard just found out his fiancÌ©e makes way more money than he does. Let‰Ûªs listen.",8
41626,Leonard,20, I went to school for half my life. I have a doctorate. I‰Ûªm still paying off college loans.,8
41627,Penny,20," Well, how much do you owe? Maybe I can help you out.",8
41628,Leonard,20," Wil, can we just turn off the podcast for a little bit?",8
41629,Wil,20," For those of you at home, I am shaking my head no.",8
41630,Scene,20, The apartment. Including fort.,8
41631,Amy,20," How‰Ûªs it going, Sheldon?",8
41632,Sheldon,20, Wonderful. I just finished hanging the lights.,8
41633,Amy,20, Can I come in?,8
41634,Sheldon,20," Yes, oh, but enter through the side. Batman is a load-bearing blanket.",8
41635,Amy,20, Amazing.,8
41636,Sheldon,20, I know. This isn‰Ûªt the printout. This is my real face.,8
41637,Amy,20, What are we doing? This is a fort. Let‰Ûªs sit on the floor.,8
41638,Sheldon,20, Roughing it? Okay. Everything looks so big from down here. This must be how Leonard feels.,8
41639,Scene,20, Mrs Wolowitz‰Ûªs house.,8
41640,Howard,20," I‰Ûªm surprised you could hear me with this Thin Mint in your ear. Yeah, pretty cool, huh?",8
41641,Josh,20," Yeah. Anyway, I should probably get going.",8
41642,Bernadette,20," Howie, have you noticed how often people say that when you start to do magic?",8
41643,Josh,20," Sorry, I have a long drive.",8
41644,Howard,20," Well, I hope I get to see you again.",8
41645,Josh,20," I hope so, too. I‰Ûªve always dreamed of having a brother to play catch with.",8
41646,Bernadette,20, Keep dreaming.,8
41647,Howard,20," Hey, I threw out the first pitch at an Angels game.",8
41648,Josh,20, Wow.,8
41649,Bernadette,20, He did it with a robot.,8
41650,Josh,20, You had sex with a robot?,8
41651,Howard,20, That‰Ûªs not what she meant.,8
41652,Raj,20," But technically, yes.",8
41653,Scene,20, Penny‰Ûªs apartment. ,8
41654,Leonard,20," Hang on, if you‰Ûªre making all this money, where is it?",8
41655,Penny,20, In a safe place.,8
41656,Leonard,20," What does that mean, under your bed?",8
41657,Penny,20," No, it means a diversified portfolio of stocks and bonds. I‰Ûªm not overly conservative. I‰Ûªm young, so my guy said I can afford to take some risks.",8
41658,Leonard,20," Wait a minute, you have a guy?",8
41659,Penny,20, Don‰Ûªt you have a guy?,8
41660,Leonard,20, Why would I have a guy? I don‰Ûªt have any money.,8
41661,Penny,20," Oh, sweetie, you should really get some money.",8
41662,Wil,20," For those of you listening at home, how great is this?",8
41663,Leonard,20," Wil, I‰Ûªm begging you, just please turn that off.",8
41664,Wil,20, Sure. And we‰Ûªre back.,8
41665,Penny,20," Leonard, why are you making such a big deal out of this? So our roles have changed a bit over the last couple years. This is the way life is. And I‰Ûªm sure in time they‰Ûªll change again.",8
41666,Leonard,20," Great, you‰Ûªre not only more successful than me, now you‰Ûªre more mature.",8
41667,Penny,20," Okay, look, would it make you feel better if I did something dumb like sneak out of work one day to go audition for a Kevin Smith movie?",8
41668,Leonard,20," That would be great, thank you.",8
41669,Wil,20," I‰Ûªm just gonna jump in here real quick. Leonard, a moment ago, you were dead set against Penny resuming her acting career, but now you‰Ûªre all for it. Is it fair to say that she played you like a violin?",8
41670,Leonard,20," Yes, it is, Wil.",8
41671,Scene,20, Mrs Wolowitz‰Ûªs house.,8
41672,Josh,20," So, I have to ask, was the robot sexy?",8
41673,Howard,20, It was actually just a mechanical hand.,8
41674,Josh,20," ‰Û÷Cause that‰Ûªs all you need, right?",8
41675,Howard,20, You are my brother.,8
41676,Scene,20, The fort.,8
41677,Sheldon,20," Okay, so the final four forts in the first annual best fort ever contest, or fort off, are, Fort Knox, Fort Ticonderoga, Fort Sumter and Fort Cozy McBlanket.",8
41678,Amy,20," I‰Ûªd say, Knox over Ticonderoga, ‰Ûªcause it‰Ûªs got the gold.",8
41679,Sheldon,20, Mm-hmm.,8
41680,Amy,20, And McBlanket over Sumter ‰Ûªcause it has a higher thread count. Oh. Ten o‰Ûªclock. Date night‰Ûªs over.,8
41681,Sheldon,20," Wait, no. We haven‰Ûªt picked a winner.",8
41682,Amy,20, We both know this one‰Ûªs gonna win.,8
41683,Sheldon,20," Well, of course we do. Fort Knox doesn‰Ûªt have a secret physics lending library.",8
41684,Amy,20," Come on, I‰Ûªll help you take this down.",8
41685,Sheldon,20," Well, wait. What if, just this once, we suspend the date night parameters and you stay later?",8
41686,Amy,20," Well, as long as we‰Ûªre suspending the parameters, I could stay really late and we could have our first sleepover.",8
41687,Sheldon,20, That‰Ûªs a big step.,8
41688,Amy,20, It‰Ûªs a big fort.,8
41689,Sheldon,20," Very well. I will agree to a family-friendly, G-rated, boy-girl sleepover.",8
41690,Amy,20, PG. Some scenes may be too intense for younger viewers.,8
41691,Sheldon,20," G-rated, with a warning for families with babies and toddlers.",8
41692,Amy,20, You got yourself a sleepover.,8
41693,Sheldon,20, Do you need to borrow a toothbrush or pajamas?,8
41694,Amy,20, Would it alarm you to know that I hid those things here two years ago just in case this ever came up?,8
41695,Sheldon,20," It would, but you know how much I admire preparedness. How did you know we‰Ûªd be in the living room?",8
41696,Amy,20, Who says this is the only one I hid?,8
41697,Scene,20, The apartment. ,8
41698,Leonard,20, Hello? What is this?,8
41699,Sheldon,20, We built a fort.,8
41700,Leonard,20, Are those my sheets?,8
41701,Amy,20," Yes, they are.",8
41702,Leonard,20," Okay. Well, you kids have fun. I‰Ûªm gonna go to sleep.",8
41703,Sheldon,20," Well, Leonard, don‰Ûªt you want to see the inside of the fort?",8
41704,Leonard,20," Yeah, I‰Ûªm good.",8
41705,Sheldon,20," Oh, come on. I really wanted to tell someone they can‰Ûªt come in.",8
41706,Leonard,20," Okay, fine. Sheldon, may I please visit your fort?",8
41707,Sheldon,20," I want to say no, but it‰Ûªs too glorious. Get in here.",8
41708,Leonard,20, Thank you.,8
41709,Amy,20," Okay, have a seat on the floor.",8
41710,Sheldon,20, Not there. That‰Ûªs my spot.,8
41711,Scene,21, The cafeteria.,8
41712,Sheldon,21," Hey, would you like to hear some songs I‰Ûªve rewritten to get children interested in the hard sciences?",8
41713,Howard,21, Sure.,8
41714,Leonard,21, Really?,8
41715,Howard,21," Yeah. Well, I like music, I like science, I like making fun of Sheldon. Hit it.",8
41716,Sheldon,21," There was a scientist who had a theory and James Clerk Maxwell was his name-o. J-A-M-E-S, C-L-E-R-K space M-A-X-W-E-L-L, And James Clerk Maxwell was his name-o. There was a scientist who had a theory and James Clerk Maxwell was his name-o, A-M-E-S‰Û_",8
41717,Leonard,21," Uh, okay, okay. Uh, we, we get it.",8
41718,Sheldon,21," Perhaps you‰Ûªd prefer this one. The itsy bitsy spider is not an insect at all, because it haseight legs and two body parts.",8
41719,Leonard,21," That‰Ûªs pretty cool, Sheldon.",8
41720,Sheldon,21, Thank you. Do either of you know BeyoncÌ©? I‰Ûªd love her to get behind it.,8
41721,Raj,21, Hey.,8
41722,Leonard,21, Hey.,8
41723,Howard,21, Hey.,8
41724,Sheldon,21, Hello.,8
41725,Raj,21, You guys know the new Discovery class missions that NASA‰Ûªs been working on?,8
41726,Leonard,21, Yeah.,8
41727,Raj,21," Well, they‰Ûªre looking to include a message from Earth in case one of them is encountered by alien life.",8
41728,Leonard,21," Oh. When I encountered alien life, I discovered that the key thing was not to sit in its spot.",8
41729,Sheldon,21," All right, you can‰Ûªt breathe our air without an inhaler, he‰Ûªs allergic to Earth nuts, but I‰Ûªm the alien.",8
41730,Raj,21," Anyway, I‰Ûªm among a handful of scientists that have been asked to submit a design proposal for the message and its delivery system.",8
41731,Sheldon,21, Excellent.,8
41732,Howard,21, Good for you.,8
41733,Leonard,21, Congratulations.,8
41734,Raj,21, And I was wondering if any of you guys would like to help me do it.,8
41735,Leonard,21, Are you kidding? Yes. What did you have in mind?,8
41736,Sheldon,21," I‰Ûªll tell you exactly what you should do, avoid the presumption of the Terran sensory input paradigm.",8
41737,Howard,21," Yeah, absolutely. You need a device capable of delivering information across a wide range of perceptual modalities.",8
41738,Sheldon,21, Any intelligent organism would at the very least need the ability to locate the position of objects in space. So the ideal interstellar lingua franca would be haptic.,8
41739,Howard,21," Ooh, how about a 3-D tactile communicator rigged for cross-sensory transposition?",8
41740,Raj,21," Exactly what I expected. Two people forcing their ideas on me and only one gentleman who could be bothered to ask me what my thoughts were. You two are out. Congratulations, Leonard, you‰Ûªre on the team.",8
41741,Leonard,21, My mommy raised a gentleman.,8
41742,Scene,21, Raj‰Ûªs apartment.,8
41743,Raj,21, Hey. Thanks for coming by.,8
41744,Leonard,21, Yeah. I‰Ûªm excited to help.,8
41745,Raj,21," I would have included the others, but you know exactly what would‰Ûªve happened. They would‰Ûªve taken over the project and bossed us around.",8
41746,Leonard,21," I get it. Uh, just this morning, Sheldon wouldn‰Ûªt let me put almond milk on my Grape-Nuts because he said it was a theoretical nut conflict.",8
41747,Raj,21, You should have told him to mind his own business.,8
41748,Leonard,21," Yeah. That‰Ûªs better than what I did say, which was, fine, I‰Ûªll eat them with club soda.",8
41749,Raj,21, What makes them think they‰Ûªre always in charge of everything?,8
41750,Leonard,21," Mmm, they‰Ûªre alpha males.",8
41751,Raj,21," Huh, what does that make us?",8
41752,Leonard,21, We could be betas. They‰Ûªre second in charge.,8
41753,Raj,21," Okay, that sounds good.",8
41754,Leonard,21, Or we could be omegas. They get pushed around by the alphas and the betas.,8
41755,Raj,21," Okay, that sounds like us.",8
41756,Leonard,21," Whatever. There‰Ûªs no alphas here, and this is your project. You‰Ûªre in charge. How do you want to start?",8
41757,Raj,21, I don‰Ûªt know. How do you want to start?,8
41758,Leonard,21, I don‰Ûªt know. Should we call Sheldon and Howard?,8
41759,Raj,21, No. We can do this by ourselves.,8
41760,Leonard,21, Okay. Great. How do you want to start?,8
41761,Raj,21, I don‰Ûªt know. How do you want to start?,8
41762,Scene,21, The hallway.,8
41763,Penny,21," (Knock, knock, knock) Sheldon. (Knock, knock, knock) Sheldon. (Knock, knock, knock) Sheldon.",8
41764,Sheldon,21," I bet that started off as a joke, but by the third one you realized there was something strangely enjoyable about it.",8
41765,Penny,21," Yeah, I kind of want to do it again.",8
41766,Sheldon,21," I don‰Ûªt recommend it. You‰Ûªll be doing it the rest of your life. Anyway, if you‰Ûªre looking for Leonard, he‰Ûªs with Koothrappali.",8
41767,Penny,21," Uh, no, I actually came to talk to you.",8
41768,Sheldon,21," How nice. Here are some topics that interest me, quantum mechanics, trains, flags.",8
41769,Penny,21," No, no. It‰Ûªs about my acting career.",8
41770,Sheldon,21," Oh, sorry. That‰Ûªs not on the list.",8
41771,Penny,21, Well.,8
41772,Sheldon,21," Oh, wait. No. How about we split the difference and discuss why Austria was an archduchy and not just a regular duchy.",8
41773,Penny,21," Okay, look, here‰Ûªs the thing. I like pharmaceutical sales, it‰Ûªs going great, but I have an audition for a movie, and if I get it, it could screw everything up.",8
41774,Sheldon,21," Hmm. I know exactly what you should do. Unfortunately, I cannot tell you.",8
41775,Penny,21," Well, why?",8
41776,Sheldon,21," I‰Ûªm attempting to turn over a new leaf. Earlier today, it was pointed out to me that I tend to force my ideas on people.",8
41777,Penny,21, You‰Ûªre really not gonna tell me?,8
41778,Sheldon,21," No, that train has left the station. Now, we can play this one of two ways. You can say, trains, tell me more, or you can just look at me like that and I‰Ûªll start.",8
41779,Scene,21, Howard and Bernadette‰Ûªs house.,8
41780,Bernadette,21, What‰Ûªs going on in here?,8
41781,Howard,21, I am making molecular cocktails. This sphere is actually a cosmopolitan.,8
41782,Bernadette,21, Oh. How do you drink it?,8
41783,Howard,21," Oh, just put it in your mouth and pop it like a zit.",8
41784,Bernadette,21, I think I‰Ûªll have a beer.,8
41785,Howard,21, First take a picture with me.,8
41786,Bernadette,21, Why?,8
41787,Howard,21," Well, Raj and I always talked about learning how to make cocktails like this together, so I taught myself and I‰Ûªm putting this on Instagram so he can see it and feel like a turd. Say cheese.",8
41788,Bernadette,21, Is this about the space probe he‰Ûªs working on without you?,8
41789,Howard,21, You betcha. The very one.,8
41790,Bernadette,21," Howard, you‰Ûªre grown men. You guys don‰Ûªt have to do everything together.",8
41791,Howard,21, I know. That‰Ûªs why I‰Ûªm spending tonight with you.,8
41792,Bernadette,21, Trying to hurt Raj‰Ûªs feelings.,8
41793,Howard,21, With my honeybunch.,8
41794,Bernadette,21, You‰Ûªre being childish.,8
41795,Howard,21, No. He is. So I have a dominant personality. We all know that.,8
41796,Bernadette,21, I‰Ûªm sorry. What do we know?,8
41797,Howard,21," In social groupings, I just naturally wind up in charge.",8
41798,Bernadette,21," Don‰Ûªt take this the wrong way, but how many of these little booze balls have you had?",8
41799,Howard,21, You don‰Ûªt think I‰Ûªm a leader?,8
41800,Bernadette,21, I was kidding. Of course you are.,8
41801,Howard,21, Right. I couldn‰Ûªt change if I wanted to.,8
41802,Bernadette,21," You better not change, because I love who you are. Now, will you need help cleaning all this up when you‰Ûªre done or can you do it all by yourself?",8
41803,Howard,21, All by myself.,8
41804,Bernadette,21, There‰Ûªs my big boss man.,8
41805,Scene,21, The apartment.,8
41806,Sheldon,21," So, often on the front of the locomotive is a large iron wedge for clearing objects off the tracks. Now, while commonly known as a cowcatcher, I prefer the more accurate cow exploder.",8
41807,Penny,21," Okay. Sheldon, let me ask you a question.",8
41808,Sheldon,21, Mmm.,8
41809,Penny,21," If I was at a train station and one train could take me to my current job and the other train could take me to an audition for a movie, which train should I get on?",8
41810,Sheldon,21, Are you using trains to trick me into giving you advice?,8
41811,Penny,21, No.,8
41812,Sheldon,21," All right, then. You should take a third train where you audition for the movie but hold off on making a career decision until you have more information.",8
41813,Penny,21, Oh. You‰Ûªre right. I‰Ûªm worried about something that hasn‰Ûªt even happened yet. Huh. You are a wise man.,8
41814,Sheldon,21," Well, Penny, who‰Ûªs smarter, the wise man or the person who comes to him for advice?",8
41815,Penny,21," Oh, I guess you‰Ûªre right. Maybe it is the person who asks.",8
41816,Sheldon,21," No, it‰Ûªs the wise man. That‰Ûªs why he‰Ûªs called the wise man. You know how I know that? I‰Ûªm the wise man.",8
41817,Penny,21, I‰Ûªm sorry. What was I thinking?,8
41818,Sheldon,21," Uh, just out of curiosity, why didn‰Ûªt you ask Leonard for advice about this?",8
41819,Penny,21," ‰Û÷Cause I already know what he‰Ûªll say. Wah, wah, wah, you shouldn‰Ûªt do it.",8
41820,Sheldon,21," Ah, it‰Ûªs just like he‰Ûªs here.",8
41821,Scene,21, Raj‰Ûªs apartment. ,8
41822,Raj,21," Okay, so we know that previous attempts to send a message into space, like the Golden Record on Voyager, were heavily criticized.",8
41823,Leonard,21," Well, aliens could only play the Golden Record if they figured out how to build a record player.",8
41824,Raj,21," Eh. Although, to be fair, I watched E.T. build a telephone out of a Speak & Spell and an umbrella. Dude was like a little brown MacGyver.",8
41825,Leonard,21, That would be more helpful if E.T. were real.,8
41826,Raj,21," Well, my feelings were real when he was about to die.",8
41827,Leonard,21," My God, when he‰Ûªs on the table and they use the paddles on him.",8
41828,Raj,21, And he‰Ûªs all white.,8
41829,Leonard,21, They zip him up in that bag.,8
41830,Raj,21, And Gertie can‰Ûªt stop crying.,8
41831,Leonard,21, The flower dies.,8
41832,Raj,21," Okay, let‰Ûªs talk about something else.",8
41833,Leonard,21," All right, so it sounds like we need a way to communicate that‰Ûªs simple.",8
41834,Raj,21, And doesn‰Ûªt require outside machinery to be built to access it.,8
41835,Leonard,21," It‰Ûªs also a problem because we don‰Ûªt even know if the aliens who find this can see. I mean, they might communicate in a totally different way than us.",8
41836,Raj,21," Like when my dog is mad at me, she tells me by peeing in my slippers.",8
41837,Leonard,21, That‰Ûªs actually a valid example. Animals do deliver messages through scent.,8
41838,Raj,21, Bees talk to each other by dancing. Whales have their songs.,8
41839,Leonard,21, Yeah. Penny has about twenty different ways of rolling her eyes that each mean something different.,8
41840,Raj,21," Okay, so, what it sounds like is, what we want is a device that can deliver a message through not only sight, but other senses, as well.",8
41841,Leonard,21, The most basic sense that any space-faring civilization would have to possess is touch.,8
41842,Raj,21," Ooh. Ooh, ooh. We could make a video-playing device that simultaneously translates the information into a tactile medium.",8
41843,Leonard,21, All we have to do is rig up a 3-D communication system.,8
41844,Raj,21," We, we can totally do that.",8
41845,Leonard,21, I know.,8
41846,Raj,21, This is great.,8
41847,Leonard,21," Yeah, you know what else it is?",8
41848,Raj,21, What?,8
41849,Howard,21, Exactly what Sheldon and Howard said.,8
41850,Raj,21," Well, thank you for peeing in my slippers.",8
41851,Scene,21, The cafeteria.,8
41852,Sheldon (singing),21," It‰Ûªs the eye of the tiger, it‰Ûªs the ear of the bat, it‰Ûªs the whiskers of the catfish and the walrus.",8
41853,Howard,21," Hang on. Not that your song isn‰Ûªt terrible, it is. but how do you mention bats and leave out sonar?",8
41854,Sheldon,21," You didn‰Ûªt let me finish. And also regarding the bat, it has sonar.",8
41855,Leonard,21, Hey.,8
41856,Howard,21, Hello.,8
41857,Raj,21," Look, I know you guys are upset, but we‰Ûªve talked about it, and we think it‰Ûªd be beneficial for you to be part of the project.",8
41858,Howard,21," Well, well, well, did you hear that, Sheldon?",8
41859,Sheldon,21, I‰Ûªm sorry. I was trying to think of what rhymes with nose of the aardvark.,8
41860,Leonard,21, We want you back on the project with us.,8
41861,Sheldon,21," Well, well, well, did you hear that, Howard?",8
41862,Raj,21," Look, we admit it. The idea that you guys came up with was really good, and I‰Ûªd love your help.",8
41863,Howard,21, I suppose it couldn‰Ûªt have been easy for you to say that.,8
41864,Raj,21," It wasn‰Ûªt, so are you in?",8
41865,Sheldon,21, Certainly.,8
41866,Howard,21, Sure.,8
41867,Leonard,21," Great. Now that we‰Ûªre all on the same page, let‰Ûªs get together tonight and work on it.",8
41868,Sheldon,21," Get together tonight? Leonard, stop trying to control everything, and give poor Raj a chance to come up with what we should do. Go ahead, Raj.",8
41869,Raj,21," Okay, I think we should do it right now.",8
41870,Sheldon,21, Tonight works better for me.,8
41871,Raj,21, Okay.,8
41872,Scene,21, A hallway.,8
41873,Penny (voiceover),21," Okay, it‰Ûªs just an audition. Why am I nervous? Maybe it‰Ûªs a good thing. Just means I want it. And I can have it. This feels right. Why did I ever give this up? (Out loud) I‰Ûªm starting to remember.",8
41874,Scene,21, The apartment. ,8
41875,Raj,21," So, I‰Ûªd like to try a technique where no one gets steamrolled. When you talk, instead of bringing up a new idea, respect what was just said by building on it.",8
41876,Sheldon,21," Uh, building on that, we should order dinner.",8
41877,Leonard,21, How is that building on what he just said?,8
41878,Howard,21," Building on what Sheldon said, I could go for Chinese.",8
41879,Raj,21," Hang on. Building on what Leonard said, no one built on what I said.",8
41880,Sheldon,21," Building on building on that, there‰Ûªs a new build-your-own pizza place on Colorado.",8
41881,Leonard,21," Building on that, I‰Ûªd like to remind you, I‰Ûªm lactose intolerant.",8
41882,Howard,21, I saw the menu. They have soy cheese.,8
41883,Sheldon,21," Bah, you didn‰Ûªt say building on. You‰Ûªre out.",8
41884,Leonard,21, It‰Ûªs not Simon Says.,8
41885,Raj,21," Yeah, you‰Ûªre missing the point, Sheldon.",8
41886,Sheldon,21," You‰Ûªre out, and you‰Ûªre out. I win. Who wants pizza?",8
41887,Scene,21, The audition room.,8
41888,Girl,21, Penny?,8
41889,Penny,21," Oh, hey.",8
41890,Girl,21, Hey. I haven‰Ûªt seen you auditioning in a while.,8
41891,Penny,21," Yeah, uh, I got a job as a pharmaceutical sales rep.",8
41892,Girl,21, You quit acting?,8
41893,Penny,21," Well, kind of. But now I get to act like inflamed heart is only a mild side effect.",8
41894,Second Girl,21, I heard you can make good money doing that.,8
41895,Penny,21," Yeah, it‰Ûªs going okay, but I do miss this sometimes.",8
41896,First Girl,21, Really?,8
41897,Penny,21, Mmm.,8
41898,First Girl,21," ‰Û÷Cause I got to tell you, I am so sick of the humiliation and being treated like a piece of meat.",8
41899,Audiitoner,21, Chelsea?,8
41900,First Girl,21, Wish me luck.,8
41901,Second Girl,21, They‰Ûªre gonna love you. I heard she‰Ûªs pushing 40 and everything‰Ûªs fake.,8
41902,Penny,21, Yeah. I started that rumour.,8
41903,Scene,21, The apartment. ,8
41904,Leonard,21," Okay, since we agree on the delivery system for the message, maybe we should talk about what the message could be.",8
41905,Raj,21," Well, I think we should show what earthlings look like.",8
41906,Howard,21, The plaque they sent up on the Pioneer probe had a drawing of a naked man and woman on it.,8
41907,Sheldon,21," Yeah, I never cared for that. It‰Ûªs advertising to predator races just how soft and squishy we are.",8
41908,Leonard,21, Squeeze yourself.,8
41909,Sheldon,21," Oh, don‰Ûªt be offended. You know, of the four of us, you have the most veal-like consistency.",8
41910,Raj,21," Well, maybe there‰Ûªs a way to appear non-aggressive, but also be able to protect ourselves if necessary. Like smiling and waving with one hand, but the other hand holding the severed head of a tiger.",8
41911,Howard,21, You want to send a passive-aggressive message out into the universe? That‰Ûªs ridiculous.,8
41912,Raj,21," Oh, you mean passive-aggressive like posting pictures of you and your wife eating cosmopolitan balls that you know belong in my mouth?",8
41913,Sheldon,21," Perhaps Howard meant passive-aggressive like asking our group to help on your project, and then only choosing Leonard.",8
41914,Raj,21," Look, I‰Ûªm sorry I hurt your feelings, but you do have strong personalities and always end up taking over.",8
41915,Howard,21, It‰Ûªs not always.,8
41916,Leonard,21," What about when we went to Comic-Con and dressed like Jabba the Hutt? You got to be Jabba‰Ûªs head, and I got to be his fat slug butt.",8
41917,Sheldon,21, We looked great.,8
41918,Leonard,21, You let a guy sit on me.,8
41919,Howard,21, He was dressed as Princess Leia. It made a nice picture.,8
41920,Leonard,21," I‰Ûªm just saying, sometimes Raj and I feel pushed aside.",8
41921,Raj,21," Yeah. Like when you took Sheldon to Texas and showed him all around NASA, you didn‰Ûªt even think to ask me and Leonard.",8
41922,Howard,21, You know what? You‰Ûªre right. I should have asked you.,8
41923,Sheldon,21," Yeah, and if he does ask you, go. It‰Ûªs amazing.",8
41924,Howard,21," Okay, and if we‰Ûªre talking about being left out of things, you guys went to Skywalker Ranch without us.",8
41925,Sheldon,21," Oh, I recommend that, too. That was a magical experience.",8
41926,Leonard,21, Wait a minute. Sheldon spent a whole day with James Earl Jones and never told any of us.,8
41927,Sheldon,21," I sure did. Oh, my goodness. Well, from Jabba‰Ûªs head to ice cream with Darth Vader, I‰Ûªm having a heck of a ride. Yeah, look, clearly, good things happen when I‰Ûªm in charge. Now, why don‰Ûªt you boys step aside, let me knock this project out?",8
41928,Leonard,21," Sheldon, you‰Ûªre not in charge. Raj is in charge.",8
41929,Sheldon,21," Leonard, who‰Ûªs really in charge? The person in charge, or those who put him in charge?",8
41930,Raj,21," He‰Ûªs right. If you think about it, we‰Ûªre all in charge.",8
41931,Sheldon,21," No, the guy in charge is in ch‰Û_ why is everyone so bad at these?",8
41932,Scene,21, Penny‰Ûªs apartment.,8
41933,Penny,21," I mean, the whole experience reminded me about how much I hated about that world. You, you know, the anxiety, the depression, the negativity. I don‰Ûªt want to feel those things. I want to sell drugs to people who feel those things.",8
41934,Amy,21, I can‰Ûªt believe you got up and walked out of an audition for a big movie.,8
41935,Penny,21," I did. I mean, I walked in, read for the part, then stunk up the place, but then I walked right out.",8
41936,Bernadette,21," Well, I‰Ûªm glad you have a new appreciation for your job.",8
41937,Penny,21," I do, and you know, I don‰Ûªt think I‰Ûªve ever thanked you properly for helping me get it.",8
41938,Bernadette,21," Properly, at all. It‰Ûªs just words I‰Ûªve never heard.",8
41939,Penny,21," Well, thank you. You‰Ûªre a good friend, and you changed my life.",8
41940,Bernadette,21," You‰Ûªre welcome. Hey, now that you‰Ûªre making some real money, maybe you can take your friend out for a nice thank-you dinner.",8
41941,Penny,21, Sure.,8
41942,Amy,21," And you probably have to invite your other friend ‰Ûªcause she overheard you talking about it, and it would be awkward to exclude her.",8
41943,Penny,21, Okay.,8
41944,Bernadette,21, How about now?,8
41945,Penny,21, All right.,8
41946,Bernadette,21, Don‰Ûªt forget your wallet.,8
41947,Penny,21," I, uh, huh.",8
41948,Scene,21, An alien spacecraft. ,8
41949,Sheldon (on screen),21, Greetings from planet Earth. Just turn left at Alpha Centauri. You can‰Ûªt miss it.,8
41950,First Alien,21, That soft pink alien looks delicious.,8
41951,Second Alien,21, I could eat.,8
41952,Scene,22, The apartment,8
41953,Raj,22," It‰Ûªs, like, the best one they make, I just can‰Ûªt get it to work.",8
41954,Howard,22, I‰Ûªll figure it out.,8
41955,Raj,22, It streams HD video straight to your phone while it‰Ûªs flying.,8
41956,Howard,22, Nice. Where were you when I was single?,8
41957,Leonard,22," Okay, we should leave in about an hour. You all packed?",8
41958,Penny,22," Uh, yeah, I just need to throw in a few last minute things, you know, makeup, underwear, clothes.",8
41959,Sheldon,22," If your bathroom floor counts as a carry-on, you‰Ûªre packed.",8
41960,Amy,22," Leonard, have you ever given a high school commencement speech before?",8
41961,Leonard,22, Nope. It‰Ûªs pretty exciting.,8
41962,Sheldon,22, Aren‰Ûªt you afraid of being blinded?,8
41963,Leonard,22, How would I be blinded?,8
41964,Sheldon,22," At the end of the ceremony, all the students throw those pointy hats in the air. It‰Ûªs all pomp and circumstance until someone loses an eye.",8
41965,Leonard,22, I‰Ûªll take my chances.,8
41966,Sheldon,22, Fine. I wonder if they make I told you so cards in braille.,8
41967,Raj,22," Look, the problem with commencement speeches is that they‰Ûªre boring. Ooh, do you own a T-shirt cannon?",8
41968,Howard,22, Why would he own a T-shirt cannon?,8
41969,Raj,22, I don‰Ûªt know. Why do I own one?,8
41970,Amy,22, I think it‰Ûªs really nice that you‰Ûªre sharing this experience with Penny.,8
41971,Leonard,22," Mm, I thought it‰Ûªd be fun to show her my old stomping grounds. I even know the exact spot where they used to stomp me.",8
41972,Bernadette,22," Well, now you get to go back as a successful scientist.",8
41973,Amy,22, With a beautiful girl on your arm.,8
41974,Sheldon,22, And a pointy hat sticking out of your eyeball.,8
41975,Scene,22, The hallway.,8
41976,Leonard,22, How‰Ûªd you get ready so fast?,8
41977,Penny,22," Oh, I pack light. Once, I got through an entire spring break with nothing but a long T-shirt and a belt.",8
41978,Leonard,22, Why did you need a belt?,8
41979,Penny,22, It‰Ûªs called an evening look. I‰Ûªve never been to New Jersey before.,8
41980,Leonard,22, It gets a bad rap from shows like Jersey Shore and Real Housewives.,8
41981,Penny,22, So it‰Ûªs not really like that?,8
41982,Leonard,22," No, it‰Ûªs like that. Well, I‰Ûªm excited to show you around.",8
41983,Penny,22, You think we‰Ûªll have time to visit your mom over there?,8
41984,Leonard,22," Yes. We‰Ûªll also have time to put my junk in a garlic press, but I‰Ûªm not doing that either. (Receives text) Uh-oh. I just got an alert. Our flight‰Ûªs been cancelled.",8
41985,Penny,22, What?,8
41986,Leonard,22," Yeah, looks like there‰Ûªs a big storm all up the East Coast.",8
41987,Penny,22," Well, can we get on another airline?",8
41988,Leonard,22, I don‰Ûªt think so.,8
41989,Penny,22," So, that‰Ûªs it? We‰Ûªre not going?",8
41990,Leonard,22, I guess not.,8
41991,Penny,22," Well, that sucks.",8
41992,Leonard,22," Yeah. I worked hard on that speech, too.",8
41993,Penny,22, Oh. You could tell it to me.,8
41994,Leonard,22," Oh, thank you, but I‰Ûªm okay.",8
41995,Penny,22, Are you sure? I could pretend I‰Ûªm a high school cheerleader who can‰Ûªt control herself around esteemed alumni.,8
41996,Leonard,22," Greetings, distinguished cheerleaders.",8
41997,Penny,22, Ooh.,8
41998,Scene,22, The apartment.,8
41999,Howard,22," Okay, the WiFi extender is on, the camera‰Ûªs on, they‰Ûªre both on the same network. We should be getting an image.",8
42000,Sheldon,22, All I see is a black screen. And my own reflection. I look sad.,8
42001,Howard,22, Maybe we should recalibrate it.,8
42002,Sheldon,22, All right.,8
42003,Howard,22," Step one, rapidly flip the calibration switch from the fully up to the fully down positions for at least ten times.",8
42004,Sheldon,22, It actually says at least?,8
42005,Howard,22, Yeah.,8
42006,Sheldon,22, Why would they say at least? Is it ten toggles? Is it a hundred toggles? You know? Is it a thousand toggles? Ten thousand toggles? A hundred thousand toggles?,8
42007,Howard,22, Sheldon.,8
42008,Sheldon,22, You see where I‰Ûªm going with this.,8
42009,Howard,22, Just flip the switch until the lights on the drone change to solid yellow.,8
42010,Sheldon,22," All right, that seems simple enough. Initiating calibration sequence. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten. Well, I suppose ten is technically at least ten. But they‰Ûªre still getting at least one angry letter.",8
42011,Howard,22, Now I rotate it horizontally on its centre axis until the lights turn green.,8
42012,Sheldon,22," Initiating rotation sequence. Don‰Ûªt look at me, initiate. What does red and yellow mean?",8
42013,Howard,22, It means the calibration failed. We have to start over.,8
42014,Sheldon,22," Oh. Very well. Re-initiating calibration sequence. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten‰Û_ eleven. It‰Ûªs a good thing I didn‰Ûªt send that letter.",8
42015,Scene,22, Raj‰Ûªs apartment. Skype tone plays.,8
42016,Raj,22," Mm. Hello, Daddy. What‰Ûªs up?",8
42017,Dr Koothrapalli,22," Not much, just wanted to see how my son‰Ûªs doing.",8
42018,Raj,22," Very well, thank you.",8
42019,Dr Koothrapalli,22, Are you still dating that dermatologist?,8
42020,Raj,22," If you could feel how soft my skin is, you wouldn‰Ûªt have to ask.",8
42021,Dr Koothrapalli,22," Oh, and there‰Ûªs something else I wanted to ask you. Why did you spend a month‰Ûªs rent on a toy helicopter?!",8
42022,Raj,22," Oh, you‰Ûªre where that bill goes.",8
42023,Dr Koothrapalli,22, I‰Ûªm tired of indulging your foolish lifestyle. It‰Ûªs time you learned responsibility. And the only way to teach you that is to cut off your allowance.,8
42024,Raj,22," No, Daddy, no. There are lots of other ways to teach me responsibility. I know, you can give me an egg and make me take care of it for a week.",8
42025,Dr Koothrapalli,22," No, my mind is made up. Starting now, you‰Ûªre on your own.",8
42026,Raj,22," But, Daddy, I, I miss my family so much, and with you and Mummy getting a divorce, I feel sad and empty. Buying a little toy every now and then helps me fill that void. So while I can‰Ûªt hug you every day, flying that helicopter‰Û_",8
42027,Dr Koothrapalli,22, I‰Ûªm cutting you off.,8
42028,Raj,22," Just to be clear, financially or mid-sentence?",8
42029,Scene,22, The apartment.,8
42030,Howard,22," No red and yellow, no red and yellow.",8
42031,Sheldon,22, Yay.,8
42032,Howard,22, It‰Ûªs green.,8
42033,Sheldon,22," We did it. Oh, if it‰Ûªs this much fun to rotate, imagine when we fly it.",8
42034,Howard,22," Okay, now all I have to do is rotate it vertically until the lights turn off.",8
42035,Sheldon,22," Oh, no.",8
42036,Howard,22," Oh. All right, playtime‰Ûªs over. Let‰Ûªs open this baby up.",8
42037,Sheldon,22, Won‰Ûªt that void the warranty?,8
42038,Howard,22," Sheldon, I have a master‰Ûªs degree in engineering. I wipe my bottom with warranties. Except for AppleCare. That pays for itself in the long run.",8
42039,Scene,22, Penny‰Ûªs apartment.,8
42040,Penny,22, Hi.,8
42041,Leonard,22," Hey, where‰Ûªd you go?",8
42042,Penny,22, I got you a little something to cheer you up.,8
42043,Leonard,22," Really? Sex last night, pancakes this morning, am I dying?",8
42044,Penny,22, Just open it.,8
42045,Leonard,22, A cap and gown? Why do I need a cap and gown?,8
42046,Penny,22, Because you are giving your commencement speech.,8
42047,Leonard,22, What are you talking about?,8
42048,Penny,22, I called your old high school and convinced them to let you give your speech over Skype.,8
42049,Leonard,22, Really? That‰Ûªs amazing. And you gave me the robes to give it in. Thank you.,8
42050,Penny,22," Yeah, now about those, uh, they came from a costume shop, and all they had left was sexy graduate, so they might be a little short.",8
42051,Leonard,22," Short and sexy, that‰Ûªs my wheelhouse.",8
42052,Penny,22, Yeah.,8
42053,Scene,22, The apartment.,8
42054,Howard,22," Boy, oh, boy, that‰Ûªs a lot of pieces.",8
42055,Sheldon,22," You know what they all do, right?",8
42056,Howard,22," Yes, of course.",8
42057,Sheldon,22, What about this one?,8
42058,Howard,22," Well, I, how familiar are you with miniaturized integrated logic circuits?",8
42059,Sheldon,22, Not very.,8
42060,Howard,22, That right there is a miniaturized integrated logic circuit.,8
42061,Sheldon,22," So, can you get it working?",8
42062,Howard,22, I‰Ûªm an MIT-trained engineer. I‰Ûªve built components for the space station.,8
42063,Sheldon,22, I thought the zero-gravity toilet didn‰Ûªt work.,8
42064,Howard,22," It worked fine, it just wasn‰Ûªt designed for Russian cosmonauts and their potato-based diet.",8
42065,Raj,22," Hey, guys.",8
42066,Howard,22, Hey.,8
42067,Sheldon,22, Hello.,8
42068,Raj,22, I have to return the helicopter. My father‰Û_ What did you do?,8
42069,Sheldon,22," Well, don‰Ûªt worry. He went to MIT. He can solve any problem, as long as it doesn‰Ûªt originate in a Russian man‰Ûªs colon.",8
42070,Raj,22, I don‰Ûªt freaking believe this.,8
42071,Howard,22," Relax, it‰Ûªll be fine.",8
42072,Raj,22," No, you have to put this back together right now, so I can return it.",8
42073,Sheldon,22, You can‰Ûªt return it. Howard wiped his bottom with the warranty.,8
42074,Raj,22, What?,8
42075,Sheldon,22, I think metaphorically. But he was in the bathroom for a while.,8
42076,Raj,22," Howard, my father cut me off. I have to get my money back for this.",8
42077,Howard,22, Calm down.,8
42078,Raj,22," Okay. Okay, you‰Ûªre right. It‰Ûªs time for me to step up and take responsibility for my life. Be a man. (On phone) Hello, Mummy.",8
42079,Mrs Koothrapalli,22," Hello, Rajesh. What a nice surprise.",8
42080,Raj,22," Well, I‰Ûªve been thinking about you. How are you doing? Are you happy, Mummy?",8
42081,Mrs Koothrapalli,22, Such a sweet boy for asking. Can‰Ûªt believe you come from the poison seed of your father.,8
42082,Raj,22," Well, I like to think I take mostly after you. Anyway, speaking of Daddy, I had a very strange conversation with him. He said he couldn‰Ûªt afford to send me money any more because of his active social life.",8
42083,Mrs Koothrapalli,22," What does that mean, active social life?",8
42084,Raj,22," Well, let‰Ûªs not talk about him or whatever shenanigans he may or may not be up to. Let‰Ûªs talk about you.",8
42085,Mrs Koothrapalli,22," Rajesh, is your father seeing someone?",8
42086,Raj,22," All I know, Mummy, is that he‰Ûªs a single wealthy doctor, and now, for some reason, there‰Ûªs no money for your little boy.",8
42087,Mrs Koothrapalli,22," Well, however much money your father was giving you, I‰Ûªll give you more.",8
42088,Raj,22," Thank you, Mummy, I love you. Helicopters for everybody.",8
42089,Scene,22, Penny‰Ûªs apartment.,8
42090,Penny,22, What‰Ûªs taking so long?,8
42091,Leonard,22, I don‰Ûªt think this is gonna work.,8
42092,Penny,22," Just let me see. Sweetie, you know you‰Ûªre supposed to wear clothes underneath a graduation gown.",8
42093,Leonard,22," A, surprised you know that. B, I wanted to look like a sexy graduate for you.",8
42094,Penny,22," Oh. Well, you do.",8
42095,Leonard,22, Thank you.,8
42096,Penny,22," Yeah. You‰Ûªre gonna be on Skype, they‰Ûªre not gonna see your legs.",8
42097,Leonard,22," Well, I‰Ûªm gonna go put on some pants just in case. But I have to say, this is very freeing.",8
42098,Penny,22, Add a belt and I‰Ûªll take you some place nice.,8
42099,Leonard,22, Oh. Done and done.,8
42100,Scene,22, The apartment.,8
42101,Howard,22," Okay, I think I‰Ûªve narrowed it down to a faulty pin on the onboard communication chip.",8
42102,Sheldon,22," Very impressive. You know, when you‰Ûªre done with that, can you look at this? It doesn‰Ûªt make smoke anymore.",8
42103,Howard,22, One toy at a time.,8
42104,Sheldon,22," Mm. Sorry. Ah, maybe it‰Ûªs for the best. I hear locomotive smoke is the second leading cause of death among train aficionados.",8
42105,Raj,22, What‰Ûªs the first one?,8
42106,Howard,22, Suicide.,8
42107,Sheldon,22, Wrong. Obesity.,8
42108,Bernadette,22, I have the tool you wanted.,8
42109,Howard,22, Thank you.,8
42110,Raj,22," You guys don‰Ûªt have to go to the trouble. I‰Ûªm back in the money now, I can just buy another helicopter.",8
42111,Howard,22," It‰Ûªs not about the money. It‰Ûªs about solving a problem. It‰Ûªs why I became an engineer. It‰Ûªs what I like to do, it‰Ûªs what I‰Ûªm trained to do. It‰Ûªs who I am.",8
42112,Sheldon,22," Oh, look at you, the little engineer that could.",8
42113,Bernadette,22, Why don‰Ûªt you just call tech support?,8
42114,Howard,22, Hey.,8
42115,Sheldon,22, Whoa.,8
42116,Raj,22, Not cool.,8
42117,Bernadette,22, What?,8
42118,Howard,22," There‰Ûªs two kinds of people in this world, those who call tech support, and those who make fun of the people who call tech support.",8
42119,Bernadette,22, I call tech support all the time.,8
42120,Howard,22, Ha-ha.,8
42121,Sheldon,22, You call tech support.,8
42122,Raj,22, What a baby.,8

42124,Headmaster,22," And now, for our commencement address, one of our most distinguished alumni, noted Caltech physicist Dr. Leonard Hofstadter.",8
42125,Leonard (on screen),22," Members of the faculty, students, I‰Ûªm excited to speak to you today. I can‰Ûªt help but remember the last time I was in this auditorium. Two guys from the lacrosse team played keep-away with my asthma inhaler. But enough about my ten-year reunion. I‰Ûªd also like to take a moment to thank my beautiful fiancÌ©e for to helping make this speech possible, even though weather nearly prevented it.",8
42126,Penny,22," Oh. Hello. I, I didn‰Ûªt know he was gonna point it at me, so, don‰Ûªt do drugs and stay in school.",8
42127,Leonard,22, They‰Ûªre graduating.,8
42128,Penny,22," Okay, bye.",8
42129,Scene,22, The apartment. ,8
42130,Howard,22," All right, the power supply is reconnected. I think we‰Ûªre back in business. Let‰Ûªs just run a few tests before we take it outside. Sheldon, we got WiFi?",8
42131,Sheldon,22, Check.,8
42132,Howard,22, GPS?,8
42133,Raj,22, Check.,8
42134,Howard,22, Battery charged?,8
42135,Sheldon,22, Check.,8
42136,Bernadette,22, Four hours of our lives gone? Check.,8
42137,Howard,22, All right. All systems go. In five‰Û_,8
42138,Together,22," Four, three, two, one.",8
42139,Sheldon,22, That‰Ûªs what my train used to do.,8
42140,Bernadette,22, Ready to call tech support?,8
42141,Howard,22, Give me the number. Probably wind up talking to some foreign guy who‰Ûªs reading from the same manual I have. (Raj‰Ûªs phone rings),8
42142,Raj,22," It‰Ûªs my father, you jerks. Hello, Daddy.",8
42143,Dr Koothrapalli,22, What did you say to your mother?,8
42144,Raj,22," Nothing. I was just calling to check in, make sure she‰Ûªs doing okay.",8
42145,Dr Koothrapalli,22," Well, after talking to you, she seems to think I‰Ûªm some sort of playboy.",8
42146,Raj,22, Really? I don‰Ûªt know where she‰Ûªd get an idea like that. You know Mummy and her crazy imagination I‰Ûªm so lucky I take after you.,8
42147,Dr Koothrapalli,22, You think you take after me?,8
42148,Raj,22," Well, I try to. I certainly wouldn‰Ûªt be a scientist if you hadn‰Ûªt been my role model. (Re-entering apartment) Who wants to go to Vegas in a real helicopter?",8
42149,Scene,22, Leonard‰Ûªs old school.,8
42150,Leonard (on screen),22," It was L. Frank Baum who said no thief, however skillful, can rob one of knowledge, and that is why knowledge is the best and safest treasure, wow, I‰Ûªm boring myself. Sorry, I can‰Ûªt see any of your faces right now, but I bet they look like this. Uh, you know, I, I wrote an entire speech to say how high school prepares you and what a wonderful place it is, but I hated it. Maybe high school‰Ûªs great if you look like this, but I didn‰Ûªt even feel like I existed at that school. And now that I think about it, I bet a lot of you feel the same way. So, for the remainder of my speech, this is for the invisible kids. Uh, maybe you never fit in. Or maybe you‰Ûªre the smallest kid in the school, or the heaviest or the weirdest. Maybe you‰Ûªre graduating and you still haven‰Ûªt had your first kiss. By the way, 19, and Geraldine Coco, wherever you are, thank you. Maybe you don‰Ûªt have any friends. And guess what? That‰Ûªs okay. While all the popular kids are off doing whatever, I don‰Ûªt know what they were doing ‰Ûªcause I was never there.",8
42151,Penny,22," I‰Ûªll, I‰Ûªll tell you later.",8
42152,Leonard,22," My point is, while you‰Ûªre spending all this time on your own, building computers or practicing your cello, what you‰Ûªre really doing is becoming interesting. And when people finally do notice you, they‰Ûªre gonna find someone a lot cooler than they thought. And for those of you who were popular in high school, it‰Ûªs over, sorry. Thank you and congratulations.",8

42156,Sheldon,22," It is awful, isn‰Ûªt it? Listen to that noise.",8
42157,Howard,22," Hang on, hang on. It‰Ûªs working. I did it.",8
42158,Raj,22, How‰Ûªd you do that?,8
42159,Howard,22," No idea, but I did it.",8
42160,Bernadette,22, Maybe you shouldn‰Ûªt be flying it inside.,8
42161,Howard,22," Well, I‰Ûªm not flying it.",8
42162,Sheldon,22, Then who is?,8
42163,Howard,22, I don‰Ûªt know. Must be getting a WiFi signal from somewhere else.,8

42174,Penny,23, Don‰Ûªt you want to know for sure?,8
42175,Leonard,23," No need to. As soon as she flies into California airspace, I‰Ûªll feel a disturbance in the Force.",8
42176,Amy,23, It‰Ûªs so nice both of your moms are coming in to see you guys get an award.,8
42177,Sheldon,23," Well, my mother‰Ûªs been there for every honour I‰Ûªve won since I beat out my twin sister for the did it on the potty trophy. How does this look?",8
42178,Penny,23," Aw, it‰Ûªs so nice. She‰Ûªs gonna love it.",8
42179,Amy,23," Sure, his mom gets roses. When I want them, they‰Ûªre a bouquet of severed plant genitals.",8
42180,Sheldon,23, You act like I didn‰Ûªt get you that mushroom log on Valentine‰Ûªs Day.,8
42181,Amy,23," He‰Ûªs right. Roses die, but a moist rotting log will pump out mushrooms for two or three magical years.",8
42182,Penny,23," You know, your mom‰Ûªs never been too thrilled with our relationship. Maybe I should get her something so she warms up to me.",8
42183,Leonard,23," If you could run out and get a PhD, that might make her like you.",8
42184,Penny,23, Really? It didn‰Ûªt work for you.,8
42185,Amy,23, Do you think the moms will get along?,8
42186,Leonard,23," Uh, I don‰Ûªt know. They‰Ûªre pretty different.",8

42189,Mrs Cooper,23," Shelly, I‰Ûªm so proud of you and Leonard for getting this award.",8
42190,Sheldon,23," Oh, thank you, Mother.",8
42191,Mrs Cooper,23," I tried to read your paper, but it was very hard for me to understand.",8
42192,Sheldon,23," Oh, it‰Ûªs quite straightforward, actually. It describes a new model of the universe that conceptualizes it as the surface of an n-dimensional superfluid.",8
42193,Mrs Cooper,23," Interesting. You can believe that, but God filling an ark with animals two-by-two is nonsense.",8
42194,Sheldon,23," What did they feed the lions, Mother?",8
42195,Mrs Cooper,23," The floating bodies of drowned sinners, of course.",8
42196,Sheldon,23," Listen, Leonard‰Ûªs mom is a renowned psychiatrist and woman of science. Can you please keep the Bible babble to yourself while she‰Ûªs here?",8
42197,Mrs Cooper,23, Are you ashamed of me?,8

42202,Leonard,23," No, we‰Ûªre kind of taking it slow.",8
42203,Dr Hofstadter,23, I see.,8
42204,Leonard,23, What does that mean?,8
42205,Dr Hofstadter,23, You‰Ûªve been on and off with this woman for seven years and engaged for one year. One has to wonder if there‰Ûªs a problem. Are you having satisfactory intercourse?,8
42206,Leonard,23," Yes, Mother.",8
42207,Dr Hofstadter,23, Only satisfactory. I see.,8
42208,Leonard,23," I change my answer. It, it‰Ûªs amazing. It‰Ûªs hot. We can barely keep our hands off each other.",8
42209,Dr Hofstadter,23," Seems odd to try and impress your mother with your sexual prowess. But then, you always did have that unresolved Oedipal complex.",8
42210,Leonard,23," See, this right here, what you‰Ûªre doing, can you please not do that around Sheldon‰Ûªs mom?",8
42211,Dr Hofstadter,23," Why? Are you attracted to her, too?",8
42212,Leonard,23," Of course not. She‰Ûªs, she‰Ûªs just a very sweet and God-fearing lady, and you have to be respectful of her beliefs.",8
42213,Dr Hofstadter,23," Leonard, I‰Ûªm an adult. I know how to conduct myself around people from different walks of life.",8
42214,Leonard,23, Thank you.,8
42215,Dr Hofstadter,23, Where is she from again?,8
42216,Leonard,23, East Texas.,8
42217,Dr Hofstadter,23, Ugh.,8
42218,Leonard,23," Hey, look who‰Ûªs here.",8
42219,Sheldon,23," Oh, Doctor Hofstadter, it‰Ûªs so good to see you again.",8
42220,Dr Hofstadter,23," Likewise. I read your paper, it was very impressive.",8
42221,Sheldon,23," Oh, thank you.",8
42222,Leonard,23, We just spent two hours in traffic. Did you think to mention to me that you liked our paper?,8
42223,Dr Hofstadter,23," Of course I did, but it‰Ûªs a mother‰Ûªs job to make sure her child‰Ûªs self-esteem is not dependent on anyone‰Ûªs approval.",8
42224,Leonard,23," That‰Ûªs so sweet, you think I have self-esteem.",8
42225,Sheldon,23," Doctor Hofstadter, I want you to meet my mother, Mary.",8
42226,Mrs Cooper,23," Nice to meet you, too. How was your flight?",8
42227,Dr Hofstadter,23, Very pleasant. And yours?,8
42228,Mrs Cooper,23," Lovely. Almost as if someone, not saying who, was watching over the plane.",8
42229,Dr Hofstadter,23," You‰Ûªre kidding, right?",8
42230,Leonard,23," Subtle, mom, real subtle.",8

42233,Stuart,23, Morning.,8
42234,Bernadette,23," We talked about this. I don‰Ûªt mind you still living here, but we got to have some rules. And rule number one is pants.",8
42235,Howard,23, Hey.,8
42236,Scene,23, The apartment. ,8
42237,Mrs Cooper,23, You must be very proud of your son.,8
42238,Dr Hofstadter,23," Oh, yes. He recently argued a case before the Supreme Court.",8
42239,Mrs Cooper,23, He did?,8
42240,Dr Hofstadter,23," Oh, you mean this son. Uh, sure, he‰Ûªs terrific.",8
42241,Sheldon,23," Beverly, would you like to see the math I worked out to support our hypothesis?",8
42242,Leonard,23," You mean, my hypothesis. I hypothesized it all by myself.",8
42243,Dr Hofstadter,23," Calm down, dear. Mary, I‰Ûªm curious. When did you first realize that your son had such a remarkable mind?",8
42244,Sheldon,23," Ooh, good question. Everyone loves stories about Sheldon Cooper, boy genius.",8
42245,Mrs Cooper,23," Well, I would have to say when he was 13 and tried to build a nuclear reactor in the tool shed.",8
42246,Sheldon,23," Ooh, this is a good one.",8
42247,Mrs Cooper,23," Now, the first thing you have to know about Shelly is ever since he was a little boy, he was always concerned with the well-being of others. And he didn‰Ûªt think that it was fair for people to pay for electricity, so he was gonna power the entire town for free.",8
42248,Sheldon,23, Tell her about the uranium. Tell her about the uranium.,8
42249,Mrs Cooper,23," Oh, well. Oh, this is adorable. When he arranged to get some yellowcake from Chad, I thought he was talking about Twinkies from one of his friends.",8
42250,Sheldon,23, But I wasn‰Ûªt. ‰Û÷Cause I didn‰Ûªt have any friends.,8
42251,Mrs Cooper,23, No. It turns out that this little scallywag was trying to use my Visa card to buy uranium from an African warlord in the country of Chad.,8
42252,Dr Hofstadter,23, Sounds like Sheldon was a handful.,8
42253,Mrs Cooper,23," Oh, he was a handful.",8
42254,Sheldon,23, I was a handful.,8
42255,Leonard,23," You still are. Uh, Mom, hey, tell Mary the story about how I made a Van der Graaf generator out of our vacuum cleaner.",8
42256,Dr Hofstadter,23, All right. He broke the vacuum cleaner.,8
42257,Scene,23, Howard and Bernadette‰Ûªs house.,8
42258,Howard,23," I mean, for a while, everything was vampires. Now it‰Ûªs all zombies. I wonder what the next monster fad will be.",8
42259,Raj,23, We haven‰Ûªt had a good invisible man in a while.,8
42260,Stuart,23," Clearly, you‰Ûªve never seen me try to talk to a woman.",8
42261,Bernadette,23," Guys. In the time you‰Ûªve been sitting here playing video games, I got the car washed, picked up cleaning supplies and went to the bank.",8
42262,Stuart,23, I put on pants.,8
42263,Howard,23, Kiss-ass.,8
42264,Bernadette,23," Okay, I don‰Ûªt know when I became the mother to three lazy teenagers, but it stops today. You guys are cleaning the kitchen, top to bottom.",8
42265,Raj,23," Hey, I don‰Ûªt even live here.",8
42266,Bernadette,23," Yes or no, do you have clothes in my laundry right now?",8
42267,Raj,23," I do. And some of it‰Ûªs wool, so dry flat if possible.",8
42268,Scene,23, The apartment. ,8
42269,Sheldon,23," Oh, and here‰Ûªs a picture of me receiving my bachelor of science degree.",8
42270,Dr Hofstadter,23, You don‰Ûªt look very happy.,8
42271,Sheldon,23," Well, I had just begun puberty. It was figuratively and literally one of the hairiest moments of my life.",8
42272,Mrs Cooper,23, Shelly does not like change.,8
42273,Sheldon,23," Oh, true. But all the clenching in the world will not keep testicles in your abdomen.",8
42274,Penny,23," Hey, sorry, got caught up at work. Hi, Beverly.",8
42275,Dr Hofstadter,23," Hello. Oh, okay.",8
42276,Penny,23," Sorry, I forgot.",8
42277,Sheldon,23, You remember my mother.,8
42278,Penny,23," Oh, yes. Hi, Mary.",8
42279,Mrs Cooper,23," Good to see you again, dear.",8
42280,Penny,23," Ah, yeah, now that‰Ûªs what I‰Ûªm talking about.",8
42281,Leonard,23," So, Mom, you haven‰Ûªt seen Penny since we got engaged.",8
42282,Penny,23," Oh, yeah, let me show you the ring.",8
42283,Dr Hofstadter,23," Oh, lovely. Must have been very expensive.",8
42284,Sheldon,23," Oh, no, not at all. No, we, uh, found a place online that, uh, repurposes diamond drill bits.",8
42285,Leonard,23, We did not. That‰Ûªs not true. Can I speak to you alone for a second?,8
42286,Sheldon,23," Oh, sure.",8
42287,Leonard,23, It came from Tiffany‰Ûªs.,8
42288,Sheldon,23," You mean the box, right?",8
42289,Leonard,23, Keep walking.,8
42290,Penny,23, Really doesn‰Ûªt matter to me how much he spent on the ring. I think.,8
42291,Sheldon,23, Did I misspeak about the ring?,8
42292,Leonard,23," Yes, and we‰Ûªll get back to that. But, uh, even with your mother here, you are deliberately hogging all the attention from my mom. You‰Ûªre like one of those elephant seal pups that steals the milk from two mothers.",8
42293,Sheldon,23, Do you mean what marine biologists refer to as super weaning?,8
42294,Leonard,23," Yes, you are a super weaner.",8
42295,Sheldon,23," Well, now I have to correct you. As a bit of an elephant seal buff, the more accurate comparison would be when two mother seals actively seek to nourish the same pup. So I believe the term you‰Ûªre looking for is a double mother suckler.",8
42296,Leonard,23," Yeah, you‰Ûªre right. That is the term I‰Ûªm looking for. You are a dirty double mother suckler.",8
42297,Sheldon,23," Okay, well, now that we have the terminology straightened out. How dare you.",8
42298,Penny,23, We‰Ûªre not in a rush. We‰Ûªll set a date when the time is right.,8
42299,Mrs Cooper,23," It doesn‰Ûªt matter, sweetie. The moment a man lays with a woman, they are married in the eyes of the Lord.",8
42300,Dr Hofstadter,23, Uch.,8
42301,Mrs Cooper,23, Uch? The bible is uch to you?,8
42302,Dr Hofstadter,23," No, I‰Ûªm sorry. That was inappropriate. As a psychiatrist, I know how important people‰Ûªs superstitions can be to them.",8
42303,Mrs Cooper,23," You want to talk about superstitions? Sheldon sent me the books you wrote, all that nonsense about superegos and ids. What bull dropped that on the barn floor?",8
42304,Dr Hofstadter,23, His name is Sigmund Freud.,8
42305,Penny,23," Hey, look at that. You both believe in Jewish bearded guys.",8
42306,Mrs Cooper,23, Stay out of this.,8
42307,Penny,23, Mm-hmm.,8
42308,Mrs Cooper,23, At least the bearded man that I believe in preaches love and compassion. All yours talks about is why you hold in your poop and want to crawl back inside your mama.,8
42309,Dr Hofstadter,23, It‰Ûªs fascinating. How can someone as enlightened as Sheldon come from someone like you?,8
42310,Mrs Cooper,23, I know the answer. You‰Ûªre not gonna like it.,8
42311,Dr Hofstadter,23, Try me.,8
42312,Mrs Cooper,23," When I was pregnant with Shelly, I was driving to church, and I was praying to the Lord to give me a son smarter than his dumb-ass daddy. And I looked over and I saw a Jesus bobblehead in the Subaru next to me nodding yes. What is that supposed to mean?",8
42313,Mrs Cooper,23," Well, do it some more. Maybe you can knock some sense into yourself.",8
42314,Penny,23," Why don‰Ûªt we all stop hitting ourselves and talk about something safe, you know, like shoes or how cute little Chinese babies are.",8
42315,Sheldon,23, It is not my fault that your mother likes me better than she likes you.,8
42316,Leonard,23," Oh, don‰Ûªt flatter yourself. She likes everybody better than she likes me.",8
42317,Scene,23, Howard and Bernadette‰Ûªs house. ,8
42318,Raj,23, How old is this Jell-O?,8
42319,Stuart,23," Well, it‰Ûªs carrots, so gonna say very.",8
42320,Howard,23, Sorry we have to do this.,8
42321,Stuart,23, Bernadette‰Ûªs not wrong. She does work hard around here.,8
42322,Raj,23," Yeah, maybe it‰Ûªs a good thing if she stops babying you so much.",8
42323,Howard,23, She doesn‰Ûªt baby me.,8
42324,Stuart,23, I saw her pull you home in a wagon.,8
42325,Howard,23," For your information, I twisted my ankle chasing the ice cream truck.",8
42326,Raj,23," Face it, dude, Bernadette treats you the same way your mother used to, and that was not a healthy relationship.",8
42327,Howard,23," You‰Ûªre right. It‰Ûªs time for me to act like an adult in this marriage. Starting with my husbandly duty of taking out the trash. Bernie, I made a mess.",8
42328,Scene,23, A coffee shop.,8
42329,Dr Hofstadter,23, I‰Ûªm terribly sorry that I upset your mother.,8
42330,Sheldon,23," Oh, it‰Ûªs all right. She‰Ûªll forgive you. She has to or she goes to hell.",8
42331,Dr Hofstadter,23, I can‰Ûªt help but notice how her unconditional love for you is diametrically opposed to my own parenting strategies.,8
42332,Sheldon,23," Well, you doled out affection as a reward for achievement, a proven way to raise a child. Or train a rat.",8
42333,Dr Hofstadter,23, But look how well you turned out.,8
42334,Sheldon,23," I‰Ûªd feign modesty at this point, but who would believe me? Still, you need to consider how successful Leonard‰Ûªs brother and sister are.",8
42335,Dr Hofstadter,23, I suppose.,8
42336,Sheldon,23, While my brother and sister are mouth-breathing idiots.,8
42337,Dr Hofstadter,23, Do you suppose you would‰Ûªve flourished more in a reward-based environment?,8
42338,Sheldon,23," Perhaps. But my mom made me spaghetti with chopped-up hot dogs whenever I wanted, so who cares?",8
42339,Scene,23, The apartment. ,8
42340,Leonard,23," Not once did my mother ever give me any love or affection for just being myself, I always had to earn it.",8
42341,Mrs Cooper,23," Oh, Leonard, I‰Ûªm sure she loves you very much. In her own cold godless way.",8
42342,Penny,23," Yeah, and you certainly don‰Ûªt have to earn my love.",8
42343,Leonard,23, Thank you.,8
42344,Penny,23," Of course, you already knew that when you bought me this princess-cut drill bit.",8
42345,Leonard,23, That‰Ûªs not what it is.,8
42346,Penny,23," I know, I know. Zzzzzzzz.",8
42347,Mrs Cooper,23," When your mom gets back, I‰Ûªm gonna need to apologize for the way I spoke to her.",8
42348,Penny,23," Well, come on now, she did kind of start it.",8
42349,Mrs Cooper,23," Doesn‰Ûªt matter, a good Christian would‰Ûªve turned the other cheek. On the other hand, a good Texan would‰Ûªve shot her, so, I just kind of split the difference. Hey, who‰Ûªs in the mood for spaghetti and hot dogs?",8
42350,Leonard,23," Oh, me.",8
42351,Penny,23," Yeah, me, too.",8
42352,Mrs Cooper,23, Coming up.,8
42353,Leonard,23, I don‰Ûªt really feel I deserve it.,8
42354,Scene,23, Howard and Bernadette‰Ûªs house.,8
42355,Howard,23," That was a big sticky mess, but I think I got it.",8
42356,Raj,23, Looks good.,8
42357,Stuart,23, Yeah.,8
42358,Bernadette,23, Look at that. You cleaned it up all by yourself.,8
42359,Howard,23," Yes, I cleaned it up all by myself. Honestly, I don‰Ûªt know why you complain so‰Û_ okay, maybe I missed one spot. Just leave.",8
42360,Scene,23, The apartment.,8
42361,Mrs Cooper,23, I‰Ûªm so glad that you and I were able to bury the hatchet.,8
42362,Dr Hofstadter,23," Me, too. And I respect your right to your beliefs.",8
42363,Mrs Cooper,23, And I will pray for you.,8
42364,Leonard,23," Okay, Mom, let‰Ûªs get you back to your hotel before anyone says anything else.",8
42365,Dr Hofstadter,23, One moment. There‰Ûªs something I need to say to you.,8
42366,Leonard,23," Oh, really? That‰Ûªs too bad.",8
42367,Dr Hofstadter,23," Leonard, I always made you earn my affection, but today I realize that there‰Ûªs more than one way to raise a child.",8
42368,Sheldon,23, I taught her that.,8
42369,Dr Hofstadter,23," Therefore, I would like to initiate a new protocol wherein I shower you with unconditional love.",8
42370,Leonard,23, Wow. When does that start?,8
42371,Dr Hofstadter,23, So needy. Come to Mommy.,8
42372,Penny,23," It‰Ûªs okay, go ahead.",8
42373,Dr Hofstadter,23," Oh, my son.",8
42374,Leonard,23," Oh, my mother.",8
42375,Penny,23," Oh, my God.",8
42376,Scene,23, Howard and Bernadette‰Ûªs house. ,8
42377,Stuart (singing),23, It‰Ûªs a hard-knock life.,8
42378,Together (singing),23," It‰Ûªs the hard-knock life for us, it‰Ûªs the hard-knock life for us. ‰Û÷Stead of treated, we get tricked, ‰Û÷stead of kisses, we get kicked, it‰Ûªs the hard-knock life. Got no folks to speak of so it‰Ûªs the hard-knock row we hoe, cotton blankets ‰Û÷stead of wool, empty bellies ‰Û÷stead of full, it‰Ûªs a hard-knock life.",8
42379,Scene,24, The apartment.,8
42380,Amy,24, Can you believe it‰Ûªs been five years since our first date?,8
42381,Sheldon,24, I know. Do you think I should start watching The Flash TV show?,8
42382,Amy,24, That‰Ûªs what you‰Ûªre thinking about?,8
42383,Sheldon,24," Well, one of the things.",8
42384,Amy,24, Are any of them me?,8
42385,Sheldon,24," Yes. I thought, I can‰Ûªt decide if I should watch The Flash TV show. I know, I‰Ûªll ask Amy. Anyway.",8
42386,Amy,24, What are you doing?,8
42387,Sheldon,24," You‰Ûªre right, you did kind of kill the mood.",8
42388,Amy,24," I didn‰Ûªt kill anything. You did, talking about your stupid TV show.",8
42389,Sheldon,24, Excuse me. Starting to watch a television show that might run for years isn‰Ûªt a decision to take lightly. I‰Ûªm wrestling with a big commitment issue here.,8
42390,Amy,24," Really? That‰Ûªs the commitment issue you‰Ûªre wrestling with? Sheldon, do you understand the irony of your fixation on a man with super speed, while after five years all I can get out of you is a distracted make-out session on a couch?",8
42391,Sheldon,24," Irony‰Ûªs not really my strong suit. But I have been getting better with sarcasm, if you want to give that a try.",8
42392,Amy,24," Oh, sure, I‰Ûªd love to.",8
42393,Sheldon,24, Whenever you‰Ûªre ready.,8
42394,Scene,24, The comic book store.,8
42395,Stuart,24," I don‰Ûªt want to rush you, but I‰Ûªm closing a little early tonight.",8
42396,Raj,24, Ooh. Hot date?,8
42397,Stuart,24," Uh, no. I overheard Bernadette tell Howard she was making him a meat loaf, and you don‰Ûªt have to not ask me twice.",8
42398,Emily,24," If I stick a light bulb on this, wouldn‰Ûªt it make a great lamp for my bedroom?",8
42399,Raj,24," You‰Ûªre kidding, right?",8
42400,Emily,24, Oh. Is this freaking you out?,8
42401,Raj,24," I guess I‰Ûªm just more of a Pottery Barn, Crate and Barrel kind of guy. Maybe Pier 1 if I really want to cut loose.",8
42402,Emily,24, All right. Never mind.,8
42403,Raj,24," No, no, no. Hey, you should totally get it. In fact, I‰Ûªll buy it for you.",8
42404,Stuart,24, Sold.,8
42405,Emily,24," Raj, you don‰Ûªt have to do that.",8
42406,Stuart,24, Too late. No returns.,8
42407,Scene,24, The stairwell.,8
42408,Leonard,24, That was really intense.,8
42409,Penny,24," Well, now we know, next time we go to the farmers‰Ûª market, the order is petting zoo first, then buy vegetables.",8
42410,Leonard,24, Hey.,8
42411,Sheldon,24," Oh, good. You‰Ûªre here. I need your assistance.",8
42412,Leonard,24, Can it wait until I put a Band-Aid on a goat bite?,8
42413,Sheldon,24, What happened?,8
42414,Penny,24," Oh, your buddy got mugged by some baby farm animals.",8
42415,Sheldon,24, Been there.,8
42416,Penny,24, Mmm. So what do you need help with?,8
42417,Sheldon,24," Amy‰Ûªs mad at me, and I‰Ûªm not clear why.",8
42418,Penny,24, Okay. Were you talking before she got upset?,8
42419,Sheldon,24, Yes.,8
42420,Penny,24, That‰Ûªs probably it. What‰Ûªd you say to her?,8
42421,Sheldon,24," Well, I just asked her if I should start watching the new Flash TV series.",8
42422,Penny,24, And that made her angry?,8
42423,Sheldon,24," Baffling, right? We were necking like a couple of hooligans under the school bleachers. I stopped so I could ask the question. Next thing I know, good-bye, kissy face. Hello, yelly face.",8
42424,Penny,24," Well, Sheldon, when you‰Ûªre kissing a girl, she expects the attention to be on her.",8
42425,Sheldon,24, It was. I asked her if she thought I should watch The Flash.,8
42426,Penny,24, Yeah. I‰Ûªm tapping out. Leonard?,8
42427,Leonard,24, I‰Ûªm gonna guess that your main concern is the time commitment of watching an entire season of a new show.,8
42428,Sheldon,24," Oh, no, not just a season. If I‰Ûªm in, I‰Ûªm in for the whole run, even if the quality declines.",8
42429,Leonard,24, I get it. Smallville almost wrecked you.,8
42430,Sheldon,24," Yeah. Exactly. You know, I waited ten years to see a guy everyone knows can fly, fly.",8
42431,Penny,24," Wait, what is wrong with you two? He was talking about television during their date night.",8
42432,Sheldon,24," Oh, not just date night, our fifth anniversary.",8
42433,Penny,24," Okay, see, that‰Ûªs even dumber than you wondering if being bitten by a goat would give you the powers of a goat.",8
42434,Sheldon,24," If that happens, don‰Ûªt make me wait ten years to watch you eat a tin can.",8
42435,Scene,24, Howard and Bernadette‰Ûªs house.,8
42436,Raj,24, You guys ever notice that Emily has a bit of a twisted side?,8
42437,Bernadette,24, You mean ‰Ûªcause she has weird tattoos?,8
42438,Raj,24," No, because she wants to have sex with me in a graveyard.",8
42439,Howard,24, One more time?,8
42440,Raj,24," She and I were supposed to watch the new Avengers movie tonight, but it was sold out. So I said, what else do you want to do? She said, let‰Ûªs go to a cemetery and do it on somebody‰Ûªs grave.",8
42441,Howard,24," Like, a random person or somebody she knew?",8
42442,Raj,24, What difference does it make?,8
42443,Howard,24," Well, if it‰Ûªs her father‰Ûªs grave and they didn‰Ûªt get along, then you know she holds a grudge.",8
42444,Bernadette,24," The only issue is that everybody has their own thing, and as long as it‰Ûªs two consenting adults, I guess I don‰Ûªt see the harm in it.",8
42445,Raj,24," Well, what if it‰Ûªs one consenting adult and one adult who pretends to consent because he‰Ûªs afraid of being alone?",8
42446,Bernadette,24," Well, then I guess bring a blanket. The grass gets damp at night.",8
42447,Raj,24," I don‰Ûªt know, guys. Maybe this relationship isn‰Ûªt for me. Maybe I should break up with her.",8
42448,Howard,24, Right. You‰Ûªre gonna break up with a girl who has sex with you. Can you believe this guy?,8
42449,Bernadette,24," I think if Raj wants to break up with a girl, he can do it.",8
42450,Howard,24, How are you saying that with a straight face?,8
42451,Bernadette,24, I don‰Ûªt know.,8
42452,Raj,24, You guys are being jerks.,8
42453,Howard,24," Buddy, other than Jenny Craig, you‰Ûªve never broken up with a girl in your life.",8
42454,Raj,24, You‰Ûªre one to talk. You‰Ûªve been complaining about Stuart living here for the past year. I don‰Ûªt see you showing him the door.,8
42455,Howard,24," That‰Ûªs not the same thing. Emily‰Ûªs a person. Stuart‰Ûªs more like an infestation, something you spray for.",8
42456,Raj,24," Baloney, okay? You two are as afraid of hurting someone‰Ûªs feelings as I am.",8
42457,Bernadette,24, That‰Ûªs not true. We were just laughing right in your face.,8
42458,Scene,24, The apartment. ,8
42459,Penny,24, Thanks for cooking.,8
42460,Leonard,24, Mmm. My pleasure.,8
42461,Penny,24, That carrot was delicious.,8
42462,Leonard,24, Yeah. I wish I‰Ûªd fought harder for the rest of ‰Ûªem.,8
42463,Penny,24, Still haven‰Ûªt heard from her?,8
42464,Sheldon,24," No, and I‰Ûªm confused. It‰Ûªs been nearly 24 hours. Amy should have figured out she‰Ûªs wrong by now.",8
42465,Penny,24," Hey, I don‰Ûªt think she‰Ûªs wrong about you going too slow in the relationship.",8
42466,Sheldon,24, Too slow?,8
42467,Penny,24," Yeah, you‰Ûªve been going out for years. You haven‰Ûªt even slept together.",8
42468,Sheldon,24, That‰Ûªs right. It‰Ûªs called foreplay. And I could make the case that you two aren‰Ûªt moving forward in your relationship.,8
42469,Penny,24," Uh, hello.",8
42470,Sheldon,24, Hello.,8
42471,Penny,24," No. Sheldon, we‰Ûªre getting married.",8
42472,Sheldon,24," But you‰Ûªve been engaged for over a year now, and you don‰Ûªt even have a wedding date.",8
42473,Penny,24," Well, we will. We‰Ûªre just not in a rush.",8
42474,Sheldon,24, Okay.,8
42475,Leonard,24, We‰Ûªre gonna set a date.,8
42476,Sheldon,24, Okay. If you say so.,8
42477,Penny,24," Yeah, it‰Ûªs just, things are good right now.",8
42478,Leonard,24, Really good.,8
42479,Penny,24, I‰Ûªm focusing on my job.,8
42480,Leonard,24, And we‰Ûªve been busy with our paper.,8
42481,Penny,24, So busy.,8
42482,Leonard,24," Yeah, we‰Ûªll pick a date when we pick a date.",8
42483,Penny,24, Yeah.,8
42484,Sheldon,24, Okay.,8
42485,Penny,24," You know, I can see why Amy‰Ûªs mad at you.",8
42486,Sheldon,24," Yeah, shut up, Sheldon.",8
42487,Scene,24, Howard and Bernadette‰Ûªs house.,8
42488,Bernadette,24, Did you eat all my yoghurt?,8
42489,Howard,24, You mean the one that makes ladies do the thing that ladies pretend they don‰Ûªt do even though they do?,8
42490,Bernadette,24, You know which yoghurt I mean.,8
42491,Howard,24, I didn‰Ûªt touch it. Must have been Stuart.,8
42492,Bernadette,24, Maybe Raj is right. Maybe it‰Ûªs time we tell him he needs to move out.,8
42493,Howard,24, We should have done it months ago.,8
42494,Bernadette,24," I know, but his store was reopening, and then there were the holidays, and then he was sick.",8
42495,Howard,24," Yeah, right. Sick. He didn‰Ûªt have jaundice. He just looks like that.",8
42496,Bernadette,24, All right. Tonight‰Ûªs the night.,8
42497,Howard,24," Agreed. When he gets home, I‰Ûªm dropping the hammer.",8
42498,Bernadette,24," Ooh, I like when you take charge.",8
42499,Howard,24," Oh, I‰Ûªm not taking charge, you‰Ûªre the hammer.",8
42500,Scene,24, The apartment.,8
42501,Leonard,24," So, why haven‰Ûªt we picked a date?",8
42502,Penny,24, You know why.,8
42503,Leonard,24," Well, of course I know why. But just for fun, why?",8
42504,Penny,24," Not in a rush, busy with work‰Û_",8
42505,Sheldon,24, Things are good right now.,8
42506,Penny,24, Really good.,8
42507,Leonard,24," You still want to get married, right?",8
42508,Penny,24," Oh, my God. Yes. Why would you even ask that?",8
42509,Leonard,24, I don‰Ûªt know. Because we don‰Ûªt have a date?,8
42510,Penny,24," Well, you want a date, pick a date.",8
42511,Leonard,24," It‰Ûªs not just the date. We haven‰Ûªt talked about anything. Big wedding, small wedding, indoor, outdoor?",8
42512,Sheldon,24, Outdoor? Oh. I can RSVP no right now.,8
42513,Penny,24," Okay, indoor it is. Big or small?",8
42514,Leonard,24, Is your dad paying for it?,8
42515,Penny,24, I doubt it.,8
42516,Leonard,24," Okay, two friends each.",8
42517,Penny,24," All right, well, I want it in a church.",8
42518,Leonard,24, Fine. I want black-tie.,8
42519,Penny,24, Fine. I want to release butterflies.,8
42520,Sheldon,24, Seriously? Airborne worms?,8
42521,Leonard,24," Okay. Well, then it‰Ûªs settled. Small indoor church wedding, black-tie, no butterflies.",8
42522,Penny,24, Sounds perfect.,8
42523,Leonard,24, Great.,8
42524,Sheldon,24, You still didn‰Ûªt pick a date.,8
42525,Penny,24, Stay out of it.,8
42526,Leonard,24, Shut up.,8
42527,Scene,24, A graveyard.,8
42528,Emily,24, Mmm. It‰Ûªs a beautiful night.,8
42529,Raj,24," Oh, yes, we‰Ûªve got the moon and the trees and Elizabeth McNulty, who apparently died when she was the same age I am.",8
42530,Emily,24," Makes you feel alive, doesn‰Ûªt it?",8
42531,Raj,24," So does enjoying a meal at a well-lit restaurant, but here we are.",8
42532,Emily,24," You aren‰Ûªt scared, are you?",8
42533,Raj,24," Of ghosts, no. Of you, little bit.",8
42534,Scene,24, The apartment.,8
42535,Sheldon,24, I‰Ûªm sorry I‰Ûªve upset you. I shouldn‰Ûªt have asked so many questions.,8
42536,Penny,24," No, it‰Ûªs okay.",8
42537,Leonard,24," Yeah, maybe it‰Ûªs good you got us talking about this stuff.",8
42538,Sheldon,24," Well, look at that, even when I‰Ûªm causing problems, I make the world a better place. Hey, next, why don‰Ûªt we tackle your penchant for whining and Penny‰Ûªs love of the ol‰Ûª glug-glug?",8
42539,Penny,24," Uh, Sheldon, I think we‰Ûªre good for now.",8
42540,Sheldon,24," Ah, well, very well. So does this mean you‰Ûªll finally pick a wedding date?",8
42541,Penny,24, Here we go again. Why is everyone so concerned with us setting a date? We‰Ûªre committed to each other. We‰Ûªre happy. A ceremony isn‰Ûªt gonna change anything.,8
42542,Sheldon,24," So you‰Ûªre never getting married? It‰Ûªs his whining, isn‰Ûªt it?",8
42543,Leonard,24," Sheldon, I‰Ûªm not a whiner.",8
42544,Sheldon,24, It‰Ûªs amusing that he doesn‰Ûªt hear it.,8
42545,Leonard,24," Look, all she‰Ûªs saying is we are in love so it doesn‰Ûªt matter if we get married tomorrow or a year from now or 50 years from now.",8
42546,Penny,24," Ew, 50? We‰Ûªll be old and gross.",8
42547,Leonard,24," Yeah, but we‰Ûªll be old and gross together.",8
42548,Sheldon,24," My aunt and uncle were married 63 years. Towards the end, it was like watching cheese melt.",8
42549,Penny,24," Um, I‰Ûªm free tonight.",8
42550,Leonard,24, Are you saying you want to get married?,8
42551,Penny,24, Vegas isn‰Ûªt that far away.,8
42552,Leonard,24, I‰Ûªm in. Let‰Ûªs do it.,8
42553,Sheldon,24, After all these years. I‰Ûªm really happy for the two of you.,8
42554,Penny,24," Oh, thank you.",8
42555,Leonard,24, Thanks.,8
42556,Sheldon,24, Now get out of my spot.,8
42557,Scene,24, Howard and Bernadette‰Ûªs house.,8
42558,Howard,24," Bernie, Stuart just pulled up. So remember, the key is to be firm. Show no weakness.",8
42559,Bernadette,24, Right.,8
42560,Howard,24, Good luck.,8
42561,Bernadette,24," Howard Joel Wolowitz, you get back here.",8
42562,Howard,24, Never should have told you my middle name.,8
42563,Stuart,24," Hey, guys.",8
42564,Howard,24," Hey, you got a minute?",8
42565,Stuart,24," Sure. Uh, let me just put this stuff in the fridge. I felt bad for finishing your yoghurt, so I bought more. And, Howard, your favourite fruit is in season. Crunch Berries.",8
42566,Bernadette,24, Don‰Ûªt let that sway you.,8
42567,Howard,24, It‰Ûªs hard not to. They taste so much better than real berries.,8
42568,Stuart,24, What‰Ûªs up?,8
42569,Bernadette,24," So, we need to talk.",8
42570,Scene,24, The graveyard.,8
42571,Emily,24, You okay?,8
42572,Raj,24, I think we should talk.,8
42573,Scene,24, Howard and Bernadette‰Ûªs house.,8
42574,Stuart,24, Is everything okay?,8
42575,Bernadette,24," Well, you‰Ûªve been living here a while now.",8
42576,Stuart,24," I know. I may sell comic books at work, but the real superheroes are sitting right in front of me.",8
42577,Bernadette,24, Yeah.,8
42578,Howard,24, His middle name is David. Go.,8
42579,Scene,24, The graveyard.,8
42580,Raj,24," Look, I care about you a lot, but we are very different people.",8
42581,Emily,24, Are you breaking up with me?,8
42582,Raj,24," No, no, I‰Ûªm just pointing out that you‰Ûªre dark on the inside and I‰Ûªm dark on the outside.",8
42583,Scene,24, Howard and Bernadette‰Ûªs house.,8
42584,Bernadette,24," So, anyway, what I‰Ûªm trying to say is‰Û_ (phone rings)",8
42585,Howard,24, You need to take that?,8
42586,Stuart,24," It‰Ûªs just my dad, probably calling to wish me a happy birthday. I‰Ûªll call him back. You were saying?",8
42587,Scene,24, The graveyard.,8
42588,Emily,24," Look, Raj, be honest with me. If you want to end things, just do it. Don‰Ûªt expect me to do it for you.",8
42589,Raj,24, End things? I‰Ûªm trying to tell you that I love you.,8
42590,Scene,24, Howard and Bernadette‰Ûªs house.,8
42591,Howard and Bernadette (singing),24, Happy birthday to you.,8
42592,Scene,24, Leonard‰Ûªs car.,8
42593,Penny,24," Wow, there‰Ûªs a Denny‰Ûªs in Vegas you can actually get married in.",8
42594,Leonard,24, Doesn‰Ûªt sound very romantic.,8
42595,Penny,24," Yeah, but we could get heart-shaped pancakes.",8
42596,Leonard,24, I‰Ûªm sure we‰Ûªll find a decent chapel.,8
42597,Penny,24, Yeah. This is crazy.,8
42598,Leonard,24, I know. You think people are gonna be mad?,8
42599,Penny,24," Maybe. But this isn‰Ûªt about them, it‰Ûªs about us.",8
42600,Leonard,24, It is. It is about us.,8
42601,Penny,24," And you know what the best part is? We took our time. I mean, we met, we were friends for a couple years, then we got together, and then we got untogether, then we worked out all our problems, and now we know everything about each other, we can just go forward with no surprises and no regrets.",8
42602,Leonard,24, Right. No surprises.,8
42603,Penny,24, And no regrets.,8
42604,Leonard,24," Uh, well, there, there‰Ûªs one thing I feel I should tell you.",8
42605,Penny,24, What?,8
42606,Leonard,24," You know, so we can go into this with no secrets between us.",8
42607,Penny,24, What?,8
42608,Leonard,24," Remember, uh, a couple years back when I was on that research ship in the North Sea?",8
42609,Penny,24, Yeah.,8
42610,Leonard,24," Okay, well, there, there was a lot of drinking and craziness going on.",8
42611,Penny,24," No, you told me.",8
42612,Leonard,24," Okay, um, well, there was this girl.",8
42613,Penny,24, What did you do?,8
42614,Leonard,24, Nothing really. It was just kissing.,8
42615,Penny,24, And then what?,8
42616,Leonard,24," And then nothing. I stopped it. But it still bothers me, and I wanted you to know.",8
42617,Penny,24, All right.,8
42618,Leonard,24, Did you ever do anything like this since we‰Ûªve been?,8
42619,Penny,24," Nope, never.",8
42620,Leonard,24," Oh, that‰Ûªs too bad.",8
42621,Penny,24," You know, can I ask you a question?",8
42622,Leonard,24, Hmm?,8
42623,Penny,24, Why are you telling me this now?,8
42624,Leonard,24," Well, like I said, we‰Ûªre about to get married, and I, I want a clean slate. No secrets.",8
42625,Penny,24," Really? Because to me, it seems like we‰Ûªre about to get married and you‰Ûªre trying to sabotage it.",8
42626,Leonard,24, Would you rather I didn‰Ûªt tell you?,8
42627,Penny,24," No, I don‰Ûªt want there to be secrets between us.",8
42628,Leonard,24," See, now I‰Ûªm confused. I mean, what, what am I supposed to do?",8
42629,Penny,24," Uh, keep your mouth off other women.",8
42630,Leonard,24," I can do that. Uh, uh, from now on, this mouth, you and food, that‰Ûªs it.",8
42631,Penny,24, Okay.,8
42632,Leonard,24, Yeah?,8
42633,Penny,24," Look, I‰Ûªm not happy this happened, but I think I can get past it. I mean, we weren‰Ûªt engaged at the time, and it was just kissing.",8
42634,Leonard,24, Right.,8
42635,Penny,24, Just kissing.,8
42636,Leonard,24," It wasn‰Ûªt even very good. She was a smoker, I‰Ûªd just been seasick.",8
42637,Penny,24," Okay, that‰Ûªs enough. Stop talking.",8
42638,Leonard,24," So, we‰Ûªre still getting married?",8
42639,Penny,24, Yes.,8
42640,Leonard,24, Because we love each other.,8
42641,Penny,24, Yes.,8
42642,Leonard,24, And it‰Ûªs the happiest day of our lives.,8
42643,Penny,24," Ha-ha, don‰Ûªt push it.",8
42644,Scene,24, The apartment. ,8
42645,Amy (on skype),24, Hello.,8
42646,Sheldon,24," Hello. Listen, I‰Ûªve been thinking a lot about relationships and how difficult they can be, and I think‰Û_",8
42647,Amy,24," I‰Ûªve been thinking about them, too, Sheldon. Being your girlfriend is so challenging. Emotionally, physically. I‰Ûªve been incredibly patient for years.",8
42648,Sheldon,24, Strongly disagree. Go on.,8
42649,Amy,24," Okay, well, this isn‰Ûªt easy to say, because I love you, but I need some time to take a step back and re-evaluate our situation.",8
42650,Sheldon,24, Oh.,8
42651,Amy,24, I hope you understand.,8
42652,Sheldon,24, Okay.,8
42653,Amy,24," Bye, Sheldon.",8
42654,Sheldon,24," Well, Gollum, you‰Ûªre an expert on rings. What do I do with this one?",8
42655,Scene,1, A Wedding Chapel.,9
42656,Penny,1," So, what package are you thinking?",9
42657,Leonard,1," Mm, this one comes with music and flowers. Oh, they even stream the whole thing live on the Internet.",9
42658,Penny,1, Why would we want that?,9
42659,Leonard,1," ‰Û÷Cause there‰Ûªs a lot of gorgeous blondes out there who don‰Ûªt believe they can land a short, nearsighted scientist. Let‰Ûªs give them hope.",9
42660,Penny,1, Whatever. Put us on the Internet. I‰Ûªve always wanted a wedding with a comment section.,9
42661,Leonard,1," If you‰Ûªre not into this, we can do it another time.",9
42662,Penny,1," No. No, I want to. Look, we‰Ûªve put this off long enough. Let‰Ûªs do it.",9
42663,Leonard,1," Aw. That‰Ûªs exactly what you said the first time we slept together. (Phone) Oh, excuse me. Sheldon. Hey.",9
42664,Sheldon,1," Leonard, have you gotten married yet?",9
42665,Leonard,1, No. Why?,9
42666,Sheldon,1, Good. Don‰Ûªt do it.,9
42667,Leonard,1, Why not?,9
42668,Sheldon,1," Some important new information has come to light. Women are the worst. I thought it was paper cuts, but I was wrong. No piece of paper ever cut me this deep.",9
42669,Leonard,1, What happened now?,9
42670,Sheldon,1, Amy has ended our relationship.,9
42671,Leonard,1," Oh, no. Seriously?",9
42672,Penny,1, What‰Ûªs going on?,9
42673,Leonard,1, Amy broke up with Sheldon.,9
42674,Penny,1, She did?,9
42675,Sheldon,1, Is Penny crying?,9
42676,Leonard,1, No.,9
42677,Sheldon,1," No, of course not. They thrive on our suffering.",9
42678,Leonard,1," Buddy, I‰Ûªm so sorry. Is there anything I can do?",9
42679,Sheldon,1," Yes. If I ever talk about going out with a girl again, roll your eyes at me like I do to you when you say dumb things.",9
42680,Leonard,1," Sheldon, uh, okay, just because you‰Ûªre going through this with Amy doesn‰Ûªt mean that all women are bad.",9
42681,Sheldon,1, Whatever.,9
42682,Penny (on phone),1," Hey, I just heard about you and Sheldon. Are you okay?",9
42683,Amy,1, Not really. Can you come over?,9
42684,Penny,1," Uh, actually I‰Ûªm in Vegas. Leonard and I are about to get married.",9
42685,Amy,1, Hold on. You‰Ûªre getting married and you didn‰Ûªt invite me?,9
42686,Penny,1," Well, it was kind of a spur-of-the-moment thing.",9
42687,Amy,1, Wow. Hope I can catch the bouquet from here.,9
42688,Penny,1," Amy, don‰Ûªt be like that.",9
42689,Sheldon,1, Why did I just hear Amy‰Ûªs name?,9
42690,Leonard,1, Penny‰Ûªs on the phone with her.,9
42691,Sheldon,1," Did she say anything about me? Never mind. I don‰Ûªt care. Well, if you care, you can find out and tell me. Just don‰Ûªt be shocked when you find out that I don‰Ûªt care.",9
42692,Penny,1," Okay, will you relax? You‰Ûªre not missing anything special.",9
42693,Leonard,1, Hey.,9
42694,Penny,1," She‰Ûªs upset. Look, it‰Ûªs gonna be a great wedding. Look at you in your little suit.",9
42695,Sheldon,1, Amy‰Ûªs upset? Is it about me?,9
42696,Leonard,1," No, I think it‰Ûªs because we‰Ûªre eloping.",9
42697,Sheldon,1," Your marriage is causing her pain? Yeah, great, I take it back. Go ahead and do it. Yay for love.",9
42698,Scene,1, Outside Amy‰Ûªs apartment. ,9
42699,Sheldon,1, Hello.,9
42700,Amy,1, Oh. What are you doing here?,9
42701,Sheldon,1," When last we spoke, you said you needed time.",9
42702,Amy,1," Well, it‰Ûªs only been 11 hours.",9
42703,Sheldon,1," The Lord of the Rings trilogy was nearly 11 hours. I made you watch that, you said it was an eternity.",9
42704,Amy,1," Sheldon, when I‰Ûªm ready to talk, I‰Ûªll let you know.",9
42705,Sheldon,1, Very well. You seem to be headed somewhere. May I walk with you?,9
42706,Amy,1, Sure.,9
42707,Sheldon,1," Boy, I‰Ûªm glad we‰Ûªre going out again.",9
42708,Amy,1, We‰Ûªre not back together.,9
42709,Sheldon,1," Why? Is there someone else? Just couldn‰Ûªt wait for that first notch on your bedpost, could you?",9
42710,Amy,1," If you must know, I‰Ûªm going to Howard and Bernadette‰Ûªs to watch the wedding.",9
42711,Sheldon,1, And who‰Ûªs this guy you‰Ûªre taking?,9
42712,Amy,1, There‰Ûªs no guy.,9
42713,Sheldon,1," Oh, you‰Ûªre going to a wedding alone? That‰Ûªs sad.",9
42714,Amy,1, I‰Ûªm not gonna be alone. I‰Ûªll be with my friends.,9
42715,Sheldon,1," Your friends? Well, I think you mean my friends. And why wasn‰Ûªt I invited to this?",9
42716,Amy,1, Maybe because the two of us being there would make them feel awkward.,9
42717,Sheldon,1, We make everyone feel awkward. That‰Ûªs our thing.,9
42718,Scene,1, The Wedding Chapel. ,9
42719,Leonard,1, They‰Ûªre running a little behind. Should be pretty soon.,9
42720,Penny,1, Okay.,9
42721,Leonard,1," Hey, if you‰Ûªre hungry, there‰Ûªs a breakfast buffet at the strip club next door.",9
42722,Penny,1," Thanks, but I don‰Ûªt like glitter on my scrambled eggs.",9
42723,Leonard,1," I don‰Ûªt think the strippers prepare the meal, but okay. Look, it‰Ûªs not how I pictured it either, but I‰Ûªm still glad we‰Ûªre doing it.",9
42724,Penny,1," Me, too.",9
42725,Leonard,1, You sure?,9
42726,Penny,1, Yes.,9
42727,Leonard,1, And you promise you‰Ûªre okay with everything from the car?,9
42728,Penny,1," Oh, my God, would you stop bringing it up?",9
42729,Leonard,1, You‰Ûªre right. I‰Ûªm sorry. We have the rest of our lives to dredge stuff up from the past and fight about it. So what do you think? Should we run next door and grab a bite?,9
42730,Penny,1, What if they call our names?,9
42731,Leonard,1," Oh, don‰Ûªt worry. They gave me this vibrating coaster.",9
42732,Penny,1," Oh, and the fairy tale continues.",9
42733,Scene,1, Howard and Bernadette‰Ûªs House.,9
42734,Amy,1, Thank you for doing this.,9
42735,Bernadette,1, Our pleasure. You feeling okay?,9
42736,Amy,1," We were together for so long, I honestly don‰Ûªt know what I‰Ûªm feeling.",9
42737,Howard,1," Well, that‰Ûªs understandable. You forgot. It‰Ûªs called happy.",9
42738,Bernadette,1, Howard.,9
42739,Howard,1, I‰Ûªm not saying anything bad. Just that she was in love with her captor and somehow managed to escape from his dark and crazy dungeon.,9
42740,Stuart,1," I know what you‰Ûªre going through. My, my, my last breakup was pretty tough.",9
42741,Amy,1, Oh. What was her name?,9
42742,Stuart,1," Hey, it‰Ûªs a true story. I don‰Ûªt need the third degree.",9
42743,Bernadette,1," For God‰Ûªs sake, Sheldon, what are you doing?",9
42744,Sheldon,1, I didn‰Ûªt want to come in. I was told it would make everyone feel uncomfortable. So I‰Ûªll just stay out here and pretend that I don‰Ûªt have to go to the bathroom.,9
42745,Bernadette,1," Howard, do something.",9
42746,Howard,1, I‰Ûªm on it.,9
42747,Amy,1," Sheldon, you being here might not be making things better.",9
42748,Sheldon,1, I see. And is that why everybody was invited but me?,9
42749,Amy,1," They didn‰Ûªt invite everybody but you.Bernadette invited me, and Stuart lives here.",9
42750,Raj,1, Who wants hot cinnamon rolls?,9
42751,Scene,1, The Wedding Chapel.,9
42752,Official,1," So, when you hear the music, that‰Ûªs your cue. Any questions?",9
42753,Leonard,1," Oh, the package that we paid for said the aisle was supposed to be strewn with rose petals.",9
42754,Official,1, Where are the rose petals?!,9
42755,Leonard,1, You know what? It‰Ûªs fine.,9
42756,Female Voice,1, We can use the potpourri from the bathroom!,9
42757,Penny,1," Really, we‰Ûªre good.",9
42758,Leonard,1," Yup, just want to get married.",9
42759,Penny,1, Yeah.,9
42760,Official,1, Great. I‰Ûªll see you two up there.,9
42761,Leonard,1, This is it.,9
42762,Penny,1, I know.,9
42763,Leonard,1, I love you.,9
42764,Penny,1," I love you, too.",9
42765,Female Voice,1, Was that a yes or no on the potpourri?,9
42766,Penny,1," No, thank you.",9
42767,Leonard,1, We‰Ûªre good.,9
42768,Scene,1, Howard and Bernadette‰Ûªs House.,9
42769,Sheldon,1," Raj, you‰Ûªre probably wondering why Amy and I aren‰Ûªt showing any affection to one another.",9
42770,Raj,1, Didn‰Ûªt even crack the top ten.,9
42771,Sheldon,1," Well, you should know that she recently broke up with me.",9
42772,Amy,1, I said I needed time to think.,9
42773,Raj,1, I‰Ûªm sure you guys will figure something out.,9
42774,Sheldon,1, You hear that? Raj is devastated.,9
42775,Bernadette,1," Sheldon, shh. The wedding‰Ûªs starting.",9
42776,Sheldon,1," I see what‰Ûªs happening. Sides are forming. Well, if Bernadette‰Ûªs on Amy‰Ûªs team, I pick Howard.",9
42777,Howard,1, I‰Ûªm not taking sides.,9
42778,Sheldon,1," Fine, I guess I‰Ûªm stuck with Raj.",9
42779,Raj,1, Really?,9
42780,Stuart,1, At least you got picked.,9
42781,Scene,1, The Wedding Chapel.,9
42782,Official,1," Before I go any further, have either of you prepared your own vows?",9
42783,Leonard,1, Yes.,9
42784,Penny,1, No. You wrote vows?,9
42785,Leonard,1, Yeah.,9
42786,Penny,1," Well, I don‰Ûªt have any. You‰Ûªre kind of making me look bad.",9
42787,Leonard,1, It‰Ûªs okay. I don‰Ûªt have to say them.,9
42788,Penny,1," No, no, no, go ahead. I‰Ûªll come up with something mushy, you‰Ûªll cry, we got this.",9
42789,Leonard,1," Penny, we are made of particles that have existed since the moment the universe began. I like to think those atoms travelled 14 billion years through time and space to create us, so that we could be together and make each other whole.",9
42790,Penny,1, Wow.,9
42791,Official,1, Penny?,9
42792,Penny,1," Right. Um, okay. Leonard, I mean, you‰Ûªre not only the love of my life. I mean, you‰Ûªre my best friend, and, you‰Ûªve got a friend in me. You got troubles. I got ‰Ûªem, too. There isn‰Ûªt anything I wouldn‰Ûªt do for you. We stick together, and we can see it through, ‰Ûªcause you‰Ûªve got a friend in me.",9
42793,Official,1, Is that the song from Toy Story?,9
42794,Penny,1, He loves that movie.,9
42795,Leonard,1, I do.,9
42796,Scene,1, Howard and Bernadette‰Ûªs house.,9
42797,Bernadette,1," Aw, that was beautiful.",9
42798,Howard,1," Yeah. I mean, not like our wedding beautiful.",9
42799,Bernadette,1," No, we totally won.",9
42800,Sheldon,1," Amy, I don‰Ûªt understand, are we broken up or not? It‰Ûªs like you can‰Ûªt make up your mind.",9
42801,Amy,1, It‰Ûªs because you‰Ûªre not giving me any space to think.,9
42802,Sheldon,1," Well, you should think fast, because men can sire offspring their entire lives, but those eggs you‰Ûªre toting around have a sell-by date.",9
42803,Amy,1," You know what, Sheldon, you‰Ûªve made this really easy. You‰Ûªre immature, you‰Ûªre selfish, you just insulted me to my face. I don‰Ûªt need any more time to think. We‰Ûªre broken up.",9
42804,Bernadette,1, Amy.,9
42805,Sheldon,1, Will someone take me home?,9
42806,Raj,1," Yeah. Come on, I‰Ûªll give you a ride.",9
42807,Penny,1, We did it.,9
42808,Leonard,1," Yeah, I‰Ûªm so glad you guys could watch.",9
42809,Howard,1, We‰Ûªll say it was beautiful in the comment section.,9
42810,Scene,1, Hotel corridor.,9
42811,Leonard,1," No, no, no. Hang on. I believe I‰Ûªm supposed to carry you across the threshold.",9
42812,Penny,1, Can you?,9
42813,Leonard,1, Who do you think carries Sheldon to bed when he falls asleep in front of the TV?,9
42814,Penny,1," Okay, let‰Ûªs do it. You gonna make it?",9
42815,Leonard,1, I‰Ûªm okay.,9
42816,Penny,1, Nicely done.,9
42817,Leonard,1," Thank you. Finally, there‰Ûªs a Mrs. Hofstadter who isn‰Ûªt disappointed in me.",9
42818,Penny,1," Well, the night is still young.",9
42819,Leonard,1, Everything all right?,9
42820,Penny,1, Yeah. I guess.,9
42821,Leonard,1, Just tell me.,9
42822,Penny,1," It‰Ûªs just, when we were kissing, I couldn‰Ûªt help but picture you with that other girl.",9
42823,Leonard,1," Oh, no. No, come on. I have a friend in you. You said so.",9
42824,Penny,1, You‰Ûªre right. Just forget it.,9
42825,Leonard,1," Yeah. Okay, listen. If you‰Ûªre imagining that it was sexy, it wasn‰Ûªt. We, we were both drunk, and she smelled like an ashtray. The boat was moving a lot, so I chipped her tooth.",9
42826,Penny,1, Did you feel guilty?,9
42827,Leonard,1," No, she had dental insurance.",9
42828,Penny,1, Did you feel guilty after kissing her?,9
42829,Leonard,1, Yes. I felt guilty as soon as it happened. I feel guilty every time I see her.,9
42830,Penny,1," What do you mean, every time you see her?",9
42831,Leonard,1," What do I mean? Boy, that‰Ûªs a toughie.",9
42832,Penny,1, You still see her?,9
42833,Leonard,1," Well, no, not socially. But, you know, just at work.",9
42834,Penny,1, You work with her? How could you not tell me that?,9
42835,Leonard,1," I wanted to tell you in the car, but you told me to stop talking",9
42836,Penny,1," Oh, okay. So you‰Ûªre saying this is my fault?",9
42837,Leonard,1," No, of course not. Okay, look, instead of fighting, why don‰Ûªt we dim the lights, um, get naked and make a baby? I was trying to lighten the mood. It‰Ûªs not easy. You try it.",9
42838,Scene,1, The apartment.,9
42839,Sheldon (on phone),1," Hello, Mother.",9
42840,Mrs Cooper,1, Shelly! How‰Ûªs my baby doing?,9
42841,Sheldon,1, I just wanted to let you know that you can remove Amy from your nightly prayers. Unless you‰Ûªre open to praying for a beehive to fall on her head.,9
42842,Mrs Cooper,1," Oh, what‰Ûªs going on?",9
42843,Sheldon,1, She broke up with me.,9
42844,Mrs Cooper,1," Oh, Shelly.",9
42845,Sheldon,1," No, I‰Ûªll be okay. But I think that I‰Ûªd like to send the ring back to you.",9
42846,Mrs Cooper,1," Well, let‰Ûªs not be hasty. Are you sure it‰Ûªs over for good?",9
42847,Sheldon,1, It‰Ûªs over for me. I‰Ûªm done with women. Like when I swore off Pop Rocks. They both hurt you on purpose.,9
42848,Mrs Cooper,1, You want to tell me what happened?,9
42849,Sheldon,1, Are you going to say it‰Ûªs all part of God‰Ûªs plan?,9
42850,Mrs Cooper,1, Good chance.,9
42851,Sheldon,1," Then no, thank you.",9
42852,Mrs Cooper,1," Well, honey, don‰Ûªt send it back yet. Your sister‰Ûªs married, and I‰Ûªm not letting your brother give my grandmother‰Ûªs ring to that whore he‰Ûªs dating.",9
42853,Sheldon,1, Wasn‰Ûªt Mary Magdalene a woman of ill repute?,9
42854,Mrs Cooper,1," When your idiot brother redeems mankind, he can date whoever he wants.",9
42855,Scene,1, Howard and Bernadette‰Ûªs house.,9
42856,Bernadette,1," I know it hurts now, but it‰Ûªs gonna get better.",9
42857,Amy,1, Yeah.,9
42858,Howard,1, Everything‰Ûªs gonna be okay.,9
42859,Stuart,1, You‰Ûªve got so much to offer.,9
42860,Amy,1, Thank you.,9
42861,Stuart,1, Any man would be lucky to have you.,9
42862,Bernadette,1, That‰Ûªs true.,9
42863,Amy,1, I just hope I did the right thing.,9
42864,Stuart,1," I‰Ûªm sure you did. Maybe that‰Ûªs the problem, you always do the right thing. Maybe it‰Ûªs time to do the wrong thing.",9
42865,Amy,1, Like you‰Ûªre doing right now?,9
42866,Stuart,1, Exactly.,9
42867,Scene,1, The stairwell. ,9
42868,Leonard,1, I asked you over and over if you were okay. Why would you go through with the wedding if you weren‰Ûªt?,9
42869,Penny,1," I thought I was okay, but it turns out I‰Ûªm not.",9
42870,Leonard,1," Okay, listen, I may not have been entirely faithful, but you, you are not easy to lift.",9
42871,Sheldon,1," Wow. Well, marriage must agree with you. Well, you are just glowing.",9
42872,Leonard,1, I‰Ûªm not glowing. I‰Ûªm upset.,9
42873,Sheldon,1," Well, whatever it is, it agrees with you.",9
42874,Scene,1, Penny‰Ûªs apartment.,9
42875,Sheldon (outside),1," Knock, knock, knock, Penny? Knock, knock, knock, Penny? Knock, knock, knock, Penny?",9
42876,Penny,1, What‰Ûªs this?,9
42877,Sheldon,1," Leonard told me what happened, so I took it upon myself to make you a hot beverage.",9
42878,Penny,1, Oh. That‰Ûªs so sweet of you.,9
42879,Sheldon,1," Yeah. I know. Turns out, being sweet isn‰Ûªt enough to keep a girl these days. I blame Madonna.",9
42880,Penny,1, I‰Ûªm sorry to hear about you and Amy.,9
42881,Sheldon,1," Well, I‰Ûªm sorry about Leonard. Thought I raised him better than that.",9
42882,Penny,1," You know, it‰Ûªs bad enough what happened, but then he tried to hide the fact that he sees her all the time at the university.",9
42883,Sheldon,1, He does? Who is it?,9
42884,Penny,1, Some girl named Mandy.,9
42885,Sheldon,1, Mandy Chao?,9
42886,Penny,1, Yeah.,9
42887,Sheldon,1," Oh, you don‰Ûªt need to worry about her. She‰Ûªs brilliant and attractive. She can do way better",9
42888,Penny,1, That‰Ûªs great.,9
42889,Sheldon,1," Wait a minute. I know this may sound far fetched, but I‰Ûªm on the market now. You know, if I dated Mandy, that would teach both Leonard and Amy a lesson.",9
42890,Penny,1, That‰Ûªs ridiculous.,9
42891,Sheldon,1," Oh, you‰Ûªre right. I could never be with a woman whose self-esteem was so low she‰Ûªd be with Leonard.",9
42892,Penny,1, I‰Ûªm with Leonard.,9
42893,Sheldon,1," Yeah, I know. Forever. Who would have believed these things would happen to us?",9
42894,Penny,1, Right? I can‰Ûªt believe Amy actually went through with it.,9
42895,Sheldon,1, Hang on. You knew that she was going to end it with me? Did you try and stop her?,9
42896,Penny,1, I told her to be true to herself and do what makes her happy.,9
42897,Sheldon,1, Do what makes her happy? She plays the harp and her car is paid for. How much happier can she be?,9
42898,Penny,1," Okay, look, it‰Ûªs not my fault that she thought you were a bad boyfriend.",9
42899,Sheldon,1," I see. Well, I think I‰Ûªll be going.",9
42900,Penny,1, Sheldon.,9
42901,Sheldon,1," No, no, no, no. We are done here. Would you mind opening the door and then angrily slamming it behind me?",9
42902,Penny,1, Sure.,9
42903,Sheldon,1," Thank you. And slam it hard, because I am pretty steamed.",9
42904,Scene,1, Howard and Bernadette‰Ûªs house.,9
42905,Howard (on phone),1," All right, Leonard, hang in there. Talk to you tomorrow.",9
42906,Bernadette,1, What happened? They just got married.,9
42907,Howard,1, I don‰Ûªt know. It‰Ûªs a mess. They had a huge fight in Vegas.,9
42908,Bernadette,1, Think they‰Ûªll break up?,9
42909,Howard,1, I don‰Ûªt know. Sounds pretty bad. Penny‰Ûªs back in her apartment all by herself.,9
42910,Stuart,1, Really?,9
42911,Scene,1, The apartment.,9
42912,Sheldon,1, Would you like to hear another reason why men are better than women?,9
42913,Leonard,1," Sure, let‰Ûªs make it an even hundred.",9
42914,Sheldon,1, You would never kiss me and make me say I love you and then break up with me.,9
42915,Leonard,1, I wouldn‰Ûªt.,9
42916,Sheldon,1, And you know why? ‰Û÷Cause you‰Ûªre a man. The champagne of genders.,9
42917,Leonard,1," Well, I may be a man, but I think I‰Ûªm the one that screwed up on this one.",9
42918,Sheldon,1," Yeah, well, and you admit it, like a man. All you hear women say is, I‰Ûªll just have a salad. You know? Where‰Ûªs my lip gloss? I think this element should be called radium. That last one was Madame Curie.",9
42919,Leonard,1, I figured that out.,9
42920,Sheldon,1, You know what? She was kind of an honorary man. She had a penis made of science.,9
42921,Leonard,1, Can‰Ûªt believe I‰Ûªm spending my wedding night with you.,9
42922,Sheldon,1, Really? I never imagined it any other way.,9
42923,Scene,2, The apartment.,9
42924,Sheldon,2, Why are you up?,9
42925,Leonard,2," How am I supposed to sleep? I‰Ûªve been married less than 24 hours, and my wife isn‰Ûªt speaking to me.",9
42926,Sheldon,2," Perhaps you can think of this n a more positive light. In one day, you‰Ûªve managed to do what it takes many couples decades to achieve.",9
42927,Penny (entering),2, Hi.,9
42928,Leonard,2, Hey.,9
42929,Penny,2, You couldn‰Ûªt sleep either?,9
42930,Leonard,2, Of course not.,9
42931,Sheldon,2," Me neither. But I just had a tickle in my throat, not profound marital problems.",9
42932,Leonard,2, What are we gonna do?,9
42933,Penny,2, I don‰Ûªt know.,9
42934,Leonard,2," Please, tell me how I can fix it.",9
42935,Sheldon,2," Glad you asked. As I see it, there‰Ûªs a simple solution. Your lips had a dalliance with the lips of another woman. It seems only logical that to restore balance to the relationship, you should find another man and dally with him. And by dally, I mean some hardcore mouth-on-mouth action.",9
42936,Leonard,2," Okay, that is the stupidest thing I‰Ûªve ever heard.",9
42937,Penny,2," Actually, I think he‰Ûªs onto something.",9
42938,Leonard,2," You can‰Ûªt be serious. ‰Û÷Cause I messed up and made out with a girl, you‰Ûªre gonna do the same with a random guy?",9
42939,Sheldon,2, I‰Ûªm currently single.,9
42940,Penny,2, That‰Ûªs true. You are.,9
42941,Leonard,2, What is happening?,9
42942,Sheldon,2, I will tell you what is happening. I am saving my best friend‰Ûªs marriage.,9
42943,Leonard (waking up),2, U-u-u-uh!,9
42944,Scene,2, The apartment.,9
42945,Amy (on skype),2," Sheldon, I don‰Ûªt think you understand how being broken up works. The only way I can sort through my feelings is if there is space between us. Every time I see you, it re-traumatizes me. I go through the pain all over again.",9
42946,Sheldon,2," Well, hello to you, too.",9
42947,Amy,2, What do you want?,9
42948,Sheldon,2," I understand we‰Ûªre no longer a couple, but I would like to remind you that we made a baby together.",9
42949,Amy,2, What baby?,9
42950,Sheldon,2, A precocious little Internet show known as Fun With Flags.,9
42951,Amy,2, I‰Ûªm hanging up.,9
42952,Sheldon,2, Great. See you in about half an hour.,9
42953,Amy,2," Sheldon, I am not doing Fun With Flags with you.",9
42954,Sheldon,2, Why not?,9
42955,Amy,2, Because we‰Ûªre broken up.,9
42956,Sheldon,2," Sonny and Cher made it work. Their variety show kept going long after the divorce, and here we are still talking about them.",9
42957,Amy,2, No one‰Ûªs talking about Sonny and Cher.,9
42958,Sheldon,2," You must be thinking about Donny and Marie, ‰Ûªcause you and I are clearly talking about Sonny and Cher.",9
42959,Amy,2," Sheldon, this has to stop. I know it‰Ûªs hard. It‰Ûªs hard for me, too. But I‰Ûªve seen and talked to you more in the two days we‰Ûªve been broken up than in the last two months that we were together.",9
42960,Sheldon,2," Well, if you want to see less of me, maybe we should go out again.",9
42961,Scene,2, The Comic Book Store.,9
42962,Raj,2, I can‰Ûªt believe you made out with Mandy Chao.,9
42963,Leonard,2," Well, trust me, I wish it never happened.",9
42964,Raj,2, And you knew about this this whole time?,9
42965,Howard,2, I did.,9
42966,Raj,2, And you didn‰Ûªt think to tell me?,9
42967,Howard,2, Leonard asked me to keep it to myself.,9
42968,Raj,2, Let‰Ûªs leave Leonard out of this for the moment. This is about you and me.,9
42969,Leonard,2," Wait, wait, wait, how is my day-old marriage falling apart becoming about you two?",9
42970,Raj,2, Hang on. What do I need to do to make you trust me?,9
42971,Howard,2," You think it‰Ûªs hard having one wife, try having two.",9
42972,Raj,2, I bet you told Bernadette all about how he was screwing around with Mandy Chao.,9
42973,Leonard,2," Oh, we didn‰Ûªt screw around. We just got drunk and made out.",9
42974,Raj,2, Whatever. It would have been nice to hear it from you.,9
42975,Scene,2, Amy‰Ûªs apartment. Sheldon knocks three times. ,9
42976,Amy,2, What are you doing here?,9
42977,Sheldon,2, I‰Ûªm here to return your belongings. That‰Ûªs what people who‰Ûªve broken up do.,9
42978,Amy,2, And you didn‰Ûªt do your compulsive knocking ritual so I would open the door.,9
42979,Sheldon,2," On the contrary, you no longer get to enjoy my charming eccentricities. We‰Ûªre not friends with benefits.",9
42980,Amy,2, Just give me the box.,9
42981,Sheldon,2, Wait. Don‰Ûªt you want to go through it to make sure I haven‰Ûªt forgotten anything?,9
42982,Amy,2, Fine. My old scarf.,9
42983,Sheldon,2, You wore it the night we went ice-skating. Remember?,9
42984,Amy,2," You mean the night that I went ice-skating, and you stood at the rail googling the symptoms of hypothermia?",9
42985,Sheldon,2," We made one heck of a team, huh?",9
42986,Amy,2, Whose bra is this?,9
42987,Sheldon,2," It‰Ûªs not yours? Oh, my. How embarrassing for both of us.",9
42988,Amy,2, It‰Ûªs Penny‰Ûªs.,9
42989,Sheldon,2," Hey, you broke up with me. It is none of your business whose naked bosom I‰Ûªm smooshing around like pizza dough.",9
42990,Amy,2, Good-bye.,9
42991,Sheldon,2," (Knock, knock, knock) Amy. (Knock, knock, knock) Amy. (Knock, knock, knock) Amy. Hmm. Tables work, too. Good to know.",9
42992,Scene,2, Howard and Bernadette‰Ûªs kitchen.,9
42993,Howard,2," Ooh, brownies for girls‰Ûª night!",9
42994,Bernadette,2, Hands off. I‰Ûªm mad at you.,9
42995,Howard,2," Look, I know it‰Ûªs a lot of money, but the guy at the store said in five to seven years, it‰Ûªll pay for itself.",9
42996,Bernadette,2, What will pay for itself?,9
42997,Howard,2, Doesn‰Ûªt matter. What are you mad about?,9
42998,Bernadette,2," I‰Ûªm mad at you for blabbing to me what Leonard did on the North Sea, and I‰Ûªm mad that I‰Ûªve had to hide this from Penny for two years.",9
42999,Howard,2," And you have every right to be mad about those things. So, why don‰Ûªt you let me handle the credit card bill this month, huh? I mean, don‰Ûªt even look at it.",9
43000,Bernadette,2," I mean, if Penny finds out I‰Ûªve known all this time and haven‰Ûªt told her, she‰Ûªs gonna think I‰Ûªm a terrible friend. I wish you never told me.",9
43001,Howard,2, And I wish Leonard never told me. He‰Ûªs the bad guy here.,9
43002,Bernadette,2, I guess that‰Ûªs true.,9
43003,Howard,2," And you let Penny marry him. Compared to that, who cares if I bought a George Clooney limited edition manscaping kit?",9
43004,Scene,2, The apartment. ,9
43005,Leonard (on phone),2," Hi. I‰Ûªm calling about your marriage counselling services and was curious what your rate is. Really? Um, okay. Is there any kind of discount for length of marriage? ‰Û÷Cause we‰Ûªre just talking hours here.",9
43006,Penny (entering),2, Hi.,9
43007,Leonard,2, Call you back. Hey.,9
43008,Penny,2, Can we talk?,9
43009,Leonard,2, I would love that.,9
43010,Penny,2," All right, look, I‰Ûªm sorry I said I was okay with everything before we got married. I hate that we‰Ûªre going through this, but I don‰Ûªt know what to do.",9
43011,Leonard,2," If you don‰Ûªt mind waiting for a Groupon, we can try marriage counselling.",9
43012,Sheldon (entering),2, Hello.,9
43013,Leonard,2," Hey, uh, buddy, can we have some privacy?",9
43014,Sheldon,2," Oh, of course. Wouldn‰Ûªt want to intrude. This is yours.",9
43015,Penny,2," Okay, when I‰Ûªm done with him, I‰Ûªm gonna need more information.",9
43016,Sheldon,2, Nothing odd. I just wanted to rub Amy‰Ûªs nose in it.,9
43017,Penny,2," Okay, look, I might be overreacting, but how am I supposed to get past this when I know tomorrow you‰Ûªre gonna go to work and see this woman?",9
43018,Sheldon,2," Now, forgive me for eavesdropping, but as I see it, there‰Ûªs a simple solution.",9
43019,Leonard,2," Wake up, wake up, wake up.",9
43020,Sheldon,2, Bring Penny to meet Mandy.,9
43021,Leonard,2, What? Why?,9
43022,Sheldon,2," Well, right now, Penny‰Ûªs imagination is running wild, but if they meet, that will eliminate the mystery and alleviate her fears. Like when that Sparkletts guy let me look under his eye patch.",9
43023,Leonard,2," Uh, first of all, you made that guy cry.",9
43024,Sheldon,2, And we learned that you don‰Ûªt need an eyeball to do that.,9
43025,Leonard,2," Secondly, I can‰Ûªt think of a more horrible idea than Penny meeting Mandy.",9
43026,Penny,2, Really? Why is that?,9
43027,Leonard,2," What, you actually want to meet her?",9
43028,Penny,2," No, but now that you‰Ûªre being weird about it, maybe I should.",9
43029,Leonard,2, I‰Ûªm not being weird. Am I being weird?,9
43030,Sheldon,2, Yes. And that‰Ûªs coming from me.,9
43031,Leonard,2," Fine, you want to meet her?",9
43032,Penny,2," No, I just want to know that when you‰Ûªre at work, there‰Ûªs nothing going on.",9
43033,Leonard,2, How many times do I have to tell you? I have no interest in this woman.,9
43034,Penny,2," Yeah, well, maybe she has interest in you.",9
43035,Sheldon,2," In Leonard? Oh, even the Sparkletts guy could see that‰Ûªs unlikely.",9
43036,Scene,2, Penny‰Ûªs apartment.,9
43037,Penny,2, I guess my big problem is I never saw Leonard as the kind of guy who would do something like this.,9
43038,Amy,2, Anybody can make a mistake in a weak moment.,9
43039,Penny,2, What do you think?,9
43040,Bernadette,2," I don‰Ûªt know what to think. But then again, I just found out about it.",9
43041,Penny,2," You know, I fell in love with Leonard because he wasn‰Ûªt anything like the guys I was used to dating. I mean, I knew those guys weren‰Ûªt above cheating because that‰Ûªs usually how we met.",9
43042,Amy,2," Come on, you know Leonard‰Ûªs not like that.",9
43043,Penny,2, I want to believe you. I really do. Am I being naive?,9
43044,Bernadette,2," Oh, I don‰Ûªt know. This is all so new to me. I‰Ûªm still processing.",9
43045,Penny,2," You know, he never would‰Ûªve done this when we first met. He‰Ûªs cockier now.",9
43046,Amy,2, That‰Ûªs because you made him more confident.,9
43047,Bernadette,2," You know, if you think about it, without you, he never would‰Ûªve grown into the person he is now. I mean, sure, more women might notice him, but I think it‰Ûªs better to have a guy be with you because he wants to be and not because he thinks he doesn‰Ûªt have any other choice.",9
43048,Penny,2, I never thought about it like that.,9
43049,Bernadette,2," Oh, me neither, not until just now.",9
43050,Scene,2, The apartment.,9
43051,Scene,2, The cafeteria.,9
43052,Leonard,2, You guys have any idea how much it costs to see a marriage counsellor?,9
43053,Howard,2, 250 dollars an hour. Why?,9
43054,Raj,2, How do you know?,9
43055,Howard,2," Bernadette and I have occasionally gone to one to, you know, stay on top of things.",9
43056,Raj,2, And I‰Ûªm just hearing about this now?,9
43057,Howard,2," Dude, just because we‰Ûªre best friends doesn‰Ûªt mean that I have to tell you everything that goes on.",9
43058,Raj,2," You don‰Ûªt have to, you should want to.",9
43059,Leonard,2," Oh, great, there‰Ûªs Mandy.",9
43060,Howard,2, Why are marine biologists always so cute?,9
43061,Raj,2," I don‰Ûªt know, but I‰Ûªd like to get lost in her Bermuda Triangle.",9
43062,Leonard,2, That‰Ûªs not helpful.,9
43063,Howard,2, Then I won‰Ûªt say I‰Ûªd like to cover three-quarters of her surface area.,9
43064,Leonard,2, Are we done?,9
43065,Raj,2," Not yet, this is fun. Ooh, I know. I‰Ûªd let her free my willy. Where you going?",9
43066,Leonard,2," I‰Ûªm gonna ask her if she‰Ûªd be willing to talk to Penny, tell her she has nothing to worry about.",9
43067,Howard,2," Leonard, wait.",9
43068,Leonard,2, What?,9
43069,Howard,2, I‰Ûªd like to SpongeBob her SquarePants.,9
43070,Raj,2, Now we are done.,9
43071,Leonard,2, Hey.,9
43072,Mandy,2," Oh, hi, Leonard. What‰Ûªs up?",9
43073,Leonard,2," Uh, do you mind if I sit?",9
43074,Mandy,2, Sure.,9
43075,Leonard,2," So, um, I‰Ûªve been thinking a lot about you and me and the boat.",9
43076,Mandy,2, What about it?,9
43077,Leonard,2," You know, what we did, when we were drunk.",9
43078,Mandy,2," Oh, no, did I sleep with you, too?",9
43079,Leonard,2," No, we just made out.",9
43080,Mandy,2," Oh. Well, good for me. So what can I do for you?",9
43081,Leonard,2," Uh, okay, well, um, I got married recently.",9
43082,Mandy,2," Oh, congratulations. To Sheldon?",9
43083,Leonard,2," Never gets old. No, no, to a girl. Anyway, I told her what happened between you and me, and she‰Ûªs concerned about us seeing each other at work.",9
43084,Mandy,2, It was just a kiss. Why would you even tell her?,9
43085,Leonard,2, Because I didn‰Ûªt want there to be any secrets between us.,9
43086,Mandy,2, Is that really the reason?,9
43087,Leonard,2, What else would it be?,9
43088,Mandy,2, I don‰Ûªt know. Sounds like you‰Ûªre trying to sabotage the relationship.,9
43089,Leonard,2," No, I don‰Ûªt think so. Although, Penny did say exactly that.",9
43090,Mandy,2," Okay, well, that‰Ûªs something to think about.",9
43091,Leonard,2," You know, on some level, I‰Ûªve always believed that I don‰Ûªt deserve a woman like her.",9
43092,Mandy,2," Oh, you‰Ûªre gonna think about that right here?",9
43093,Leonard,2," I mean, she‰Ûªs really beautiful. She could have any guy she wants. Which is probably why it took her so many years to tell me she loved me.",9
43094,Mandy,2, Maybe you should talk to a therapist about this.,9
43095,Leonard,2," Too expensive. You‰Ûªd think I‰Ûªd be used to women withholding their love. I mean, my mother did. I mean, no matter how hard I tried, she just didn‰Ûªt have any interest in me.",9
43096,Mandy,2, Imagine that.,9
43097,Leonard,2," I wonder if that‰Ûªs why I have such a dysfunctional relationship with Sheldon. I had a dream the other night that I was in a cave and I was nursing a baby, but the baby had Sheldon‰Ûªs head on it.",9
43098,Mandy,2, And your wife is worried about me?,9
43099,Raj,2," Hey, Leonard, when you‰Ûªre done, we came up with a bunch more.",9
43100,Scene,2, Amy‰Ûªs apartment. Amy is watching Fun With Flags.,9
43101,Sheldon (on screen),2," And then the Czech Republic says to Slovakia, I don‰Ûªt think you understand how being broken up works. Can you believe that? You‰Ûªd think that the Czech Republic would try to hold on to what it had, given that it‰Ûªs not as young as it used to be. And I don‰Ûªt see any other countries lining up to invade its southern borders.",9
43102,Amy,2, I‰Ûªm gonna kill him.,9
43103,Sheldon,2," But enough about the Czech Republic. Let‰Ûªs talk about the time Moldova made Romania a birthday cake and Romania said it tasted good even though it didn‰Ûªt. And yet Romania gets dumped. I‰Ûªll pause here while you mull that one over. I know, right?",9
43104,Scene,2, Penny‰Ûªs apartment.,9
43105,Penny,2," So, you said you had something to tell me.",9
43106,Leonard,2," Okay, yeah, um, do you remember when you accused me of trying to sabotage our wedding?",9
43107,Penny,2, Uh-huh.,9
43108,Leonard,2," I‰Ûªve been thinking about it, and you might be right. But the good news is that I‰Ûªm pretty sure I know why.",9
43109,Penny,2, I‰Ûªm listening.,9
43110,Leonard,2," Penny, after all these years, I still feel like maybe I don‰Ûªt deserve you.",9
43111,Penny,2," Okay, that is the lamest excuse you could‰Ûªve possibly come up with. But I get it.",9
43112,Leonard,2, You do?,9
43113,Penny,2," Yeah. Yeah, sometimes I worry you‰Ûªre gonna wake up and leave me for someone more like you.",9
43114,Leonard,2, I don‰Ûªt even understand why you‰Ûªre with someone like me. Why would I want to be with someone like me?,9
43115,Penny,2," You know what I mean. And, you know, maybe the way I‰Ûªve been reacting was me sabotaging this, too.",9
43116,Leonard,2," Well, how about we stop being so scared of losing each other and just be together?",9
43117,Penny,2, That sounds nice.,9
43118,Leonard,2," Good. Because I‰Ûªve loved you since the moment we met, and I will keep loving you until the end of time.",9
43119,Penny,2," Oh. Oh, my God, that is the most beautiful thing anyone‰Ûªs ever said to me.",9
43120,Leonard,2," Yeah? That‰Ûªs because you‰Ûªre beautiful, and your beauty fills my heart with love and song.",9
43121,Penny,2," It‰Ûªs getting kind of cheesy, Leonard.",9
43122,Leonard,2," Huh? If you think that‰Ûªs cheesy, buckle up. Penny Hofstadter, will you please stay married to me?",9
43123,Penny,2," Oh, damn it, you topped it. Should we go to the bedroom and make this marriage official?",9
43124,Leonard,2," Yes, please.",9
43125,Penny,2, Okay.,9
43126,Scene,2, The apartment. ,9
43127,Penny,2," Sheldon, I can‰Ûªt believe you got us a wedding gift.",9
43128,Sheldon,2," I don‰Ûªt know why you‰Ûªre so surprised. I watch movies, I see what people do.",9
43129,Leonard,2, What is this?,9
43130,Sheldon,2, Plane tickets and hotel reservations for a weekend away in San Francisco.,9
43131,Penny,2, Oh.,9
43132,Leonard,2, Wow.,9
43133,Penny,2, That‰Ûªs so great.,9
43134,Sheldon,2," Yeah, there‰Ûªs Fisherman‰Ûªs Wharf and Alcatraz and cable cars. We‰Ûªre gonna have so much fun.",9
43135,Penny,2, We?,9
43136,Sheldon,2, Is there a problem?,9
43137,Penny,2," Oh, no, no, I just, I said, Whee.",9
43138,Amy (at door),2, How dare you go on the Internet and say mean things about me and compare my genitalia to part of Czechoslovakia?,9
43139,Sheldon,2," You saw through that one, did you?",9
43140,Amy,2," I don‰Ûªt know what you were thinking, but take the video down now.",9
43141,Sheldon,2, She watched it. I‰Ûªm gonna get that girl back.,9
43142,Amy,2, I only watched it because you e-mailed it to me with the subject line this is gonna make you mad.,9
43143,Sheldon,2, She was listening through the door. She wants me.,9
43144,Scene,3, The apartment.,9
43145,Sheldon,3, Would you pass the mustard?,9
43146,Leonard,3," Sure. Hey, want to hear a fun fact about mustard?",9
43147,Sheldon,3, Is it that the glucosinolates which give mustard its flavour were evolved by the cabbage family as a chemical defence against caterpillars?,9
43148,Leonard,3, Yeah.,9
43149,Sheldon,3," Well, that was fun. Good for you, Leonard.",9
43150,Raj (entering with Howard),3," Hey, there.",9
43151,Leonard,3," Hey, you‰Ûªre early. The movie doesn‰Ûªt start for an hour.",9
43152,Howard,3," Actually, we‰Ûªre not going to the movies. We are here to kidnap you.",9
43153,Leonard,3, What are you talking about?,9
43154,Raj,3," Well, you eloped and we didn‰Ûªt get a chance to throw you a bachelor party, so there‰Ûªs a van downstairs and we‰Ûªre here to take you to a surprise location for the weekend.",9
43155,Sheldon,3," Well, I‰Ûªd hardly call this kidnapping. Where‰Ûªs the blindfold? Where‰Ûªs the duct tape? Where‰Ûªs the part where you call me and demand ransom and I try to keep you on the phone, but you hang up seconds before I can trace it and then I say I‰Ûªm getting too old for this crud?",9
43156,Leonard,3, When do we leave?,9
43157,Howard,3, Right now.,9
43158,Raj,3," Yeah, Penny packed you a bag.",9
43159,Howard,3," Wow, okay.",9
43160,Sheldon,3, You‰Ûªre seriously going to get in a van and let these two take you to an unknown destination for an entire weekend?,9
43161,Raj,3," Oh, not just him, you‰Ûªre coming, too.",9
43162,Sheldon,3," Oh, and how do you think you‰Ûªre going to get me to do that?",9
43163,Scene,3," Outside, by a van.",9
43164,Sheldon,3, Unhand me. This is ridiculous.,9
43165,Howard,3, I told you to put tape on his mouth.,9
43166,Raj,3, And I told you he bit me.,9
43167,Scene,3, The van.,9
43168,Sheldon,3, It‰Ûªs bad enough I‰Ûªm being taken against my will. I don‰Ûªt see why it has to be in some hippie‰Ûªs mobile sex dungeon.,9
43169,Howard,3," Well, Sheldon, there‰Ûªs something about this van that you‰Ûªre going to find very interesting.",9
43170,Sheldon,3, It runs on syphilis?,9
43171,Raj,3," This van was owned and driven by your personal physics hero, Richard Feynman.",9
43172,Sheldon,3, No.,9
43173,Howard,3, Yeah. A buddy of mine let me borrow it.,9
43174,Leonard,3, This was Feynman‰Ûªs van? That‰Ûªs so cool.,9
43175,Raj,3," Yeah, nothing‰Ûªs been changed since he drove it.",9
43176,Howard,3, I bet he picked up a lot of cute grad students in this bad boy.,9
43177,Sheldon,3," Yeah, and talked about physics with them.",9
43178,Leonard,3," So, are you gonna give us a clue where we‰Ûªre headed?",9
43179,Raj,3," Uh, okay, let‰Ûªs see. They‰Ûªve got spicy food and there‰Ûªs a chance you‰Ûªll get diarrhoea.",9
43180,Leonard,3, India.,9
43181,Raj,3, We can drive there.,9
43182,Leonard,3, Your house?,9
43183,Howard,3, We are going to Me-hi-co.,9
43184,Leonard,3," Fun, I‰Ûªve never been there.",9
43185,Sheldon,3," Leonard, don‰Ûªt be fooled. I‰Ûªm from Texas, Me-hi-co is Spanish for Mexico.",9
43186,Raj,3, What‰Ûªs wrong with Mexico?,9
43187,Sheldon,3," Uh, mariachi bands, wild dogs, beans that jump around ‰Ûªcause there‰Ûªs a worm inside.",9
43188,Howard,3," Okay, calm down. There‰Ûªs a theme to this weekend. We are going to Mexico in Feynman‰Ûªs van to stay at the vacation house Feynman bought with the money from his Nobel Prize.",9
43189,Sheldon,3, Viva la Imodium. Ay-ay-ay.,9
43190,Scene,3, Penny‰Ûªs apartment.,9
43191,Bernadette,3," Come on, Leonard‰Ûªs doing bachelor stuff. You sure we can‰Ûªt take you to a strip club?",9
43192,Penny,3," Nah, if I want to see a naked dancing man, I just flush the toilet while Leonard‰Ûªs in the shower.",9
43193,Amy (entering),3, Hi.,9
43194,Penny,3, Hey.,9
43195,Amy,3," I know we‰Ûªre not making a fuss, but in the spirit of bachelorette parties, I made cookies in the shape of male genitals.",9
43196,Penny,3," You really didn‰Ûªt have to, whoa! That is anatomic.",9
43197,Amy,3, Thank you. The veins are gummy worms.,9
43198,Bernadette,3," Oh, look, Jewish and gentile.",9
43199,Amy,3, I had extra dough.,9
43200,Penny (reading text),3," Oh, that‰Ûªs Leonard. He said they‰Ûªre about to cross the border.",9
43201,Bernadette,3, I hope the boys don‰Ûªt get too crazy in Mexico.,9
43202,Penny,3," Oh, yeah, right. Lock up your daughters or Sheldon might lecture them about the North American Free Trade Agreement.",9
43203,Amy,3," Boy, that was a long night for me.",9
43204,Scene,3, The van.,9
43205,Sheldon,3," Uh-oh. According to this Mexican customs website, visitors may not bring more than five laser discs, 20 compact discs or 12 VHS tapes.",9
43206,Raj,3, We don‰Ûªt have any of those.,9
43207,Sheldon,3," How can you be sure? VHS was king when Feynman drove this van. For all we know, there are hidden compartments lousy with Jane Fonda workout videos.",9
43208,Leonard,3," If there was a hidden compartment, don‰Ûªt you think you‰Ûªd be stuffed in it by now?",9
43209,Sheldon,3, Are we all up to date on our yellow fever inoculations?,9
43210,Howard,3, You don‰Ûªt need a yellow fever shot to go to Mexico.,9
43211,Sheldon,3, You can never be too careful. I got one last year before I went to Epcot.,9
43212,Scene,3, Penny‰Ûªs apartment. ,9
43213,Amy,3," So, Penny, how‰Ûªs married life?",9
43214,Penny,3," Oh, it‰Ûªs good. I just wish Leonard would work up the courage to tell Sheldon he‰Ûªs moving in here.",9
43215,Bernadette,3, You guys still aren‰Ûªt living together?,9
43216,Penny,3," We are. I mean, he sleeps here. But it‰Ûªs only a matter of time before Sheldon has a bad dream and tries to climb into bed with the Leonard-shaped pile of pillows.",9
43217,Bernadette,3," Speaking of Sheldon, how‰Ûªs single life treating you?",9
43218,Amy,3," Fine, I guess. I‰Ûªve been focusing on me. I was thinking about changing my wardrobe.",9
43219,Penny,3, Yes.,9
43220,Bernadette,3, Good for you.,9
43221,Amy,3, But then I decided I don‰Ûªt want to go changing who I am just because of some man.,9
43222,Penny,3, Yes.,9
43223,Bernadette,3, Good for you.,9
43224,Penny,3," You know, it is normal to want to change your look after a breakup.",9
43225,Amy,3," Actually, I was thinking of making one small change.",9
43226,Bernadette,3, Your sweater?,9
43227,Penny,3, Your glasses?,9
43228,Bernadette,3, Your hair?,9
43229,Penny,3, Your shoes.,9
43230,Amy,3, Piercing my ears.,9
43231,Penny,3, Oh.,9
43232,Bernadette,3, You really never had that done?,9
43233,Amy,3," My mom said pierced ears were for whores, pirates and genies.",9
43234,Penny,3," Okay, well, you‰Ûªre a grown woman now.",9
43235,Amy,3," I know, but Sheldon had this clause in the Relationship Agreement forbidding cosmetic surgery unless it‰Ûªs to look like a Klingon.",9
43236,Bernadette,3, We‰Ûªll take you to the mall to get it done.,9
43237,Penny,3, Why? I can do it right here.,9
43238,Amy,3, Really? You have a piercing gun?,9
43239,Penny,3," No. All you need is a needle and an ice cube. I‰Ûªve done it, like, a dozen times.",9
43240,Amy,3," Oh, I don‰Ûªt know.",9
43241,Penny,3," Oh, come on. I‰Ûªll be gentle. Let me take your ear virginity.",9
43242,Bernadette,3, This party‰Ûªs weird.,9
43243,Scene,3, The van.,9
43244,Leonard,3," Hey, watch your speed. I hear the Mexican police target tourists.",9
43245,Howard,3," Oh, not a problem. If anything goes down, we just put Koothrappali in the driver‰Ûªs seat and slap a sombrero on his head.",9
43246,Raj,3," Dude, how many races can you offend in a single breath?",9
43247,Howard,3, I don‰Ûªt know. Have you watched the Olympics with me?,9
43248,Leonard,3," Sheldon, can you believe that we‰Ûªre driving in a van that was owned by one of the greatest scientific minds of the 20th century? It‰Ûªs like the Batmobile. If Batman was real and a physicist and his car wasn‰Ûªt cool.",9
43249,Sheldon,3, It is extraordinary.,9
43250,Raj,3," Perhaps some of his mojo will rub off on us. Maybe between this and his beach house, we will be inspired to greatness.",9
43251,Sheldon,3," I usually don‰Ûªt put too much stock in charms and talismans. However, even I must admit feeling Richard Feynman‰Ûªs butt dent cupping my own bottom that does get the creative juices flowing.",9
43252,Howard,3," Hey, I have to return this van. Keep your creative juices in your pants.",9
43253,Sheldon,3, What was that?,9
43254,Howard,3, I think it‰Ûªs a tyre.,9
43255,Sheldon,3, What if it‰Ûªs banditos shooting at us? What if we get kidnapped? What if we end up in a factory making Bart Simpson piÌ±atas for the rest of our lives?,9
43256,Howard,3, It‰Ûªs the tyre.,9
43257,Sheldon,3, Leonard?,9
43258,Leonard,3, What?,9
43259,Sheldon,3, I am getting too old for this crud.,9
43260,Scene,3, Penny‰Ûªs apartment.,9
43261,Bernadette,3," Amy, I noticed your status still says in a relationship on Facebook.",9
43262,Amy,3," You‰Ûªre right. I should probably let all of my Facebook friends know. Penny, I‰Ûªm no longer in a relationship.",9
43263,Bernadette,3, Did you change yours to married yet?,9
43264,Penny,3," Uh, no, not yet. There‰Ûªs still a few people I haven‰Ûªt told personally.",9
43265,Amy,3, Who?,9
43266,Penny,3," Oh, just my parents and my entire family.",9
43267,Bernadette,3, What?,9
43268,Amy,3, Why?,9
43269,Penny,3," Well, I don‰Ûªt want to hurt my dad. You know, he always wanted to dance with his daughter at her wedding.",9
43270,Bernadette,3, What about your sister‰Ûªs wedding?,9
43271,Penny,3," They started to, then her water broke. You know, if he finds out we eloped, it‰Ûªs gonna break his heart.",9
43272,Amy,3, How long do you think you can keep it from him?,9
43273,Bernadette,3," Yeah, isn‰Ûªt it gonna get worse the longer you wait?",9
43274,Penny,3," Well, not necessarily. You know, Dad‰Ûªs not getting any younger, so if I wait long enough, I‰Ûªll just tell him he walked me down the aisle and it was magical.",9
43275,Scene,3, Mexico.,9
43276,Raj,3, When did you learn how to change a tyre?,9
43277,Howard,3, Every self-respecting gentleman should know how in case he comes across a damsel in distress by the side of the road.,9
43278,Sheldon,3," If I see one scorpion, I am getting on someone‰Ûªs shoulders and never coming down.",9
43279,Leonard,3, And there‰Ûªs your damsel.,9
43280,Howard,3," Wow, this one‰Ûªs really stuck.",9
43281,Raj,3, Are you turning it the right way?,9
43282,Howard,3," No. I took the other four off and when I got to this one, I thought, you know, I‰Ûªm in a rut, let‰Ûªs shake things up.",9
43283,Raj,3," Here, let me try. You‰Ûªre right, it doesn‰Ûªt turn the other way.",9
43284,Scene,3, Penny‰Ûªs apartment. ,9
43285,Penny,3, There you go. You‰Ûªre all done.,9
43286,Amy,3," That wasn‰Ûªt so bad. Nice. Boy, if my mom could see me now, she‰Ûªd lock me in the sin closet.",9
43287,Bernadette,3," That‰Ûªs a joke, right?",9
43288,Amy,3," Actually, the joke was on her. I could still see the TV through the slats.",9
43289,Penny,3, I‰Ûªm starting to see why you and your mom aren‰Ûªt very close.,9
43290,Bernadette,3, Bet she‰Ûªd still tell her if she got married.,9
43291,Penny,3," You‰Ûªre not gonna let this go, are you?",9
43292,Amy,3," Well, it‰Ûªs kind of sad that they don‰Ûªt know. I mean, they love Leonard.",9
43293,Penny,3," Fine, you want me to call? I‰Ûªll call. Why am I so nervous?",9
43294,Bernadette,3, It‰Ûªs understandable. Amy was afraid to tell her mom she broke up with Sheldon.,9
43295,Penny,3, Yeah? How did it go? Did she make you crawl into the breaking-up drawer?,9
43296,Amy,3," Uh, well, actually, to be honest, I haven‰Ûªt told her yet.",9
43297,Penny,3, You‰Ûªve been giving me a hard time and you haven‰Ûªt even told your mom about Sheldon?,9
43298,Amy,3, I‰Ûªm feeling a little dizzy from all the blood loss. I don‰Ûªt know what you‰Ûªre talking about.,9
43299,Penny,3," Fine. I‰Ûªm calling home, but when I‰Ûªm done, you‰Ûªre calling your mother.",9
43300,Amy,3, Easy for you to say. You never had to watch 60 Minutes like this.,9
43301,Penny,3," Hey, Daddy.",9
43302,Penny‰Ûªs Dad,3," Hey, slugger. How‰Ûªs my girl?",9
43303,Penny,3," Uh, good. Is Mom around?",9
43304,Penny‰Ûªs Dad,3," Ah, she took your brother out to celebrate. He just got his tenth one-month sober chip. Yeah, she‰Ûªs gonna make him a little necklace.",9
43305,Penny,3," Okay, I‰Ûªll talk to her later. Uh, Dad, there‰Ûªs something I need to tell you. Leonard and I got married.",9
43306,Penny‰Ûªs Dad,3, You did? When?,9
43307,Penny,3," Last week. I‰Ûªm sorry, I should‰Ûªve told you. It was a spur of the moment thing. I feel terrible. Please don‰Ûªt be too disappointed.",9
43308,Penny‰Ûªs Dad,3, Are you happy?,9
43309,Penny,3, Very. Leonard is so great.,9
43310,Penny‰Ûªs Dad,3," Well, then I‰Ûªm happy for you.",9
43311,Penny,3," Aw, thank you, Daddy. That means so much.",9
43312,Penny‰Ûªs Dad,3," Well, I understand it‰Ûªs hard to tell someone something if you think it‰Ûªs gonna upset ‰Ûªem.",9
43313,Penny,3, It is. You‰Ûªre the best dad ever.,9
43314,Penny‰Ûªs Dad,3," Yeah. Uh, hold that thought. I‰Ûªve been sitting on a little news myself.",9
43315,Penny,3," Well, what is it?",9
43316,Penny‰Ûªs Dad,3, You know that rototiller I got for the tractor?,9
43317,Penny,3, No.,9
43318,Penny‰Ûªs Dad,3," Oh, you should see it. It is a beautiful piece of machinery. Anyway, uh, I backed over your pet pig with it.",9
43319,Penny,3, Moondance?,9
43320,Penny‰Ûªs Dad,3," Yeah, he‰Ûªs, uh, not dancing anymore.",9
43321,Penny,3, You killed my pig?,9
43322,Penny‰Ûªs Dad,3, I did not kill him. The vet took care of that.,9
43323,Penny,3, When?,9
43324,Penny‰Ûªs Dad,3," Oh, ten, twelve months ago.",9
43325,Penny,3, You didn‰Ûªt tell me for a year?,9
43326,Penny‰Ûªs Dad,3," Well, apple doesn‰Ûªt fall far from the tree, does it? Love ya, slugger. Gotta go.",9
43327,Bernadette,3," Okay, Amy, your turn.",9
43328,Scene,3, Mexico.,9
43329,Howard,3, What are you doing?,9
43330,Raj,3, It‰Ûªs called Lamaze breathing. It helps you push.,9
43331,Howard,3, Great. He‰Ûªs pushing with his uterus.,9
43332,Raj,3, There‰Ûªs got to be a smarter way of removing it.,9
43333,Leonard,3," Yeah, this is nothing more than a physics problem.",9
43334,Sheldon,3," Right. Archimedes once said give me a lever long enough and a fulcrum on which to place it, and I shall move the world.",9
43335,Raj,3, Of course. All we need is to find stuff to make a lever big enough to fix this.,9
43336,Howard,3, Exactly. I‰Ûªll bet there‰Ûªs something around here that could be a lever.,9
43337,Leonard,3," Let‰Ûªs see, a lever, a lever.",9
43338,Sheldon,3," Everybody hold on. Let‰Ûªs take this problem one step at a time. First, we need to decide whether we‰Ûªre calling it leever or lehver. And the sooner we decide it‰Ûªs leever, the sooner we can roll up our sleeves, not slehves, and get to work.",9
43339,Leonard,3, We‰Ûªre gonna be here foreever.,9
43340,Scene,3, Penny‰Ûªs apartment.,9
43341,Penny,3," Thanks a lot, guys.",9
43342,Bernadette,3, What did we do?,9
43343,Penny,3," Before I made that call, my pig was alive and happy and rolling around in the mud. Now he‰Ûªs illegally buried in our backyard next to my great-grandmother.",9
43344,Bernadette,3, Really? They didn‰Ûªt eat him?,9
43345,Penny,3, No. He was a beloved member of the family.,9
43346,Bernadette,3, The breakfast meat family?,9
43347,Penny,3, It‰Ûªs not funny. You‰Ûªre up. Call your mother.,9
43348,Amy,3," Oh, maybe later. Your pig dying made me sad. And a little hungry.",9
43349,Penny,3," Phone, now.",9
43350,Amy,3," Okay. Okay. Fine. Hi, Mom.",9
43351,Penny,3, Try dialing.,9
43352,Amy,3," You saw that, huh? Hi, Mom. How are you doing? Oh, good. How‰Ûªs work? That‰Ûªs nice. I‰Ûªm fine. Hey, listen, I‰Ûªve been meaning to ask, how come Aunt Doe and Aunt Florence never got along?",9
43353,Penny,3," Okay, just give me that. Amy broke up with Sheldon, she got her ears pierced and she made us eat penis cookies. Hang on. She wants to talk to you.",9
43354,Scene,3, Mexico.,9
43355,Leonard,3, I don‰Ûªt think the lever‰Ûªs working.,9
43356,Howard,3, What makes you say that?,9
43357,Leonard,3, There‰Ûªs gotta be something else we could try.,9
43358,Raj,3," If this was Star Trek, we could use a phaser to blast it off.",9
43359,Howard,3," No, it‰Ûªs too broad of a beam. You‰Ûªd need something more precise, like Superman‰Ûªs heat vision.",9
43360,Sheldon,3," Ooh, the Green Lantern‰Ûªs ring could make a big green hand that unscrews it.",9
43361,Raj,3," If you need a green hand, why not just use the Hulk?",9
43362,Sheldon,3," Oh, please, the Hulk would never get across the border with that temper.",9
43363,Leonard,3," Guys, excuse me, not that calling one of the Avengers isn‰Ûªt a perfectly reasonable choice, but we‰Ûªre scientists. Don‰Ûªt you think we can figure this out using actual science?",9
43364,Sheldon,3," Yes, we could use science. But it‰Ûªs your bachelor party. Lighten up.",9
43365,Howard (singing),3," We will, we will percussive shock you.",9
43366,Howard and Raj (singing),3," We will, we will percussive shock you.",9
43367,Sheldon (singing),3," Buddy you‰Ûªre a boy, make a big noise playin‰Ûª in the street, gonna be a big man someday. You got mud on your face, you big disgrace, kickin‰Ûª your can all over the place. I have an eidetic memory. Sometimes it‰Ûªs a curse.",9
43368,Raj,3, I had no idea tortilla chips were such a good fuel source.,9
43369,Leonard,3, They‰Ûªre basically pure hydrocarbons soaked in fat. Let‰Ûªs hope the lug nut expands.,9
43370,Sheldon,3, What if that burning food attracts animals?,9
43371,Howard,3, We have plenty of food for the animals.,9
43372,Sheldon,3, We do?,9
43373,Howard,3, Yep. A six-foot wiener in a Flash T-shirt.,9
43374,Sheldon,3, That‰Ûªs not very nice.,9
43375,Leonard,3, It‰Ûªs a bachelor party. Lighten up.,9
43376,Sheldon,3, What is that awful smell?,9
43377,Howard,3, It‰Ûªs burning salsa. I‰Ûªm hoping the acidity and salinity combined with electricity will corrode the lug nut off.,9
43378,Sheldon,3, What an innovative solution. Perhaps I don‰Ûªt give your MIT education enough credit.,9
43379,Howard,3," Yeah, I saw it on Mythbusters.",9
43380,Sheldon,3," All right, this rust, combined with the aluminium recovered from the van, is now thermite.",9
43381,Howard,3, Great. Couple of pinches ought to do the trick.,9
43382,Raj,3, Is that enough to melt the lug nut?,9
43383,Leonard,3," Well, let‰Ûªs start small. We can always add more.",9
43384,Howard,3," You put up a good fight, lug nut, but you‰Ûªve met your match.",9
43385,Scene,3," A moment later, next to the burning van.",9
43386,Raj,3," Hey, look, the lug nut‰Ûªs off.",9
43387,Scene,3, The stairwell.,9
43388,Penny,3, What? What are you doing back?,9
43389,Leonard,3, We got a flat and couldn‰Ûªt get the tyre off.,9
43390,Penny,3," Oh, I‰Ûªm sorry.",9
43391,Leonard,3, Thank you.,9
43392,Penny,3," If it makes you feel any better, I pierced Amy‰Ûªs ears and her mom made her sit in my closet.",9
43393,Sheldon,3, We blew up Feynman‰Ûªs van.,9
43394,Penny,3, My dad killed my pig with his tractor.,9
43395,Leonard,3, I spent the night in Mexico with Sheldon.,9
43396,Penny,3, You win.,9
43397,Scene,4, The stairwell.,9
43398,Sheldon,4," What a wonderful day, thank you.",9
43399,Penny,4," Oh, we‰Ûªre glad you had fun.",9
43400,Sheldon,4," Blue Icees and a trip to The Container Store? It‰Ûªs like I died and went to the post-mortem, neuron-induced hallucination commonly mistaken as heaven.",9
43401,Leonard,4, I still don‰Ûªt understand why you bought that pill caddie. You‰Ûªre a young man.,9
43402,Sheldon,4," Age is a state of mind, Leonard. In here I‰Ûªm 90. Why are you taking your bins over there?",9
43403,Leonard,4," It‰Ûªs just where I need them. You know, she doesn‰Ûªt have a lot of closet space.",9
43404,Sheldon,4, What‰Ûªs wrong with your closet?,9
43405,Penny,4," Uh, well, honey, you know, now that Leonard and I are married, it kind of makes sense that we actually live together.",9
43406,Sheldon,4, So that‰Ûªs all this day was? A plan to butter me up before delivering bad news?,9
43407,Leonard,4," Come on, buddy.",9
43408,Sheldon,4," No, I thought we were friends. You asked for a sip of my Icee. If you had your own straw, I might‰Ûªve said yes.",9
43409,Penny,4," Sheldon, please, we already feel bad about this.",9
43410,Sheldon,4," You know what they don‰Ûªt sell at The Container Store? Something large enough to contain my disappointment. Although, if anyone did, it would be them.",9
43411,Scene,4, Howard and Bernadette‰Ûªs house.,9
43412,Sheldon,4, Thank you for letting me come speak with you.,9
43413,Bernadette,4, Of course.,9
43414,Sheldon,4," As my relationships with Penny and Amy are currently strained, I‰Ûªm turning to you for female comfort and encouragement.",9
43415,Bernadette,4, Aw. I‰Ûªm honoured.,9
43416,Sheldon,4," I tried reaching out to my mother, but she was in Bible study. Leonard‰Ûªs mother is on a book tour. My Mee-Maw was taking a nap, and after a while Siri started repeating her answers.",9
43417,Bernadette,4," So, I‰Ûªm your seventh choice.",9
43418,Sheldon,4," Yeah, I know, top ten, pretty exciting.",9
43419,Bernadette,4, How can I help you?,9
43420,Sheldon,4," Well, in addition to Amy leaving me, Leonard‰Ûªs moving in with Penny. It‰Ûªs difficult not to feel abandoned.",9
43421,Bernadette,4," Well, why don‰Ûªt you look at this as an opportunity? You had other roommates before Leonard. Maybe this is a chance to find someone new.",9
43422,Sheldon,4, Perhaps I could find someone better than Leonard. Someone I can rub in his face. Chris Pratt‰Ûªs all the rage right now. I wonder how he‰Ûªd feel about taking the smaller bedroom.,9
43423,Stuart,4, Hey.,9
43424,Bernadette,4, Hey. You know who would be the perfect roomie?,9
43425,Sheldon,4," Gandalf, but he‰Ûªs a smoker.",9
43426,Bernadette,4, Stuart. He‰Ûªs been living with us for a while now. I‰Ûªm sure he‰Ûªd love to get us out of his hair.,9
43427,Stuart,4," Nope, couldn‰Ûªt be happier.",9
43428,Bernadette,4," Well, Sheldon‰Ûªs looking for a roommate.",9
43429,Stuart,4, Nope.,9
43430,Bernadette,4, He‰Ûªll think about it.,9
43431,Stuart,4, No I won‰Ûªt.,9
43432,Scene,4, The comic book store.,9
43433,Raj,4, Have you seen this Archie comic? It‰Ûªs actually Archie versus Predator.,9
43434,Howard,4, How could Archie defeat Predator?,9
43435,Raj,4, I don‰Ûªt know. Maybe Jughead‰Ûªs a Terminator.,9
43436,Stuart,4, Hey.,9
43437,Howard,4," Hey, Stuart.",9
43438,Stuart,4, Do you guys know any musicians?,9
43439,Howard,4, Why?,9
43440,Stuart,4," I was thinking it might be cool to have live music here a few nights a week. You know, give this place more of a staying in business vibe.",9
43441,Howard,4, What kind of music are you thinking of?,9
43442,Stuart,4," I like all kinds of music, but my favourite genre is free.",9
43443,Raj,4," Hey, we‰Ûªve always talked about playing together.",9
43444,Howard,4," Well, it could be fun to try a little acoustic thing.",9
43445,Raj,4," Oh, we could play filk music.",9
43446,Stuart,4, What‰Ûªs that?,9
43447,Raj,4," It‰Ûªs been around for years. It‰Ûªs like folk music, but with a sci-fi/fantasy theme.",9
43448,Stuart,4, I like it. It sounds exactly like something I shouldn‰Ûªt be expected to pay for.,9
43449,Raj,4," Dude, if we do this, we‰Ûªre gonna need a cool band name.",9
43450,Howard,4," You know, I‰Ûªve actually had one I‰Ûªve been sitting on for years.",9
43451,Raj,4, Really?,9
43452,Howard,4," It was for this power trio I tried to put together in junior high, but I was short two friends.",9
43453,Raj,4, What is it?,9
43454,Howard,4, Footprints on the Moon.,9
43455,Raj,4, I just got chills.,9
43456,Howard,4, So did I.,9
43457,Stuart,4," Me, too. But I, uh, might have Lyme Disease.",9
43458,Scene,4, The apartment.,9
43459,Sheldon,4," Just a few more signatures, and we‰Ûªll be finished. Initial here to acknowledge that you‰Ûªve returned your key. Okay. As my future neighbour, I‰Ûªd like you to have a key. Initial here to acknowledge you received it.",9
43460,Penny,4, I‰Ûªm proud of you. You‰Ûªre taking this really well.,9
43461,Sheldon,4," Well, it‰Ûªs not like I‰Ûªm never going to see you two again. Which brings us to article 23 subsection C, please check here to reserve your spot at the ten year roommate reunion.",9
43462,Leonard,4, Do I really have to do that now?,9
43463,Sheldon,4," No, but if you want chicken and get stuck with the fish, that‰Ûªs on you. All right. Oh, and lastly, please initial here to confirm that ownership of the living room couch is hereby transferred to me in perpetuity all throughout the universe and all alternate universes except for those universes where owning a couch is forbidden by the hive queen. In which case, all glory to the hive queen. All right, now all that‰Ûªs left is for us to sign and date the document, and we will officially no longer be roommates.",9
43464,Penny,4, What‰Ûªs the matter?,9
43465,Leonard,4, It‰Ûªs harder than I thought.,9
43466,Sheldon,4, Let me help you. L. E. O. N.,9
43467,Leonard,4, That helped.,9
43468,Scene,4, Raj‰Ûªs apartment. ,9
43469,Raj,4," So I have an idea for a filk song. It‰Ûªs kind of a, a power ballad, superhero crossover tale of epic proportions.",9
43470,Howard,4," Is it cold in here, ‰Ûªcause, oh, my.",9
43471,Raj,4," Okay, so it‰Ûªs a, it‰Ûªs a David and Goliath story. It‰Ûªs about man against God. It‰Ûªs called Hammer and Whip, The Untold Story of Thor versus Indiana Jones.",9
43472,Howard,4, Thor versus Indiana Jones? You just blew my filking mind.,9
43473,Raj,4," Okay, I don‰Ûªt have it all worked out yet, but I was thinking something like, um, Oh, Indy, oh, Indy, the skies are so windy. Is that a flying man with a killer bod? Wait, that‰Ûªs no man, it‰Ûªs a Norse god.",9
43474,Howard,4," Oh yes, definitely. Hang on. Thunder clapped as Thor raised his mighty hammer. Indy rapped, that‰Ûªs one bad mamma-jamma.",9
43475,Raj,4," That is, that is so good!",9
43476,Howard,4, Right? Mamma-jamma just came to me.,9
43477,Raj,4," Okay, and here‰Ûªs the hook. Thor and Dr. Jones. Thor and Dr. Jones. One plays with lightning, the other plays with bones.",9
43478,Together,4," Thor and Dr. Jones. Thor and Dr. Jones. One plays with lightning, the other plays with bones.",9
43479,Howard,4," Oh, man, that rocks.",9
43480,Raj,4," Hey, remember The Ark of the Covenant?",9
43481,Howard,4, Yeah?,9
43482,Raj,4, That‰Ûªs how much we‰Ûªre gonna melt people‰Ûªs faces off.,9
43483,Scene,4, The apartment.,9
43484,Sheldon,4, I appreciate your interest in the apartment. I just need to ask you a few standard questions.,9
43485,Bespectacled Man,4, Sure.,9
43486,Sheldon,4, It says here you‰Ûªre a chemist. Which element on the periodic table do you feel is too big for its britches?,9
43487,Bespectacled Man,4, Is that supposed to be a joke?,9
43488,Sheldon,4, Looks like argon‰Ûªs not the only one with an attitude problem.,9
43489,Sheldon,4," In general, would you say that you smell better, worse or the same as you do right now?",9
43490,Sheldon,4," I was going to ask you what is the best fruit, but then I realized what I want to ask you is why is there a Band-Aid on your forearm, but then I realized what I really want to ask you is just can you just go?",9
43491,Sheldon,4," You‰Ûªre healthy. You have a job in the sciences. I‰Ûªve got to say, if this credit report comes back good, you‰Ûªre the frontrunner.",9
43492,Amy (on Skype),4," I‰Ûªm not gonna be your roommate, Sheldon.",9
43493,Sheldon,4," But I met with 11 people, and they all walked out. And that Hollywood phoney Chris Pratt never tweeted me back.",9
43494,Amy,4, I‰Ûªm sure you‰Ûªll find somebody else.,9
43495,Sheldon,4," I suppose. What happened to me, Amy? Years ago I was completely disengaged from my feelings. I‰Ûªd say it was a happier time, but I was disengaged from my feelings, so who can tell?",9
43496,Amy,4," I don‰Ûªt know how to help you. You know, feelings are a part of life.",9
43497,Sheldon,4," They didn‰Ûªt used to be. You and Leonard and Penny, you all poisoned me with emotions. I was like the Tin Man, perfectly content until that evil wizard gave him a heart.",9
43498,Amy,4, I don‰Ûªt think that was the point of the movie.,9
43499,Sheldon,4," Fine, then I was like Pinocchio before that jerk Geppetto went and made him a real boy.",9
43500,Amy,4, There you go.,9
43501,Scene,4, Penny‰Ûªs apartment.,9
43502,Penny,4," So, what are you thinking for dinner?",9
43503,Leonard,4," Well, it‰Ûªs Thai food night.",9
43504,Penny,4," Well, honey, you don‰Ûªt live with Sheldon any more. You can have anything you want.",9
43505,Leonard,4, You‰Ûªre right. But what? Mexican? Italian? German? Indian? Greek? Cuban? Chinese? Pizza? Barbecue? Korean? Korean barbecue?,9
43506,Penny,4, How about Thai food?,9
43507,Leonard,4," Oh, thank God.",9
43508,Penny,4," Hey, we‰Ûªre going to dinner. You want to come?",9
43509,Sheldon,4," Oh, I wish I could, but I realized I‰Ûªve become too emotionally vulnerable, so, like an operating system, I‰Ûªm restoring my life to the last stable version, which was in 2003, the day before I met Leonard.",9
43510,Leonard,4," You heard him, no.",9
43511,Penny,4," Hang on. Wait, you actually think it‰Ûªs 2003?",9
43512,Sheldon,4," No, just because I‰Ûªm living my life like it was 12 years ago doesn‰Ûªt mean I‰Ûªm delusional. And since it is 2003, I don‰Ûªt know who you are, so please exit the premises before I call the police on my stylish new flip phone.",9
43513,Scene,4, A Thai restaurant.,9
43514,Penny,4, Are you doing okay?,9
43515,Leonard,4," I guess. I‰Ûªm just, you know, worried about Sheldon.",9
43516,Penny,4," Well, come on, he‰Ûªs a grown man in his 30s pretending to be a grown man in his 20s. He‰Ûªs fine.",9
43517,Leonard,4, I hope so.,9
43518,Penny,4, What else can you do? Move back in with him?,9
43519,Leonard,4," No, of course not. I just feel bad.",9
43520,Penny,4," Well, so do I, but don‰Ûªt you want to live with your wife and set the thermostat to whatever you want and have your body tell you when it‰Ûªs time to go to the bathroom, you know, not a schedule slipped underneath your door every morning?",9
43521,Leonard,4, I did like that he had the weather on it.,9
43522,Penny,4," Trust me, this is the right thing.",9
43523,Leonard,4," I know. And it‰Ûªs not like we‰Ûªre abandoning him. Plus, we can FaceTime him whenever we want, you know, once iPhones are invented in his universe.",9
43524,Scene,4, A bar.,9
43525,Bernadette,4, I can‰Ûªt believe Sheldon asked you to be his roommate.,9
43526,Amy,4, I can‰Ûªt believe he ran my credit.,9
43527,Bernadette,4," Hey, if you‰Ûªre open to living with someone great, I‰Ûªll give you a thousand dollars to take Stuart.",9
43528,Amy,4, You really should‰Ûªve gone on the Internet and checked how long that kind of thing lives before you got one.,9
43529,Bernadette,4," I‰Ûªm sorry. I just thought you might have a pasty, weirdo-shaped hole in your life.",9
43530,Amy,4," Hey, I know Sheldon‰Ûªs quirky, but he‰Ûªs also brilliant and insightful. I think calling him a weirdo is a little unfair.",9
43531,Scene,4, The apartment.,9
43532,Sheldon,4," Hello, 2003.",9
43533,Leonard,4," Hey, we brought you Thai. Where is everything?",9
43534,Sheldon,4," In my present, it‰Ûªs in the future. In your present, it‰Ûªs been crammed in the bedroom by an enterprising young man I met in The Home Depot parking lot.",9
43535,Leonard,4," I know what you‰Ûªre doing. You‰Ûªre trying to get attention so we‰Ûªll feel bad for you, but it‰Ûªs not happening.",9
43536,Sheldon,4," No, what I‰Ûªm doing is trying to figure out how to live my life now that everyone is leaving me.",9
43537,Leonard,4, Will you knock it off? We‰Ûªre across the hall.,9
43538,Sheldon,4," As the kids are saying today, talk to the hand.",9
43539,Penny,4, They‰Ûªre not saying that.,9
43540,Sheldon,4, They are in 2003.,9
43541,Penny,4," No, no, they‰Ûªre really not.",9
43542,Scene,4, Raj‰Ûªs apartment.,9
43543,Raj (singing),4," Thor and Dr. Jones. Thor and Dr. Jones. One runs from Loki, the other runs from stones. So, what do you think?",9
43544,Emily,4, Wow.,9
43545,Raj,4," Runs from stones means that, that big boulder, but I couldn‰Ûªt rhyme anything with boulder.",9
43546,Emily,4," Colder, shoulder, soldier, folder.",9
43547,Raj,4," Right, yeah, right. But, what do you think?",9
43548,Emily,4, I think it‰Ûªs very cute.,9
43549,Raj,4, Cute? It‰Ûªs not cute. Cute is children dressed as vegetables.,9
43550,Emily,4," Okay, fine, it‰Ûªs not cute.",9
43551,Raj,4, Just be honest. You don‰Ûªt like it.,9
43552,Emily,4," I didn‰Ûªt say that. I, I just like music you can dance to.",9
43553,Raj,4," You can dance to this. Um, uh, uh, Thor and Dr. Jones. Thor and Dr. Jones. One plays with lightning, the other plays with bones.",9
43554,Scene,4, Howard and Bernadette‰Ûªs house.,9
43555,Raj,4," I‰Ûªm telling you, dude, the song has no groove, you can‰Ûªt dance to it.",9
43556,Howard,4, Who cares? I thought the whole point of Footprints on the Moon was to write songs that make people think.,9
43557,Raj,4," You can do both, like Michael Jackson‰Ûªs Billie Jean. While you‰Ûªre dancing you‰Ûªre thinking, like, darn it, whose baby is it?",9
43558,Howard,4," Where‰Ûªs this coming from? A few hours ago, we both loved this song.",9
43559,Raj,4, I still love it. I just think there‰Ûªs room for improvement.,9
43560,Howard,4," You played it for Emily, didn‰Ûªt you?",9
43561,Raj,4," Yeah, so what?",9
43562,Howard,4," You are such a wimp. She didn‰Ûªt like it, now you don‰Ûªt like it.",9
43563,Raj,4," No, no. I‰Ûªm just evolving as a musician. You‰Ûªre the one who‰Ûªs stuck in the past.",9
43564,Howard,4, The past was lunch. You know what‰Ûªs really happening here? Your girlfriend is breaking up our band.,9
43565,Raj,4, She has nothing to do with this. I am my own man.,9
43566,Howard,4," Oh, please. Your brain belongs to whoever‰Ûªs willing to sleep with you.",9
43567,Raj,4, That is so not true.,9
43568,Howard,4, Really? Remember when you were gonna get circumcised for Rachel Bernstein?,9
43569,Raj,4, That had nothing to do with Rachel. It was an overreaction to a bad zipper injury.,9
43570,Howard,4, I don‰Ûªt need this. I‰Ûªm quitting the band.,9
43571,Raj,4," Fine, I quit, too.",9
43572,Howard,4, Then get out of my house.,9
43573,Raj,4, With pleasure.,9
43574,Howard,4," Raj, wait.",9
43575,Raj,4, What took you so long?,9
43576,Scene,4, The apartment. ,9
43577,Leonard,4," Buddy, I know me moving in with Penny feels like a big change, but it‰Ûªs not.",9
43578,Sheldon,4," How can you say that? Amy‰Ûªs gone, and you two are married now, so it‰Ûªs only a matter of time before you‰Ûªre gone, too.",9
43579,Penny,4," Okay, you don‰Ûªt know what‰Ûªs gonna happen.",9
43580,Sheldon,4," No, I do. Eventually you‰Ûªll want more space, and you‰Ûªll move into a house, and then instead of dinner a couple of times a week, it‰Ûªll only be a couple of times a month, and then it‰Ûªll only be on special occasions, like when Bernadette divorces Wolowitz. Or, or, or like when Koothrappali‰Ûªs weird girlfriend admits where she buried his body. Or Amy‰Ûªs wedding, where she‰Ûªs marrying someone better than me.",9
43581,Penny,4," Okay, look, we don‰Ûªt need to rush into anything. All right? Maybe instead of Leonard moving in with me, we just leave things the way they are, and sometimes we‰Ûªll sleep over there, and sometimes we‰Ûªll sleep over here.",9
43582,Sheldon,4, But mostly here.,9
43583,Penny,4, Sure.,9
43584,Leonard,4," Wuh, what about what you said in the restaurant?",9
43585,Penny,4," Well, it‰Ûªs not forever. It‰Ûªs just for a while. If you want, we can think of him like he‰Ûªs our dog.",9
43586,Sheldon,4," You can. I‰Ûªm happy when you come home. And I‰Ûªm scared of fireworks. By the way, on July Fourth, we‰Ûªre all sleeping here.",9
43587,Leonard,4, Fine.,9
43588,Sheldon,4," All right, great. Just give me one minute, and I‰Ûªll get started on a new roommate agreement. Yeah. nothing from Pratt, we‰Ûªre good.",9
43589,Scene,4, The comic book store. ,9
43590,Howard (singing),4," Indy‰Ûª whip snapped, Thor‰Ûªs hammer missed.",9
43591,Raj (singing),4, It was Avenger versus archeologist.,9
43592,Howard,4," Indy held his ground, and straightened his fedora.",9
43593,Raj,4," Thor said, that‰Ûªs a nice look in nineteen fourty-foura.",9
43594,Together,4," Thor and Dr. Jones. Thor and Dr. Jones. One plays with lightning, the other plays with bones. Thor and Dr. Jones. Thor and Dr. Jones. One plays with lightning, the other plays with bones.",9
43595,Stuart,4, Play something we can dance to.,9
43596,Scene,5, Howard‰Ûªs workshop.,9
43597,Leonard,5," Hey, ready for lunch?",9
43598,Howard,5," Oh, one sec.",9
43599,Sheldon,5, Is that the prototype drive system for the high-G rover?,9
43600,Howard,5," No, Bernadette got me a Fitbit so she can track how much I‰Ûªm exercising.",9
43601,Leonard,5, That‰Ûªll teach her to care about your health.,9
43602,Howard,5," Yeah, I can‰Ûªt wait to see the look on her face when I die young.",9
43603,Raj,5, When was the last actual exercise you got?,9
43604,Howard,5," The other day, when she tried to put that Fitbit on me and I ran away from her.",9
43605,Sheldon,5," According to a recent study, simply thinking about exercise, even while sitting still, can have physical benefits. For all you know, I could be exercising right now.",9
43606,Raj,5, Are you?,9
43607,Sheldon,5," Nah, I‰Ûªll do it tomorrow.",9
43608,Leonard,5, It wouldn‰Ûªt be the worst thing if we were more active.,9
43609,Howard,5," You make an excellent point. Ooh, I think I‰Ûªm getting a runner‰Ûªs high.",9
43610,Scene,5, The apartment.,9
43611,Leonard,5," Look at all these activities the university has. Rock climbing club, archery, flag football.",9
43612,Sheldon,5," Had me at flag, lost me at football.",9
43613,Penny,5," Yeah, I think it‰Ûªs great you guys want to get more exercise, but do you really think sports is the right choice for you?",9
43614,Leonard,5, What are you saying? We‰Ûªre not coordinated enough to play sports?,9
43615,Penny,5," Okay, Leonard, sweetheart, you twisted your ankle playing Scrabble.",9
43616,Leonard,5," I got a triple-word score with a double letter Q. If that‰Ûªs not a time to bust out the scrabble dance, what‰Ûªs the point of having one? Hey, Barry Kripke started a fencing club.",9
43617,Sheldon,5, Interesting. Sword fighting does hold a certain elegant appeal. And I would imagine it meets many of our personal criteria for a sport.,9
43618,Leonard,5," It‰Ûªs indoors, so no sunscreen.",9
43619,Sheldon,5," No throwing, no catching, no running.",9
43620,Leonard,5, No gym shorts that can be yanked down.,9
43621,Sheldon,5," Or worse, up.",9
43622,Leonard,5, Preach.,9
43623,Sheldon,5," And as an added bonus, the word touchÌ© comes from fencing. It would be our only opportunity to use it in a non-metaphorical sense.",9
43624,Leonard,5, What about a game of tag on a French schoolyard?,9
43625,Sheldon,5," Ah, touchÌ©.",9
43626,Scene,5, The comic book store.,9
43627,Stuart,5, Thanks for coming by.,9
43628,Bernadette,5, Sure. So how can we help?,9
43629,Stuart,5," Well, I know more women are buying comics than ever, but for some reason, I, I can‰Ûªt get ‰Ûªem in here.",9
43630,Penny,5," All right, well, what have you tried so far?",9
43631,Stuart,5," Uh, I‰Ûªve, I‰Ûªve been stocking more female-oriented titles. Uh, in the bathroom, I folded the end of the toilet paper into a triangle. And, uh, you are now sitting in the official breastfeeding area.",9
43632,Penny,5, Really? In a comic book store?,9
43633,Stuart,5," Oh, don‰Ûªt worry. I, I‰Ûªve got a camera right up here, so I could watch from the counter and make sure guys aren‰Ûªt being pervs. Anyway, so what do I got to do to, to get you in the door?",9
43634,Amy,5," Well, for starters, you might want to rethink some of this artwork. I mean, this woman‰Ûªs actually on a leash like a dog.",9
43635,Stuart,5," Well, you don‰Ûªt know the backstory. Maybe she kept jumping up on the couch.",9
43636,Scene,5, The gym.,9
43637,Raj,5, I feel cool. Like Puss in Boots.,9
43638,Leonard,5, I always wanted to be a swashbuckler when I was a kid.,9
43639,Sheldon,5," Technically, swashbuckler is a combination of two terms. Swash referring to the sound of the sword. Swash. And then buckler meaning a small shield, which you don‰Ûªt have.",9
43640,Raj,5, We can still be swashers.,9
43641,Howard,5," Well said, Puss.",9
43642,Barry,5," Gentlemen, welcome to the fencing cwub. Before we start, I just want to warn you, fencing isn‰Ûªt a joke. I hope you‰Ûªre not here because you think it‰Ûªs going to be wike Star Wars.",9
43643,Leonard,5, That‰Ûªs not why we‰Ûªre here.,9
43644,Raj,5," Yeah, I‰Ûªm here because I think it‰Ûªs gonna be like Game of Thrones.",9
43645,Howard,5, And maybe a little Princess Bride.,9
43646,Raj,5," Ooh, ooh, I forgot about Princess Bride. That‰Ûªs my answer.",9
43647,Barry,5," Well, sowwy to disappoint you, but fencing is a sewious spowt. If you‰Ûªre not wiwwing to put in the effowt, you might as well just weave now.",9
43648,Sheldon,5, We‰Ûªre not afraid of physical activity.,9
43649,Howard,5, Yeah. I already ran 18 miles today.,9
43650,Barry,5, Awwight. Let‰Ûªs begin with some fundamentals. This is the en garde position. Feet are in an L. Heels in a stwaight wine. Elbow is about a fist from the wib cage. Notice my dominant weg faces fowward.,9
43651,Sheldon,5," Oh, dear.",9
43652,Barry,5," What‰Ûªs wong, Cooper?",9
43653,Sheldon,5," Well, I‰Ûªm not sure I have a dominant leg. They‰Ûªre both pretty submissive.",9
43654,Howard,5," When you‰Ûªre in a public restroom, which foot do you flush the toilet with?",9
43655,Sheldon,5, Right. Always right.,9
43656,Howard,5, He‰Ûªs a righty.,9
43657,Barry,5," Okay, show me en garde. Good. Knees bent, swightwy over the toe. Non-sword hand up for bawance.",9
43658,Howard,5," Oh, God, I am going to feel this tomorrow.",9
43659,Barry,5," The first move is called an advance. You move your fwont foot fowward, heel to toe. Back foot fowwows. So fwont foot fowward, heel to toe. Back foot fowwows. Now you twy. Advance. And advance. And advance.",9
43660,Leonard,5, This is easy. I didn‰Ûªt need to wear a cup.,9
43661,Barry,5," Good. The next move is called a wetweat. Step back. Back foot first, toe to heel. Fwont foot fowwows. On thwee.",9
43662,Sheldon,5," Excuse me, Barry?",9
43663,Barry,5, Yes.,9
43664,Sheldon,5, When can I stab one of my friends?,9
43665,Barry,5," In fencing, we don‰Ûªt call it a stab. We call it a touch.",9
43666,Sheldon,5," Uh, yes, I‰Ûªm aware. But if I say I want to touch one of my friends, I‰Ûªll get called into Human Resources.",9
43667,Barry,5," Okay, on thwee, Cooper and Koothwappawi advance, the other two wetweat. One, two, thwee. Vewy good. Switch it up. One, two, thwee. Switch again. One, two, thwee. (Phone rings) Excuse me. Can I call you back? No, I‰Ûªm teaching a cwass. Sure. Sure. An hour, tops. Yeah. Okay. Okay. Yeah. Okay. Thanks. And one, two, thwee.",9
43668,Scene,5, The comic book store.,9
43669,Amy,5, Have you thought about advertising directly to females?,9
43670,Stuart,5," Hmm, okay. Well, alright, what if I put up a sign in the window that said women, come in. Don‰Ûªt be afraid.",9
43671,Penny,5," Hey, have you read the online reviews for this place?",9
43672,Stuart,5," Eh, the Internet‰Ûªs so negative. I try to avoid it.",9
43673,Penny,5," All right, well, Heather H says, the owner stared at me the whole time and didn‰Ûªt blink once. Kelly M says, the creepy guy who runs it asked me out, then called himself stupid before I could say no. Jessica K says, I told the weird owner that I liked his shirt. He took it off and gave it to me.",9
43674,Stuart,5, See? Negative.,9
43675,Scene,5, The gym.,9
43676,Barry,5," With your foil extended, kick your fwont weg up and push off with your back weg. Now you twy. And again. And again.",9
43677,Raj,5, Look at us. We‰Ûªre like the Rockettes.,9
43678,Sheldon,5," En garde, Leonard. Prepare yourself for a rigorous touching.",9
43679,Howard,5, My name is Inigo Montoya. You killed my father. Prepare to die.,9
43680,Raj,5, My name is Inigo Montoya. You killed my father. Prepare to die.,9
43681,Howard,5, I thought you were Puss in Boots.,9
43682,Raj,5," Oh, yeah, right. Sorry. My name is Puss in Boots. You killed my father. Prepare to die.",9
43683,Sheldon,5, I‰Ûªm looking forward to him teaching us glove-slapping.,9
43684,Leonard,5, What?,9
43685,Sheldon,5," You know, when my honour is insulted, and I need to challenge someone to a duel by slapping them across the face with my glove.",9
43686,Leonard,5, When was your honour insulted?,9
43687,Sheldon,5, My last physical.,9
43688,Leonard,5," Again, that doctor didn‰Ûªt insult your honour. Just checked your prostate.",9
43689,Raj,5, My name is Little Orphan Annie. You killed my father. Prepare to die.,9
43690,Howard,5, My name is Darth Vader. I am your father. Prepare to die.,9
43691,Sheldon,5," Ah, this is fun.",9
43692,Leonard,5," Well, good. It‰Ûªs nice to see your mind off Amy.",9
43693,Barry,5, What‰Ûªs going on with Amy?,9
43694,Sheldon,5," Not that it‰Ûªs any of your business, but she broke up with me.",9
43695,Barry,5, Weawwy? Good to know.,9
43696,Sheldon,5, Good to know? What‰Ûªs that supposed to mean?,9
43697,Leonard,5," Oh. I hate to say it, but it sounds like he‰Ûªs interested in her.",9
43698,Sheldon,5," Well, that‰Ûªs unacceptable.",9
43699,Leonard,5," Oh, buddy, I get that you don‰Ûªt like it, but it‰Ûªs not really up to you.",9
43700,Sheldon,5," Yeah, but he‰Ûªs dumb, and his face is dumb.",9
43701,Leonard,5," Look, even if it‰Ûªs not him, Amy‰Ûªs probably going to date someone at some point.",9
43702,Sheldon,5, You really think so?,9
43703,Leonard,5, Of course. She deserves to be happy.,9
43704,Sheldon,5, How dare you.,9
43705,Scene,5, Later.,9
43706,Leonard,5," Listen, I should warn you that maybe asking Amy out isn‰Ûªt a good idea.",9
43707,Sheldon,5," Barry, a word?",9
43708,Leonard,5, And now the crazy version of what I just said.,9
43709,Sheldon,5," If you intend to pursue Amy, you leave me with no choice but to put a stop to it.",9
43710,Barry,5, And how are you gonna do that?,9
43711,Sheldon,5, By challenging you to a duel.,9
43712,Barry,5, You‰Ûªve had one wesson. I‰Ûªll destwoy you.,9
43713,Sheldon,5," That is why the duel will take place at high noon, three years from today. If you‰Ûªre worth your salt as an instructor, I should be ready by then. Yeah, and be warned. I‰Ûªm going to touch you all over.",9
43714,Leonard,5," Wow. That, that was crazier than I thought.",9
43715,Scene,5, The comic book store.,9
43716,Stuart,5," All right, I‰Ûªm not saying it‰Ûªs true, but let‰Ûªs, let‰Ûªs consider for a moment that possibly I‰Ûªm the problem.",9
43717,Penny,5, Yeah.,9
43718,Bernadette,5, You are.,9
43719,Amy,5, You can say it.,9
43720,Stuart,5," Okay, fine. What, I mean, what can I do? I get so nervous around women.",9
43721,Penny,5," Well, you‰Ûªre talking to us now. I mean, you don‰Ûªt seem nervous.",9
43722,Stuart,5," Well, that‰Ûªs ‰Ûªcause I‰Ûªm doing that trick where you imagine the audience is naked. By the way, thumbs up, ladies.",9
43723,Amy,5, Do you not hear how creepy that sounds?,9
43724,Stuart,5, It was a joke.,9
43725,Bernadette,5, Was it?,9
43726,Stuart,5," No, I‰Ûªm still doing it.",9
43727,Penny,5," Okay. Don‰Ûªt be offended, but, what went wrong with you?",9
43728,Stuart,5," I, I guess I assumed at this point in my life, I would be married or in a relationship, or even have a pet that didn‰Ûªt run away or kill itself.",9
43729,Bernadette,5, That really happened?,9
43730,Stuart,5," I mean, I can‰Ûªt say for sure, but I swear that rabbit looked me right in the eye before it hopped in front of that car. Anyway, the longer I‰Ûªm alone, the more desperate I get.",9
43731,Amy,5," Stuart, believe it or not, I understand. You know, before I met Sheldon, I was alone for a really long time. I was so desperate for people to like me, when I met these guys, it took everything in my power to hide my insecurity.",9
43732,Stuart,5," Okay, we‰Ûªre all feeling it. Yes, I‰Ûªll go out with you.",9
43733,Amy,5," Suddenly, the rabbit thing makes sense.",9
43734,Scene,5, A sports bar.,9
43735,Leonard,5," I‰Ûªm surprised you wanted to go to a sports bar, Sheldon.",9
43736,Sheldon,5," Look at this blister. Like it or not, we‰Ûªre athletes now. Besides, a bar is where I belong. I‰Ûªm having female problems.",9
43737,Leonard,5," If you‰Ûªre cranky and retaining water, I have a theory.",9
43738,Howard,5," Sheldon, instead of focusing on Amy dating other guys, maybe you should start thinking about dating another girl.",9
43739,Sheldon,5, That‰Ûªs ridiculous.,9
43740,Raj,5," Why? You never thought you‰Ûªd end up in a relationship, and then you met Amy. Maybe there‰Ûªs someone else out there for you.",9
43741,Sheldon,5," True, but Penny‰Ûªs married, and so is Bernadette. And your girlfriend has red hair and white skin, which really rubs up against my clown phobia.",9
43742,Leonard,5, Maybe you should consider women who aren‰Ûªt in serious relationships with your closest friends?,9
43743,Sheldon,5," There‰Ûªs that prostate doctor, but I‰Ûªm still mad at her. Oh, there‰Ûªs a woman. I‰Ûªll make her my girlfriend.",9
43744,Raj,5," Whoa, whoa. Walking up to a strange woman in a bar usually doesn‰Ûªt work.",9
43745,Sheldon,5, You‰Ûªre forgetting something. Ladies love jocks.,9
43746,Raj,5, How many sips of that beer did he have?,9
43747,Leonard,5, Three.,9
43748,Howard,5," Oh, boy.",9
43749,Sheldon,5," Excuse me. I‰Ûªm recovering from a recent breakup, and I‰Ûªm told asking out another woman might make me feel better. And as Ash Ketchum said to Pikachu, I choose you.",9
43750,Woman,5, What?,9
43751,Sheldon,5, It‰Ûªs a PokÌ©mon reference.,9
43752,Woman,5, I don‰Ûªt know what that means.,9
43753,Sheldon,5," Well, we gave it a shot. How about you?",9
43754,Older woman,5," I‰Ûªm married, and I‰Ûªm her grandmother.",9
43755,Sheldon,5," Ah, what might have been. And you, give my regards to Barnum and Bailey.",9
43756,Scene,5, Penny‰Ûªs apartment.,9
43757,Bernadette,5, Stuart took that rejection like a pro.,9
43758,Penny,5," Well, he knew he was on the breast cam.",9
43759,Amy,5, I don‰Ûªt have much experience turning men down. It wasn‰Ûªt so much fun.,9
43760,Bernadette,5," Oh, you get used to it. Some guys you have to turn down over and over.",9
43761,Penny,5, And sometimes we marry them anyway.,9
43762,Amy (Phone text sound),5," Huh. Well, this is weird.",9
43763,Penny,5, What?,9
43764,Amy,5, Barry Kripke just asked me out.,9
43765,Bernadette,5," Oh. Look at you, two guys in one day.",9
43766,Penny,5, I told you things would change if you plucked your eyebrows.,9
43767,Bernadette,5, What did he say?,9
43768,Amy,5," Hi, how are you? I was wondering if you‰Ûªd like to get a drink after work sometime.",9
43769,Penny,5," Well, what are you gonna do?",9
43770,Amy,5," I don‰Ûªt know. I guess I assumed that I would eventually date other people, but this is happening so fast.",9
43771,Bernadette,5, What can it hurt?,9
43772,Amy,5," Well, I was hoping the next person I dated would be a little less like Sheldon.",9
43773,Bernadette,5," You mean, not a scientist?",9
43774,Penny,5, I think she means not a weirdo.,9
43775,Bernadette,5, Are you attracted to him?,9
43776,Amy,5, I don‰Ûªt know.,9
43777,Penny,5," All right, well, what happens if you imagine him naked?",9
43778,Amy,5," Oh, I don‰Ûªt have to imagine it.",9
43779,Scene,5, The stairwell.,9
43780,Sheldon,5, I smell funny. I taste salty.,9
43781,Leonard,5, You‰Ûªre just sweaty from exercise.,9
43782,Sheldon,5, And kind of delicious. I wonder how many licks it would take to get to the centre of me.,9
43783,Leonard,5, I know it only takes one doctor‰Ûªs finger.,9
43784,Amy,5, Hello.,9
43785,Sheldon,5, Hello.,9
43786,Leonard,5, We should let you guys talk.,9
43787,Bernadette,5, Yeah.,9
43788,Sheldon,5, You don‰Ûªt have to leave.,9
43789,Leonard,5, Look at me go.,9
43790,Amy,5," Uh, Bernadette, you‰Ûªre my ride.",9
43791,Bernadette,5, Walk.,9
43792,Amy,5, How have you been?,9
43793,Sheldon,5, I‰Ûªm doing all right. I tried fencing today.,9
43794,Amy,5, How‰Ûªd that go?,9
43795,Sheldon,5, It was pretty easy. And I think my background in mathletics helped. Barry Kripke was there. I should let you know that he expressed interest in asking you out.,9
43796,Amy,5," Well, actually, he, he already did.",9
43797,Sheldon,5," Okay. But don‰Ûªt get too attached to him. in two years, 364 days, he‰Ûªs a dead man.",9
43798,Amy,5, I said no.,9
43799,Sheldon,5," Interesting. I asked two women out today, and they both said no.",9
43800,Amy,5, I didn‰Ûªt know you were interested in dating.,9
43801,Sheldon,5, I‰Ûªve been told it‰Ûªs a good way to move on.,9
43802,Amy,5," Oh. Okay. Anyway, um, it‰Ûªs nice to see you. You look good.",9
43803,Sheldon,5, Thanks. And I taste good too.,9
43804,Scene,5, Howard and Bernadette‰Ûªs kitchen.,9
43805,Bernadette,5, Howie?,9
43806,Howard,5, What‰Ûªs up?,9
43807,Bernadette,5, Why does your Fitbit say you ran 174 miles yesterday?,9
43808,Scene,6, Leonard‰Ûªs lab.,9
43809,Sheldon,6," Leonard, I‰Ûªve got terrible news.",9
43810,Leonard,6, What‰Ûªs going on?,9
43811,Sheldon,6," Before I tell you, perhaps I should soften the blow. You‰Ûªre face is pleasingly symmetrical.",9
43812,Leonard,6, Just tell me.,9
43813,Sheldon,6, A Swedish team of physicists is trying to scoop our super-fluid vortex experiment.,9
43814,Leonard,6," Oh, well, that kind of stinks.",9
43815,Sheldon,6, That kind of stinks? Why aren‰Ûªt you more upset? Did I soften the blow too much? Because this here is more like a Picasso painting.,9
43816,Leonard,6, What are we going to do?,9
43817,Sheldon,6, Perform the experiment immediately.,9
43818,Leonard,6," I‰Ûªd love to, but we need liquid helium and our shipment‰Ûªs on back order for a month.",9
43819,Sheldon,6, A month? What? Are you kidding me? That would have been a good time for you to soften the blow.,9
43820,Leonard,6, That shirt brings out the blue in your eyes.,9
43821,Sheldon,6, Thank you. Aren‰Ûªt you sweet.,9
43822,Leonard,6, Let‰Ûªs go check to see if the university has any helium in reserve.,9
43823,Sheldon,6, Did you know that I almost didn‰Ûªt wear this shirt today?,9
43824,Scene,6, Barry Kripke‰Ûªs office.,9
43825,Leonard,6," Hey, Barry, we‰Ûªre in trouble. We need liquid helium, does the department have any we can use?",9
43826,Barry,6," Sowwy, there‰Ûªs a showtage. And what we do have I need for my quantum excitation study.",9
43827,Sheldon,6, But you won‰Ûªt need much for that.,9
43828,Barry,6," Twue, but if it‰Ûªs successful, I‰Ûªm having a pawty with bawwoons.",9
43829,Leonard,6," Come on, Barry, there‰Ûªs a Swedish team trying to run our experiment before us. Can‰Ûªt you spare any?",9
43830,Barry,6," Be honest, if the shoe was on the other foot, would you do this for me?",9
43831,Leonard,6, Yes.,9
43832,Sheldon,6, Not a chance.,9
43833,Leonard,6, What are you doing?,9
43834,Sheldon,6," He said be honest, so I was honest. Didn‰Ûªt your mother tell you? It‰Ûªs the best policy. So, what do you say?",9
43835,Barry,6, Hell no.,9
43836,Sheldon,6, He could‰Ûªve softened the blow.,9
43837,Scene,6, Leonard‰Ûªs lab.,9
43838,Raj,6, Why do you need Kripke? Can‰Ûªt you just go to Party City for helium?,9
43839,Leonard,6, We‰Ûªd have to go to every Party City in California.,9
43840,Howard,6, Sounds like you on Cinco de Mayo.,9
43841,Raj,6," Hey, people were still talking about that party on siete de Mayo.",9
43842,Sheldon,6," Leonard, if that Swedish team beats us, I will never be able to enjoy anything from their country again. Which is a shame, because Swedish meatballs are my favourite toothpick-delivered meatball.",9
43843,Howard,6," If you need liquid helium so bad, I know a guy who can get you some, if you don‰Ûªt ask too many questions.",9
43844,Leonard,6, Who is he?,9
43845,Sheldon,6, Where does he work?,9
43846,Leonard,6, How does he get the helium?,9
43847,Sheldon,6, How many questions are too many questions?,9
43848,Howard,6, Maybe he‰Ûªs not for you.,9
43849,Sheldon,6, Four questions. There answer‰Ûªs four.,9
43850,Scene,6, Howard and Bernadette‰Ûªs house.,9
43851,Bernadette,6," Hey, you know who went out on a date the other night? Stuart.",9
43852,Penny,6," Oh, good for him.",9
43853,Bernadette,6," I thought so, too.",9
43854,Penny,6," So is she, like, homeless, or framing him for a crime?",9
43855,Bernadette,6, He‰Ûªs using some kind of dating app on his phone.,9
43856,Penny,6," Oh, which one? Maybe we can get Amy to try it.",9
43857,Bernadette,6," I don‰Ûªt know. Stuart, can you come in here? He tried to explain it to me. It shows you pictures of people nearby, you swipe them around, it looks kind of like a game.",9
43858,Penny,6," Oh, and if you lose the game, you have to go out with Stuart.",9
43859,Stuart,6, What‰Ûªs up?,9
43860,Bernadette,6, Can you show us that dating app?,9
43861,Stuart,6," Oh, yeah, sure. This thing has changed my life.",9
43862,Penny,6, Wow. So how many girls have you met?,9
43863,Stuart,6, Two. I probably don‰Ûªt need to mention there‰Ûªs an entire number between that and zero.,9
43864,Penny,6," Well, so how does it work?",9
43865,Stuart,6," Uh, well, it, it shows me all the single women in a five-mile radius who are using the app. If I like the way they look I hit thumbs up, if I don‰Ûªt, thumbs down.",9
43866,Bernadette,6," Oh, what would make you give a girl a thumbs down?",9
43867,Stuart,6, First time it happens I will let you know.,9
43868,Scene,6, The apartment. ,9
43869,Leonard,6," Oh, hey. I just heard back from the liquid helium guy.",9
43870,Sheldon,6, What‰Ûªs he say?,9
43871,Leonard,6, He‰Ûªs got what we need and can meet us tonight.,9
43872,Leonard,6, The man restocking the cereal shelves.,9
43873,Sheldon,6, That‰Ûªs right. And what did he do?,9
43874,Leonard,6, He handed you the box directly and called you Stretch.,9
43875,Sheldon,6, It‰Ûªs like it was yesterday.,9
43876,Leonard,6, Do you want liquid helium or not?,9
43877,Sheldon,6, Of course I do. I don‰Ûªt want that Swedish team scooping us.,9
43878,Leonard,6, Then I‰Ûªm going to tell him we‰Ûªre in.,9
43879,Sheldon,6," Leonard, wait. This is highly unethical.",9
43880,Leonard,6," We‰Ûªre just bending the rules a little. We have grant money to do the experiment, so we‰Ûªre going to spend it on the helium we need. It‰Ûªs not like when Dr. Goldfarb claimed he bought an electron microscope and he was really just keeping a Russian girl in an apartment in Van Nuys.",9
43881,Sheldon,6, Was she helping him with his research?,9
43882,Leonard,6," Sure. So, are we doing this?",9
43883,Sheldon,6," Well, but where does he get the helium?",9
43884,Leonard,6, Remember? Don‰Ûªt ask too many questions?,9
43885,Sheldon,6," Uh, but this is violating university code.",9
43886,Leonard,6," A little, but if I may quote Einstein, the pursuit of science calls us to ignore the rules set by man.",9
43887,Sheldon,6," Huh. All right, do it. Tell him we‰Ûªre in.",9
43888,Leonard,6, Done.,9
43889,Sheldon,6, I can‰Ûªt find that quote on the Internet. Did you make that up?,9
43890,Leonard,6," Before I answer, may I just say your skin has never looked better.",9
43891,Sheldon,6, Aren‰Ûªt you just made of sugar.,9
43892,Scene,6, Howard and Bernadette‰Ûªs house.,9
43893,Amy,6, I‰Ûªm not sure how I feel about this.,9
43894,Penny,6," Oh, come on, just let him put the app on your phone.",9
43895,Bernadette,6," Yeah, Stuart got two dates with it.",9
43896,Stuart,6," One of which would‰Ûªve ended in sex had she not said no. Okay, all set.",9
43897,Penny,6," Okay, let me see. Nope, nope, nope, oh, he‰Ûªs cute.",9
43898,Bernadette,6, Doesn‰Ûªt a teardrop tattoo mean he murdered someone?,9
43899,Penny,6, And he‰Ûªs sad about it.,9
43900,Howard,6, Hey.,9
43901,Raj,6, Hello.,9
43902,Penny,6, Hey.,9
43903,Bernadette,6," Hey, I thought you were gonna be out late?",9
43904,Howard,6," If you wanted me to stay out later, you should‰Ûªve given me more spending money.",9
43905,Raj,6, What are you guys up to?,9
43906,Bernadette,6," We put Amy on a dating app, and we‰Ûªre seeing what‰Ûªs out there.",9
43907,Raj,6," Oh, fun. Let me see. Uh, no, no, uh, definitely not.",9
43908,Howard,6, What was wrong with that guy?,9
43909,Raj,6," Uh, he‰Ûªs Indian. We‰Ûªve already got one of those. Ooh, we should find a nice Latino, really round us out.",9
43910,Howard,6," Hey, I want to try.",9
43911,Amy,6," Uh, excuse me, can I have my phone back?",9
43912,Howard,6," Hang on, I‰Ûªm trying to find you the next great love of your life. The man who will father your children. Okay, yes or no on white guy with dreadlocks?",9
43913,Scene,6, A parking garage.,9
43914,Leonard,6, That must be him.,9
43915,Sheldon,6," Oh, of course. An nondescript, white panel van. You may be familiar with it from the sentence, their bodies were found in a nondescript, white panel van.",9
43916,Leonard,6, Hey.,9
43917,Man,6, What‰Ûªs up?,9
43918,Leonard,6," Uh, I‰Ûªm Leonard. This is my friend‰Û_",9
43919,Sheldon,6, I‰Ûªm Skippy. Skippy Cavanaugh.,9
43920,Man,6, Great. You got the cash?,9
43921,Leonard,6," Uh, yeah, uh, right here.",9
43922,Sheldon,6," Wait, hold on, hold on. How do we know that you‰Ûªre not gonna take the money and drive away?",9
43923,Leonard,6," What ya doing, Skippy?",9
43924,Sheldon,6, Exactly what 1970s television crime dramas have taught us. You give us the helium first.,9
43925,Man,6," Oh, how do I know you‰Ûªre not gonna drive away without paying me?",9
43926,Sheldon,6, Guess I‰Ûªm not the only one who watches ‰Ûª70s television crime dramas.,9
43927,Leonard,6," Look, you can trust us. We‰Ûªre respected scientists.",9
43928,Sheldon,6," Well, he is. I‰Ûªm a wedding planner who can‰Ûªt find love himself. It‰Ûªs ironic, but the point is we can‰Ûªt trust you. You‰Ûªre a sketchy character in a parking garage.",9
43929,Man,6," Yeah, well, from my perspective, that‰Ûªs how you two appear to me.",9
43930,Sheldon,6," Well, I never thought of it like that. Boy, frame of reference will just sneak up on you, won‰Ûªt it?",9
43931,Leonard,6, My friend does make a decent point about the money. I don‰Ûªt feel comfortable just handing it over up front.,9
43932,Man,6," Ah, no money, no helium. Seems we‰Ûªre at a, uh, stalemate.",9
43933,Sheldon,6," Not technically. In chess, a stalemate refers to a situation in which there are no remaining moves. Uh, you have plenty of moves available. You could beat us up and steal the money. You could kill us, you know. Really, you‰Ûªre only limited by your imagination.",9
43934,Man,6," Huh. All these years I‰Ûªve been using stalemate, when I really mean impasse. I feel foolish.",9
43935,Leonard,6, I don‰Ûªt think it matters if this is a stalemate or an impasse or a Mexican standoff. What are we gonna do here?,9
43936,Man,6," Oh, whoa, whoa, how can it bea Mexican standoff? Everybody knows you need three sides for that.",9
43937,Sheldon,6," Not necessarily. Uh, many argue the essence of a Mexican standoff is that no one can walk away from the conflict without incurring harm.",9
43938,Man,6," Hmm, I don‰Ûªt follow.",9
43939,Sheldon,6," Let me give you an example. Earlier today, I decoded the headers on your e-mail, and I know that your name is Kenneth Fitzgerald. From that, I figured out where you live and where you work. Now, to make this a Mexican standoff, I would say something like, uh, you give us the helium or I‰Ûªll turn you in to the authorities.",9
43940,Man,6, Is that a threat?,9
43941,Sheldon,6," Yeah, exactly. See, you‰Ûªre getting it.",9
43942,Man,6," Yeah, well, I know where you work, all right? And if you mess with me, I‰Ûªll report you, then I‰Ûªll pound your asses into the ground.",9
43943,Sheldon,6, Perfect. Now we really are in a Mexican standoff. Is this one of those times where I‰Ûªve won the battle but lost the war?,9
43944,Leonard,6," Afraid so, Skippy.",9
43945,Sheldon,6, I told you we shouldn‰Ûªt go shopping at night.,9
43946,Leonard,6," All right, let‰Ûªs all just calm down. Nobody wants to report anybody.",9
43947,Man,6," No, I don‰Ûªt like this. I‰Ûªm out.",9
43948,Leonard,6," No, no, no. Wait, don‰Ûªt go. Just let me explain. We‰Ûªre physicists, and we‰Ûªre trying to prove a hypothesis that we‰Ûªve been working on for over a year.",9
43949,Man,6, Really? What‰Ûªs the hypothesis?,9
43950,Sheldon,6, Space-time can be interpreted as the surface of an n-dimensional superfluid.,9
43951,Man,6," Hmm. Could be, could be. Go on.",9
43952,Leonard,6," Okay, but now there‰Ûªs this Swedish team that read our paper and they‰Ûªre trying to beat us to our own discovery. We really need this helium.",9
43953,Sheldon,6," And I‰Ûªm sorry I lied about being a wedding planner who can‰Ûªt find love. Although I am currently single, if you know anybody.",9
43954,Leonard,6, Here‰Ûªs the money. Can we do this?,9
43955,Man,6, Okay. It‰Ûªs a shame about those scientists ripping you off. I expected a higher ethical standard from our friends in Sweden.,9
43956,Leonard,6, It‰Ûªs actually pretty common in our field. There‰Ûªs not much you can do about it.,9
43957,Man,6," Well, for the right amount of money, if you know where they live, there‰Ûªs, uh, plenty we could do about it.",9
43958,Sheldon,6," Did you hear that, Leonard? There‰Ûªs plenty we could do about it. Do you have a card?",9
43959,Scene,6, Howard and Bernadette‰Ûªs house.,9
43960,Penny,6," Okay, here we go. Now everyone can see. All right. Where do we stand on cross-eyed Mike?",9
43961,Raj,6, You know he won‰Ûªt be looking at other girls.,9
43962,Howard,6, Unless they‰Ûªre sitting on the end of his nose.,9
43963,Penny,6," Okay, okay, okay. Thumbs down. Next.",9
43964,Bernadette,6," Ew, check out his tiny teeth. He looks like a man-dolphin.",9
43965,Penny,6," Well if he‰Ûªs good in bed, she can throw him a fish.",9
43966,Howard,6," I love you, Amy. (Dolphin noises)",9
43967,Amy,6," Okay, I‰Ûªm starting to feel guilty. Aren‰Ûªt we being a little mean?",9
43968,Raj,6, That‰Ûªs a fair point. We wouldn‰Ûªt make fun of someone like this to their face.,9
43969,Penny,6," Look, it‰Ûªs Stuart.",9
43970,Raj,6, You may want to leave the room.,9
43971,Scene,6, Leonard‰Ûªs lab.,9
43972,Sheldon,6," Right this way, Uncle Harvey.",9
43973,Leonard,6, Will you stop with that already?,9
43974,Sheldon,6, I‰Ûªm trying not to attract attention.,9
43975,Leonard,6, And tipping his hat to the cleaning lady didn‰Ûªt do that?,9
43976,Sheldon,6, She said buenas noches. What was he supposed to do?,9
43977,Leonard,6, Let‰Ûªs just start the experiment.,9
43978,Sheldon,6," Leonard, we should probably have our story straight in case we get caught.",9
43979,Leonard,6, We‰Ûªre not getting caught.,9
43980,Sheldon,6," Well, you can‰Ûªt be sure of that. What if the helium dealer rats us out? What if Kripke asks where we got it? What if the university checks my family tree and finds out I don‰Ûªt have an Uncle Harvey?",9
43981,Leonard,6," The dealer doesn‰Ûªt care, Kripke has no authority over us, and you being related to a metal container would explain a lot. Help me hook this up.",9
43982,Sheldon,6, Uh-oh.,9
43983,Leonard,6, What?,9
43984,Sheldon,6," Well, did you see this sticker?",9
43985,Leonard,6, What is it?,9
43986,Sheldon,6," It‰Ûªs partially torn off, but the segment that remains reads property of and the letter U.",9
43987,Leonard,6, It‰Ûªs probably USC or UCLA.,9
43988,Sheldon,6," Yeah, but what if it‰Ûªs Property of U.S. Government? There‰Ûªs a national helium reserve in Amarillo, Texas. If this was stolen from there, we‰Ûªre accessories to a federal crime.",9
43989,Leonard,6, Let‰Ûªs not jump to conclusions. A lot of things start with U.,9
43990,Sheldon,6," That‰Ûªs true. There‰Ûªs the U.S. Air Force, U.S. Department of Defence, U.S. Navy, you and I are going to jail.",9
43991,Leonard,6," Listen, we can do the experiment as planned and beat the Swedish team to the punch, or we can kiss our dreams good-bye because we were to afraid to break a few rules.",9
43992,Scene,6, A university corridor.,9
43993,Leonard,6, Ma‰Ûªam.,9
43994,Scene,6, Howard and Bernadette‰Ûªs house.,9
43995,Penny,6," Okay, does everyone remember the rules? If he‰Ûªs shirtless, one sip. Posing with a pet, two sips. Pet and shirtless, chug like it‰Ûªs your job. And pull.",9
43996,Raj,6, I have that same underwear.,9
43997,Penny,6, Chug.,9
43998,Penny,6," Amy, you‰Ûªre getting a text.",9
43999,Amy,6," Oh, um, give me that.",9
44000,Raj,6, I had a great time last night.,9
44001,Amy,6," No, no, stop reading that.",9
44002,Howard,6, Who‰Ûªs Dave?,9
44003,Penny,6, You went on a date last night? Are you seeing someone?,9
44004,Amy,6," No, it, it‰Ûªs not like that.",9
44005,Bernadette,6, And I‰Ûªd love to take you out again‰Û?,9
44006,All,6," Amy/What?/Can‰Ûªt believe it/Oh, my God.",9
44007,Amy,6," Okay, it‰Ûªs like that.",9
44008,Scene,6, The parking garage.,9
44009,Leonard,6, Thank you for coming back.,9
44010,Man,6," Yeah, well, normally I wouldn‰Ûªt, but my daughter‰Ûªs having a sleepover, and there‰Ûªs only so much screaming and Katy Perry a man can take.",9
44011,Sheldon,6," Anyway, if you could just give us our money back, you can have your helium and we‰Ûªll be on our way.",9
44012,Man,6," Yeah, well, is there something wrong with it?",9
44013,Leonard,6," No, nothing. We just changed our mind.",9
44014,Sheldon,6," He has glasses and I‰Ûªm a know-it-all, we are not built for prison.",9
44015,Man,6," Yeah, I hear you. Well, you‰Ûªre good guys, so I‰Ûªll, uh, I‰Ûªll take the helium off your hands.",9
44016,Leonard,6, Thank you.,9
44017,Man,6, But you ain‰Ûªt getting your money back.,9
44018,Sheldon,6, You‰Ûªre taking advantage of us? We clarified nomenclature together.,9
44019,Man,6," Look, I enjoy semantic digressions as much as the next guy, but, uh, this is business.",9
44020,Leonard,6, You know what? It‰Ûªs fine. Keep the money. We just want to be done with this.,9
44021,Man,6," No problem, but I am gonna have to charge you a small helium restocking fee.",9
44022,Sheldon,6, I don‰Ûªt understand.,9
44023,Leonard,6, He wants more money.,9
44024,Sheldon,6," Well, it better not be more than a thousand dollars. That‰Ûªs all I‰Ûªve got on me.",9
44025,Man,6, That‰Ûªs exactly how much it is.,9
44026,Sheldon,6," Finally, something breaks our way.",9
44027,Scene,6, Howard and Bernadette‰Ûªs house.,9
44028,Penny,6, I can‰Ûªt believe you‰Ûªre seeing someone and we don‰Ûªt even know about it.,9
44029,Bernadette,6," Yeah, why wouldn‰Ûªt you tell us?",9
44030,Amy,6, Because it‰Ûªs new and weird and I‰Ûªm just trying to figure it all out. And I knew if I told you guys I had been out with a few people that you‰Ûªd get way too excited about it.,9
44031,Stuart,6, A few people?,9
44032,Bernadette,6, What?,9
44033,Penny,6, Amy.,9
44034,Stuart,6," So, are we allowed to ask how it‰Ûªs going?",9
44035,Amy,6, It‰Ûªs going fine. It‰Ûªs mostly just been meeting people for coffee.,9
44036,Raj,6, What? I thought we were all‰Û_ never mind.,9
44037,Bernadette,6," I, I thought you weren‰Ûªt ready to start seeing people.",9
44038,Amy,6," Well, I don‰Ûªt have much experience dating, so I decided it would be good for me to, you know, get out there a little.",9
44039,Penny,6," Well, good for you.",9
44040,Amy,6, Thank you.,9
44041,Bernadette,6, And how many guys have you gone out with?,9
44042,Stuart,6, Please be less than two.,9
44043,Amy,6, Three.,9
44044,Stuart,6, Damn it.,9
44045,Scene,6, Leonard‰Ûªs lab. ,9
44046,Sheldon,6," Well, the Swedes might beat us, but at least we won‰Ûªt get gang-noogied in prison.",9
44047,Leonard,6, Is Ernest Goes to Jail the only prison movie you‰Ûªve seen?,9
44048,Sheldon,6," It scared me straight, Leonard.",9
44049,Barry,6," Hey, I‰Ûªve been thinking. I was being petty. You can have my hewium.",9
44050,Leonard,6," Thank you, Barry.",9
44051,Barry,6, But you have to add my name to your paper.,9
44052,Sheldon,6, That‰Ûªs preposterous.,9
44053,Barry,6," I don‰Ûªt know, seems fair. You can‰Ûªt do it without me.",9
44054,Leonard,6, Can you give us a minute?,9
44055,Barry,6, Take your time. I‰Ûªll walk out backwards for dwamatic effect.,9
44056,Sheldon,6, I don‰Ûªt like being extorted like this. Especially by him of all people.,9
44057,Leonard,6," Me neither, but what other choice do we have?",9
44058,Scene,6, The parking garage.,9
44059,Leonard,6, I promise this is the last time.,9
44060,Scene,6, The apartment. ,9
44061,Leonard,6, It says right here on Wikipedia. A Mexican standoff is a confrontation between at least three parties.,9
44062,Sheldon,6, How can you trust Wikipedia if they use between to refer to three parties?,9
44063,Helium Man,6," They should‰Ûªve used among, right?",9
44064,Sheldon,6," Or amongst, if they were feeling whimsically archaic.",9
44065,Helium Man,6," All right, enough with the chitchat. Are we gonna watch Ernest Goes to Jail or not?",9
44066,Sheldon,6, Absolutely. But don‰Ûªt be surprised if this movie sets you on the straight and narrow.,9
44067,Helium Man,6, I am open to change.,9
44068,Scene,7, The apartment.,9
44069,Leonard,7, Did you hear about this study that found people that were cool and popular at 13 have problems succeeding later in life?,9
44070,Raj,7," Hmm. I‰Ûªm doing okay, and I was very popular at 13.",9
44071,Penny,7, In school?,9
44072,Raj,7," Oh, no. At home. The servants would sing to me, laugh at my jokes. I wish I knew their names.",9
44073,Penny,7, Does the study say what happens to the unpopular kids?,9
44074,Leonard,7," You tell me, you woke up in bed with one.",9
44075,Sheldon,7, Listen to this. I just received an e-mail from Wil Wheaton. Leonard Nimoy‰Ûªs son is working on a documentary that he started with his father before he passed away. It‰Ûªs about Mr. Spock and his impact on our culture.,9
44076,Leonard,7, Why is he writing to you?,9
44077,Sheldon,7," Well, they‰Ûªre looking for fans to interview, and Wil thought I‰Ûªd be good for it.",9
44078,Raj,7," Oh. Hey, high five.",9
44079,Sheldon,7," Absolutely not. Yeah, Penny, you spent some time in front of the camera. Any words of advice?",9
44080,Penny,7, Yes. Don‰Ûªt take your shirt off just because the director said so.,9
44081,Sheldon,7," This is a documentary about Mr. Spock. I‰Ûªm sure if there‰Ûªs nudity, it will be tasteful.",9
44082,Scene,7, Howard and Bernadette‰Ûªs house.,9
44083,Bernadette,7, Hey. You got a minute?,9
44084,Howard,7, Not really. Visigoths are kind of up my butt right now.,9
44085,Bernadette,7," Pause the game, Howard.",9
44086,Howard,7," Howard? Uh-oh. Make room, Visigoths. ‰Û÷Sup?",9
44087,Bernadette,7, We need to talk about redecorating this place.,9
44088,Howard,7," Oh, no, not this again.",9
44089,Bernadette,7," Look, I get that you grew up here and you‰Ûªre attached to things looking a certain way, but I want this to feel like my house, too.",9
44090,Howard,7," Oh, honey, of course it‰Ûªs your house. Why else would you be cleaning it all the time?",9
44091,Bernadette,7," All right. Let‰Ûªs start over. I‰Ûªm redecorating. The furniture, the carpeting, the walls. I‰Ûªm changing everything that depresses me when I look at it. Try not to be one of those things.",9
44092,Howard,7, May I say something?,9
44093,Bernadette,7, Is it about how I can‰Ûªt have new wallpaper ‰Ûªcause your dad left when you were little and your mom died?,9
44094,Howard,7, Never mind.,9
44095,Scene,7, The apartment. ,9
44096,Sheldon (on phone),7," Hello, Amy. It‰Ûªs Sheldon. Yeah, I, I know that we‰Ûªre broken up, but I‰Ûªm leaving this message because I thought perhaps you‰Ûªd like to watch me be interviewed for a documentary about Mr. Spock. Or as I like to call it, a Spockumentary. Yeah, I‰Ûªm going to use that joke in the interview, so try to laugh like you‰Ûªre hearing it for the first time. You know, hysterically, hmm? And with a tinge of sadness that I‰Ûªm no longer in your life.",9
44097,Leonard,7, I‰Ûªm the one who thought of Spockumentary.,9
44098,Penny,7, And I‰Ûªm laughing like I did the first time I heard it.,9
44099,Sheldon (answering door),7, Hello.,9
44100,Wil Wheaton,7," Hey, Sheldon. This is Adam Nimoy.",9
44101,Adam,7, Nice to meet you.,9
44102,Sheldon,7," Oh, it‰Ûªs nice to meet you. I admire your father‰Ûªs work very much. It‰Ûªs not every day I get to meet someone whose life‰Ûªs journey began in my hero‰Ûªs scrotum.",9
44103,Wil,7, I told you. This guy is gold.,9
44104,Scene,7, Howard and Bernadette‰Ûªs kitchen.,9
44105,Bernadette,7, Whatcha doing?,9
44106,Howard,7," Oh. Making myself a bologna sandwich like my mom used to make me after my dad left, but before she died.",9
44107,Bernadette,7," Okay, listen, I‰Ûªm thinking that maybe we can compromise on the house.",9
44108,Howard,7, I‰Ûªm listening.,9
44109,Bernadette,7, Let‰Ûªs just redo one room and see how it goes.,9
44110,Howard,7, That is reasonable. But what room?,9
44111,Bernadette,7, How ‰Ûªbout this one?,9
44112,Howard,7," No way. No, this is the room I associate the most with my mom.",9
44113,Bernadette,7, Then how ‰Ûªbout the bathroom?,9
44114,Howard,7, I want to change my answer.,9
44115,Bernadette,7, Fine. Then the dining room.,9
44116,Howard,7, I guess we didn‰Ûªt use it very often. Unless we had company. Which didn‰Ûªt happen much after my dad left and not at all after my mom‰Û_,9
44117,Bernadette,7, Great. I‰Ûªm gonna go pick out paint samples.,9
44118,Scene,7, The apartment.,9
44119,Adam,7," All right, we‰Ûªre just gonna have a conversation. Pretend the camera‰Ûªs not here.",9
44120,Sheldon,7, All right. But this better not be some elaborate scheme to get me out of my shirt.,9
44121,Leonard,7, How long have you known Adam?,9
44122,Wil,7, A few years.,9
44123,Leonard,7, And what are you getting him back for?,9
44124,Adam,7, Let‰Ûªs start with your name and occupation.,9
44125,Sheldon,7," Dr. Sheldon Cooper, theoretical physicist, Caltech.",9
44126,Adam,7, And what is your earliest memory of the character Spock?,9
44127,Adam,7, What was it about Spock that appealed to you?,9
44128,Sheldon,7," I think the same thing that appeals to people everywhere, the dream of a cold, rational world entirely without human emotion. Spock came from a planet governed only by logic. You know, on Vulcan, when your brother asks, why are you hitting yourself? the answer is, I‰Ûªm not. You‰Ûªre moving my arm. To which he says, Fascinating. And then you both watch educational television.",9
44129,Penny,7," Aw. When he says things like that, I just want to hug him and make everything better.",9
44130,Leonard,7," My brother was mean to me, too.",9
44131,Penny,7," Yeah, you probably had it coming.",9
44132,Adam,7, Do you have any Spock collectibles?,9
44133,Sheldon,7, I have many. My most treasured is an autographed napkin given to me by my very thoughtful friend Penny. That‰Ûªs her over there.,9
44134,Penny,7," Hi. Look at that. I‰Ûªm in a movie, my shirt stayed on.",9
44135,Adam,7, Can we see the napkin?,9
44136,Sheldon,7, Of course. Excuse me. This will just take a moment.,9
44137,Leonard,7, When did we get a wall safe?,9
44138,Sheldon,7, When there was no more room in the floor safe.,9
44139,Leonard,7, When did we get a floor safe?,9
44140,Sheldon,7, When we got the security camera.,9
44141,Leonard,7, There‰Ûªs a security camera?,9
44142,Sheldon,7," Aquaman, protecting your home since 2012.",9
44143,Penny,7," Oh, my God. We‰Ûªve done things on that couch.",9
44144,Sheldon,7, Yeah. You don‰Ûªt have to tell me.,9
44145,Scene,7, Howard and Bernadette‰Ûªs house.,9
44146,Raj,7," So, your father-in-law is in there right now?",9
44147,Howard,7, Yes. So back me up. The house is good the way it is.,9
44148,Raj,7," Oh, okay. Got it.",9
44149,Howard,7, Hey. What‰Ûªs going on?,9
44150,Raj,7, Hey.,9
44151,Bernadette,7," Hey, Raj. Dad and I were just talking about taking down this wall.",9
44152,Raj,7, You sure? It‰Ûªs a pretty great wall.,9
44153,Mr Rostenkowski,7, What‰Ûªs so great about it?,9
44154,Raj,7, I‰Ûªm sorry. I did what I could.,9
44155,Bernadette,7, Seriously? You brought Raj over to take your side?,9
44156,Howard,7, Your dad‰Ûªs on your side.,9
44157,Bernadette,7, He‰Ûªs not on my side. He‰Ûªs doing all the work for free.,9
44158,Raj,7, That is so generous of you. I‰Ûªd like to switch sides.,9
44159,Howard,7," Look, uh, I don‰Ûªt even think you can take this wall down ‰Ûªcause it‰Ûªs load-bearing.",9
44160,Raj,7," Well, it‰Ûªs easy to find out. Just go into the crawlspace under the house and check.",9
44161,Howard,7, When is your visa up?,9
44162,Scene,7, The apartment.,9
44163,Sheldon,7, Not only is it signed to me but this is where he wiped his mouth. So we are currently in the presence of Leonard Nimoy‰Ûªs DNA.,9
44164,Wil,7," Um, doesn‰Ûªt Adam count as Leonard Nimoy‰Ûªs DNA?",9
44165,Sheldon,7," No offence, but this is pure 100% Nimoy. Because of your mother, you‰Ûªre only 50%. Which isn‰Ûªt bad, but anything that you wipe your mouth on gets thrown away.",9
44166,Penny,7," Okay, enough about the napkin. What else you hiding in there?",9
44167,Sheldon,7, Wouldn‰Ûªt you like to know?,9
44168,Penny,7, I would.,9
44169,Sheldon,7," All right then. See? Just my valuables. My passport, uh, my will.",9
44170,Leonard,7, You have a will?,9
44171,Sheldon,7," Yeah. My 1/18 scale Wil Wheaton action figure. I also have the other kind of will, and in it I will my Wil back to Wil.",9
44172,Leonard,7, Will Wil want it?,9
44173,Wil,7, Wil won‰Ûªt.,9
44174,Penny,7," Oh, what‰Ûªs that ring box?",9
44175,Sheldon,7, Oh. That is an engagement ring that I was going to give my girlfriend Amy.,9
44176,Penny,7, What?,9
44177,Leonard,7, You bought her a ring?,9
44178,Sheldon,7," No, no. This has been in my family for generations. Except for a short time when Comanches cut off my great-great-great-grandmother‰Ûªs finger and stole it.",9
44179,Wil,7," Sheldon, that‰Ûªs awful.",9
44180,Sheldon,7," No. The Texas Rangers tracked them down to their village and slaughtered every last one of them. It was a happy ending. Well, for my nine-fingered Nana.",9
44181,Penny,7," Okay, back to the ring. Does Amy even know about this?",9
44182,Sheldon,7, No. She broke up with me before I could broach the subject.,9
44183,Leonard,7," Oh, man, I‰Ûªm sorry, that must have been devastating for you.",9
44184,Sheldon,7," No, not at all. No, I‰Ûªm fine. You know, Amy had reservations about our relationship, so all worked out for the best.",9
44185,Penny,7, I know. It just‰Û_,9
44186,Sheldon (shouting),7," I said I‰Ûªm fine! (Long pause) We‰Ûªve gotten a little off-topic. Allow me to make things entertaining again in this little Spockumentary. That was Leonard‰Ûªs joke. As a child, when faced with a dilemma, my mother encouraged me to ask what would Jesus do? The answer to that was always love thy neighbour. But my neighbour had a dead tooth, so that wasn‰Ûªt going to happen. But that‰Ûªs why I changed it to, what would Spock do?",9
44187,Adam,7, Did you find that helpful?,9
44188,Sheldon,7," Yes. Oh, for example, three years ago when I discovered Penny was eating all my Pop-Tarts, instead of getting angry or vindictive, you know, I got a floor safe.",9
44189,Penny,7, I knew I could smell ‰Ûªem.,9
44190,Adam,7, What about from when you were a kid?,9
44191,Sheldon,7," Oh, certainly. Uh, when I was eight years old, Billy Sparks cornered me in the playground. I asked myself what would Spock do? Then I grabbed Billy on his shoulder and performed my first Vulcan nerve pinch.",9
44192,Adam,7, Did it work?,9
44193,Sheldon,7," Oh, no, he broke my collarbone. I can still hear it click.",9
44194,Adam,7, That must have been very upsetting for you.,9
44195,Sheldon,7," Oh, not at all. As I said, the entire point of emulating Spock was to rise above human emotion, which I‰Ûªve spent a lifetime mastering.",9
44196,Penny,7, Oh pfft.,9
44197,Sheldon,7, Excuse me?,9
44198,Penny,7, I‰Ûªm sorry. I‰Ûªm not here.,9
44199,Sheldon,7, No. You went pfft. What does pfft mean?,9
44200,Penny,7, Um.,9
44201,Leonard,7, You did go pfft.,9
44202,Penny,7," All right, fine. Well, Sheldon, I‰Ûªm no expert, but aren‰Ûªt you completely missing the point of Spock? I mean, he liked to act like he had no emotions, but he was still half human.",9
44203,Leonard,7, Just like you.,9
44204,Penny,7," I‰Ûªm just saying, you pretend you don‰Ûªt, but you have feelings just like everybody else.",9
44205,Sheldon,7," Not true. No, look at me. I had an engagement ring to give a girl, and instead, she rejected me. And am I emotional about that? No. No, I am sitting here on a couch, talking about my favourite TV character like nothing happened. ‰Û÷Cause I am just like him, all logical, all the time.",9
44206,Penny,7," Sweetie, you‰Ûªre yelling.",9
44207,Sheldon,7," Because when I speak at a regular volume, no one seems to believe me that I‰Ûªve put this Amy nonsense behind me.",9
44208,Wil,7, This documentary is gonna be awesome.,9
44209,Scene,7, The crawlspace under Howard and Bernadette‰Ûªs house.,9
44210,Mr Rostenkowski,7, You gonna be okay down here?,9
44211,Howard,7," Yeah. Yeah, I feel like an archaeologist. Indiana Jones and the Single-Family Dwelling. Hey. Look. Found a seashell.",9
44212,Mr Rostenkowski,7," Yeah, that‰Ûªs a rat skull.",9
44213,Howard,7, Oh.,9
44214,Mr Rostenkowski,7, Relax. There‰Ûªs enough droppings down here without you making more.,9
44215,Howard,7, Sorry. Do you have a sense of where we are?,9
44216,Mr Rostenkowski,7, Yeah. I think that‰Ûªs the den.,9
44217,Howard,7," Oh. Okay, so we must be under the dining room.",9
44218,Mr Rostenkowski,7," Uh-huh. Yep. You know, I know you don‰Ûªt want to hear this, but it wouldn‰Ûªt take that much work to turn that den into a nursery.",9
44219,Howard,7, Why wouldn‰Ûªt I want to hear it?,9
44220,Mr Rostenkowski,7, ‰Û÷Cause Bernie said you didn‰Ûªt want kids.,9
44221,Howard,7," That‰Ûªs not true at all. I wish she‰Ûªd get pregnant, believe me. I‰Ûªm climbing on top of her every chance I get. In a loving and respectful manner. The point is, I really do want kids.",9
44222,Mr Rostenkowski,7, Huh.,9
44223,Howard,7," I don‰Ûªt know why she‰Ûªs lying to you. She‰Ûªs the one who doesn‰Ûªt want kids. In fact, every time I bring up the subject‰Û_",9
44224,Bernadette (above),7, Earthquake.,9
44225,Howard,7," Oh, my God, we‰Ûªre gonna die.",9
44226,Bernadette,7, Aftershock.,9
44227,Scene,7, The apartment.,9
44228,Penny,7, I can‰Ûªt believe Sheldon was gonna ask Amy to marry him.,9
44229,Leonard,7, I know. I also can‰Ûªt believe he watched what we did on that couch and still sits on it.,9
44230,Penny,7, Yeah.,9
44231,Sheldon,7, Hello.,9
44232,Leonard,7," Hey, buddy. How you doing?",9
44233,Sheldon,7, Better. Did Wil and Adam leave?,9
44234,Leonard,7, Yeah.,9
44235,Sheldon,7, Do you think they‰Ûªre going to put my outburst in the documentary?,9
44236,Leonard,7," Oh, yeah.",9
44237,Penny,7, Definitely.,9
44238,Sheldon,7," Well, there‰Ûªs no point in dwelling on it. As the Vulcans say, Kup-fun-tor ha‰Ûªkiv na‰Ûªish Du stau.",9
44239,Penny,7, Do you know what that means?,9
44240,Leonard,7, No.,9
44241,Penny,7, Are you telling the truth?,9
44242,Leonard,7, Nirsh.,9
44243,Sheldon,7," Well, this is ridiculous. Being upset about Amy all the time isn‰Ûªt accomplishing anything. If I want to resolve this situation, then I need to take action.",9
44244,Penny,7, What are you gonna do?,9
44245,Sheldon,7," I‰Ûªm going to find her and ask her to marry me. And if she says yes, we can put this behind us and resume our relationship. And if she says no, well, then she can just ponfo miran.",9
44246,Leonard,7, He didn‰Ûªt meant that.,9
44247,Scene,7, Howard and Bernadette‰Ûªs kitchen.,9
44248,Bernadette,7, So I should probably explain why I kind of fibbed.,9
44249,Howard,7, That would be nice.,9
44250,Bernadette,7, I told my dad that you were the one who didn‰Ûªt want kids because I didn‰Ûªt want to disappoint him.,9
44251,Howard,7, But you were okay throwing me under the bus?,9
44252,Bernadette,7," Turns out yeah, I didn‰Ûªt think twice about it.",9
44253,Mr Rostenkowski,7," Bernie, you don‰Ûªt need to worry about me. But I don‰Ûªt want to see you miss out. Raising children was the most rewarding experience of my life.",9
44254,Bernadette,7," Oh, please. Mom did everything. All you did was come home from work, sit on the couch and drink beer. How is that raising kids?",9
44255,Mr Rostenkowski,7," This is really a conversation for husband and wife. I‰Ûªm gonna go clean up, hit the road. If your mother asks, I was here till ten.",9
44256,Raj,7," It‰Ûªs interesting your father didn‰Ûªt help around the house and Howard doesn‰Ûªt help, either, so in a way, Howard‰Ûªs not only like your father, but he‰Ûªs also like the child that you‰Ûªre afraid to have.",9
44257,Howard,7, Why are you still here?,9
44258,Raj,7," Fine, I‰Ûªll leave. But it sounds like somebody needs a fresh diaper.",9
44259,Howard,7," All right, I admit that I don‰Ûªt help out a lot. And I need to work on that. But if we had a kid, it would be different.",9
44260,Bernadette,7, Why?,9
44261,Howard,7," Because when my dad left, I promised myself that if I ever had a chance to be a father I‰Ûªd always be there.",9
44262,Bernadette,7," Okay, I‰Ûªll think about it.",9
44263,Howard,7," And this an actual I‰Ûªll think about it, not like the can we get a motorcycle with a sidecar I‰Ûªll think about it‰Û?",9
44264,Bernadette,7, It‰Ûªs an actual I‰Ûªll think about it.,9
44265,Howard,7, I really believe I‰Ûªd be a great dad.,9
44266,Bernadette,7, I know you would.,9
44267,Howard,7," Speaking of making babies, what do you say I wash up and poke around your crawlspace?",9
44268,Scene,7, The street. Sheldon sees Amy with another man. He leaves. ,9
44269,Scene,7, The apartment.,9
44270,Kirk (on screen),7, Dr. Dana feels he isn‰Ûªt that dangerous. What makes you right and a trained psychiatrist wrong?,9
44271,Spock (on screen),7, Because she feels. I don‰Ûªt. All I know is logic.,9
44272,Sheldon,7," Yeah, right. You can just shut your feelings off. There goes television, lying to us again. We let you raise our children, and this is the thanks we get. Leonard, how could I have been so foolish to try and follow in the footsteps of a made-up alien race with no emotions?",9
44273,Leonard,7," Well now instead of idolizing fictional characters, you can focus on the real people who are already in your life.",9
44274,Sheldon,7, Those are very wise words.,9
44275,Leonard,7, Thank you.,9
44276,Sheldon,7, They‰Ûªd just be so much more comforting if they came out of a television.,9
44277,Scene,8, The apartment.,9
44278,Penny,8, I think it‰Ûªs so adorable you‰Ûªre making Sheldon breakfast.,9
44279,Leonard,8," Well, he‰Ûªs having a rough time. Amy broke his heart, the DVR cut off the last minute of Doctor Who. That crow followed him home.",9
44280,Penny,8, Aren‰Ûªt you worried you‰Ûªre making French toast on oatmeal day?,9
44281,Leonard,8," Ah, well, what‰Ûªs this? A pot of oatmeal? Or, thanks to you, what I will now call gloatmeal.",9
44282,Penny,8," Oh, I don‰Ûªt want credit for that.",9
44283,Sheldon,8," Oh, Dr. and Mrs. Hofstadter, lovely to see you this fine morning.",9
44284,Leonard,8, You‰Ûªre in a good mood.,9
44285,Sheldon,8," Yeah, I am indeed. I have decided, instead of wallowing in sadness about Amy, it is time that I find myself a new female companion.",9
44286,Penny,8, Oh. Good for you.,9
44287,Leonard,8, What brought this on?,9
44288,Sheldon,8," I realized something. When Amy was in my life, I was hyper-focused on my work and ignored her.",9
44289,Penny,8, And you don‰Ûªt want to make the same mistake with the next woman.,9
44290,Sheldon,8," No, I need a new woman in my life to ignore so I can hyper-focus on my work again.",9
44291,Leonard,8," Hey, I made French toast sticks.",9
44292,Sheldon,8, On oatmeal day?,9
44293,Leonard,8," Ah, I also made oatmeal.",9
44294,Sheldon,8," Ooh, that‰Ûªs a lot of carbohydrates for a man on the prowl. You know what? You eat it. You‰Ûªre married, it doesn‰Ûªt matter what you look like.",9
44295,Penny,8, Don‰Ûªt take advice from a man who threw his shoe at a crow.,9
44296,Scene,8, The apartment.,9
44297,Sheldon,8," Thank you for coming by, gentlemen.",9
44298,Howard,8, No problem.,9
44299,Raj,8, So what‰Ûªs up?,9
44300,Sheldon,8," Well, it was the two of you who found Amy Farrah Fowler for me. Now that I‰Ûªm looking for my next girlfriend, it seemed only logical that I employ your services once again.",9
44301,Howard,8, You sure you‰Ûªre up for that? She did hurt you.,9
44302,Sheldon,8," Oh, no, it‰Ûªs all right. I think of my time with Amy as a stick of Fruit Stripe gum. Sweet and enjoyable at first, but ultimately a flavourless lump of sadness.",9
44303,Raj,8, You‰Ûªre not wrong about Fruit Stripe. I was always a Hubba Bubba man.,9
44304,Howard,8, Hubba Bubba over Dubble Bubble? You‰Ûªre crazy.,9
44305,Raj,8," Hey, the jaw wants what it wants.",9
44306,Sheldon,8, Gentlemen.,9
44307,Raj,8," Oh, right, uh, girlfriend. Okay.",9
44308,Howard,8, But what are you looking for?,9
44309,Sheldon,8," All I‰Ûªm looking for is an educated, intelligent woman who shares my interests while retaining her own unique point of view. She should be kind, patient, and most important, unable to imagine life without me by ten o‰Ûªclock tonight.",9
44310,Howard,8, Isn‰Ûªt that a little unreasonable?,9
44311,Sheldon,8," All right, fine, she doesn‰Ûªt need her own point of view. Now, chop-chop.",9
44312,Scene,8, Penny‰Ûªs apartment.,9
44313,Penny,8," Come on, Amy, show us the dress.",9
44314,Amy,8, Okay. But I‰Ûªm really stepping outside of my comfort zone here.,9
44315,Penny,8," Uh, I don‰Ûªt think any of your comfort zones are showing.",9
44316,Bernadette,8," Yeah, it‰Ûªs your third date, maybe you could go more sexy.",9
44317,Amy,8," Well, some people think the sexiest organ is the brain.",9
44318,Penny,8, No one ever bought me drinks at a bar because my brain just popped out of my shirt.,9
44319,Amy,8, Do you have any heels higher than this? He‰Ûªs pretty tall.,9
44320,Penny,8, Ooh.,9
44321,Bernadette,8," Ooh, tall. Finally some details about this mystery man.",9
44322,Penny,8," Yeah, come on, tell us more.",9
44323,Amy,8," Well, I told you his name and that he‰Ûªs tall. What more do you need?",9
44324,Bernadette,8, Did you kiss him yet?,9
44325,Amy,8, Just a little peck on the lips.,9
44326,Penny,8," Well, we‰Ûªre your best friends, give us one more detail and we promise we‰Ûªll leave you alone.",9
44327,Amy,8," Fine. Um, he‰Ûªs British. All right, that is a juicy one.",9
44328,Penny,8," All right, where is tall British Dave taking you?",9
44329,Bernadette,8, Tea and basketball?,9
44330,Amy,8, To that new Italian place on Walnut.,9
44331,Bernadette,8," Oh, nice.",9
44332,Amy,8, I‰Ûªm gonna go look for other shoes.,9
44333,Penny,8, Good luck. I threw out all my tall ones when I married Leonard.,9
44334,Bernadette,8," Hey, you want to swing by that place tonight and get a look at this guy?",9
44335,Penny,8, We don‰Ûªt even know what time they‰Ûªre gonna be there.,9
44336,Bernadette,8," I‰Ûªll just call the restaurant, pretend I‰Ûªm Amy and check the reservation.",9
44337,Penny,8," Damn, you‰Ûªre sneaky.",9
44338,Bernadette,8," Yeah, but I‰Ûªm little, so it‰Ûªs adorable.",9
44339,Scene,8, The apartment.,9
44340,Howard,8, I think the quickest way to find you a new girlfriend is just to get you on every dating Web site out there.,9
44341,Sheldon,8," Are you sure? I‰Ûªve heard that on those sites, often when you think you‰Ûªre corresponding with someone, it‰Ûªs actually a computer program pretending to be a real person.",9
44342,Raj,8, And you‰Ûªre afraid it‰Ûªll do a better job than you?,9
44343,Sheldon,8," Excuse me. No one does a better job pretending to be a person than I do. Siri comes close, but I know more jokes.",9
44344,Howard,8," If you don‰Ûªt want to use dating Web sites, what do you suggest?",9
44345,Sheldon,8," Off the top of my head? Uh, prospective women weed themselves out in a battle of wits until only one champion remains, and she shows up at my door flush with the thrill of victory, and then sits quietly by my side while I watch Daredevil.",9
44346,Howard,8, You seriously think women would fight for you?,9
44347,Sheldon,8," People compete for jobs and trophies, why not me?",9
44348,Howard,8," He‰Ûªs right, he knows a lot of jokes.",9
44349,Raj,8," Yeah, no, but it is basic human nature. If we present him as a prize, maybe they would.",9
44350,Howard,8," Well, he‰Ûªs smart, he‰Ûªs a respected scientist.",9
44351,Sheldon,8, And I have the soulful eyes of a cow.,9
44352,Raj,8, I don‰Ûªt know if I‰Ûªd say you‰Û_ oh.,9
44353,Howard,8," I have an idea. What if we put a post on Craigslist that says world-class Caltech physicist seeking girlfriend. If interested, solve the following puzzles for a chance to meet him.",9
44354,Sheldon,8," Oh, we‰Ûªll make the puzzles extremely challenging to eliminate unworthy candidates.",9
44355,Raj,8," Oh, we could set it up like a scavenger hunt where the last puzzle gives the winner Sheldon‰Ûªs contact information.",9
44356,Howard,8," Well, this is actually an interesting social experiment.",9
44357,Raj,8, I‰Ûªm a little jealous of the people who get to do it.,9
44358,Howard,8," Me, too. And we‰Ûªve seen the prize.",9
44359,Scene,8, The stairwell.,9
44360,Leonard,8, I don‰Ûªt understand why we‰Ûªre leaving so early for the movie.,9
44361,Penny,8," Oh, I forgot to tell you, we‰Ûªre gonna meet up with Bernadette to spy on Amy and her date.",9
44362,Leonard,8, What? I don‰Ûªt want to do that.,9
44363,Penny,8," What, and you think I want to see a documentary about aluminium can recycling?",9
44364,Leonard,8, This is the movie that big soda doesn‰Ûªt want you to see.,9
44365,Penny,8," No, it‰Ûªs the movie your wife doesn‰Ûªt want you to see.",9
44366,Leonard,8, So you‰Ûªre actually okay with invading your friend‰Ûªs privacy?,9
44367,Penny,8, You‰Ûªre not curious who she‰Ûªs out with?,9
44368,Leonard,8, Not really.,9
44369,Penny,8, But you‰Ûªre curious about aluminium cans? You‰Ûªre a weird little guy.,9
44370,Scene,8, The apartment.,9
44371,Sheldon,8, That‰Ûªs it. The Sheldon Cooper Girlfriend Challenge is officially live.,9
44372,Howard,8, Congratulations.,9
44373,Raj,8, This is exciting.,9
44374,Sheldon,8," Right now, somewhere, a woman is dividing the atomic weight of the best noble gas by the number of colours in the oldest national flag still in use.",9
44375,Howard,8, Then using that number as the average speed to calculate the travel time from Mordor to the Shire.,9
44376,Sheldon,8," And, taking her first step towards a lifetime of laughter, love and, best of all, rules.",9
44377,Raj,8," I, I hope we didn‰Ûªt make the puzzles too hard.",9
44378,Howard,8," Well, if she can solve them, it‰Ûªll prove she‰Ûªs intelligent, tenacious and so socially awkward she has nothing better to do on a Saturday night.",9
44379,Sheldon,8," Golly, she sounds too good to be true.",9
44380,Scene,8, A restaurant.,9
44381,Tall British Dave,8, This is fun. I haven‰Ûªt dated much since my divorce.,9
44382,Amy,8," Well, I‰Ûªm having a good time, too. If you don‰Ûªt mind me asking, why did you and your wife split up?",9
44383,Dave,8," Oh, you know how it is, we wanted different things. I wanted children, and she wanted a pastry chef named Jean-Philippe.",9
44384,Amy,8," Oh, I‰Ûªm, I‰Ûªm so sorry.",9
44385,Dave,8," No, it‰Ûªs, it‰Ûªs fine. It‰Ûªs why I left England. It reminded me too much of her. Cold, gloomy and easily accessed by a Frenchman through a tunnel.",9
44386,Penny,8," Hey. So, where are they?",9
44387,Bernadette,8," Across the street, in the left window.",9
44388,Penny,8," Oh, damn it, we should have brought binoculars.",9
44389,Bernadette,8, Right here.,9
44390,Leonard,8, You just happen to have those in the car?,9
44391,Bernadette,8," Kinda. Before I met Howie, I liked to keep close tabs on my boyfriends.",9
44392,Leonard,8, By stalking them?,9
44393,Bernadette,8, No. Stalkers are creepy. I‰Ûªm just a harmless little girl with military-grade spy equipment.,9
44394,Penny,8," Oh, there he is.",9
44395,Bernadette,8," He‰Ûªs cute, right?",9
44396,Penny,8, Yeah.,9
44397,Leonard,8, Can I see?,9
44398,Penny,8," What, now you‰Ûªre interested? You didn‰Ûªt even want to come.",9
44399,Leonard,8," I know, but you guys make being a crappy friend look fun.",9
44400,Penny,8, Fine.,9
44401,Leonard,8," Yeah, okay, I see him. It looks like they‰Ûªre having a nice time. I wish I could hear what they‰Ûªre saying.",9
44402,Bernadette,8," Yeah, I should‰Ûªve brought my parabolic microphone.",9
44403,Penny,8, Your what?,9
44404,Bernadette,8, Nothing. Not important.,9
44405,Dave,8, So you‰Ûªve never been married?,9
44406,Amy,8," No. I mean, to be completely honest, I‰Ûªve, I‰Ûªve only been in one long-term relationship.",9
44407,Dave,8, Oh. What happened with that?,9
44408,Amy,8," That‰Ûªs a good question. After five years, it was just feeling like more work than it should be.",9
44409,Dave,8," Oh, that‰Ûªs too bad. Was he a neurobiologist like you?",9
44410,Amy,8, No. He‰Ûªs a theoretical physicist at Caltech.,9
44411,Dave,8," I love teaching math, but that would be my dream job. What‰Ûªs his focus?",9
44412,Amy,8," Um, used to be string theory, now it‰Ûªs dark matter. But let‰Ûªs not discuss Sheldon. Let‰Ûªs get back to you.",9
44413,Dave,8," Wait, you‰Ûªre not talking about Dr. Sheldon Cooper?",9
44414,Amy,8, I‰Ûªm trying not to. Do you know him?,9
44415,Dave,8," No, but I‰Ûªve followed his work for years. He‰Ûªs a rock star. You‰Ûªve got to tell me about him. What‰Ûªs he like?",9
44416,Penny,8, He really seems into her.,9
44417,Bernadette,8, I took a video. I forgot how much fun this is.,9
44418,Leonard,8," Okay, we saw them. Can we go catch the movie?",9
44419,Bernadette,8, Why‰Ûªd you bring him?,9
44420,Penny,8, I had to; we‰Ûªre married now.,9
44421,Bernadette,8," Ugh, I hear that.",9
44422,Dave,8," I‰Ûªm sorry, just one more question about Sheldon.",9
44423,Amy,8," Sure, why not?",9
44424,Dave,8," It‰Ûªs more of a four-part question, really. When he wrote his paper on supersingular prime numbers, how long did it take?",9
44425,Amy,8, Um about an hour and half.,9
44426,Dave,8," Wow. I mean, wow. And you were there to see it?",9
44427,Amy,8, Yes. Yep. We were on a date. Very much like this one.,9
44428,Dave,8," Mm. I doubt it was like this one. I mean, he‰Ûªs a genius, and I wasn‰Ûªt even smart enough to figure out why my wife always smelled of croissants.",9
44429,Amy,8, What was the rest of your question?,9
44430,Dave,8, Do you think you could introduce me to him?,9
44431,Amy,8, Really? You-you want me to introduce you to my ex-boyfriend?,9
44432,Dave,8," You‰Ûªre right, it‰Ûªs, it‰Ûªs weird. No, wait. Do it. No. I changed my mind. I‰Ûªd be too nervous. Oh, I don‰Ûªt know what to do.",9
44433,Leonard,8, Are we gonna be much longer? I really have to go to the bathroom.,9
44434,Bernadette,8, Right here.,9
44435,Scene,8, The apartment.,9
44436,Raj,8, 37 minutes left until the deadline.,9
44437,Sheldon,8, Someone will show.,9
44438,Howard,8," And no matter what happens, this is still a fun experiment.",9
44439,Raj,8, Not as fun as the night we blew up grapes in the microwave. We really have led full lives.,9
44440,Sheldon,8, Someone will show.,9
44441,Raj,8," Maybe you don‰Ûªt want someone exactly like you. You know what they say, opposites attract.",9
44442,Sheldon,8," Well, by that logic, I should be with someone short, dull and needy, eh? Not to cast aspersions, but I can‰Ûªt shake a stick around here without hitting that.",9
44443,Scene,8, The restaurant.,9
44444,Dave,8," You know, I once drove 500 miles to hear him speak at Stanford.",9
44445,Amy,8, I have a DVD of that lecture.,9
44446,Dave,8, Really? Wasn‰Ûªt it great?,9
44447,Amy,8," Not as a Valentine‰Ûªs present, no.",9
44448,Dave,8," Well, the next time you watch it, I‰Ûªm the bloke who asked the question that he said was stupid and obvious. It was the nicest thing he said to anyone there.",9
44449,Amy,8," That‰Ûªs, um, terrific. Listen, I‰Ûªm, I‰Ûªm kind of tired. Can we call it a night?",9
44450,Dave,8," Oh, gosh. Sorry, I‰Ûªve just spent the whole night talking about your ex-boyfriend. I‰Ûªm such an idiot.",9
44451,Amy,8," No, you‰Ûªre not.",9
44452,Dave,8," Well, maybe not an idiot, but certainly not as smart as someone we won‰Ûªt mention.",9
44453,Amy,8, Thank you.,9
44454,Dave,8," That you said you might introduce me to, I‰Ûªm free on Thursday.",9
44455,Bernadette,8," Hey, hey, they‰Ûªre leaving.",9
44456,Penny,8," What? Here, give me, give me. Oh, my God. Oh, my God, they‰Ûªre coming right towards us.",9
44457,Bernadette,8, We got to get out of here.,9
44458,Penny,8," Okay. Well, wait, what about Leonard?",9
44459,Bernadette,8, He and his tiny bladder can take the bus. (Reverses into car behind),9
44460,Penny,8," Oh, no.",9
44461,Dave,8, She just hit my car.,9
44462,Amy,8, What are you guys doing here?,9
44463,Bernadette,8," Hi, Ames, what are you doing here?",9
44464,Leonard,8, What happened?,9
44465,Dave,8, O-M-G. Aren‰Ûªt you Leonard Hofstadter?,9
44466,Leonard,8, Yeah.,9
44467,Dave,8," I saw you speak at Stanford with Sheldon Cooper. Amy, can you believe it? It‰Ûªs Dr. Leonard Hofstadter.",9
44468,Amy,8, No. Pinch me.,9
44469,Dave,8, It‰Ûªs an absolute pleasure to meet you. Can I shake your hand?,9
44470,Leonard,8," I don‰Ûªt know if you want to do that, I was just, okay, never mind.",9
44471,Dave,8," Amy, I‰Ûªm never washing this hand again.",9
44472,Leonard,8, You really should.,9
44473,Scene,8, The apartment.,9
44474,Raj,8, Sixty seconds. This is not looking good.,9
44475,Sheldon,8, One minute is a long time.,9
44476,Howard,8, I‰Ûªve been telling women that for 20 years.,9
44477,Raj,8, Forty-five.,9
44478,Sheldon,8," 45 seconds is plenty of time for a woman to walk through that door and fall in love with me. You know, probably half that if I break out the old cow eyes.",9
44479,Raj,8, Thirty seconds.,9
44480,Sheldon,8, Uh-oh. What if it‰Ûªs Jennifer Lawrence?,9
44481,Howard,8, What?,9
44482,Sheldon,8," Well, that last Hunger Games was not my cup of tea.",9
44483,Howard,8, You thought she was great in X-Men.,9
44484,Sheldon,8," Oh, fine, I won‰Ûªt shut my heart to the love of Jennifer Lawrence.",9
44485,Raj,8," Guys, fifteen seconds.",9
44486,Howard,8, Maybe she‰Ûªs waiting to show up at the last possible moment.,9
44487,Sheldon,8," Sounds like a drama queen. Oh, no. It is Jennifer Lawrence.",9
44488,Raj,8," Five, four, three, two, one. That‰Ûªs too bad.",9
44489,Howard,8, Maybe we did make the test too difficult.,9
44490,Raj,8," I don‰Ûªt think it matters. Look, Sheldon, I believe when the time is right for you to meet someone, it‰Ûªll just happen. Okay? Not because of a test or a Web site, but because‰Û_ (knock on door) we are the dreamers of dreams.",9
44491,Howard,8," It‰Ûªs an actual girl, and she‰Ûªs really pretty.",9
44492,Raj,8, Answer it.,9
44493,Sheldon,8, All right. Can I help you?,9
44494,Girl,8," Um, are you the physicist that placed the ad on Craigslist?",9
44495,Sheldon,8, Yes.,9
44496,Girl,8," Hi. I‰Ûªm Vanessa Bennett. Sorry it took a while for me to get here. I was stuck in this boring symposium on atomic spectroscopy when I came across your ad, and it saved my night. The puzzles were, were really fun. I‰Ûªve never had to translate Klingon into ancient Sanskrit before.",9
44497,Sheldon,8," Careful, it‰Ûªs addictive.",9
44498,Vanessa,8," Chija‰Ûe‰ÛªvlKub je. Or, as they say in Sanskrit, Ahm asman matey-bee ta-teyva.",9
44499,Sheldon,8," And just like that, you‰Ûªre a Klingon-Sanskrit junkie.",9
44500,Vanessa,8," Anyway, I, I just, I knew I had to meet the person responsible for such a brilliant idea. And I don‰Ûªt need to tell you, there aren‰Ûªt a lot of men who love physics, archaic languages and flags of the world.",9
44501,Sheldon,8," I am a bit of a unicorn. Well, you certainly seem like a special lady, uh, but as you know, you missed the deadline, so thanks for playing.",9
44502,Raj,8, How could you send her away?,9
44503,Sheldon,8," She was late. And she found atomic spectroscopy boring. Well, I wouldn‰Ûªt coitus her with your genitals.",9
44504,Scene,8, Amy‰Ûªs car.,9
44505,Dave,8," Uh, thanks for driving me home.",9
44506,Amy,8, No problem. I‰Ûªm really sorry about your car.,9
44507,Dave,8," Oh, it‰Ûªs all right. If you‰Ûªre free next weekend, I‰Ûªd love to take you out again.",9
44508,Amy,8," Um, listen, you‰Ûªre a really nice guy, but I just, I don‰Ûªt think this is working out.",9
44509,Dave,8, Oh. Okay.,9
44510,Amy,8," I‰Ûªm, I‰Ûªm really sorry.",9
44511,Dave,8," No, it‰Ûªs, at least the same woman that rejected Sheldon Cooper rejected me.",9
44512,Amy,8, There you go.,9
44513,Dave,8," If I ever do meet him, we‰Ûªll have that in common.",9
44514,Amy,8, Sure. Heh.,9
44515,Dave,8," And, he‰Ûªs kissed you and I‰Ûªve kissed you, so if you think about it‰Û_",9
44516,Amy,8," Okay, get out.",9
44517,Scene,9, The apartment.,9
44518,Raj,9, Have you guys seen this feature that lets you talk to Siri without pressing any buttons?,9
44519,Howard,9, No. How does it work?,9
44520,Raj,9," You just say, uh, Hey, Siri, what time is it?",9
44521,Howard,9," So now anyone can control your phone? Hey, Siri, show me pictures of naked grandma butts.",9
44522,Raj,9, Nice try. It only recognizes my voice.,9
44523,Howard,9," Oh. Cool. (In thick Indian accent) Hey, Siri, show me pictures of naked grandma butts.",9
44524,Raj,9, I don‰Ûªt sound like that.,9
44525,Siri,9, Here are some images of naked grandma butts.,9
44526,Sheldon,9," Hey. Good news, everybody. Now that I‰Ûªm no longer with Amy, I have an extra ticket to the annual Thanksgiving lunch buffet at the aquarium cafeteria. Who wants it? Well, you realize you won‰Ûªt be going alone, I‰Ûªll be there the whole time. Providing fish and pilgrim facts. Can you people hear me?",9
44527,Leonard,9," Well, we‰Ûªre having everyone over.",9
44528,Penny,9," Yeah, Leonard and I are gonna be cooking all day.",9
44529,Leonard,9, Otherwise we‰Ûªd love to.,9
44530,Penny,9, But we can‰Ûªt.,9
44531,Leonard,9," Yeah, poor us.",9
44532,Penny,9, Mm-hmm.,9
44533,Bernadette,9," And Raj and I are volunteering at the soup kitchen, feeding food to the homeless.",9
44534,Sheldon,9," Well, Howard, what about you?",9
44535,Howard,9," Oh, I can‰Ûªt. I‰Ûªm going to the soup kitchen, too.",9
44536,Bernadette,9, You said that sounded like the worst thing ever.,9
44537,Howard,9," If you can‰Ûªt support me when I‰Ûªm lying, why are we married?",9
44538,Scene,9, The apartment.,9
44539,Amy (on skype),9," Hi, Sheldon. What‰Ûªs up?",9
44540,Sheldon,9," Well, I‰Ûªm calling because Thanksgiving is coming up, and I wanted to offer you the aquarium tickets.",9
44541,Amy,9, No one can go with you?,9
44542,Sheldon,9," No. They‰Ûªd rather spend the holiday with each other than find out of this is the year I finally touch a starfish. Anyway, I wouldn‰Ûªt want the tickets to go to waste, so take whomever you‰Ûªd like.",9
44543,Amy,9, Oh. Okay. Thank you.,9
44544,Sheldon,9, And feel free to tell your guest that the Myanmar catfish is also known as the pilgrim fish. In case the turkey‰Ûªs dry and you need something juicy.,9
44545,Amy,9," Sheldon, I can tell you want to go, so if you‰Ûªd be comfortable with it, maybe we could go as friends.",9
44546,Sheldon,9, You don‰Ûªt think that will be awkward?,9
44547,Amy,9," Well it is Thanksgiving in an aquarium cafeteria, so I‰Ûªm gonna go out on a limb here and say yes. But if you mean between us, I think it‰Ûªll be fine.",9
44548,Sheldon,9," Very well, then. I‰Ûªll see you on Thanksgiving morning.",9
44549,Amy,9, See you then.,9
44550,Sheldon,9," Oh, and forget what I said about the Myanmar catfish. My list of marine-themed pilgrim facts is pretty short.",9
44551,Amy,9, Did you know they served shellfish and eel at the very first Thanksgiving?,9
44552,Sheldon,9, And there goes my list.,9
44553,Scene,9, Outside the soup kitchen.,9
44554,Emily,9," So, how does this work?",9
44555,Bernadette,9," The soup kitchen manager assigns the jobs, and the shifts are six hours.",9
44556,Howard,9," Six hours? Oh, God, I don‰Ûªt want to complain for that long.",9
44557,Raj,9, Do you ever do anything for anyone else?,9
44558,Howard,9, I happen to be a giving and generous lover.,9
44559,Emily,9, Are you and I close enough for me to say that‰Ûªs creepy?,9
44560,Bernadette,9," We are, and I believe the word you‰Ûªre looking for is yu-huh-huh-huh.",9
44561,Soup Kitchen Manager,9," Uh, can I help you?",9
44562,Bernadette,9, Hi. We‰Ûªd like to volunteer.,9
44563,Soup Kitchen Manager,9," Oh, I appreciate you guys coming down, but we already have enough people. Any other day, please, come back.",9
44564,Bernadette,9, Oh. Okay. Wipe that smug smile off your face.,9
44565,Howard,9, Maybe I‰Ûªm happy that so many people turned up to help the less fortunate.,9
44566,Emily,9, Are you and I close enough for me to say‰Û_,9
44567,Bernadette,9, That he‰Ûªs an ass? He beat you to it.,9
44568,Soup Kitchen Manager,9, I was wrong. A large group had to cancel.,9
44569,Bernadette,9," Oh, great. We‰Ûªd love to help.",9
44570,Howard,9, Wipe that smug smile off your face.,9
44571,Bernadette,9, I can‰Ûªt.,9
44572,Scene,9, The apartment.,9
44573,Penny,9, Look at us. Our first Thanksgiving as husband and wife.,9
44574,Leonard,9, I know. I feel so grown up.,9
44575,Penny,9," Sweetie, you are grown up.",9
44576,Leonard,9," Really? How many grown-ups do you know who have Mr. Spock oven mitts? Hey, the recipes are on my iPad. Will you pull ‰Ûªem up?",9
44577,Penny,9, Yep. What‰Ûªs the code?,9
44578,Leonard,9, My birthday.,9
44579,Penny,9, It‰Ûªs not working.,9
44580,Leonard,9," It‰Ûªs just the four digits, month and day.",9
44581,Penny,9, Nope.,9
44582,Leonard,9," Let me see. Yeah, there. What number were you putting in?",9
44583,Penny,9, Uh.,9
44584,Leonard,9," You don‰Ûªt know my birthday, do you?",9
44585,Penny,9," Yes, I do.",9
44586,Leonard,9," Well, what is it?",9
44587,Penny,9, May.,9
44588,Leonard,9, May what?,9
44589,Penny,9, I‰Ûªm not gonna say your password out loud. That is not secure.,9
44590,Leonard,9, You don‰Ûªt know your own husband‰Ûªs birthday.,9
44591,Penny,9," Well, you don‰Ûªt know everything about me.",9
44592,Leonard,9," Your birthday is December 2, you grew up on Perkins Street, the last four digits of your social are 7 6-2 1, and the odds of me letting you forget this are zero.",9
44593,Penny,9," Oh, look at us. Our last Thanksgiving as husband and wife.",9
44594,Scene,9, Amy‰Ûªs car.,9
44595,Sheldon,9, Hello.,9
44596,Amy,9, Hi. Ready for the aquarium?,9
44597,Sheldon,9," I am. You know, and in an effort to reduce awkwardness as we learn how to function as friends, I printed out a list of safe topics for polite conversation.",9
44598,Amy,9, If that makes you more comfortable.,9
44599,Sheldon,9," If there were a list of things that make me more comfortable, lists would be on the top of that list. Okay, now, oh, since last we spoke, have you acquired any pets?",9
44600,Amy,9, No. You?,9
44601,Sheldon,9," No. Um, since last we spoke, have you planned or gone on any vacations?",9
44602,Amy,9, I might go visit my aunt next week.,9
44603,Sheldon,9, Mm. Your aunt in Modesto?,9
44604,Amy,9," No, the one in Bakersfield.",9
44605,Sheldon,9, Bakersfield. I see. Where has this list been all my life?,9
44606,Scene,9, The soup kitchen.,9
44607,Soup Kitchen Manager,9," We‰Ûªre gonna have you washing dishes. Uh, aprons and rubber gloves are here, just scrape, wash and stack. If you need me, I‰Ûªll be around.",9
44608,Howard,9, So we don‰Ûªt even get to be up front where the action is?,9
44609,Bernadette,9, What difference does it make?,9
44610,Howard,9," I don‰Ûªt know. I was hoping some poor kid would come up to me and say, please, sir, I want some more.",9
44611,Raj,9," You‰Ûªre in a soup kitchen, not a production of Oliver!",9
44612,Howard,9, It‰Ûªs not like I‰Ûªm expecting them to sing.,9
44613,Scene,9, Amy‰Ûªs car. ,9
44614,Sheldon,9," and then the next day was 73 degrees, and the day after that was 72, and then it was 72 again, uh, then it was 74, and that brings us to today, at I‰Ûªd wear shorts if I had a pair. 78.",9
44615,Amy,9, Are we done discussing the weather?,9
44616,Sheldon,9," I don‰Ûªt know if I‰Ûªd call it discussing. You kind of sat back and let me do all the work. Let‰Ûªs see, what‰Ûªs next on the list. Oh, uh, do you whittle, and if so, what kind of knife do you use.",9
44617,Amy,9, Sheldon. We‰Ûªve known each other a long time. We are perfectly capable of having a conversation without relying on a list off the Internet.,9
44618,Sheldon,9," All right. Well, what should we talk about?",9
44619,Amy,9, I don‰Ûªt know. Just ask me whatever comes to mind.,9
44620,Sheldon,9, Very well. I know you‰Ûªve been seeing other men. Have you had coitus with any of them?,9
44621,Amy,9," Man, I walked right into that one.",9
44622,Scene,9, The apartment.,9
44623,Leonard,9," Next we need a teaspoon of pepper, which, I believe, was also the name of your childhood dog.",9
44624,Penny,9, Fine. You think you know so much. Who‰Ûªs my favourite Spice Girl?,9
44625,Leonard,9, Baby.,9
44626,Penny,9, Who‰Ûªs my favorite member of NSYNC?,9
44627,Leonard,9, Justin.,9
44628,Penny,9, Who‰Ûªs my favorite Backstreet Boy?,9
44629,Leonard,9, Nice try. NSYNC forever.,9
44630,Penny,9, Damn it.,9
44631,Leonard,9," Face it, you can‰Ûªt stump me. I am the king of husbands. I know that you don‰Ûªt like the lingerie that I got you on Valentine‰Ûªs Day. I know you hate the word moist. I know‰Û_",9
44632,Penny,9," Hang on. Wait, wait. Why don‰Ûªt I like the lingerie you got me?",9
44633,Leonard,9, Because it‰Ûªs orange and you think it makes you look like a slutty carrot.,9
44634,Penny,9, Interesting. I never told you that.,9
44635,Leonard,9, Sure you did.,9
44636,Penny,9, No. I never told anyone that. But I did write it in my journal.,9
44637,Leonard,9, What? I didn‰Ûªt know you had a journal.,9
44638,Penny,9, I also know your voice gets higher when you‰Ûªre lying.,9
44639,Leonard,9," No, it doesn‰Ûªt.",9
44640,Scene,9, The soup kitchen.,9
44641,Raj,9," You know, this reminds me of high school.",9
44642,Emily,9, You worked in a restaurant?,9
44643,Raj,9," No, I was in India, it was humid and smelled funny.",9
44644,Howard,9," All right, I think I‰Ûªm getting into a groove here. This isn‰Ûªt so bad.",9
44645,Emly,9, Only five hours and 40 minutes to go.,9
44646,Howard,9, We‰Ûªve only been doing this 20 minutes?,9
44647,Raj,9," You know, I read that washing dishes can be an excellent form of meditation. The key is that while washing the dishes one should only be washing the dishes.",9
44648,Howard,9, Just because you have that accent doesn‰Ûªt mean what you say isn‰Ûªt stupid.,9
44649,Raj,9," No, seriously. It‰Ûªs about being present in the moment, focusing on the feeling of the warm water, the smell of the detergent, the sound of the dishes squeaking, and following your own breath. It‰Ûªs about, it‰Ûªs about simply being.",9
44650,Howard,9," Huh. Okay, I‰Ûªll try it.",9
44651,Soup Kitchen Manager,9, I need three people out front.,9
44652,Bernadette,9, I‰Ûªll do it.,9
44653,Raj,9, Me.,9
44654,Emily,9, Right here!,9
44655,Howard,9," No fair, I was meditating.",9
44656,Scene,9, The apartment. ,9
44657,Leonard,9," Come on, don‰Ûªt be mad. It was a long time ago, and it was an accident.",9
44658,Penny,9, How can reading my journal be an accident?,9
44659,Leonard,9, I didn‰Ûªt even know what it was. I saw it on your nightstand. I picked it up.,9
44660,Penny,9," Well, when you realized what it was, why didn‰Ûªt you stop?",9
44661,Leonard,9," You know me, I‰Ûªm a big ol‰Ûª bookworm.",9
44662,Penny,9, All right. Let‰Ûªs just finish cooking.,9
44663,Leonard,9," Well, hey, okay. Let me make this up to you. Sometimes I keep an online journal. I want you to read something that I wrote.",9
44664,Penny,9," Okay, really, I‰Ûªm fine.",9
44665,Leonard,9," Okay. Well, then I‰Ûªll read it to you. It‰Ûªs from the day we first met. Beauty, thy name is Penny.",9
44666,Penny,9," Oh, God. Stop. I don‰Ûªt want you to read something you think‰Ûªll just butter me up. I want to hear the most recent thing you wrote.",9
44667,Leonard,9," Fine. Mmm, Penny‰Ûªs beauty, like our love, grows more with each passing day.‰Û",9
44668,Penny,9, Does it really say that?,9
44669,Leonard,9, Why would I lie?,9
44670,Penny,9, OMG. OMG. We‰Ûªre so close to the new Star Wars. I can‰Ûªt take it. Gah. Gah?,9
44671,Leonard,9," Well, you didn‰Ûªt read it right. The new Star Wars is coming. Gah.",9
44672,Scene,9, Amy‰Ûªs car.,9
44673,Sheldon,9, I‰Ûªm sensing things have gotten awkward.,9
44674,Amy,9," No. It‰Ûªs okay. If we‰Ûªre friends, we should be able to talk about anything.",9
44675,Sheldon,9, All right.,9
44676,Amy,9," So, you had some questions about me seeing other people.",9
44677,Sheldon,9, Just a few.,9
44678,Amy,9, Go ahead.,9
44679,Sheldon,9, How many dates have you been on? Who were they with? Where‰Ûªd you go? Where did you meet them? Did you sleep with them? And how much longer to the aquarium? I‰Ûªm getting kind of hungry.,9
44680,Amy,9, Let‰Ûªs see. I have been on six dates with three different people. It was either for coffee or dinner. One I met at a bookstore and two I met online. I haven‰Ûªt slept with anyone. The aquarium is 40 minutes away. And there‰Ûªs a baggie of Cheerios for you in the glove compartment.,9
44681,Sheldon,9, Is that regular or honey nut?,9
44682,Amy,9, I mixed them.,9
44683,Sheldon,9, You mixed them. No wonder gentleman callers are pounding down your door. Do you have any questions for me?,9
44684,Amy,9, Just one. Are you doing okay?,9
44685,Sheldon,9, I am.,9
44686,Amy,9, Good. I want you to be happy.,9
44687,Sheldon,9, I believe you. I‰Ûªd believe you more if you threw a few Apple Jacks in here.,9
44688,Scene,9, The soup kitchen.,9
44689,Man,9, Here you go.,9
44690,Howard,9, Thanks. You got to be kidding me.,9
44691,Man,9, Sorry?,9
44692,Howard,9," Y, you‰Ûªre Elon Musk.",9
44693,Elon,9, I am.,9
44694,Howard,9," Wh, what are you doing here?",9
44695,Elon,9," I‰Ûªm washing dishes. Well, I was on the turkey line, but I got demoted for being too generous with the gravy.",9
44696,Howard,9," Oh, man. I, what an honour to meet you. I‰Ûªm, I‰Ûªm such a fan of Tesla and SpaceX. All your companies. Howard Wolowitz, Caltech.",9
44697,Elon,9," Nice to meet you, Howard. Feels great to come down here and help the less fortunate, huh?",9
44698,Howard,9," Oh, yeah. Nothing better than helping people. Which is something I realized when I was viewing Earth from the deck of the International Space Station, where I spent two months as a payload specialist, a job I was qualified for because I‰Ûªm an MIT-trained engineer.",9
44699,Elon,9, And I thought I ladled the gravy on thick.,9
44700,Howard,9," Sorry. It‰Ûªs just, you‰Ûªre you, you know? And I really want you to adopt me.",9
44701,Elon,9," Well, you‰Ûªre here on Thanksgiving, so you‰Ûªre probably a good person.",9
44702,Howard,9," Oh. I made my wife come down, too.",9
44703,Elon,9, You think you might ever get back out to space?,9
44704,Howard,9, Is that a job offer? ‰Û÷Cause I really want to go to Mars. Assuming I can bring my wife. She hardly takes up any room. She‰Ûªs basically a carry-on.,9
44705,Elon,9," Well, we‰Ûªre not quite there yet, but we‰Ûªre always looking for engineers. So let me give you my e-mail. We can stay in touch.",9
44706,Howard,9, Thank you.,9
44707,Elon,9," Oh, look. Someone hardly touched their pumpkin pie. Want to share it with me?",9
44708,Howard,9," A partially eaten piece of pumpkin pie from a homeless shelter? With Elon Musk, you bet I do.",9
44709,Scene,9, The aquarium. ,9
44710,Sheldon,9," You know, for a Thanksgiving buffet in an aquarium cafeteria, that was really bad.",9
44711,Amy,9, You‰Ûªre just upset ‰Ûªcause they ran out of Pilgrim hats.,9
44712,Sheldon,9, They gave one to that baby. He wasn‰Ûªt even awake.,9
44713,Amy,9," Well, it wouldn‰Ûªt be a holiday without you being mad at a baby.",9
44714,Sheldon,9, Oh. Would you care to play an ocean-themed game I invented?,9
44715,Amy,9, Sure. What is it?,9
44716,Sheldon,9," It‰Ûªs called Food, Friend, Fight. One of us chooses three aquatic creatures, and the other one must decide which he would eat, befriend, or battle.",9
44717,Amy,9," So it‰Ûªs like Kiss, Marry, Kill.",9
44718,Sheldon,9, What is that?,9
44719,Amy,9," It‰Ûªs a game where you‰Ûªre given three people and you choose which one you‰Ûªd kiss, marry, or kill.",9
44720,Sheldon,9," Well, my game is better, ‰Ûªcause instead of marrying someone, you get to eat them.",9
44721,Amy,9, Let‰Ûªs just play.,9
44722,Sheldon,9," I‰Ûªll start you off easy. Electric eel, pufferfish, shrimp.",9
44723,Amy,9," Hmm. Well, I wouldn‰Ûªt fight the eel, because I know it can generate enough current to kill a horse. So I‰Ûªd eat the eel, fight the shrimp, and befriend the pufferfish, because it would be nice to have company on those days I feel bloated.",9
44724,Sheldon,9, Very well done.,9
44725,Amy,9," Thank you. Okay, your turn. Hmm. Seal, hagfish, SpongeBob SquarePants.",9
44726,Sheldon,9," Well, I‰Ûªd befriend SpongeBob but he‰Ûªs not real, so I can‰Ûªt do that, can I?",9
44727,Amy,9, But you can pal around with a hagfish?,9
44728,Sheldon,9," Hey, let‰Ûªs not pull at that thread. Okay. I‰Ûªll fight SpongeBob, because he‰Ûªs so friendly we‰Ûªll just end up tickling each other. Um, I‰Ûªll befriend the seal, because he‰Ûªs trainable, which is the problem I‰Ûªm having with my current friends. Which means I‰Ûªll have to eat the hagfish.",9
44729,Amy,9," Isn‰Ûªt that gross? I mean, a hagfish can produce enough mucus to fill a bucket in a minute.",9
44730,Sheldon,9," I know. It makes its own gravy, it‰Ûªll slide right down.",9
44731,Amy,9, I miss this.,9
44732,Sheldon,9," How can you miss a game you‰Ûªve never played before, silly?",9
44733,Amy,9, I guess sometimes I‰Ûªm silly.,9
44734,Scene,9, The apartment. ,9
44735,Penny,9, Hey. Where‰Ûªd you go? I can‰Ûªt tell if the turkey‰Ûªs done.,9
44736,Leonard,9," Be right there. Hi, lover.",9
44737,Penny,9, What are you doing?,9
44738,Leonard,9, I‰Ûªm sorry about the journal. I want to make it up to you. So I‰Ûªm gonna let you post a shame photo of me on Facebook.,9
44739,Penny,9, I am not putting that on the Internet. I don‰Ûªt want people to see this. I don‰Ûªt want to see it.,9
44740,Leonard,9," Don‰Ûªt want people to see what, huh? A little bit of this?",9
44741,Penny,9, Oh.,9
44742,Leonard,9," Huh? Some of this? And, since it‰Ûªs Thanksgiving, an extra helping of this?",9
44743,Bernadette,9, Happy Thanks‰Û_ Yikes.,9
44744,Scene,9, The apartment.,9
44745,Leonard,9, I‰Ûªm glad you had a nice time with Amy.,9
44746,Sheldon,9," Me, too. It‰Ûªs comforting to know that she and I are able to function as friends.",9
44747,Penny,9," Well, I‰Ûªve never been friends with any of my exes.",9
44748,Sheldon,9," Oh, I‰Ûªm sure you and Leonard will be able to pull it off. (Phone rings) Oh. It‰Ûªs my friend Amy. Hello.",9
44749,Amy,9," Hi, Sheldon. I‰Ûªm just driving home from my mother‰Ûªs.",9
44750,Sheldon,9, Did you have a nice time?,9
44751,Amy,9," I did. Um, listen, I really enjoyed spending this morning with you.",9
44752,Sheldon,9," Well, I can‰Ûªt take all the credit. It was pretty funny when that one anchovy started going the wrong way.",9
44753,Amy,9," It was. Uh, listen, I, I was thinking that, um, maybe I‰Ûªm ready to be your girlfriend again.",9
44754,Sheldon,9, Oh. I thought we were just friends.,9
44755,Amy,9," We are. But I was hoping, maybe‰Û_",9
44756,Sheldon,9," Amy, I excel at many things, but getting over you wasn‰Ûªt one of them. I think I need to just be your friend.",9
44757,Amy,9, Okay. I understand.,9
44758,Sheldon,9," Good. Oh, I watched a video of the hagfish producing mucus, so I‰Ûªm gonna change my answer and eat SpongeBob.",9
44759,Amy,9, Okay. Sure.,9
44760,Scene,10, Sheldon‰Ûªs bedroom.,9
44761,Scene,10, The apartment. 2 days earlier.,9
44762,Leonard,10, Since when do you hum songs?,9
44763,Sheldon,10, What are you talking about?,9
44764,Leonard,10, You were just humming.,9
44765,Sheldon,10," Are you sure? Sometimes when my brain really gets moving, it makes noise.",9
44766,Leonard,10, How does your brain feel about calculating the surface tension of the domain walls?,9
44767,Sheldon,10," Let‰Ûªs see. Hey, I was humming. One point for Hufflepuff. What song is that?",9
44768,Leonard,10," Well, hum it again. Is that the SpongeBob song?",9
44769,Sheldon (singing),10, Who lives in a pineapple. Nope.,9
44770,Leonard,10, Whatever. Can we just get back to this?,9
44771,Sheldon,10," I feel like I know what song that is, but I can‰Ûªt put my finger on it. (Singing) My country, ‰Ûªtis of thee. No.",9
44772,Leonard,10, It‰Ûªs just an earworm. It‰Ûªll come to you.,9
44773,Sheldon,10, Okay. (Singing) R-E-S-P-E-C-T. No.,9
44774,Leonard,10, Is this what we‰Ûªre doing the rest of the night?,9
44775,Sheldon (singing),10, I‰Ûªm surprised you have to ask.,9
44776,Scene,10, The apartment.,9
44777,Sheldon (on phone),10," Hello, yes, I was hoping you could help me. What song is this? La, la, la, la, la, la, la. You don‰Ûªt know? Well, how dare you call yourselves a Rock and Roll Hall of Fame? My goodness. Do you sing along to the greatest hits of Elvis Presley with that mouth? Well, they were no help at all.",9
44778,Leonard,10," Which is crazy, since rock and roll is all about good customer service.",9
44779,Penny,10, Yeah. So you have a song stuck in your head. It happens to everybody.,9
44780,Sheldon,10," Well, I‰Ûªm not everybody. I have an eidetic memory. I should be able to remember what song this is, but I can‰Ûªt. Something‰Ûªs wrong with me.",9
44781,Penny,10," I told you if we were patient, he‰Ûªd figure it out for himself.",9
44782,Sheldon,10," I was always afraid this day would come. This might be the first step of my descent into madness, where I gradually test the limits of public nudity.",9
44783,Penny,10, Public nudity?,9
44784,Leonard,10," Eh, that just means going barefoot.",9
44785,Scene,10, Amy‰Ûªs apartment.,9
44786,Dave (voice on phone),10, Hello?,9
44787,Amy,10," Hi, Dave. Uh, it‰Ûªs Amy.",9
44788,Dave,10, Oh. How are you?,9
44789,Amy,10, I‰Ûªm fine. How are you?,9
44790,Dave,10," Terrific. And pleasantly surprised to hear from you, given how I acted on our last date.",9
44791,Amy,10," Yeah, well, we both made mistakes, you know. I took the last breadstick, you gushed over my ex-boyfriend like he was Leonard Nimoy and you were my ex-boyfriend.",9
44792,Dave,10," So, to what do I owe the pleasure?",9
44793,Amy,10," Well, I was wondering if you‰Ûªd like to get dinner again sometime.",9
44794,Dave,10," Yes, please.",9
44795,Amy,10, Great.,9
44796,Dave,10," Let me just check my schedule, he said, trying to seem like a man with things on his schedule.",9
44797,Amy,10, How ‰Ûªbout Saturday?,9
44798,Dave,10," Uh, hmm, let me see. Uh, Friday, farmers‰Ûª market with Jay Z. Sunday, piano shopping with Elton John. Saturday works.",9
44799,Scene,10, Howard‰Ûªs workshop.,9
44800,Raj,10," Oh. Did you know, at the United Nations, there‰Ûªs a Department for Outer Space Affairs?",9
44801,Howard,10, Really? Why?,9
44802,Raj,10, They exist in case we ever make contact with an alien civilization.,9
44803,Howard,10," Mm, boy, that‰Ûªs one of those jobs that‰Ûªs boring, boring, boring, then, oh, God, where‰Ûªs the memo with what we do now?",9
44804,Raj,10," Oh, this is cool. So, a few weeks ago I set up a fan page on Facebook for our band and‰Û_",9
44805,Howard,10, Wait a second. How could you do that without consulting me?,9
44806,Raj,10," It‰Ûªs not a big deal. It just took, like, five minutes to set up.",9
44807,Howard,10," That‰Ûªs not the point. When we created Footprints on the Moon, we agreed that every band decision would be mutual. Now you‰Ûªre just trying to take over the whole thing. You know, maybe I should go solo.",9
44808,Raj,10, But someone joined our page. We have an actual fan.,9
44809,Howard,10," All right. This thing‰Ûªs bigger than you and me, band‰Ûªs back together.",9
44810,Raj,10," So, listen to what he wrote. Uh, I saw you play at the comic book store. You guys rock. And then there‰Ûªs an animated smiley face raising the roof like this.",9
44811,Howard,10, We did raise the roof that night.,9
44812,Raj,10," Yeah, we totally did.",9
44813,Howard,10, Why do rock stars do drugs when this feels so great?,9
44814,Scene,10, The apartment.,9
44815,Sheldon (singing),10, Why can‰Ûªt I recall this song? This is taking far too long. The urge to bang my head against the wall again and again and again and again and again is strong.,9
44816,Leonard,10, Put on some headphones.,9
44817,Sheldon (singing),10, No they make my earlobes sweat.,9
44818,Penny,10," Hey, sweetie, why don‰Ûªt you take a break and do something else for a while?",9
44819,Sheldon,10, There was a project I‰Ûªve been thinking about starting.,9
44820,Penny,10," Okay, great. What is it?",9
44821,Sheldon,10," I‰Ûªll show you. (Into phone camera) Dear Crazy Future Sheldon, you were driven mad by an earworm. Your mind, once your most trusted asset, is now a sack of parrots and monkeys. So, I‰Ûªm going to tell you everything you need to know. Uh, first, music is dangerous. The movie Footloose tried to warn us, but we wouldn‰Ûªt listen. Oh, wait. (Singing) Everyody cut footloose. Nope.",9
44822,Penny,10, I‰Ûªll pay a thousand dollars to watch you cut footloose.,9
44823,Sheldon,10," This is Penny. She is your friend. If she offers you food, it‰Ûªs safe to take it. You probably paid for it, anyway.",9
44824,Scene,10, Amy‰Ûªs apartment.,9
44825,Bernadette,10," So, you‰Ûªre really going out with Dave again?",9
44826,Amy,10, Why not? He‰Ûªs actually a very nice guy.,9
44827,Bernadette,10, But he spent an entire date talking about how much he loves Sheldon.,9
44828,Amy,10," That‰Ûªs nothing Sheldon hasn‰Ûªt done before. Dave‰Ûªs just a big fan of his work. Besides, he said he wouldn‰Ûªt bring it up again.",9
44829,Bernadette,10, Okay. So where‰Ûªs he taking you?,9
44830,Amy,10," Oh, he‰Ûªs coming here. I‰Ûªm actually making dinner.",9
44831,Bernadette,10, Oh. That‰Ûªs a big step.,9
44832,Amy,10, It is?,9
44833,Bernadette,10, Yeah. You‰Ûªre inviting him into your home. It‰Ûªs intimate. It‰Ûªs where your underpants live.,9
44834,Amy,10," You know what? Good. I tried to get back together with Sheldon, he shot me down. Dave likes me. Maybe intimate is what I need.",9
44835,Bernadette,10, You sure? You‰Ûªve never really been with a man. Do you really want to start with one that‰Ûªs six-foot-seven?,9
44836,Amy,10, Why not?,9
44837,Bernadette,10, ‰Û÷Cause it‰Ûªs like taking your driver‰Ûªs test in a bus.,9
44838,Scene,10, Howard‰Ûªs workshop.,9
44839,Raj,10, Maybe we should post a comment back to our fan and thank him.,9
44840,Howard,10, What should we write?,9
44841,Raj,10," How about, uh, oh, how about, we might be Footprints on the Moon, but your kind words sent us over the moon.",9
44842,Howard,10, Someday you‰Ûªre gonna make an amazing grandma.,9
44843,Raj,10, Well what do you want to write?,9
44844,Howard,10," Something badass, you know, like, thanks for diggin‰Ûª our vibe. We‰Ûªll keep rockin‰Ûª if you keep rollin‰Ûª.",9
44845,Raj,10," Dude, if I was wearing a bra, I‰Ûªd throw it at your head right now.",9
44846,Howard,10, I‰Ûªll keep rockin‰Ûª. You don‰Ûªt do that.,9
44847,Raj,10, Okay. I posted it.,9
44848,Howard,10," So, who is this guy?",9
44849,Raj,10," Let‰Ûªs see. Uh, his name is Trent Monaco.",9
44850,Howard,10, Cool name.,9
44851,Raj,10," Yeah. He‰Ûªs 24. He‰Ûªs a deejay. He brews his own beer. He‰Ûªs got awesome tattoos. Dude, he‰Ûªs got a hot girlfriend, too.",9
44852,Howard,10," Damn. I don‰Ûªt know if he‰Ûªs our biggest fan or I‰Ûªm his. Hey, Trent just liked our comment.",9
44853,Raj,10," He is so cool. Hey, no hard feelings, but I‰Ûªm throwing my hypothetical bra at him.",9
44854,Scene,10, Leonard‰Ûªs bedroom. Sheldon is playing his tune on a keyboard in the background.,9
44855,Penny,10," Oh, my God, he won‰Ûªt stop.",9
44856,Leonard,10, How does he keep coming up with new ways to be annoying?,9
44857,Penny,10, Nobody knows. That‰Ûªs why he‰Ûªs number one. Can you please go talk to him?,9
44858,Leonard,10, Come on. I take care of him all day long. You do it for once.,9
44859,Penny,10, Once? Who got the gum out of his hair?,9
44860,Leonard,10," What do you want, a medal? It was your gum.",9
44861,Penny,10, Fine.,9
44862,Leonard,10, I love you.,9
44863,Penny,10, Who cares?,9
44864,Sheldon (off),10, What are you doing in my room? Stop it. That‰Ûªs mine. Why are you so strong?,9
44865,Penny,10, Problem solved.,9
44866,Leonard,10," Oh, yeah, he got a tuba.",9
44867,Scene,10, The apartment.,9
44868,Sheldon,10," Dear Crazy Future Sheldon, this is a thermostat. It controls the temperature of the apartment. The ideal setting is 72 degrees. If you find this too cold, then put on a jacket. A straitjacket, ‰Ûªcause 72‰Ûªs the best and you‰Ûªre crazy. Now, this is your spot. You‰Ûªre very protective of it. When anyone else tries to sit here, you berate them relentlessly. It sounds mean, but somehow you make it adorable. People are also delighted by your love of pranks. For example, Leonard has no idea what I did to his coffee. It wasn‰Ûªt replace it with Folger‰Ûªs crystals, I‰Ûªll tell you that much.",9
44869,Leonard,10," Hey, can we please get back to work?",9
44870,Sheldon,10, This is Leonard. He‰Ûªs your best friend in the world.,9
44871,Leonard,10," All right, just stop. This is ridiculous.",9
44872,Sheldon,10," Sometimes he gets cranky, but you can trust him with your life. And he does more things for you than I can even begin to list.",9
44873,Leonard,10, Thank you.,9
44874,Sheldon,10," Oh, no, he‰Ûªs drinking it.",9
44875,Scene,10, Howard and Bernadette‰Ûªs house.,9
44876,Howard,10, Look at this. Trent is rebuilding a vintage motorcycle.,9
44877,Raj,10, That is so cool. Old broken things are so much better than new things that work.,9
44878,Bernadette,10, Who‰Ûªs Trent?,9
44879,Howard,10," Oh, he‰Ûªs our fan.",9
44880,Bernadette,10, Fan of what?,9
44881,Howard,10," Uh, did you forget? We‰Ûªre in a band.",9
44882,Bernadette,10, You mean because you played one time in the comic book store?,9
44883,Howard,10, And at the children‰Ûªs hospital until they asked us to leave.,9
44884,Raj,10," Hey, dude, Trent just checked in at the coffee shop on Fair Oaks.",9
44885,Howard,10, Really? You want to go down there and meet him?,9
44886,Bernadette,10, Are you stalking him? That‰Ûªs creepy.,9
44887,Raj,10," It‰Ûªs not creepy. I built a Footprints on the Moon fan page, Trent joined it.",9
44888,Howard,10," After that, all I did was check out his profile, go back in the archive of his feed until I found his Twitter handle.",9
44889,Raj,10," From there, it was easy to find him on Instagram, Snapchat and pretty much track his every movement.",9
44890,Howard,10," So if you think that‰Ûªs creepy, you married the wrong guy.",9
44891,Bernadette,10, Maybe I should marry Trent.,9
44892,Raj,10," Yeah, like she could get Trent.",9
44893,Scene,10, Amy‰Ûªs apartment.,9
44894,Dave,10, This is delicious.,9
44895,Amy,10, Thank you.,9
44896,Dave,10, Been a long time since I had a home-cooked meal.,9
44897,Amy,10," When you were married, did your wife cook?",9
44898,Dave,10," Not at first, no. But when she began cheating on me with a French chef, she became quite the wiz in the kitchen.",9
44899,Amy,10," So, a little silver lining.",9
44900,Dave,10," I suppose. Yeah. Nothing takes the sting out of a shattered life like a properly-seasoned bowl of onion soup. How long have you, uh, lived here?",9
44901,Amy,10," Uh, about five years. I‰Ûªm actually thinking of moving to a better place now that I don‰Ûªt need to be so close to, well, you know.",9
44902,Dave,10," I do. The brilliant physicist that I now know lives in the area, not that I care.",9
44903,Amy,10," Yeah. Anyway, he doesn‰Ûªt drive, so, I pretty much had to take him everywhere.",9
44904,Dave,10, Had to or got to? Sorry.,9
44905,Amy,10, My fault. I brought him up.,9
44906,Dave,10," Yeah. Well, let‰Ûªs change the subject. No more mentions of you-know-who. That‰Ûªs a cool train. Where did you get that?",9
44907,Scene,10, The apartment.,9
44908,Sheldon,10," Bah, bam, bum-bum, bah, bum, bum. This song is never going to stop. Have you ever dealt with something so relentlessly irritating?",9
44909,Leonard,10," That‰Ûªs a trick question, right?",9
44910,Sheldon,10," Well, I shouldn‰Ûªt be surprised. There‰Ûªs a rich history of brilliant minds descending into madness.",9
44911,Penny,10," Come on, Sheldon. There are plenty of smart people who don‰Ûªt have mental problems.",9
44912,Leonard,10," Yup, she‰Ûªs right. For every Newton who had a psychological issue, there‰Ûªs an Edison who was just a jerk. That could totally be you.",9
44913,Sheldon,10, Empedocles thought he was a god and jumped into a volcano. And Pythagoras had an irrational fear of beans. Tesla fell madly in love with a pigeon who he claimed loved him back.,9
44914,Penny,10, Maybe he just had bread in his pocket.,9
44915,Sheldon,10," The list extends outside of science. Painters like Van Gogh and Pollock, chess champion Bobby Fischer, Brian Wilson of the Beach Boys. (Clip of Darling by the Beach Boys) I remember the song. It‰Ûªs called Darlin‰Ûª by the Beach Boys. Oh, thank goodness. I‰Ûªm not crazy. I don‰Ûªt have to take a pigeon as my bride.",9
44916,Leonard,10, There goes our shot at him living on the roof.,9
44917,Scene,10, A coffee shop.,9
44918,Raj,10," So, all right, there he is. So, should we introduce ourselves?",9
44919,Howard,10, No. Let him spot us.,9
44920,Raj,10, I wonder if he‰Ûªs listening to our music right now.,9
44921,Howard,10," Could you imagine? What a cool way for us to meet. He‰Ûªs playing our song and looks up, and there we are, his favorite two-piece acoustic sci-fi novelty rock band.",9
44922,Raj,10," And he‰Ûªs, all, like, aren‰Ûªt you the guys from Footprints on the Moo-oo-ooh what is he doing?!",9
44923,Howard,10, I can‰Ûªt watch.,9
44924,Raj,10," It‰Ûªs okay. Oh, it‰Ûªs okay. He‰Ûªs done.",9
44925,Howard,10, Why is he looking at it?,9
44926,Raj,10," Eh, no, he‰Ûªs not going to eat it, is he?",9
44927,Howard,10," Come on, Trent, you‰Ûªre better than th-ah.",9
44928,Raj,10, Ooh!,9
44929,Howard,10, Let‰Ûªs just go.,9
44930,Trent,10," Hey, aren‰Ûªt you the guys?",9
44931,Howard,10, Nope.,9
44932,Raj,10," No, never heard of ‰Ûªem!",9
44933,Scene,10, The apartment. Sheldon is listening to Darlin‰Ûª,9
44934,Sheldon,10, I wonder why it was this particular song that was stuck in my head.,9
44935,Leonard,10, I don‰Ûªt know. It‰Ûªs pretty catchy.,9
44936,Penny,10, Do you even like the Beach Boys?,9
44937,Sheldon,10, They have beach right in the name. What do you think?,9
44938,Leonard,10," Well, now that you can focus again, what do you say we get back to surface tension of domain walls?",9
44939,Sheldon,10, Of course. I‰Ûªm already seeing a more efficient way of taming the ultravi‰Û_ I know why the song was in my head.,9
44940,Penny,10, Why?,9
44941,Sheldon,10, It‰Ûªs about Amy.,9
44942,Penny,10," Okay, look, I know Amy‰Ûªs like an old lady, but she‰Ûªs not old enough to have a song from the sixties written about her.",9
44943,Sheldon,10," It‰Ûªs about how she made my life better. Consider the lyrics. I was living like half a man. Then I couldn‰Ûªt love, but now I can. More soul than I ever had. I love the way you soften my life.‰Û",9
44944,Penny,10," She did soften your life, didn‰Ûªt she?",9
44945,Sheldon,10, Yes. She‰Ûªs like the dryer sheets of my heart. I have to go.,9
44946,Leonard,10, Aw. Am I like the dryer sheets of your heart?,9
44947,Penny,10, Better. You‰Ûªre the lint trap of my love.,9
44948,Leonard,10, Aw.,9
44949,Scene,10, Amy‰Ûªs apartment.,9
44950,Amy,10, That‰Ûªs an interesting tie clip.,9
44951,Dave,10," Oh, thanks. It‰Ûªs, uh, Avogadro‰Ûªs constant. It‰Ûªs useful for calculating the number of atoms in a substance, or causing regret in anyone who asks about it.",9
44952,Amy,10," No, I, I think it‰Ûªs neat. Oh.",9
44953,Dave,10," Sorry. Sorry. No one‰Ûªs ever liked the tie clip before, so I just lost all control.",9
44954,Amy,10," No, it, it‰Ûªs okay, and we are on a date. I‰Ûªm, I‰Ûªm just a little nervous.",9
44955,Dave,10," Well, no need to be nervous with me. I‰Ûªm just a harmless giant from a foreign land.",9
44956,Amy,10," You know, I‰Ûªm just being silly. I, I don‰Ûªt know what I‰Ûªm waiting for.",9
44957,Sheldon,10," (Knock, knock, knock) Amy? (Knock, knock, knock) Amy? (Knock, knock, knock) Amy?",9
44958,Amy,10, That‰Ûªs Sheldon.,9
44959,Dave,10, You‰Ûªre kidding. How‰Ûªs my hair?,9
44960,Amy,10," Sheldon, this, this isn‰Ûªt a good time.",9
44961,Sheldon,10," I don‰Ûªt care. Amy, there was a song I couldn‰Ûªt get out of my head. Eventually, I realized the song was about you, and like that earworm, I can‰Ûªt get you out of my heart. So, what I‰Ûªm trying to say is, you‰Ûªre my heartworm. The metaphorical kind, not, not the poodle-killing kind.",9
44962,Amy,10, What?,9
44963,Dave,10," If I may, I believe what he‰Ûªs saying, in a charming and delightful way, is that he loves you and wants you back. Dave Gibbs, huge fan of your work. Don‰Ûªt mind me.",9
44964,Sheldon,10," I‰Ûªm, I‰Ûªm sorry; I didn‰Ûªt realize you were on a date.",9
44965,Amy,10," No, it, it, it‰Ûªs okay. Keep going?",9
44966,Sheldon,10," Amy, if you want to be my girlfriend again, I really want to be your boyfriend.",9
44967,Amy,10," I really want that, too.",9
44968,Sheldon,10, Good. Because I love you.,9
44969,Amy,10," I love you, too.",9
44970,Dave,10," Kiss her, you brilliant fool.",9
44971,Sheldon,10," Well, I‰Ûªll let you get back to your date.",9
44972,Amy,10, Get back here.,9
44973,Dave,10," Okay, then. I‰Ûªll, uh, see myself out. Amy, thank you for dinner. Dr. Cooper, pleasure to meet you, sir. Uh, if perhaps sometime you have a spare moment, I‰Ûªd, uh, love to discuss physics, or shoot the breeze, as you Yanks say. Ah. What a lovely evening.",9

45003,Leonard,11, I think Penny has a point. You can see it another day.,9

45039,Sheldon,11, Hello.,9
45040,Leonard,11, Hey. We‰Ûªre going to the comic book store. You want to come?,9
45041,Sheldon,11," No, I can‰Ûªt. I need to make preparations for Amy‰Ûªs birthday. Which leads me to the following bit of business. This is my ticket to Star Wars. I don‰Ûªt have to tell you it is worth far more than its face value of fifteen dollars and fifty cents. I trust you‰Ûªll give it to someone worthy.",9

45054,Penny,11, We‰Ûªre sorry. What do you need?,9
45055,Sheldon,11," Well, as you know, I‰Ûªll be celebrating Amy‰Ûªs birthday with her, and I could use your assistance in helping me select the perfect gift.",9
45056,Bernadette,11, Sure.,9
45057,Sheldon,11," Well, so far, I‰Ûªve come up with three ideas. The first is a chance for her to play the harp with the L.A. Philharmonic.",9
45058,Penny,11, Wow. You can really arrange that?,9
45059,Sheldon,11," Well, I said a chance, you know. When you tell them it‰Ûªs your birthday at Bennigan‰Ûªs, they make a fuss. I don‰Ûªt see why the Philharmonic would be any different.",9
45060,Bernadette,11, How about something a little more realistic?,9
45061,Sheldon,11," Well, Amy enjoys knitting her own sweaters, so I was thinking of getting her an all-expense-paid trip to the Wisconsin Sheep and Wool Festival.",9
45062,Penny,11, Sorry. I was waiting for the bazinga.,9
45063,Bernadette,11," Hold on. It could be romantic. The two of them away together, keeping each other warm in snowy Wisconsin.",9
45064,Sheldon,11," No, no, no, no. She‰Ûªd be going alone. Well, if you think I‰Ûªm afraid of birds, you should see me around sheep.",9
45065,Penny,11," Okay, well, what‰Ûªs the third option?",9
45066,Sheldon,11, That I have coitus with her.,9
45067,Scene,11, The comic book store. ,9
45068,Leonard,11, What do you think about giving Sheldon‰Ûªs ticket to Stuart?,9
45069,Raj,11, I don‰Ûªt know. Have you ever seen a movie with Stuart before?,9
45070,Howard,11," It‰Ûªs like going with your grandpa. Instead of eating popcorn, he brings little pieces of chicken in Tupperware and a thermos full of soup.",9
45071,Leonard,11," He‰Ûªs not that bad. Hey, Stuart, got any plans Thursday night?",9
45072,Stuart,11," My, uh, my doctor‰Ûªs worried about my circulation, so I was thinking about walking around the mall. Why?",9
45073,Leonard,11, Well‰Û_,9
45074,Wil Wheaton,11," Hey, you guys.",9
45075,Howard,11," Oh, make sure to wear sensible shoes. Wil, want to go to Star Wars Thursday?",9
45076,Wil,11, Absolutely.,9
45077,Stuart,11," Fine, take Wil. See if he brings you clam chowder.",9
45078,Scene,11, Penny‰Ûªs apartment. ,9
45079,Penny,11," Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay. Let‰Ûªs, let‰Ûªs, let‰Ûªs just recap our options. All right, we‰Ûªve got harp thing, sheep thing.",9
45080,Bernadette,11, Wild thang.,9
45081,Sheldon,11," Which do you think she‰Ûªd prefer? Because I checked the Sheep and Wool Festival Web site, and there‰Ûªs only 8,000 tickets left.",9
45082,Penny,11," Sheldon, being physical with Amy is a huge step for you.",9
45083,Bernadette,11," Yeah, are you ready for this?",9
45084,Sheldon,11," Intimacy in any form has been challenging for me, but I‰Ûªd like to show her how important she is, and it feels like now might be the right time.",9
45085,Penny,11," Sheldon, that‰Ûªs so beautiful.",9
45086,Sheldon,11, Then it‰Ûªs settled. Amy‰Ûªs birthday present will be my genitals.,9
45087,Scene,11, The stairwell. ,9
45088,Amy,11, Thanks for taking me out.,9
45089,Penny,11," Well, you‰Ûªre spending your birthday with Sheldon. Why not celebrate early?",9
45090,Bernadette,11, So where do you want to go?,9
45091,Amy,11, I heard that new Mexican place on Green Street is good.,9
45092,Penny,11," Sure, sure. Or we could take you to get a bikini wax.",9
45093,Amy,11, Why would I get a bikini wax for my birthday?,9
45094,Penny,11," Uh, I don‰Ûªt know. It was just a thought.",9
45095,Amy,11, I think I‰Ûªll just stick to Mexican.,9
45096,Bernadette,11," Great. And then maybe after, we can watch a dirty movie, and if anybody has any questions about what happened or how, we can answer them.",9
45097,Amy,11," Okay, what is going on?",9
45098,Penny,11," Oh, we just want you to be prepared for any surprises that might happen tomorrow.",9
45099,Amy,11, What surprises?,9
45100,Bernadette,11," We don‰Ûªt want to spoil anything, but you should know that Sheldon said he‰Ûªs ready to be physical.",9
45101,Amy,11, You shut your damn mouth. You actually heard him say this?,9
45102,Penny,11, Yes. He said he wants to do something to show you how much you mean to him.,9
45103,Amy,11," I, I can‰Ûªt believe it. I, I don‰Ûªt know what to say.",9
45104,Bernadette,11," Well, we‰Ûªre really happy for you, and we know how much he cares‰Û_",9
45105,Amy,11, I do know what to say. Let‰Ûªs get me waxed.,9
45106,Scene,11, Sheldon‰Ûªs bedroom.,9
45107,Arthur,11, Why isn‰Ûªt it ever Angie Dickinson‰Ûªs bedroom?,9
45108,Sheldon,11, You‰Ûªre back.,9
45109,Arthur,11," It, it doesn‰Ûªt seem like it‰Ûªs up to me.",9
45110,Sheldon,11," I suppose you‰Ûªre here because I‰Ûªve decided to be physical with my girlfriend, and I‰Ûªve never done that before.",9
45111,Arthur,11," Eh, excuse me for a moment. Well, it was worth a shot.",9
45112,Sheldon,11," So, can you help me?",9
45113,Arthur,11," Uh, all right. Um, once, once the man gets the, the woman out of her, out of her bloomers‰Û_",9
45114,Sheldon,11," Oh, no. Not that. I, I understand the mechanics.",9
45115,Arthur,11," Oh, good, good. ‰Û÷Cause, uh, I have no idea what kids these days are calling their, their parts.",9
45116,Sheldon,11, I think they say junk.,9
45117,Arthur,11," What is happening to this world? What, what do you actually need to know?",9
45118,Sheldon,11," This is an important night for us, and I‰Ûªm worried I might be overwhelmed and ruin everything.",9
45119,Arthur,11," Sheldon, if, if you‰Ûªre with the right person, it, it‰Ûªll be okay.",9
45120,Sheldon,11," Thank you, Arthur. You are the wisest of the wise.",9
45121,Arthur,11," Well, that‰Ûªs, that‰Ûªs very nice of you to say, but I think I‰Ûªm just an expression of, of your unconscious mind.",9
45122,Sheldon,11," Oh, sure. Well, you‰Ûªre fun to look at.",9
45123,Scene,11, The apartment.,9
45124,Raj,11, Tonight‰Ûªs the night.,9
45125,Leonard,11," Yeah, the wait is finally over.",9
45126,Penny,11, I know. Then you‰Ûªll finally stop talking about it.,9
45127,Howard,11, Ready to go?,9
45128,Raj,11, Let‰Ûªs do this.,9
45129,Penny,11," Have fun, guys.",9
45130,Leonard,11, We will.,9
45131,Raj,11, I can‰Ûªt believe Sheldon gave this up.,9
45132,Howard,11, I know.,9
45133,Leonard,11, We‰Ûªre gonna have so much more fun than him.,9
45134,Bernadette,11," No, they‰Ûªre not.",9
45135,Penny,11," Knowing them, they will.",9
45136,Scene,11, The cinema.,9
45137,Howard,11, T minus 15 minutes.,9
45138,Raj,11," Oh, did you hear from Wil?",9
45139,Leonard,11," Yeah, he‰Ûªs on his way. Time for bladder check.",9
45140,Raj,11, Check.,9
45141,Leonard,11, Check.,9
45142,Howard,11, Check. Wait. Screw it. I‰Ûªm holding it.,9
45143,Raj,11, What is everyone booing at?,9
45144,Wil,11," Hey, guys. What‰Ûªs up?",9
45145,Leonard,11," Um, hey, Wil. What you doin‰Ûª?",9
45146,Wil,11, I was on Star Trek. Just rooting for the home team.,9
45147,Man,11, Star Trek stinks!,9
45148,Wil,11, Yeah? Live long and suck it.,9
45149,Scene,11, Amy‰Ûªs apartment. ,9
45150,Sheldon,11," (Knock, knock, knock) Birthday girl. (Knock, knock, knock) Birthday girl. (Knock, knock, knock) Birthday girl.",9
45151,Amy,11, Come in.,9
45152,Sheldon,11, Oh.,9
45153,Amy,11," Hi, Sheldon.",9
45154,Sheldon,11," Hello. Sorry I‰Ûªm late. I also got you a balloon, but it floated away, and I chased it for a while.",9
45155,Amy,11," That‰Ûªs okay. Come on in. Thank you. Um, I‰Ûªll, I‰Ûªm gonna go put these in water.",9
45156,Sheldon,11," Okay. Ooh, this is different, hmm? Candles and music.",9
45157,Amy,11, Do you like it?,9
45158,Sheldon,11, It‰Ûªs kind of spooky.,9
45159,Amy,11, I can change it back.,9
45160,Sheldon,11," No, no, no. It‰Ûªs your birthday. As long as no one jumps out in a hockey mask, I‰Ûªll be fine.",9
45161,Amy,11," So, what‰Ûªd you have in mind for tonight?",9
45162,Sheldon,11," I thought I could take you out to a nice birthday dinner. If we pick a place east of here, we might find the balloon.",9
45163,Amy,11," Um, that sounds nice, but I‰Ûªm not really hungry right now. I thought maybe we could do presents first.",9
45164,Sheldon,11, Oh. All right. Um. I should probably tell you something about this gift.,9
45165,Amy,11, You mean before you give it to me?,9
45166,Sheldon,11, Yes. May I ask you a question before I give it to you?,9
45167,Amy,11, Of course.,9
45168,Sheldon,11, Why are we saying give it to you like that?,9
45169,Amy,11," Sheldon, I know your present is for us to be intimate tonight.",9
45170,Sheldon,11," I see. Is that all right? I‰Ûªm sorry, but this is a litigious society. I‰Ûªm gonna need verbal consent.",9
45171,Amy,11, Yes.,9
45172,Sheldon,11," You know what, let me pull a quick contract off the Internet.",9
45173,Scene,11, The cinema. ,9
45174,Leonard,11," So, if you don‰Ûªt like Star Wars, why are you here?",9
45175,Wil,11," Oh, I‰Ûªm just having fun. Everyone takes Star Wars so seriously. Like if the movie‰Ûªs bad, it‰Ûªs gonna ruin their lives.",9
45176,Raj,11," Is it bad? Did you hear something? Oh, my God. It‰Ûªs bad. Somebody kill me.",9
45177,Wil,11," See? That‰Ûªs what I mean. When you wake up in the morning, whether this is the greatest movie ever or a total piece of crap, your life isn‰Ûªt gonna change at all.",9
45178,Howard,11, He‰Ûªs right.,9
45179,Leonard,11," Yeah. No matter what happens, we‰Ûªre coming back tomorrow to watch it again.",9
45180,Scene,11, The apartment.,9
45181,Bernadette,11, Do you think Sheldon‰Ûªs actually gonna go through with it?,9
45182,Penny,11, I don‰Ûªt know. He said he‰Ûªs ready.,9
45183,Bernadette,11," Yeah, but he also swore this was the year he‰Ûªd be able to pull the guts out of a pumpkin.",9
45184,Penny,11," Well, I‰Ûªm gonna stay positive. I mean, we talked, I told him what women like, and after he stopped giggling, he seemed pretty sure of himself.",9
45185,Scene,11, Amy‰Ûªs bedroom.,9
45186,Amy,11, Hi.,9
45187,Sheldon,11, Hello.,9
45188,Amy,11," So, um, should I get under the covers with you?",9
45189,Sheldon,11, All right. Hello.,9
45190,Amy,11, Hi.,9
45191,Sheldon,11, Why are you shaking? Are you cold?,9
45192,Amy,11," I‰Ûªm just, um, really nervous.",9
45193,Sheldon,11, Why?,9
45194,Amy,11," Well, I‰Ûªve been waiting for this for so long, I‰Ûªve just built it up in my head. I don‰Ûªt know what to expect.",9
45195,Sheldon,11, Neither do I. But we can find out together.,9
45196,Amy,11, Okay.,9
45197,Scene,11, The cinema. ,9
45198,Leonard,11, I‰Ûªm really nervous.,9
45199,Howard,11, I know. We‰Ûªve been waiting so long for this.,9
45200,Raj,11, And we‰Ûªve built it up in our heads so much.,9
45201,Wil,11," Guys, it‰Ûªs just a movie.",9
45202,Leonard,11, That‰Ûªs true.,9
45203,Howard,11, He‰Ûªs right.,9
45204,Raj,11, It is.,9
45205,Wil,11," Although, we all remember Jar Jar.",9
45206,Raj,11," Leonard, I, I‰Ûªm scared again.",9
45207,Caption,11," A few hours later, in a bedroom not far away‰Û_.",9
45208,Sheldon,11," Well, I enjoyed that more than I thought I would.",9
45209,Amy,11," Me, too.",9
45210,Sheldon,11, I look forward to your next birthday when we do it again.,9
45211,Amy,11, That works for me.,9
45212,Scene,11, The cinema.,9
45213,Wil,11, I enjoyed that more than I thought I would.,9
45214,Raj,11, I don‰Ûªt think I can walk right now.,9
45215,Scene,11, Sheldon‰Ûªs bedroom.,9
45216,Arthur,11," Uh, Sheldon? Sheldon?",9
45217,Sheldon,11," Arthur. What are you doing here? I, I don‰Ûªt think I need any more advice.",9
45218,Arthur,11," I, I was just curious. How, how‰Ûªd it go?",9
45219,Sheldon,11," Oh. It was amazing. I, I saw it a few days later. What a movie.",9
45220,Arthur,11," But, uh, what, what about Amy?",9
45221,Sheldon,11," Oh. Uh, uh, she liked it fine. But she doesn‰Ûªt have the history with the franchise I do.",9
45222,Arthur,11," Okay. Good, good talk.",9
45223,Scene,12, The apartment.,9
45224,Sheldon,12, I‰Ûªm glad to see you made it safely. How‰Ûªs your hotel?,9
45225,Amy (on Skype),12," It‰Ûªs not the best Best Western I‰Ûªve been to, but I‰Ûªd say it‰Ûªs the third best Best Western I‰Ûªve been to.",9
45226,Sheldon,12," I know how you feel. The Best Buy by my house is only the third best Best Buy. They have the best buys, but having the best buys isn‰Ûªt the only thing that makes a Best Buy the best Best Buy.",9
45227,Amy,12, What makes a best Best Buy the best Best Buy?,9
45228,Sheldon,12," Mm, that‰Ûªs a great question. I like when they‰Ûªre next to a Chipotle.",9
45229,Amy,12," Okay, well, I should unpack.",9
45230,Sheldon,12, All right. Enjoy the neurobiology conference.,9
45231,Amy,12, I will. I wish you were here.,9
45232,Sheldon,12, At a neurobiology conference? What a mean thing to say.,9
45233,Amy,12," Okay, I‰Ûªm glad you‰Ûªre not here?",9
45234,Sheldon,12," Aw, you always know just what to say after I tell you what to say.",9
45235,Amy,12," Good-bye, Sheldon.",9
45236,Sheldon,12," Bye. Oh, good news, gentlemen. Amy‰Ûªs at a conference this weekend, which means I‰Ûªm available to be entertained, hmm. As today‰Ûªs youth might put it, who wants to get their Sheld-on?",9
45237,Howard,12, Bernie and I are getting the house ready for the remodel. We could always use an extra pair of hands.,9
45238,Sheldon,12, That sounds awful. Raj?,9
45239,Raj,12," Uh, I‰Ûªve got time booked in the telescope room all weekend scanning for rogue planets. You‰Ûªre more than welcome to join me.",9
45240,Sheldon,12, That‰Ûªs the one to beat. Leonard?,9
45241,Leonard,12," Oh, if anything, I‰Ûªm trying to get my Sheld-off.",9
45242,Sheldon,12," Well, then it looks like we have a winner. Congratulations.",9
45243,Raj,12," Well, I should warn you, it‰Ûªs just looking at data for hours and hours on a computer screen.",9
45244,Sheldon,12," Uh, stop selling it, kid. You won.",9
45245,Scene,12, The apartment.,9
45246,Penny,12, Hey.,9
45247,Leonard,12, Hey.,9
45248,Raj,12, Hello.,9
45249,Howard,12, Hi.,9
45250,Leonard,12, How was your day?,9
45251,Penny,12," Oh, not good. Still couldn‰Ûªt get in to see Dr. Gallo.",9
45252,Sheldon,12," A doctor? Well, I hope you‰Ûªre not contagious. I‰Ûªve got a weekend in the telescope room I‰Ûªve been excited about for almost three minutes.",9
45253,Penny,12, I‰Ûªm not sick. It‰Ûªs for work. There‰Ûªs this doctor who refuses to see any sales reps. I‰Ûªve been trying to get in for months.,9
45254,Leonard,12," Well, did you try wearing the shirt I said was inappropriate for work?",9
45255,Penny,12," Well, the doctor‰Ûªs a woman, but yes, because you never know.",9
45256,Howard,12, What kind of doctor is she?,9
45257,Penny,12," Um, a psychiatrist. Why?",9
45258,Howard,12," Well, what if you make an appointment as a patient? Then you‰Ûªll get to talk to her.",9
45259,Penny,12," Yeah, they already know I‰Ûªm a pharmaceutical sales rep.",9
45260,Raj,12, Oh. What if Leonard made an appointment and tried to lay some groundwork for you?,9
45261,Penny,12, That‰Ûªs interesting.,9
45262,Leonard,12, I‰Ûªm not gonna make a fake appointment with a psychiatrist. What would I say is wrong with me?,9
45263,Raj,12, Low self-esteem.,9
45264,Howard,12, Social anxiety.,9
45265,Sheldon,12, Sexual insecurity.,9
45266,Leonard,12, None of that is true.,9
45267,Penny,12," Uh, denial. See, sweetie, the list goes on and on.",9
45268,Leonard,12, That‰Ûªs just crazy. How would my going in there even help you?,9
45269,Penny,12," I don‰Ûªt know. You could talk to her, and maybe if it comes up, you could ask if she‰Ûªs heard about the drug.",9
45270,Leonard,12, What if I get caught?,9
45271,Howard,12, Fear of failure.,9
45272,Raj,12, Lack of confidence.,9
45273,Sheldon,12, Kind of a wuss.,9
45274,Leonard,12," Fine, I‰Ûªll do it. But not because of them, because I love you.",9
45275,Penny,12, Thank you.,9
45276,Raj,12, Pushover.,9
45277,Howard,12, Spineless.,9
45278,Sheldon,12, Still hasn‰Ûªt bought milk even though I told him two days ago.,9
45279,Scene,12, Howard and Bernadette‰Ûªs bedroom.,9
45280,Howard,12, That was incredible.,9
45281,Bernadette,12, It was. I just wish Stuart wasn‰Ûªt around so we didn‰Ûªt have to be so quiet.,9
45282,Howard,12, I know. It‰Ûªs not like he returns the favour when he watches his Japanese porn cartoons.,9
45283,Stuart (knocking),12," You guys got a minute, or are you still cuddling?",9
45284,Howard,12," What is it, Stuart?",9
45285,Stuart,12, Can I come in?,9
45286,Howard,12, Hang on. Should I send him away?,9
45287,Bernadette,12," No, it‰Ûªs okay.",9
45288,Stuart,12," Thanks, Bernie.",9
45289,Howard,12, What‰Ûªs up?,9
45290,Stuart,12," Uh, well, I know the remodel is coming up, so I thought I‰Ûªd make it easy on you guys and find my own place.",9
45291,Howard,12, Wow. I thought I was done getting lucky tonight.,9
45292,Bernadette,12," So, when are you thinking of moving?",9
45293,Stuart,12," Uh, actually, I already found an apartment, so in a couple of days.",9
45294,Bernadette,12, Oh. Okay. Sorry to see you go?,9
45295,Stuart,12," Okay, well, thank you guys for everything. I, I really appreciate it.",9
45296,Stuart,12, Hmm.,9
45297,Howard,12, What?,9
45298,Stuart,12," Hmm, I just have never been in this room while you‰Ûªre awake.",9
45299,Scene,12, The telescope room.,9
45300,Sheldon,12, What are you doing?,9
45301,Raj,12," Uh, making sure the telescope‰Ûªs camera is white-field balanced.",9
45302,Sheldon,12, Hmm. What are you doing now?,9
45303,Raj,12, Still making sure the telescope‰Ûªs camera is white-field balanced.,9
45304,Sheldon,12," Oh, I see. How about now?",9
45305,Raj,12, Now I‰Ûªm making sure the telescope‰Ûªs camera is white-field balanced and wishing you had a colouring book.,9
45306,Sheldon,12," Well, I can be helpful. Give me something to do. You know, my father took me to work once, and in ten minutes I figured out who‰Ûªd been stealing from the cash register. It was my father. Yeah, Dad lost his job, but Mr. Hinckley gave me a Fudgsicle.",9
45307,Raj,12," Fine, you want something to do? There‰Ûªs about six months of data on this hard drive. Why don‰Ûªt you go through it and see if you can spot any patterns or anomalies.",9
45308,Sheldon,12," Yep, I‰Ûªm on it. Hey, look at that, an Indian guy outsourcing a computer job to a white fella.",9
45309,Raj,12," Yeah, okay, whatever it takes to keep you busy for a few hours.",9
45310,Sheldon,12, Found one.,9
45311,Raj,12," No, you didn‰Ûªt. There are millions of data points there.",9
45312,Sheldon,12," But, look, an optical transient.",9
45313,Raj,12," Yeah, maybe that is something. How did you find that?",9
45314,Sheldon,12," It wasn‰Ûªt difficult. You know how when you see prime numbers, they appear red, but when they‰Ûªre twin primes, they‰Ûªre pink and smell like gasoline?",9
45315,Raj,12, No.,9
45316,Sheldon,12," Oh. I guess I‰Ûªm a special boy. You know, sometimes when a boy is special, he gets a Fudgsicle. Which, by the way, tastes like the speed of light.",9
45317,Scene,12, Dr Gallo‰Ûªs office.,9
45318,Leonard,12, Thank you for seeing me on such short notice.,9
45319,Dr Gallo,12," Ah, it‰Ûªs my pleasure. I‰Ûªm curious, are you related to Dr. Beverly Hofstadter?",9
45320,Leonard,12," Uh, she‰Ûªs my mother. You know her?",9
45321,Dr Gallo,12," No, not personally, but I have read all of her books.",9
45322,Leonard,12," Well, then you know her better than I do.",9
45323,Dr Gallo,12," Well, I‰Ûªm not so sure about that. But I can tell you I do not agree with her theories on child rearing at all.",9
45324,Leonard,12," Really? Any chance you find them cold, cruel and unsuitable for innocent little boys who just want to be happy?",9
45325,Dr Gallo,12," Well, I didn‰Ûªt want to say it.",9
45326,Leonard,12," No, no, say it. Sing it. Rent a plane, write it in the sky.",9
45327,Dr Gallo,12, Sounds like you‰Ûªre holding on to quite a bit of anger towards her.,9
45328,Leonard,12," Oh, no, I, I‰Ûªve worked through a lot of that stuff, I‰Ûªm better now.",9
45329,Dr Gallo,12, Mm. Good for you.,9
45330,Leonard,12," Do you know she never let me celebrate my birthday because being born was her achievement, not mine?",9
45331,Dr Gallo,12, That‰Ûªs heartbreaking.,9
45332,Leonard,12," Right? To this day, I send her a card every year with a little money in it.",9
45333,Scene,12, Howard and Bernadette‰Ûªs house.,9
45334,Howard,12," You know, once we get the house back to ourselves, we can be romantic in any room we want.",9
45335,Bernadette,12, Great. I can finally show you where the laundry room is.,9
45336,Stuart,12," Boy, who would‰Ûªve thought when you asked me to move in and help take care of your mom, I‰Ûªd still be here two years later?",9
45337,Howard,12, No one.,9
45338,Bernadette,12, Nobody thought that.,9
45339,Stuart,12," Well, that‰Ûªs it.",9
45340,Bernadette,12, I guess so.,9
45341,Stuart,12, This is weird.,9
45342,Howard,12, Yeah. A grown man moving into his own apartment. Crazy times. See ya.,9
45343,Bernadette,12, Ignore him. He‰Ûªs just using humour to express how happy he is.,9
45344,Stuart,12, It‰Ûªs okay. I know he loves me.,9
45345,Bernadette,12," Sure he does. Well, let us know when you‰Ûªre all settled in.",9
45346,Stuart,12, I will. And I really can‰Ûªt thank you guys enough.,9
45347,Bernadette,12, Our pleasure.,9
45348,Stuart,12, Bye.,9
45349,Bernadette,12, Goodbye.,9
45350,Howard,12, He‰Ûªs gone. Let‰Ûªs start in the garage.,9
45351,Scene,12, The telescope room.,9
45352,Raj,12," Okay, so once we receive the next image and compare it to the ones we‰Ûªve already collected, we‰Ûªll know what it is that we found.",9
45353,Sheldon,12," Ooh, perhaps it‰Ûªs a Heliosheath scintillation.",9
45354,Raj,12, It could be a trans-Neptunian object.,9
45355,Sheldon,12, Maybe it‰Ûªs a new planet.,9
45356,Raj,12," Unlikely, but it could be a dwarf planet.",9
45357,Sheldon,12," Well, as long as it has a healthy gravity and all its moons, I‰Ûªll be happy.",9
45358,Raj,12," Okay, the final image is coming in. And the object we discovered is‰Û_",9
45359,Sheldon,12," Come on, Daddy needs a livable planet he can rule with an iron fist.",9
45360,Raj,12, A medium-sized asteroid.,9
45361,Sheldon,12, That‰Ûªs it? How common. That‰Ûªs the chicken fingers on the menu of space.,9
45362,Raj,12, I kind of like chicken fingers.,9
45363,Sheldon,12," Yeah, me, too. I was stuck for a metaphor.",9
45364,Raj,12," Come on, a medium-sized asteroid is still an interesting discovery.",9
45365,Sheldon,12, I suppose it could end up on a collision course with Earth and destroy life as we know it.,9
45366,Raj,12, You dream different than me.,9
45367,Sheldon,12, It is kind of cute.,9
45368,Raj,12," Yeah, it is. And you know we get to name it.",9
45369,Sheldon,12, We better choose a name no one can make fun of. Sir Frederick William Herschel didn‰Ûªt do Uranus any favours.,9
45370,Scene,12, The apartment.,9
45371,Leonard,12, Hi.,9
45372,Penny,12," Hey, how‰Ûªd it go?",9
45373,Leonard,12," Oh, great. Dr. Gallo is terrific. You know, I, I‰Ûªve always been insecure that no one cares about what I have to say, but she made me see‰Û_",9
45374,Penny,12," Yeah, no one cares. Did you help me out or not?",9
45375,Leonard,12," Okay, now, what I‰Ûªm hearing is that you feel that I sometimes take too long to express myself, and you wish I‰Ûªd be more succinct.",9
45376,Penny,12, You‰Ûªre only hearing that because I cannot roll my eyes any louder.,9
45377,Leonard,12," All right, well, after we talked about my issues with my mother, nothing too deep, just how she ruined my life, I told her about you and your drug. She said she‰Ûªd be happy to meet you.",9
45378,Penny,12," Really? Oh, you‰Ûªre the best husband ever.",9
45379,Leonard,12, So you‰Ûªll go to the Doctor Who convention with me next week?,9
45380,Penny,12, I guess.,9
45381,Leonard,12," Oh, I actually did hear your eyes roll that time.",9
45382,Scene,12, Stuarts former bedroom in Howard and Bernadette‰Ûªs house.,9
45383,Bernadette,12," Boy, when was the last time Stuart cleaned this place?",9
45384,Howard,12," No kidding. Oh, okay, I‰Ûªm about to suck something up. What do you think this object sounds like?",9
45385,Bernadette,12," Howie, I don‰Ûªt want to play Lego, Toenail or Pill anymore. So, what do you think we should do with this room?",9
45386,Howard,12," Well, I was thinking a home theatre or a gaming room, you know, like a man cave.",9
45387,Bernadette,12, Why can‰Ûªt it be a woman cave?,9
45388,Howard,12," As long as it has a home theatre, a video game system and you‰Ûªre not allowed in it, you can call it whatever you want.",9
45389,Bernadette,12, I‰Ûªm being serious.,9
45390,Howard,12," Well, what do you think we should do?",9
45391,Bernadette,12," I don‰Ûªt know, maybe a home office or, oh look. The teddy bear Stuart won the night we took him to the fair.",9
45392,Howard,12, Oh. He was so excited.,9
45393,Bernadette,12," Yeah. You know, no matter how hard they tried, they could not guess his age.",9
45394,Howard,12, I‰Ûªll give it to him next time I see him.,9
45395,Bernadette,12, Have you heard from him since he left?,9
45396,Howard,12, No. You‰Ûªd think he would‰Ûªve called once he got settled in.,9
45397,Bernadette,12, Hmm. Maybe he‰Ûªs busy.,9
45398,Howard,12, Too busy to call? He wasn‰Ûªt too busy to binge-watch Hot in Cleveland with my Hulu password. What is happening? Are we missing him?,9
45399,Bernadette,12," No, that‰Ûªs not what this feeling is. Is it?",9
45400,Howard,12, Of course not. He drove us crazy. Like when you were gonna make that pie and Stuart ate all the blueberries.,9
45401,Bernadette,12," And he tried to deny it, but his teeth were all purple.",9
45402,Howard,12, That was pretty cute.,9
45403,Bernadette,12," Yeah. Ew, we are missing him!",9
45404,Scene,12, The apartment.,9
45405,Raj,12," So I was thinking, maybe we can come up with a name for the asteroid by combining our names.",9
45406,Sheldon,12, That‰Ûªs a great idea. I‰Ûªve got it. We‰Ûªll call it Cooper.,9
45407,Raj,12, How is that both our names?,9
45408,Sheldon,12, Koo from Koothrappali and per from Cooper.,9
45409,Raj,12," Yeah, s-so it‰Ûªs, like, Kooper with a K?",9
45410,Sheldon,12," Nah, you‰Ûªre right, that‰Ûªs dumb.",9
45411,Leonard,12, Hey.,9
45412,Sheldon,12," Oh, Leonard, great news. We discovered a medium-sized asteroid together.",9
45413,Leonard,12," Wow, that‰Ûªs amazing. I‰Ûªm in a pretty great mood today myself.",9
45414,Sheldon,12, Okay. Guess we‰Ûªre gonna talk about you now.,9
45415,Leonard,12," Well, we are, because Dr. Gallo made me realize that I‰Ûªm a worthwhile person and that my feelings matter.",9
45416,Raj,12," I learned that for free from a cat poster, but good for you.",9
45417,Sheldon,12," Okay, back to me. I discovered an asteroid, and now I get to name it.",9
45418,Raj,12," Wait, what happened to us?",9
45419,Sheldon,12," Now, this isn‰Ûªt about us, this is about what‰Ûªs best for the asteroid.",9
45420,Leonard,12," Well, what are you thinking of naming it?",9
45421,Sheldon,12, I haven‰Ûªt settled on anything yet.,9
45422,Raj,12, We haven‰Ûªt settled on anything yet.,9
45423,Sheldon,12," All right, way to go, Cat Poster. You hang in there.",9
45424,Leonard,12, You know what‰Ûªd be nice? Name it after your girlfriends. Show them how much you care.,9
45425,Raj,12, That is a great idea.,9
45426,Sheldon,12," It‰Ûªs perfect. It appears romantic, but it‰Ûªs really just a rock in space that gets me out of Valentine‰Ûªs Day forever.",9
45427,Raj,12," So, uh, what were you thinking? Combine their names?",9
45428,Sheldon,12," I like it. Yeah, we‰Ûªll take the A-M from Amy and, uh, the Y from Emily.",9
45429,Raj,12, That‰Ûªs just Amy.,9
45430,Sheldon,12, Exactly. See how well we work together?,9
45431,Penny,12," And in double-blind studies, Placinex proved extremely effective in treating all kinds of anxiety. Actually, funny story, the boys in the lab were worried about getting FDA approval for Placinex. They started taking it, stopped worrying.",9
45432,Dr Gallo,12, Got it.,9
45433,Penny,12," Uh, do you have any questions?",9
45434,Dr Gallo,12, Just one.,9
45435,Penny,12, Mm-hmm?,9
45436,Dr Gallo,12," When you made your husband pretend to be a patient so you could get access to me, what were you thinking there?",9
45437,Penny,12, I just meant a question about the drug.,9
45438,Dr Gallo,12," Yeah, I know what you meant. Let‰Ûªs put that aside for a minute and talk about why you married Leonard.",9
45439,Penny,12, I don‰Ûªt wanna.,9
45440,Dr Gallo,12, Here is a man raised by an overbearing woman who completely dominated every aspect of his formative years. Do you think he‰Ûªs perpetuating that relationship by seeking out a partner like you?,9
45441,Penny,12," You know, I used to wear tank tops a lot. That was a big selling point.",9
45442,Scene,12, The apartment.,9
45443,Amy (on Skype),12," Hi, Sheldon. What‰Ûªs up?",9
45444,Sheldon,12, Good news. You‰Ûªre an asteroid.,9
45445,Amy,12," Uh, please tell me what to say next.",9
45446,Sheldon,12," Perhaps I should explain. While working with Koothrappali, we discovered an asteroid, and I named it after you.",9
45447,Amy,12," Oh. Sheldon, thank you. That‰Ûªs so romantic. But what about Rajesh? He was okay with you choosing the name?",9
45448,Sheldon,12," Well, it took a little negotiating, but I wore him down. Uh, we get the asteroid, and if you and I have children, they all have to be named Rajesh.",9
45449,Amy,12, All of them?,9
45450,Sheldon,12, Even the girls.,9
45451,Amy,12," Okay, I think I know what to say now.",9
45452,Scene,12, Dr Gallo‰Ûªs office. ,9
45453,Penny,12," How can I not sound like his mother when our entire bedroom is filled with Star Wars toys? I mean, have you ever had sex with a stuffed Wookiee watching you?",9
45454,Dr Gallo,12, I went to college in the ‰Ûª70s. It was a hairier time. I‰Ûªm gonna say yes.,9
45455,Penny,12," You know, if anything, he‰Ûªs turning me into his mother. Before I did pharmaceutical sales, I was an actress. You know, I was pretty good. You know, girl-next-door type, but hot. Doable.",9
45456,Dr Gallo,12, Hmm.,9
45457,Penny,12," And not only am I Leonard‰Ûªs mother, but we have this man-child living with us named Sheldon.",9
45458,Dr Gallo,12," Oh, Leonard talked a lot about him. I wasn‰Ûªt sure if he was real.",9
45459,Penny,12," Yeah, he‰Ûªs as real as the fine I get when I use too much toilet paper.",9
45460,Dr Gallo,12," Wow, you really do have a lot on your plate.",9
45461,Penny,12," I do. You know, Leonard‰Ûªs right. Talking to you is really helping.",9
45462,Dr Gallo,12," Oh, I‰Ûªm glad. You know, you might also benefit from a prescription for anxiety.",9
45463,Penny,12," Okay, if you think it‰Ûªll help. Oh, just don‰Ûªt make it Placinex. I do not need sudden fits of homicidal rage.",9
45464,Scene,12, The apartment.,9
45465,Amy (on Skype),12, I miss you.,9
45466,Sheldon,12, I miss you as well.,9
45467,Scene,12, Howard and Bernadette‰Ûªs house.,9
45468,Howard,12, I can‰Ûªt believe I miss Stuart.,9
45469,Scene,12, Dr Gallo‰Ûªs office.,9
45470,Penny,12, I guess I just miss when life was simpler.,9
45471,Scene,12, A street. Leonard is skipping ropes with some young girls. ,9
45472,Girls,12," Go, Leonard! Go, Leonard! Go, Leonard! Go, Leonard!",9
45473,Leonard,12," Remember, girls, you decide what makes you happy, not your emotionally withholding mothers.",9
45474,Girls,12," Go, Leonard! Go, Leonard! Go, Leonard! Go, Leonard! Go, Leonard!",9
45475,Scene,12, Howard and Bernadette‰Ûªs bedroom. Howard and Bernadette are asleep.,9
45476,Stuart,12, I really miss this.,9
45477,Scene,13, The apartment.,9
45478,Penny,13," Hey, so I saw a movie trailer the other day. How could Batman possibly fight Superman? I mean, isn‰Ûªt that dumb?",9
45479,Bernadette,13, Maybe he uses Kryptonite.,9
45480,Emily,13," Well, Batman‰Ûªs got a lot of money. Maybe he builds a suit that can do everything Superman can do.",9
45481,Penny,13," No, no, no, no, no. I‰Ûªve seen that movie. It‰Ûªs called Iron Man.",9
45482,Leonard,13, What is happening?,9
45483,Howard,13, I don‰Ûªt know.,9
45484,Raj,13, But it‰Ûªs beautiful.,9
45485,Penny,13, And now Ben Affleck is Batman?,9
45486,Emily,13," Oh, he was great in Shakespeare in Love.",9
45487,Penny,13," Ooh, we should watch that next girls‰Ûª night.",9
45488,Bernadette,13, We could do a double feature with the Leonardo Di Caprio Romeo and Juliet.,9
45489,Penny,13," Oh, I love me some Leo.",9
45490,Leonard,13, And it‰Ûªs gone.,9
45491,Sheldon,13," Oh, hello, everyone. I am happy to report I‰Ûªm feeling much better.",9
45492,Leonard,13, Good for you.,9
45493,Sheldon,13," My fever is gone, my sinuses are pressure-free, and my mucus is as clear as a Yosemite waterfall.",9
45494,Howard,13, Glad to hear it.,9
45495,Sheldon,13, I‰Ûªll be able to return to work tomorrow.,9
45496,Raj,13, Yay.,9
45497,Sheldon,13," Well, why isn‰Ûªt everyone happy? Your little ray of sunshine is ready to beam again.",9
45498,Penny,13, You really don‰Ûªt know why?,9
45499,Sheldon,13, No. But I knew that his yay was sarcastic. Not bad for a guy whose last bowel movement sounded like rain on a roof.,9
45500,Leonard,13, Let me refresh your memory.,9
45501,Sheldon,13," Penny, rub Vicks on my chest.",9
45502,Penny,13," Sheldon, I cooked you breakfast. I made your bed. I checked your mouth for thrush. You can rub your own chest.",9
45503,Sheldon,13," Oh, sure, grope every other male on the planet, but draw the line with me.",9
45504,Bernadette,13, I brought you a little care package from work. It‰Ûªs our latest antiviral and the best decongestant we make.,9
45505,Sheldon,13," I hope laughter is the best medicine, ‰Ûªcause this care package is a joke.",9
45506,Howard,13," Hey, she came all the way here‰Û_",9
45507,Bernadette,13, You‰Ûªre gonna want to take these with food.,9
45508,Raj,13," Sheldon, stop being a baby and let Emily take a look at you.",9
45509,Sheldon,13, She‰Ûªs a dermatologist.,9
45510,Emily,13, I went to medical school.,9
45511,Sheldon,13," Well, in that case, try removing the irritating patch of brown skin standing next to you.",9
45512,Leonard,13," All right, here you go.",9
45513,Sheldon,13," Leonard, I‰Ûªm dying.",9
45514,Leonard,13, You‰Ûªre not dying. It‰Ûªs just the flu.,9
45515,Sheldon,13, I asked for chicken noodle. This is chicken and stars. It‰Ûªs killing me.,9
45516,Sheldon,13," I never did get that chicken noodle, did I?",9
45517,Scene,13, Sheldon‰Ûªs bedroom.,9
45518,Amy (on Skype),13," Hi, Sheldon.",9
45519,Sheldon,13, Hello.,9
45520,Amy,13, Are you feeling any better?,9
45521,Sheldon,13," Physically, yes, but I‰Ûªm upset because everyone‰Ûªs mad at me for no good reason.",9
45522,Amy,13," Why don‰Ûªt you tell me what happened, and in a gentle, loving way, I‰Ûªll explain to you why you‰Ûªre wrong.",9
45523,Sheldon,13," You know how, when you‰Ûªre sick, you‰Ûªre allowed to be cranky and say whatever you want and other people‰Ûªs feelings don‰Ûªt matter?",9
45524,Amy,13," Ooh. Gentle and loving, this is gonna be tricky.",9
45525,Sheldon,13," I had a hundred and one fever. If that‰Ûªs not a time to verbally abuse my loved ones, when is?",9
45526,Amy,13," Sheldon, when you‰Ûªre sick, you can be unbearable. That‰Ûªs why your friends have been known to work late or sneak out to the movies or stay at a neurobiology conference three days after it‰Ûªs ended.",9
45527,Sheldon,13, You stayed in Michigan all week to avoid being around me?,9
45528,Amy,13," No, no, not just that. I mean, Detroit is beautiful when it‰Ûªs sleeting.",9
45529,Sheldon,13," You know, I‰Ûªm not the only one who‰Ûªs unpleasant when they‰Ûªre sick. When Penny got food poisoning, she threw up so loudly I could barely hear the television.",9
45530,Amy,13," Ooh, I just heard something. Might be hail, might be gunfire. Either way, I‰Ûªm gonna go take pictures. Bye.",9
45531,Scene,13, The comic book store.,9
45532,Raj,13," Hey, Stuart.",9
45533,Stuart,13, Hey. Where‰Ûªs Sheldon? Still sick?,9
45534,Leonard,13," No, he‰Ûªs fine. We just needed a little break.",9
45535,Stuart,13," Yeah, I get that. When I brought him his comics the other day he said, oh great, death is literally at my door.",9
45536,Howard,13, He was being a jerk to everyone. Don‰Ûªt take it personally.,9
45537,Stuart,13," Oh, I‰Ûªm on so many antidepressants, I couldn‰Ûªt if I wanted to.",9
45538,Raj,13, I wish we could do more stuff without Sheldon.,9
45539,Leonard,13, I wish that all the time. Usually before I blow out birthday candles.,9
45540,Howard,13," You know, Amy took some time off from him. Really improved their relationship.",9
45541,Raj,13," Huh. Okay. As long as it doesn‰Ûªt end with us having coitus with him, I‰Ûªm in.",9
45542,Howard,13, We should all take a trip or something.,9
45543,Leonard,13," Well, you know, Penny and I have been talking about taking a weekend in Vegas. Maybe we should all go.",9
45544,Howard,13, Bernie would love that.,9
45545,Raj,13," Oh, Ooh, maybe we could get one of those party buses to take us there.",9
45546,Leonard,13, That sounds really fun.,9
45547,Raj,13," Yeah, that sounds fun. A party-bus party don‰Ûªt stop. Ooh, when I say party, you say bus.",9
45548,Leonard,13, No.,9
45549,Howard,13, No.,9
45550,Leonard,13, No.,9
45551,Howard,13, No.,9
45552,Scene,13, The apartment.,9
45553,Leonard,13," So, the guys and I were talking about renting a party bus and everyone going to Vegas.",9
45554,Penny,13," Oh, that could be fun. But just to be clear, you mean a party bus with booze and music, right, not, like, juice boxes and video games?",9
45555,Leonard,13," Yes. And Howard‰Ûªs birthday was a drop-off party, you didn‰Ûªt have to stay.",9
45556,Penny,13," Well, I‰Ûªm in. When are we going?",9
45557,Leonard,13, This weekend.,9
45558,Sheldon,13," Oh, where are we going?",9
45559,Leonard,13," Well, Vegas, but‰Û_",9
45560,Sheldon,13," Ugh, Atlantic City without the taffy? No, thank you.",9
45561,Leonard,13," That‰Ûªs fine, ‰Ûªcause actually you‰Ûªre not invited.",9
45562,Sheldon,13," Well, now, well, that‰Ûªs hurtful.",9
45563,Penny,13," Oh, Sheldon, you don‰Ûªt even like it there.",9
45564,Sheldon,13, I can consider a place America‰Ûªs urinal cake and still enjoy the occasional visit.,9
45565,Leonard,13, Not this time.,9
45566,Sheldon,13," Oh, fine. Then I‰Ûªll just hang out with Wolowitz.",9
45567,Leonard,13," He‰Ûªs coming, too.",9
45568,Sheldon,13," Well, then Raj and I will‰Û_",9
45569,Leonard,13, Nope.,9
45570,Sheldon,13, Very well. Stuart.,9
45571,Leonard,13," Oh, great. Do that.",9
45572,Sheldon,13, Ugh. Stuart.,9
45573,Scene,13, Sheldon‰Ûªs bedroom. ,9
45574,Amy (on Skype),13," Hi, Sheldon. What‰Ûªs new?",9
45575,Sheldon,13," Our friends are jerks, and I‰Ûªm mad at all of them.",9
45576,Amy,13," I said what‰Ûªs new, but sure.",9
45577,Sheldon,13, Can you believe they planned a trip to Las Vegas and didn‰Ûªt invite me?,9
45578,Amy,13, Did you refuse to apologize and act like they were stupid for being mad?,9
45579,Sheldon,13," You know, I liked it better when there was still a little mystery left in our relationship.",9
45580,Amy,13," Everyone tried to take care of you, and you were nothing but mean to them.",9
45581,Sheldon,13, I can‰Ûªt believe you‰Ûªre not on my side. I was on your side when someone stole your car radio.,9
45582,Amy,13, Who else‰Ûªs side could you have been on?,9
45583,Sheldon,13, I don‰Ûªt know. A music-loving hobo with a heart of gold?,9
45584,Amy,13," Sheldon, I understand that you‰Ûªre upset because you feel left out, but I don‰Ûªt know why we‰Ûªre even talking about this. Just apologize to them.",9
45585,Sheldon,13," Fine, if that‰Ûªs what it takes to go on their dumb trip.",9
45586,Amy,13, Maybe you could try apologizing because you actually feel bad. It‰Ûªs called empathy. It‰Ûªs something you could work on.,9
45587,Sheldon,13," I have empathy. Watch. Leonard made me soup, and I was mean to him.",9
45588,Amy,13, Great. Now try it as if this isn‰Ûªt your first day as a person.,9
45589,Sheldon,13," Fine. Leonard made me soup, and I was mean to him. Hey, I felt a little something. Let me try again. Leonard made me soup, and I was mean to him. I was mean to him. He must have felt terrible. Oh, now I feel terrible. Neat.",9
45590,Amy,13, Glad I could help.,9
45591,Sheldon,13, Now let me see you feel bad for lying and staying in Detroit longer than you needed to.,9
45592,Amy,13," I feel so, so bad.",9
45593,Sheldon,13," Hey, we‰Ûªre both great at this.",9
45594,Scene,13, The apartment.,9
45595,Sheldon,13," Leonard, get ready for an apology. And with the added twist of an M. Night Shyamalan movie, I‰Ûªm going to mean it.",9
45596,Leonard,13," Ah, so like every other M. Night Shyamalan movie I‰Ûªve seen, you spoil it in advance.",9
45597,Sheldon,13," Hey, if you didn‰Ûªt know Bruce Willis was dead the whole time, that‰Ûªs not on me. Okay. Here it comes. You tried to take care of me when I was sick, and I was mean to you. There‰Ûªs no excuse for that. And I‰Ûªm truly sorry.",9
45598,Leonard,13, Thank you. I appreciate that.,9
45599,Sheldon,13, I want you to know that that is sincere. I do feel bad. I‰Ûªm not just saying it to be included on your trip.,9
45600,Leonard,13," Appreciate that, too.",9
45601,Sheldon,13," Terrific. Now all that‰Ûªs left is for you to invite me to come, me to ask are you sure, you to say absolutely, and then me to bring it home with, how could I say no to that face?",9
45602,Leonard,13, You‰Ûªre still not coming.,9
45603,Sheldon,13," What? I apologized and I meant it. I know that we don‰Ûªt play this game very often, but you‰Ûªre doing it wrong.",9
45604,Leonard,13," Sheldon, I accept your apology, but you upset a lot of people while you were sick. I‰Ûªm not in a position to just say you can come.",9
45605,Sheldon,13," Well, all right. What if I apologize to all of them?",9
45606,Leonard,13," Fine, if you apologize to everyone, they all say it‰Ûªs okay, then yes, you can come.",9
45607,Sheldon,13, Challenge accepted. Sounds like it‰Ûªs time for the Sheldon Cooper Apology Tour.,9
45608,Leonard,13," Well, I hope it‰Ûªs as much fun as the Sheldon Cooper Spell-Checks Local Menus Tour.",9
45609,Sheldon,13," My goodness, do you remember comes with apsparagus?",9
45610,Scene,13, Howard and Berndette‰Ûªs house.,9
45611,Sheldon,13," Howard and Bernadette, you tried to comfort me when I was ill, and I treated you terribly. I‰Ûªm sorry.",9
45612,Howard,13, Wow. I‰Ûªm impressed.,9
45613,Sheldon,13," No, no, no, wait. I‰Ûªm not done. Allow me to underscore my sentiment with a haunting rendition of Brenda Lee‰Ûªs I‰Ûªm Sorry played on the pan flute.",9
45614,Howard,13, Apology accepted.,9
45615,Bernadette,13," Forgiven, forgiven.",9
45616,Sheldon,13," All right, that‰Ûªs eight hours of practice down the drain. And to memorialise this occasion, here are your commemorative T-shirts.",9
45617,Howard,13, Sheldon Cooper apologized to me,9
45618,Bernadette,13, And he made it all better.,9
45619,Scene,13, The apartment bathroom.,9
45620,Sheldon,13," All you did was offer maternal care and affection, and all you received in return was rude and insensitive behavior.",9
45621,Penny,13, Can this wait?,9
45622,Sheldon,13, I‰Ûªm afraid it can‰Ûªt. The trip is tomorrow. And I have more apologies to make.,9
45623,Penny,13," Okay, fine, I accept your apology, now get out.",9
45624,Sheldon,13, Wonderful. would you mind holding up this shirt while I take a quick‰Û_?,9
45625,Penny,13, Leonard.,9
45626,Scene,13, The comic book store.,9
45627,Sheldon,13," You brought me my comic books when I wasn‰Ûªt feeling well. That, that was thoughtful. And I was insensitive. I‰Ûªm sorry.",9
45628,Stuart,13," Thank you, Sheldon. I appreciate that.",9
45629,Sheldon,13," And I want you to know that I mean it, you know? This isn‰Ûªt me just wanting to go on the trip to Las Vegas.",9
45630,Stuart,13, What trip to Las Vegas?,9
45631,Sheldon,13, The one everyone‰Ûªs taking this weekend on the party bus.,9
45632,Stuart,13," Of course, I wasn‰Ûªt invited.",9
45633,Sheldon,13," That would be my understanding. On a less painful subject, what size T-shirt do you take?",9
45634,Scene,13, Raj‰Ûªs apartment.,9
45635,Sheldon,13," Raj, you were being a good friend, and my illness was no excuse for my behaviour. I hope that you can accept my apology.",9
45636,Raj,13, Of course I do.,9
45637,Sheldon,13," And, Emily, I‰Ûªm sorry for saying dermatologists aren‰Ûªt real doctors. And I‰Ûªm sure you‰Ûªre tired of hearing that.",9
45638,Emily,13, Do you honestly think I hear that a lot?,9
45639,Sheldon,13," Well, I would imagine when your job is popping zits and squirting Botox into old lady faces‰Û_",9
45640,Raj,13," Okay, okay, the point is that we accept your apology.",9
45641,Emily,13," Uh, maybe you do. He just insulted me again.",9
45642,Raj,13," Yeah, but he doesn‰Ûªt mean it.",9
45643,Emily,13, Why are you defending him?,9
45644,Sheldon,13," I believe I can answer that. Uh, like me, Raj is demonstrating empathy. Now, why don‰Ûªt you accept my apology receive your free T-shirt, uh, I hope extra small is okay. For some reason Wolowitz took a medium.",9
45645,Emily,13," Well, I don‰Ûªt accept your apology.",9
45646,Raj,13, What are you doing?,9
45647,Emily,13, It‰Ûªs called standing up for myself. You should try it some time.,9
45648,Raj,13," Fine, how about this? You‰Ûªre making me uncomfortable by prolonging this ridiculous fight, and I wish you‰Ûªd stop.",9
45649,Emily,13," Oh, you want me to stop? No problem.",9
45650,Raj,13," No, come on, please don‰Ûªt leave.",9
45651,Sheldon,13," Point of clarification, are you still going on the trip? Because if not‰Û_",9
45652,Emily,13," Don‰Ûªt worry, you‰Ûªre good.",9
45653,Sheldon,13," I caused that fight, I feel terrible. Wait, I can do that better. I caused that fight. I feel terrible. Yeah, wow, I don‰Ûªt know which one I like more.",9
45654,Scene,13, The apartment.,9
45655,Penny,13," So, was the fight really bad?",9
45656,Sheldon,13," No. As a fight, it was excellent. She used harsh language and slammed the door. Although as I say this, that might not have been what you were asking.",9
45657,Leonard,13, You think they‰Ûªll still go on the trip?,9
45658,Sheldon,13, All I know is after the fight I went to Emily‰Ûªs to smooth‰Û_,9
45659,Leonard,13, They‰Ûªre not going on the trip.,9
45660,Penny,13, No.,9
45661,Raj,13, What is wrong with you?,9
45662,Sheldon,13," Look at him, caring about what‰Ûªs wrong with me. That is some top-shelf empathy. Hey, well, we should start a club.",9
45663,Raj,13," You went to Emily‰Ûªs to apologise, and when you left, she was crying.",9
45664,Sheldon,13," That is true. Well, I suppose I should apologize again.",9
45665,All,13, No.,9
45666,Penny,13, Is she okay?,9
45667,Raj,13," Yeah, I calmed her down, but she‰Ûªs not going to Vegas if he‰Ûªs going.",9
45668,Howard,13," Wait, that‰Ûªs an option? I didn‰Ûªt know that was an option.",9
45669,Sheldon,13," Well, that is fine, because I‰Ûªve decided that I won‰Ûªt be joining you. I‰Ûªve realized that the most genuine way to demonstrate the remorse I feel is to let you have this weekend to yourselves.",9
45670,Raj,13, That‰Ûªs very mature of you.,9
45671,Sheldon,13," Well, I‰Ûªve been on a little trip myself recently. Not to Sin City but to Sincere City. Where instead of genital warts, the only growth you‰Ûªll come back with is personal growth.",9
45672,Penny,13, And there‰Ûªs your next T-shirt.,9
45673,Scene,13, The party bus. ,9
45674,Howard,13," Ooh, check out the stripper pole.",9
45675,Bernadette,13, You know what that means.,9
45676,Leonard,13, That Raj‰Ûªll be on it before we make it to the freeway?,9
45677,Raj,13," You know it. Oo-ah, oo-ah.",9
45678,Bernadette,13, This is so cool.,9
45679,Penny,13, Here‰Ûªs some champagne.,9
45680,Leonard,13," Mm-hmm. Well, I would like to propose a toast to a well-deserved weekend of‰Û_",9
45681,Sheldon,13, Aha.,9
45682,Leonard,13, What are you doing?,9
45683,Sheldon,13," My plan was to jump out at the state line, but one of my nose plugs fell into the toilet.",9
45684,Penny,13, You couldn‰Ûªt give us just one weekend?,9
45685,Stuart,13, I told him this was a bad idea.,9
45686,Leonard,13," What do we do, kick them off?",9
45687,Penny,13," If we drop them off at a fire station, they have to take them, no questions asked.",9
45688,Sheldon,13," Before you do, please give me one more chance to apologize to Emily.",9
45689,Raj,13," Oh, God.",9
45690,Sheldon,13," Emily, as I‰Ûªm sure you know, I‰Ûªm considered an odd fellow. But what you don‰Ûªt know is that, while I often say the wrong thing, in my heart I mean well. I think that you are a smart and wonderful woman, you know? And we all think that you can do better than Koothrappali.",9
45691,Raj,13," You know, Sheldon‰Û_",9
45692,Emily,13," Shh, let him finish.",9
45693,Sheldon,13," So, for all the times I‰Ûªve offended you and all the times that I‰Ûªll offend you in the future, I‰Ûªm sorry.",9
45694,Emily,13, Thank you.,9
45695,Sheldon,13, Good. Then I‰Ûªll be leaving now.,9
45696,Emily,13," Oh, it‰Ûªs okay, Sheldon. Come with us.",9
45697,Sheldon,13," Oh, that‰Ûªs very kind of you. But I‰Ûªm sure you‰Ûªll all have a better time without me. Let‰Ûªs go, Stuart.",9
45698,Stuart,13, But I want to stay.,9
45699,Sheldon,13," Stuart, now.",9
45700,Emily,13," You know, I know he‰Ûªs a jerk, but I actually feel bad for him.",9
45701,Penny,13, And now you see the problem.,9
45702,Leonard,13," Come on, you pain in the ass.",9
45703,Sheldon,13," That‰Ûªs me. Bye, Stuart.",9
45704,Stuart,13," Wait. I‰Ûªm a pain in the ass, too.",9
45705,Scene,13, Later on the party bus.,9
45706,Sheldon,13, Are you relieved that you and Raj were able to patch things up?,9
45707,Emily,13," At the moment? No, not really.",9
45708,Penny,13," Shake it, baby.",9
45709,Bernadette,13," Ooh, work that thing.",9
45710,Scene,14, The foyer.,9
45711,Sheldon,14," Here‰Ûªs a fun Postal fact. The inner side of our mailbox is under federal jurisdiction. So, if you broke my right thumb, that‰Ûªs Pasadena city police. But if you broke my left thumb, that‰Ûªs the FBI.",9
45712,Leonard,14," If I‰Ûªm going to jail, I‰Ûªm killing him, not breaking his thumb.",9
45713,Penny,14, Yeah.,9
45714,Sheldon,14," Oh, I got a letter from my Meemaw. Umm. Smell this.",9
45715,Penny,14, What is that?,9
45716,Sheldon,14," Uh, roses, bengay, and Dr. Scholls‰Ûª foot powder.",9
45717,Penny,14," Ah, yeah, Grandma by Calvin Klein. You know, the last time I got a hand written letter it was from someone who told me I parked like a blind person.",9
45718,Leonard,14, That someone has a name.,9
45719,Sheldon,14," Uh, thank you. Oh, Meemaw got a new set of teeth. Oh, but then she found her old ones. Oh, so now the new ones are just gonna be her church teeth.",9
45720,Leonard,14, Fun. Like your Comic-Con Spock ears and your around the house Spock ears.,9
45721,Penny,14, I park fine.,9
45722,Sheldon,14," Oh, my goodness, she‰Ûªs coming to visit!",9
45723,Leonard,14," Oh, it‰Ûªll be nice to finally meet her.",9
45724,Sheldon,14," Oh, you are going to love her. She is the kindest, sweetest woman you‰Ûªll ever meet. Unless you‰Ûªre a gopher digging up her vegetable garden. In that case, you can expect to have your head bashed in with a shovel.",9
45725,Scene,14, The airport arrivals area.,9
45726,Sheldon,14, That‰Ûªs not her. That‰Ûªs not her. That‰Ûªs not her. That‰Ûªs not her. That‰Ûªs not her. That‰Ûªs not her. That‰Ûªs not her. That‰Ûªs not her.,9
45727,Leonard,14, Really? The old Asian man is not your Meemaw?,9
45728,Sheldon,14," And that‰Ûªs not helpful. You know, I got her an iPhone for Christmas. I‰Ûªll see where she is.",9
45729,Leonard,14," Oh, that‰Ûªs nice. Most people her age don‰Ûªt embrace technology.",9
45730,Sheldon,14," Oh, no, she doesn‰Ûªt even know she has it. No, I had my sister slip it in her bag so that I can track her like a sea turtle.",9
45731,Leonard,14, Same as when we lost you at the zoo.,9
45732,Sheldon,14," Uh, for the hundredth time, I smelled kettle corn and couldn‰Ûªt find the cart.",9
45733,Leonard,14, Still doesn‰Ûªt explain how you ended up on the freeway divider.,9
45734,Meemaw,14, Moon Pie.,9
45735,Sheldon,14, Meemaw. I‰Ûªm so happy to see you.,9
45736,Meemaw,14," I‰Ûªm so happy to see you, too.",9
45737,Sheldon,14," Oh. You got even smaller. I love it. Uh, Meemaw, this is Leonard. Leonard, this is my Meemaw.",9
45738,Leonard,14," Hi. So nice to finally meet you. Let me take this for you, Meemaw.",9
45739,Meemaw,14, Thank you.,9
45740,Sheldon,14," No. Oh, no. Now you call her Constance. I call her Meemaw. You have your own Meemaw. It‰Ûªs not my fault she died when you were four.",9
45741,Meemaw,14, Is that nice to say to your friend?,9
45742,Sheldon,14," It isn‰Ûªt, Meemaw. Sorry, Leonard.",9
45743,Leonard,14, Can you please live with us forever?,9
45744,Scene,14, The comic book store.,9
45745,Howard,14," That‰Ûªs ridiculous. If you had a superpower, and spent your whole life being told to suppress it, when you finally decide to embrace that power, why hide in isolation?",9
45746,Raj,14," I‰Ûªm sorry, and how much money did your version of Frozen make?",9
45747,Howard,14," I‰Ûªm just saying, instead of Let it Go, she should really sing, Look At Me Hiding in a Freezer Like a Dove Bar.",9
45748,Raj,14," She built an ice castle, made a snow monster and gave herself a complete makeover in one day. You know what I saw you do today? Eat a block of cream cheese straight from the foil and lie about it to your wife.",9
45749,Girl,14," Sorry for eavesdropping, but did you know they actually had the song Let It Go in place before they finalized the story?",9
45750,Raj,14," Yeah, that‰Ûªs true. In fact, they liked the song so much, they retooled the whole script around it.",9
45751,Girl,14, Which is probably why that movie sucks.,9
45752,Howard,14," Here we are talking about Frozen, and yet, you got burned.",9
45753,Raj,14," I‰Ûªm so sorry but, how can you not like that movie?",9
45754,Girl,14, I just think it gets more credit than it deserves.,9
45755,Howard,14," Oh, that‰Ûªs what I said an hour ago.",9
45756,Girl,14, Wow. You‰Ûªve been talking about Frozen for an hour?,9
45757,Howard,14, You should‰Ûªve seen us after The Good Dinosaur.,9
45758,Raj,14," It was a classic western set in the post-Jurassic period, and it changed my life.",9
45759,Scene,14, The apartment.,9
45760,Sheldon,14, Are you comfortable?,9
45761,Meemaw,14, Very. It‰Ûªs nice to rest after 800 flights of stairs.,9
45762,Sheldon,14," You were so cute, huffin‰Ûª and puffin‰Ûª. There‰Ûªs Amy. I just know you‰Ûªre gonna hit it off. You both have the same fashion sense. Hello. Come in, say hi to my Meemaw.",9
45763,Amy,14, Hi. Nice to meet you.,9
45764,Meemaw,14," Nice to meet you, too.",9
45765,Amy,14, How was your trip?,9
45766,Meemaw,14," Wonderful. And the pilot did such a good job, I gave him a butterscotch.",9
45767,Amy,14," That‰Ûªs great. And look at you, sitting in Sheldon‰Ûªs spot. You know, I don‰Ûªt even get to sit there.",9
45768,Sheldon,14," Yeah. And you never will. Ooh, hey, oh, ask her to do the tissue thing. Do it, ask her.",9
45769,Amy,14, Can I have a tissue?,9
45770,Meemaw,14, Of course.,9
45771,Sheldon,14, Isn‰Ûªt that the best? She‰Ûªs like Grandma Spider-Man.,9
45772,Meemaw,14, He‰Ûªs been saying that since he was little. I still don‰Ûªt know what it means.,9
45773,Sheldon,14," Oh, well, you two sit down and get to know each other. I‰Ûªll get your room ready.",9
45774,Meemaw,14," Oh, now don‰Ûªt you go looking through my suitcase for presents.",9
45775,Sheldon,14," If I did, would I find any?",9
45776,Meemaw,14, Maybe. But you also might find my brassieres and bloomers.,9
45777,Sheldon,14, That‰Ûªs a risk I‰Ûªm willing to take.,9
45778,Amy,14," Well, this is so nice. He‰Ûªs so excited to have you here and‰Û_",9
45779,Meemaw,14," Okay, now let‰Ûªs you and me get something straight. He may think that I came to bake him cookies, but the real reason is to size you up.",9
45780,Amy,14," S, s, si, size me up?",9
45781,Meemaw,14," Sheldon‰Ûªs mother may be okay with you, but I‰Ûªm not so easy.",9
45782,Amy,14," Well, I, I‰Ûªm, I‰Ûªm sure you‰Ûªll like me once you get to know me.",9
45783,Meemaw,14," Oh, you better hope so.",9
45784,Sheldon,14," A Texas Special cattle and calf car train set with authentic horn and bell. Thank you, Meemaw.",9
45785,Meemaw,14," Oh, you‰Ûªre welcome, Moon Pie.",9
45786,Sheldon,14," Amy, why don‰Ûªt you look excited? Well, you get to watch me play with this.",9
45787,Scene,14, The comic book store.,9
45788,Raj,14," Oh, I see you‰Ûªre reading Saga.",9
45789,Girl,14," Yeah, I hear it‰Ûªs pretty good.",9
45790,Raj,14," It is, and not a lot of comics have a woman with wings breastfeeding a baby right on the cover.",9
45791,Girl,14, I‰Ûªll take your word for it.,9
45792,Howard,14, You should. He‰Ûªs really looked.,9
45793,Raj,14," I‰Ûªm Raj, by the way. This is Howard.",9
45794,Howard,14, Hi.,9
45795,Girl,14, Claire.,9
45796,Raj,14," Well, I‰Ûªve never seen you here before, Claire.",9
45797,Claire,14, It‰Ûªs my first time. I‰Ûªm looking for inspiration for this movie I‰Ûªm writing.,9
45798,Howard,14, You‰Ûªre a screenwriter?,9
45799,Claire,14," Well, screenwriter, slash bartender, slash, a month away from living in my car.",9
45800,Raj,14," Yeah, I get that. I‰Ûªm a scientist, slash party planner, slash small-dog enthusiast, slash guy who probably should have stopped at scientist.",9
45801,Claire,14, You‰Ûªre really a scientist?,9
45802,Raj,14," Well, astrophysicist.",9
45803,Claire,14, That‰Ûªs perfect. Do you think I could pick your brain for my movie some time? It‰Ûªs animated sci-fi for kids.,9
45804,Raj,14, Sure. I love animated movies.,9
45805,Howard,14," He does, and he has the Lilo & Stitch collector plates to prove it.",9
45806,Raj,14, Excuse me for wanting a little magic in my life.,9
45807,Claire,14," Here‰Ûªs my number. Give me a call, we‰Ûªll get together.",9
45808,Raj,14," Yeah, great.",9
45809,Claire,14, See ya.,9
45810,Raj,14," Yeah, bye.",9
45811,Howard,14, What are you doing? You have a girlfriend.,9
45812,Raj,14, So?,9
45813,Howard,14," So, how do you think she‰Ûªd feel about you helping a beautiful girl with her screenplay?",9
45814,Raj,14, I wouldn‰Ûªt say she‰Ûªs beautiful.,9
45815,Howard,14, Really? You don‰Ûªt think she‰Ûªs attractive?,9
45816,Raj,14, I do. I just wouldn‰Ûªt tell my girlfriend.,9
45817,Scene,14, The apartment.,9
45818,Penny,14," Constance, are you sure I can‰Ûªt pour you some wine?",9
45819,Meemaw,14," Oh, no wine for me. Sheldon‰Ûªs bringing me my whiskey.",9
45820,Sheldon,14," Here you go, Meemaw. I made it just how you like, a lot in a glass.",9
45821,Meemaw,14," Thank you, Moon Pie.",9
45822,Amy,14, I‰Ûªm curious. Why do you call Sheldon Moon Pie?,9
45823,Meemaw,14, ‰Û÷Cause he‰Ûªs so nummy-nummy.,9
45824,Leonard and Penny,14, She could just eat him up.,9
45825,Sheldon,14," And I call her Meemaw because, well, just, well, look at her.",9
45826,Meemaw,14, It‰Ûªs interesting that Leonard and Penny know about his nickname and you don‰Ûªt.,9
45827,Amy,14," Oh, well, you know, now, now that I‰Ûªm hearing it, it does sound familiar.",9
45828,Sheldon,14," How could it? I never told you, and you never bothered to ask.",9
45829,Amy,14," Well, now I know.",9
45830,Sheldon,14, Yeah.,9
45831,Meemaw,14," So, Penny, I understand you have a new job.",9
45832,Penny,14, Yes. I‰Ûªm a pharmaceutical sales rep.,9
45833,Meemaw,14, Oh. It‰Ûªs so wonderful that you modern gals can have it all. A husband and a full-time career.,9
45834,Amy,14," I have a relationship and a full-time career, too.",9
45835,Meemaw,14, That doesn‰Ûªt bode well.,9
45836,Amy,14," Why not? You, you just said it‰Ûªs okay for her to work.",9
45837,Meemaw,14," Well, Leonard doesn‰Ûªt need as much tending to as Sheldon does. And as Moon Pie explained, Leonard‰Ûªs work is more of a hobby.",9
45838,Leonard,14, That‰Ûªs my best friend.,9
45839,Penny,14, Yeah.,9
45840,Amy,14," Look, I, I get that you‰Ûªre protective of your grandson, but he‰Ûªs an adult now. Maybe I understand what he needs better than you do.",9
45841,Meemaw,14," I appreciate your honesty, dear.",9
45842,Amy,14, Thank you.,9
45843,Meemaw,14, And here‰Ûªs some more honesty. I don‰Ûªt like you very much.,9
45844,Amy,14," Well, maybe I don‰Ûªt like you either.",9
45845,Amy,14, I think I should leave.,9
45846,Sheldon,14," But why? Other than you two fighting, we‰Ûªre having such a good time.",9
45847,Amy,14," The minute you left the room, your precious meemaw started giving me a really hard time. I don‰Ûªt need this.",9
45848,Meemaw,14, Let her go. And under no circumstance will you give her that engagement ring.,9
45849,Amy,14, What ring?,9
45850,Leonard,14, Maybe we should give them some privacy.,9
45851,Penny,14," Yeah, yeah, yeah. You go ahead. I‰Ûªll catch up with you.",9
45852,Amy,14, You have an engagement ring?,9
45853,Sheldon,14, Yes.,9
45854,Amy,14," Penny, did you know about this?",9
45855,Penny,14," All right, let‰Ûªs go.",9
45856,Amy,14, When did you get an engagement ring?,9
45857,Sheldon,14," My mother gave it to me, and I had been thinking about giving it to you, but then we broke up.",9
45858,Meemaw,14," Well, thank goodness for that.",9
45859,Amy,14," Sheldon, will you please tell your grandmother to stay out of this?",9
45860,Sheldon,14," Oh, I don‰Ûªt think I could do that.",9
45861,Meemaw,14," Sheldon, tell this girl that my ring will never be on her finger.",9
45862,Sheldon,14," I‰Ûªm gonna opt out of that one, too.",9
45863,Amy,14," Who said I even want to be engaged to him? And if I do, I, I don‰Ûªt need your hand-me-downs.",9
45864,Sheldon,14," All right, all right, look, l, let‰Ûªs all, let‰Ûªs remain calm and analyse this situation. Now, I realize that you‰Ûªve only known each other for less than a day, but is it possible this crankiness is because your cycles have synced?",9
45865,Meemaw,14, You leave the room and let the grown-ups talk. Now.,9
45866,Amy,14, Don‰Ûªt speak to him like he‰Ûªs a child.,9
45867,Sheldon,14, Thank you. I‰Ûªm gonna go next door and play with Leonard.,9
45868,Scene,14, Howard and Bernadette‰Ûªs kitchen.,9
45869,Bernadette,14," Okay, so you met this girl, you exchanged numbers, and you‰Ûªre gonna meet up with her.",9
45870,Raj,14, Just to help her with her screenplay.,9
45871,Bernadette,14," Oh. Well, I guess that‰Ûªs not so bad.",9
45872,Howard,14, You weren‰Ûªt there. He was really flirting.,9
45873,Raj,14," Hey, it‰Ûªs not my fault if American women project their fantasies on foreigners with the kind of magical voice that grants wishes.",9
45874,Bernadette,14, I‰Ûªm sure it was harmless. People flirt. No big deal.,9
45875,Howard,14, Really? So it‰Ûªs okay if I fl‰Û_,9
45876,Bernadette,14," Not you. I own your ass. The real question is, where are you with Emily?",9
45877,Raj,14," Uh, it‰Ûªs hard to say. I think we‰Ûªre good, but things like this make me wonder if Emily‰Ûªs really the right person for me. I mean, did you guys ever have doubts about each other?",9
45878,Howard,14, No. Never.,9
45879,Bernadette,14, Absolutely.,9
45880,Howard,14, What?,9
45881,Bernadette,14," Howie, you forget how much of our early dates involved you doing magic and me doing this.",9
45882,Howard,14," Fine. I had reservations about you, too.",9
45883,Bernadette,14," No, you didn‰Ûªt.",9
45884,Howard,14," No, I didn‰Ûªt.",9
45885,Bernadette,14," Well, it doesn‰Ûªt matter now, ‰Ûªcause I love how things worked out.",9
45886,Howard,14," Me, too. And I think you‰Ûªre even more beautiful than this rose.",9
45887,Scene,14, Penny‰Ûªs apartment.,9
45888,Penny,14," Wow. You know, the last time I saw my grandma, the most exciting thing was watching the ash of her cigarette get longer and wondering if it was gonna fall in her pudding.",9
45889,Leonard,14, Did it?,9
45890,Penny,14," Yeah, right in there. She ate it and everything.",9
45891,Sheldon,14," (Knock, knock, knock) Leonard and Penny. (Knock, knock, knock) Leonard and Penny. (Knock, knock, knock) Leonard and Penny.",9
45892,Penny,14, Come in.,9
45893,Leonard,14, Hey. What happened? Is Amy gone?,9
45894,Sheldon,14, No. They asked me to leave so they could speak privately.,9
45895,Penny,14, Uh-oh.,9
45896,Sheldon,14," Yeah, I know. It was quite tense. So here‰Ûªs the million dollar question, uh, who wants to pop over there and get my trains?",9
45897,Scene,14, Howard and Bernadette‰Ûªs kitchen.,9
45898,Raj,14," All right. I‰Ûªve made up my mind. I‰Ûªm gonna do the right thing, call this girl, and let her know that I‰Ûªm in a relationship.",9
45899,Howard,14," Okay, so far we‰Ûªve heard, made up my mind I‰Ûªm dumping Emily.",9
45900,Bernadette,14, Made up my mind to date both of them by pretending to be twin brothers.,9
45901,Howard,14," And made up my mind, I‰Ûªll ask for a threesome and if they say no, play it off as a joke.",9
45902,Raj,14, I‰Ûªm calling her. And the threesome didn‰Ûªt deserve the belly laugh it got.,9
45903,Bernadette,14, You‰Ûªre right. It could totally happen.,9
45904,Claire (voice),14, Hello?,9
45905,Raj,14," Hi. Hi. Yeah, it‰Ûªs Raj. Rajesh. We met at the comic book store.",9
45906,Claire,14," Hey, what‰Ûªs up? Figure out what time you‰Ûªre free?",9
45907,Raj,14," Actually, that‰Ûªs why I‰Ûªm calling. I, um, I just, I need to let you know that I have a girlfriend.",9
45908,Claire,14, Okay. Good for you.,9
45909,Raj,14," Well, no, no. I, I didn‰Ûªt want to mislead you after you asked me out.",9
45910,Claire,14, I didn‰Ûªt ask you out. I just need help with my screenplay.,9
45911,Raj,14," Wait, are you saying that we didn‰Ûªt have a vibe?",9
45912,Claire,14, Why do you care if we have a vibe? You have a girlfriend.,9
45913,Raj,14," Come on, I just told you I had a girlfriend. The least you can do is tell me if we had a vibe.",9
45914,Claire,14," Sure, we had a vibe.",9
45915,Raj,14," I knew it. Okay, we did have a vibe. This is exciting. What‰Ûªs my next move?",9
45916,Bernadette,14, You still have a girlfriend.,9
45917,Raj,14," Right. Good catch. Anyway, so I‰Ûªm sorry to waste your time. And, uh, and good luck with your screenplay.",9
45918,Claire,14, Hang on. We‰Ûªre both adults. We can still get together without it meaning anything.,9
45919,Raj,14," Not me. Ever since you admitted we had a vibe, I‰Ûªve been planning our wedding.",9
45920,Claire,14," Look, it‰Ûªs just coffee. I‰Ûªll ask you some questions about science, and if you propose, I promise to say no.",9
45921,Raj,14," Okay. That hurts a little, but okay.",9
45922,Claire,14, Great. I‰Ûªll text you.,9
45923,Raj,14," Bye. All right. So, uh, we‰Ûªre meeting for coffee like two adults. Everybody‰Ûªs happy. Easy peasy.",9
45924,Bernadette,14, Are you gonna tell Emily?,9
45925,Raj,14," Yeah, of course. We have no secrets.",9
45926,Howard,14, When are you gonna tell Emily?,9
45927,Raj,14, He lied about the cream cheese. He ate the whole thing. I saw him.,9
45928,Scene,14, The apartment. ,9
45929,Amy,14," Look, I know you think I‰Ûªm not right for Sheldon, but trust me, I‰Ûªm his best shot. You have no idea how much I put up with.",9
45930,Meemaw,14, I know more than you think I do.,9
45931,Amy,14, Really? You know what it‰Ûªs like to have date night ruined because Google changed their font?,9
45932,Meemaw,14," Young lady, if you think I don‰Ûªt know what it‰Ûªs like to live with a stubborn, egotistical man, then you‰Ûªre wrong. ‰Û÷Cause that was my husband.",9
45933,Amy,14, Really?,9
45934,Meemaw,14, There were days I wanted to fill his pockets with corn and toss him in the pigpen.,9
45935,Amy,14," Well, if you understand, then why are you giving me such a hard time?",9
45936,Meemaw,14," Because when you broke up with Sheldon, it hurt him deeply, and I don‰Ûªt want to see that happen again.",9
45937,Penny,14, Hi. Sorry. Sheldon would like to say something to you.,9
45938,Sheldon,14," No, I wouldn‰Ûªt.",9
45939,Leonard,14, Just get in here.,9
45940,Sheldon,14, Hello.,9
45941,Penny,14, Go ahead.,9
45942,Sheldon,14," Meemaw, look, I‰Ûªm sorry, but I have to defend my girlfriend to you.",9
45943,Amy,14," Oh, Sheldon, thank you.",9
45944,Sheldon,14," Oh, great, now you‰Ûªre gonna get emotional. I always looked up to you and Pop-Pop. I, I know what a challenging man he could be, but I saw you stand by him and-and make him into a better person.",9
45945,Meemaw,14, I did.,9
45946,Sheldon,14," Yeah, well, that is exactly what I‰Ûªve been doing the last five years with this little work in progress.",9
45947,Leonard,14," He never disappoints, does he?",9
45948,Amy,14, I think what Sheldon means to say is we‰Ûªve both grown together. Isn‰Ûªt that right?,9
45949,Sheldon,14, Well‰Û_,9
45950,Penny,14, Say yes.,9
45951,Sheldon,14, Yes.,9
45952,Meemaw,14," Fine. If you feel so strongly, I won‰Ûªt stand in your way.",9
45953,Sheldon,14, Thank you.,9
45954,Amy,14," So if he wanted to give me that engagement ring, we would have your blessing?",9
45955,Meemaw,14, I suppose.,9
45956,Sheldon,14," I just gave you my virginity, woman. Cool your jets.",9
45957,Scene,14, The comic book store.,9
45958,Raj,14," Yeah, see, if you just change the story to the destruction of our galaxy, then a super massive black hole could work.",9
45959,Claire,14, This is great. Thank you so much. I just got to figure out a way for everyone to die that isn‰Ûªt too scary for children.,9
45960,Raj,14, And that‰Ûªs how Mommy and Daddy met.,9
45961,Claire,14," Hey, did you ever tell Emily about us?",9
45962,Raj,14, I will.,9
45963,Scene,15, The cafeteria.,9
45964,Sheldon,15, Gentlemen.,9
45965,Leonard,15, Hey.,9
45966,Raj,15, Hey.,9
45967,Howard,15, Hello.,9
45968,Sheldon,15," If any of you are looking for something to do on Valentine‰Ûªs Day, Amy and I‰Ûªll be streaming our first-ever live episode of Fun With Flags. You‰Ûªre welcome to join us as we celebrate the timeless love affair between wind and flapping fabric.",9
45969,Leonard,15," Penny and I have dinner reservations that night, but any other time, no.",9
45970,Howard,15," Sorry, Bernie and I are breaking in the new hot tub, if you know what I mean.",9
45971,Sheldon,15, Not a clue. Raj?,9
45972,Raj,15, Spending Valentine‰Ûªs Day with Emily.,9
45973,Leonard,15, You don‰Ûªt sound very excited about it.,9
45974,Raj,15," Oh, I am, I am. I, I guess I‰Ûªm still wondering if Emily and I are right for each other.",9
45975,Howard,15, Does this have to do with that girl you had coffee with?,9
45976,Raj,15," You mean the strong, sexy angel I can‰Ûªt stop thinking about? Who can say?",9
45977,Howard,15, You‰Ûªve been talking about breaking up with Emily forever. Why don‰Ûªt you just do it already?,9
45978,Leonard,15," Yeah, just get it over with.",9
45979,Raj,15," Well, you say it like it‰Ûªs easy. Have any one of you ever broken up with anyone?",9
45980,Howard,15, No.,9
45981,Leonard,15, Not really.,9
45982,Sheldon,15," You know, uh, once I ordered an Uber by accident. I just got in and went somewhere.",9
45983,Scene,15, Penny‰Ûªs apartment.,9
45984,Penny,15," So, you really gonna break up with her?",9
45985,Raj,15," Yeah, I think so. Do you have any advice?",9
45986,Penny,15," Well, I have broken up with my fair share of guys. I mean, how many times did I break up with Leonard?",9
45987,Leonard,15, I stopped counting at four.,9
45988,Penny,15," All right, my advice to you is do it at her place so you can leave when you need to, uh, tell the truth, make it quick and be prepared for tears.",9
45989,Raj,15," Oh, I‰Ûªm gonna do a pre-cry before I go in there. Really dry myself out.",9
45990,Leonard,15, She meant Emily.,9
45991,Penny,15," No, I, I really didn‰Ûªt.",9
45992,Scene,15, Emily‰Ûªs apartment.,9
45993,Emily,15, You‰Ûªre seriously breaking up with me?,9
45994,Raj,15, Yeah.,9
45995,Emily,15, And you thought right before Valentine‰Ûªs Day was a good time to do it?,9
45996,Raj,15," You‰Ûªre right, let‰Ûªs talk again in a few days.",9
45997,Scene,15, Raj‰Ûªs apartment.,9
45998,Raj (on phone),15," Hey, Claire. Hi. It‰Ûªs, it‰Ûªs Rajesh. I was, I was wondering if you‰Ûªre free for Valentine‰Ûªs Day?",9
45999,Claire,15," Sorry, I just got back with my boyfriend.",9
46000,Raj,15, But I just broke up with my girlfriend.,9
46001,Claire,15, Right before Valentine‰Ûªs Day? What an ass.,9
46002,Scene,15, Emily‰Ûªs apartment. ,9
46003,Raj,15, Please take me back. Our love was meant to be.,9
46004,Scene,15, Penny‰Ûªs apartment.,9
46005,Raj,15, I‰Ûªm gonna all alone on Valentine‰Ûªs Day.,9
46006,Leonard,15," Well, you were right, tears.",9
46007,Scene,15, The apartment.,9
46008,Amy,15," Okay, and we are live in 22 minutes.",9
46009,Sheldon,15, I‰Ûªm nervous. I hope people will be around to watch even though it‰Ûªs Valentine‰Ûªs Day.,9
46010,Amy,15," People who are fans of an Internet show about flags? Trust me, they‰Ûªre around.",9
46011,Sheldon,15," Oh, and speaking of Valentine‰Ûªs Day, I haven‰Ûªt forgotten about you tonight.",9
46012,Amy,15, What do you mean?,9
46013,Sheldon,15," Well, you‰Ûªve become such an integral part of my life as well as this show, I felt it only right to include your name in the title.",9
46014,Amy,15, Oh. That is so sweet.,9
46015,Sheldon,15," So from now on, this program will be officially known as Dr. Sheldon Cooper and Dr. Amy Farrah Fowler present Dr. Sheldon‰Ûª Cooper‰Ûªs Fun With Flags.",9
46016,Amy,15, Catchy.,9
46017,Scene,15, Howard and Bernadette‰Ûªs house. ,9
46018,Howard,15, I‰Ûªm gonna check the temp on the tub.,9
46019,Bernadette,15, Don‰Ûªt make it too hot.,9
46020,Howard,15," Sorry, but too hot is the only temperature I come in.",9
46021,Bernadette,15," Look at that, you shaved it all.",9
46022,Howard,15," You‰Ûªre welcome. Um, question, this is my first hot tub, is it supposed to come with a rat flopping around in it?",9
46023,Bernadette,15," Ew, really? Get it out.",9
46024,Howard,15, How?,9
46025,Bernadette,15," Uh, wish we had a skimmer.",9
46026,Howard,15," Uh, you turn off the jets, I‰Ûªll get a strainer from the kitchen.",9
46027,Bernadette,15, I don‰Ûªt know how to turn off the jets.,9
46028,Howard,15," Good, I don‰Ûªt know where we keep the strainer.",9
46029,Scene,15, A restaurant. ,9
46030,Leonard,15," Excuse me. Uh, bad news. The maÌ¨tre d‰Ûª said it‰Ûªs gonna be at least an hour.",9
46031,Penny,15, An hour? What? That‰Ûªs crazy. We have a reservation.,9
46032,Leonard,15, I know.,9
46033,Penny,15, So what did you say?,9
46034,Leonard,15," Thanks, sorry to bother you. But I said it like a badass.",9
46035,Penny,15," All right, well, can‰Ûªt you, like, slip him some money or something?",9
46036,Leonard,15, Really? I‰Ûªve never done that before. Does it work?,9
46037,Penny,15, Do people like money? Is that what you‰Ûªre asking?,9
46038,Leonard,15, A lot of attitude from the woman who thought MC squared was a rapper.,9
46039,Penny,15," Now, is that a smart thing to say on a holiday that‰Ûªs basically national sex night?",9
46040,Leonard,15," I‰Ûªm sorry. You‰Ûªre pretty, I‰Ûªm stupid. Hello. Uh, just checking again for Hofstadter. Still gonna be an hour?",9
46041,Maitre d‰Ûª,15, I‰Ûªm afraid so.,9
46042,Leonard,15, Okay. Thanks. Hey. I think you may have dropped this?,9
46043,Maitre d‰Ûª,15, Oh. Did anybody lose a 20?,9
46044,Man,15, I did.,9
46045,Leonard,15," Oh, I took care of it.",9
46046,Scene,15, The apartment.,9

46053,Amy,15," Since we‰Ûªre live, you‰Ûªll finally be able to reach out to us with your flag thoughts and flag questions.",9
46054,Sheldon,15," Allow us to answer a few quick ones that we get all the time. Uh, uh, yes, I really am a doctor. Uh, yes, she really is my girlfriend.",9
46055,Amy,15," No, I just blink a lot, it‰Ûªs not Morse code for rescue me. Oh, uh, ok, uh, here‰Ûªs our first call. Hello, and welcome to Fun With Flags. What‰Ûªs your question?",9
46056,Raj (voice),15, What is wrong with me? Why am I so self-destructive?,9
46057,Amy,15, Rajesh?,9
46058,Raj,15," Yes. Whenever things are going well, I always find a way to ruin it. You two look happy, how do you do it?",9
46059,Amy,15," I, I think it starts with good communication.",9
46060,Sheldon,15," You know what, that‰Ûªs not a flag question. Next caller.",9
46061,Scene,15, Howard and Bernadette‰Ûªs house.,9
46062,Howard,15," I hope you don‰Ûªt think I‰Ûªm just saying this because it‰Ûªs Valentine‰Ûªs Day, but, I love you so much.",9
46063,Bernadette,15," I‰Ûªm gonna put this down your robe. It‰Ûªs not moving, but I think it‰Ûªs still alive.",9
46064,Howard,15," Well, should we put it back in there a few minutes?",9
46065,Bernadette,15," No. No, and it‰Ûªs not a rat, it‰Ûªs a rabbit. We need to save it.",9
46066,Howard,15," Well, how do we do that?",9
46067,Bernadette,15," Um, I don‰Ûªt know, look it up on your phone. I‰Ûªm gonna wrap it in a towel.",9
46068,Howard,15," Um, taking care of injured rabbit. Okay. Make sure it‰Ûªs comfortable and warm. Well, it was just in a hot tub. I‰Ûªm gonna say check.",9
46069,Bernadette,15, Anything else?,9
46070,Howard,15," To make sure it‰Ûªs not dehydrated, feed him an electrolyte solution. If it‰Ûªs not responding, use a warm cloth to wash its face and genitals. Yeah.",9
46071,Scene,15, The restaurant.,9
46072,Penny,15," This is ridiculous. You know, I‰Ûªm gonna go talk to the maÌ¨tre d‰Ûª.",9
46073,Leonard,15, What are you gonna say?,9
46074,Penny,15," I don‰Ûªt know. I‰Ûªm, I‰Ûªm gonna flirt with him.",9
46075,Leonard,15, I don‰Ûªt know if I‰Ûªm comfortable with that.,9
46076,Penny,15, I‰Ûªm still sleeping with you tonight.,9
46077,Leonard,15, See if you can get a table by the window.,9
46078,Penny,15, Hi there. What‰Ûªs your name?,9
46079,Maitre d‰Ûª,15, Glen.,9
46080,Penny,15," Oh, boy, it is crazy in here tonight, huh, Glen?",9
46081,Maitre d‰Ûª,15," Well, you know, Valentine‰Ûªs Day.",9
46082,Penny,15," Yes. Oh, bet your girlfriend is super bummed you had to work tonight. Anyway, look, we have been waiting a while, and I just‰Û_",9
46083,Maitre d‰Ûª,15," With all due respect, ma‰Ûªam, there‰Ûªs nothing I can do.",9
46084,Penny,15, You don‰Ûªt have to call me ma‰Ûªam.,9
46085,Maitre d‰Ûª,15, Okay.,9
46086,Penny,15," I mean, we‰Ûªre basically the same age.",9
46087,Maitre d‰Ûª,15, Okay.,9
46088,Penny,15, How old are you?,9
46089,Maitre d‰Ûª,15, I‰Ûªm 21. How old are you?,9
46090,Penny,15," Just shut up, Glen. Come on, let‰Ûªs get out of here.",9
46091,Leonard,15, What? Why?,9
46092,Penny,15, Because I‰Ûªm young. Let‰Ûªs go.,9
46093,Scene,15, The apartment.,9
46094,Amy,15," Rajesh, it‰Ûªs perfectly normal to have doubts after breaking up with someone.",9
46095,Raj (voice),15, You really think so?,9
46096,Sheldon,15," Yeah, you know what‰Ûªs not normal? Blubbering about emotions during a flag show. Unless that emotion is excitement over New Zealand changing their flag. Yeah, good luck, you crazy Kiwis, we‰Ûªre rooting for you.",9
46097,Amy,15, Your friend is hurting.,9
46098,Raj,15," No, Sheldon‰Ûªs right. Emily did say I always talk about my feelings too much.",9
46099,Sheldon,15," I suppose that could be a legitimate concern in a relationship. Uh, perhaps even a, a red flag. And speaking of red flags, check out this sexy number from the former Soviet Union. Hubba, hubba.",9
46100,Amy,15," Oh. Uh, we-we have another caller. Hi. You‰Ûªre on Fun with Flags.",9
46101,Barry (voice),15," Hewwo. I want to talk about how wonewy I am, too.",9
46102,Raj,15, Kripke? Is that you?,9
46103,Barry,15," Yeah, I‰Ûªm just sitting here all by myself wondering if I‰Ûªw ever find someone to share my wife with. Pwefewabwy Asian, 18-24, no fatties.",9
46104,Sheldon,15," Please, all comments and questions should be flag-related.",9
46105,Barry,15, Aw wight. Is my pole fwag-wewated?,9
46106,Sheldon,15, I don‰Ûªt see why not.,9
46107,Scene,15, Howard and Bernadette‰Ûªs house.,9
46108,Bernadette,15, He‰Ûªs eating. That‰Ûªs a good sign.,9
46109,Howard,15, You‰Ûªre gonna have to wait one hour until you can go swimming again.,9
46110,Bernadette,15, He‰Ûªs pretty cute.,9
46111,Howard,15, He is. Should we name him?,9
46112,Bernadette,15, It is Valentine‰Ûªs Day. How about Valentino?,9
46113,Howard,15," Nice. A classic rabbit name. Peter Rabbit, Roger Rabbit. Valentino Wolowitz Rabbit. Oh, look at all that chest hair and overbite. Of course you‰Ûªre a Wolowitz. Son of a bitch, he bit me.",9
46114,Bernadette,15, Are you okay?,9
46115,Howard,15," No, I‰Ûªm not okay. Wild rabbits can have rabies.",9
46116,Bernadette,15," Oh. Well, why did you put your finger near its mouth?",9
46117,Howard,15," Poor judgement, obviously.",9
46118,Bernadette,15, He‰Ûªs so little. I‰Ûªm sure it‰Ûªs fine.,9
46119,Howard,15, How can it be fine? I just got attacked by a clearly anti-Semitic wild animal.,9
46120,Scene,15, Leonard‰Ûªs car.,9
46121,Leonard,15," It‰Ûªs not what we planned, but this isn‰Ûªt so bad, right?",9
46122,Penny,15, It is freaking amazing.,9
46123,Leonard,15," Well, glad you‰Ûªre feeling better.",9
46124,Penny,15," I was just hungry and cranky, and I‰Ûªve never been called ma‰Ûªam before.",9
46125,Leonard,15, Is that a big deal?,9
46126,Penny,15, Kind of. When was the first time someone called you sir?,9
46127,Leonard,15," Sixth grade, but I wore a sport coat and carried a briefcase, so‰Û_",9
46128,Penny,15," Can you believe when I met you I was 22? I mean, it‰Ûªs crazy. Where did all that time go?",9
46129,Leonard,15," Mm, you watched The Bachelor a lot.",9
46130,Penny,15," Yeah, go ahead and make jokes, but your thirties are almost over.",9
46131,Leonard,15," No, they‰Ûªre not.",9
46132,Penny,15, You‰Ûªre closer to 40 than you are 30.,9
46133,Leonard,15," Ha, ha. You married an old man. Tell you what. Let‰Ûªs do something fun tonight.",9
46134,Penny,15, Won‰Ûªt make us any younger.,9
46135,Leonard,15," Well, maybe not, but some day we actually will be old, and we‰Ûªll look back on this night and remember what a good time we had.",9
46136,Penny,15," Okay, like what?",9
46137,Leonard,15, I know. Food fight. I‰Ûªll keep thinking.,9
46138,Scene,15, The apartment.,9
46139,Amy,15," Look, I know you both feel bad about being alone, but sometimes the best thing you can do is take a little time for yourself, especially when you just got out of a relationship.",9
46140,Sheldon,15," Speaking of ending relationships, when British Honduras became Belize, they designed a new flag with a tree on it, and I would like to hang myself from that tree.",9
46141,Raj,15," But, Amy, when you and Sheldon split up, didn‰Ûªt you start dating someone right away?",9
46142,Amy,15," Well, I, I wouldn‰Ûªt say right away.",9
46143,Sheldon,15," And actually, it was three different men.",9
46144,Barry,15," Thwee diffewent men? Damn, girl, way to give the milk away?",9
46145,Amy,15," Oh, looks like we just lost Kripke.",9
46146,Barry,15," No, actuawwy, I‰Ûªm stiw here.",9
46147,Amy,15, Now?,9
46148,Barry,15, Yup.,9
46149,Amy,15, Now?,9
46150,Barry,15, Yup.,9
46151,Amy,15," Now? Oh, looks like we just lost Kripke.",9
46152,Raj,15," Before Emily, I was alone for so long. I just, I don‰Ûªt know if I can do that again.",9
46153,Sheldon,15," Well, you know, here is something that might cheer you up. The flag of the Isle of Man is nothing but three legs sharing a weird pair of underpants, so you think you got problems.",9
46154,Amy,15," I have an idea. Maybe someone in our audience would be interested in meeting Rajesh. Ladies, I can attest that he is a kind, handsome, intelligent‰Û_",9
46155,Raj,15," Rich parents, don‰Ûªt forget, rich parents.",9
46156,Amy,15," ‰Û_spoiled astrophysicist who not only‰Û_ oh. Well, that was quick. Hi. You‰Ûªre on Fun with Flags.",9
46157,Barry,15," Hey, I think I got cut off.",9
46158,Amy,15," Hello, Kripke.",9
46159,Barry,15, I have a fwag question. How many men did you have sex with?,9
46160,Scene,15, Leonard‰Ûªs car.,9
46161,Leonard,15," Let‰Ûªs see. What‰Ûªs young and fun? Uh, we could go dancing.",9
46162,Leonard,15, Are you actually gonna dance?,9
46163,Leonard,15, Of course.,9
46164,Penny,15," Yeah. No one wants to see that. Hey, how about skinny dipping at the beach?",9
46165,Leonard,15," No, I don‰Ûªt need any fish nibbling my business.",9
46166,Penny,15," Oh, there‰Ûªs a screening of Moulin Rouge, I heard the crowd sings along and stuff.",9
46167,Leonard,15, That sounds fun. When‰Ûªs it start?,9
46168,Penny,15, Midnight.,9
46169,Leonard,15, Midnight. Really? You know what? Let‰Ûªs do it.,9
46170,Penny,15," Okay, great. Oh, wait. Uh, it‰Ûªs sold out.",9
46171,Leonard,15," Oh, thank God.",9
46172,Penny,15, Yes.,9
46173,Scene,15, Howard and Bernadette‰Ûªs house.,9
46174,Howard,15," It says, rabies in rabbits is highly unlikely.",9
46175,Bernadette,15," Oh, terrific.",9
46176,Howard,15," It‰Ûªs not terrific. Lots of highly unlikely things happen. You saw what‰Ûªs under this robe, and you still married me.",9
46177,Bernadette,15," If you‰Ûªre really worried, we‰Ûªll take him to the vet and have him tested.",9
46178,Howard,15," Good. Thank you. Oh, okay, there is a test. All they have to do is cut off his head and check his brain.",9
46179,Bernadette,15," Oh, cut off his head? That‰Ûªs where his little nose is.",9
46180,Howard,15, He‰Ûªs not showing any symptoms. I guess I‰Ûªll just go to the emergency room to be safe.,9
46181,Bernadette,15," Howie, this is just your hypochondria.",9
46182,Howard,15," No, when I sat on the mute button and thought I‰Ûªd gone deaf, that was my hypochondria.",9
46183,Bernadette,15, We‰Ûªll find another time to tell him I‰Ûªm pregnant.,9
46184,Scene,15, The apartment.,9
46185,Raj (voice),15," I mean, this is the first time I‰Ûªve ever broken up with someone. I just, I didn‰Ûªt realize it was gonna hurt this much.",9
46186,Amy,15, It really can.,9
46187,Sheldon,15," All right. Nothing about this is fun. No one wants to talk about flags, and I haven‰Ûªt spoken in over ten minutes, so, enjoy your new show, Internet. Dr. Amy Farrah Flower present with.",9
46188,Raj,15, I‰Ûªm sorry for bothering you. I‰Ûªll hang up now.,9
46189,Amy,15," No, hold on, Rajesh. You know, you‰Ûªre not being very sympathetic. You know first hand that breakups are hard.",9
46190,Sheldon,15," Fine. If you insist on making me a part of this, yes, I knowledge how painful they can be. However, pain has an evolutionary purpose. It provides information from the environment that, uh, behaviour isn‰Ûªt good for us.",9
46191,Barry,15, Wike when I feww in wove with that stwipper and bought her a Pwius.,9
46192,Amy,15, I‰Ûªm just gonna push all the buttons.,9
46193,Sheldon,15," Raj, now, I‰Ûªm sorry you‰Ûªre suffering. When Amy and I were broken up, I also suffered. And this may sound surprising, but I‰Ûªm grateful for having gone through it.",9
46194,Amy,15, Really?,9
46195,Sheldon,15, Yes. I believe our relationship now is stronger than ever.,9
46196,Amy,15, So do I.,9
46197,Sheldon,15," When, when we were apart, I learned how important you are to me. And I realize that when two people are in love, sometimes they‰Û_",9
46198,Leonard and Penny,15, Happy Valentine‰Ûªs Day!,9
46199,Leonard,15, We are young and fun.,9
46200,Sheldon,15, I stand corrected. Fun.,9
46201,Scene,15, The apartment.,9
46202,Sheldon,15, Congratulations on a successful live show.,9
46203,Amy,15, And a lovely Valentine‰Ûªs Day.,9
46204,Penny,15, Cleaning up is not young and fun.,9
46205,Leonard,15, It can be. Confetti fight. Maybe you should take a break. I got this.,9
46206,Sheldon,15, Did you know the singular of confetti is confetto?,9
46207,Amy,15," Interesting, and when would you use the singular?",9
46208,Sheldon,15," I‰Ûªm glad you asked. Amy, you have a confetto in your nose. No, no, no, no. Other side. There you go.",9
46209,Scene,16, Howard and Bernadette‰Ûªs kitchen.,9
46210,Howard,16, Morning.,9
46211,Bernadette,16, Morning.,9
46212,Howard,16, We? What is this?,9
46213,Bernadette,16, I don‰Ûªt know. Maybe it says something on the back.,9
46214,Howard,16," Continued on milk. If you‰Ûªre tricking me into making my own breakfast, it didn‰Ûªt work for my mom, and it won‰Ûªt work for you. Are. We are. See spoons for more.",9
46215,Bernadette,16, What could it be? We are Groot? We are the champions? We are family? I got all my sisters with me?,9
46216,Howard,16, Are you serious?,9
46217,Bernadette,16, Yeah.,9
46218,Howard,16, Are you sure?,9
46219,Bernadette,16," Pretty positive. That‰Ûªs a joke, because the pregnancy test says‰Û_",9
46220,Howard,16," Oh, my God. This is incredible. We‰Ûªre gonna be parents? We‰Ûªre gonna get to board planes first. Finally gonna get to see what‰Ûªs in that family bathroom at the mall.",9
46221,Bernadette,16," I know, it‰Ûªs crazy.",9
46222,Howard,16," It is crazy. Oh. I mean, how do you prepare for something like this? I‰Ûªm not even sure I‰Ûªve held a baby before.",9
46223,Bernadette,16," Oh, it‰Ûªs okay, you‰Ûªll figure it out.",9
46224,Howard,16," But how‰Ûªs this all gonna work? Do we get a nanny? I mean, can we afford a nanny? And if we can, we can‰Ûªt get a pretty one, ‰Ûªcause it‰Ûªll wreck our marriage. We can‰Ûªt get an ugly one, ‰Ûªcause it‰Ûªll scare the kid.",9
46225,Bernadette,16," I don‰Ûªt know, Howie.",9
46226,Howard,16," Are we in a good school district? You‰Ûªre Catholic, I‰Ûªm Jewish. What religion do we raise it? And if it‰Ûªs a boy, do we get him circumcised? People say it‰Ûªs barbaric, but if we don‰Ûªt, it looks like a pig in a blanket.",9
46227,Bernadette,16," Calm down, it‰Ûªs gonna be okay.",9
46228,Howard,16," How‰Ûªs it gonna be okay? Look at me, I‰Ûªm a mess. And that means this baby‰Ûªs gonna be half a mess. And that‰Ûªs even before we screw it up with our cut-rate moderately attractive nanny.",9
46229,Scene,16, The apartment.,9
46230,Leonard,16," Hey, Raj, I read a couple of guys in your department may have discovered a new planet in our solar system?",9
46231,Sheldon,16," Oh, I heard about that. Why didn‰Ûªt you discover it?",9
46232,Raj,16," Because instead of being in the telescope room, I was busy making you guys home made jam for the holidays.",9
46233,Sheldon,16," Well, you be sure to let us know when you win the Nobel Prize for boysenberry.",9
46234,Leonard,16, Hey.,9
46235,Sheldon,16, Hello.,9
46236,Raj,16," Hey, bud.",9
46237,Leonard,16, Ready to play when you are.,9
46238,Howard,16," Yeah, um, in a minute. I actually need to tell you guys something.",9
46239,Raj,16," If it‰Ûªs thank you for the home made jam you got in December, congratulations, you‰Ûªre the first one.",9
46240,Leonard,16, What‰Ûªs going on?,9
46241,Howard,16," I‰Ûªm, uh, uh, gonna be a father.",9
46242,Leonard,16, What? Congratulations.,9
46243,Raj,16, That‰Ûªs so amazing.,9
46244,Sheldon,16," Oh, no.",9
46245,Leonard,16," Why oh, no?",9
46246,Sheldon,16," Because this changes everything. What about comic book night? Uh, what about playing games together? What about our trips to Disneyland? How can we do those things with a child around?",9
46247,Leonard,16," Relax, there‰Ûªs room for two babies in this group.",9
46248,Sheldon,16," Oh, dear lord, Penny‰Ûªs pregnant, too?",9
46249,Leonard,16, You‰Ûªre the other baby.,9
46250,Sheldon,16," Oh, really? Okay, well, would a baby have to shave once every 11 days?",9
46251,Leonard,16, Would an adult refuse to eat his graham crackers because one of them was broken?,9
46252,Sheldon,16, I guess we‰Ûªll call this a draw.,9
46253,Scene,16, Howard and Bernadette‰Ûªs patio.,9
46254,Bernadette,16," So, I‰Ûªm glad you guys are here. There‰Ûªs something I want to share with you. Howie and I are going to‰Û_",9
46255,Penny (reading text),16, Leonard says you‰Ûªre pregnant.,9
46256,Amy,16, What?,9
46257,Penny,16," Don‰Ûªt say anything. act surprised when she tells you. All right, how you want to do this?",9
46258,Bernadette,16, I‰Ûªm pregnant.,9
46259,Penny,16," Oh, my God, I can‰Ûªt believe it.",9
46260,Amy,16, This is so exciting.,9
46261,Bernadette,16," Yeah, it‰Ûªs all real exciting.",9
46262,Penny,16," Are, are you not happy about this?",9
46263,Bernadette,16," I am. Of-of course I am. I‰Ûªm, I‰Ûªm sure it‰Ûªs just the hormones. But it‰Ûªs weird, Howie‰Ûªs the one who‰Ûªs been talking about having kids for years, and I was all excited to tell him because I thought he‰Ûªd be thrilled, but then he started to flip out and now this feels like a bad idea and I‰Ûªm gonna get fat.",9
46264,Penny,16," No, no, come on. Come on, you‰Ûªre not gonna get fat. You‰Ûªre gonna be beautiful and glowing and, and have the cutest little baby bump ever.",9
46265,Bernadette,16," Easy for you to say, skinny bitch. Sorry, hormones.",9
46266,Penny,16," Oh, that‰Ûªs all right. All I heard was skinny.",9
46267,Amy,16, I wouldn‰Ûªt make too much out of Howard not reacting the way you expected him to.,9
46268,Penny,16," Yeah, I‰Ûªm sure it was just the initial shock of it all.",9
46269,Bernadette,16," You‰Ûªre probably right. After we talked about it, he started to calm down.",9
46270,Scene,16, The apartment. ,9
46271,Howard,16, I shouldn‰Ûªt be raising a kid. I don‰Ûªt even eat my own vegetables.,9
46272,Leonard,16," Buddy, I, I think you might be overreacting.",9
46273,Howard,16," And then there‰Ûªs this nose. I mean, what if he looks like me? Or worse, what if she looks like me?",9
46274,Sheldon,16, Not to mention the impact on our social circle. Everything‰Ûªs going to change. Howard won‰Ûªt be able to come over as much.,9
46275,Raj,16," Well, he could bring the baby here.",9
46276,Sheldon,16," Oh, but then we‰Ûªd have to baby-proof the apartment. You know, my sister has one of those toilet locks in her bathroom. I have two doctorates, I still had to go in the sink.",9
46277,Howard,16," Oh, my God, and do you have any idea how expensive having a kid is?",9
46278,Raj,16," I read that in Los Angeles, raising a child through college can cost over a million dollars.",9
46279,Howard,16," A million dollars? God, it‰Ûªs like my nuts just kicked me in the nuts. That‰Ûªs it, I got to start earning more money right now.",9
46280,Raj,16," I know, you could ask Bernadette for a raise in your allowance.",9
46281,Howard,16, This isn‰Ûªt a joke.,9
46282,Raj,16, I wasn‰Ûªt joking.,9
46283,Leonard,16, It‰Ûªll be fine. People have kids every day. You‰Ûªll figure this out.,9
46284,Raj,16," Yeah, come on, this is great news and you know it.",9
46285,Howard,16," You‰Ûªre right, it is, I‰Ûªm just a little overwhelmed right now.",9
46286,Leonard,16," Hey, you know what we should do?",9
46287,Sheldon,16, All get vasectomies so this doesn‰Ûªt happen to us?,9
46288,Leonard,16, Go out and celebrate. But not your worst idea.,9
46289,Scene,16, Howard and Bernadette‰Ûªs patio.,9
46290,Amy,16," Hey, let‰Ûªs go do something to get your mind off this.",9
46291,Penny,16," Yeah, yeah, we should go out.",9
46292,Bernadette,16, Where?,9
46293,Penny,16," Uh, I don‰Ûªt know, a bar?",9
46294,Bernadette,16, Can‰Ûªt drink.,9
46295,Penny,16," We can, but all right.",9
46296,Amy,16, Are you hungry? How about that sushi place you love?,9
46297,Bernadette,16, Doctor said I can‰Ûªt have sushi.,9
46298,Penny,16," Okay, look, we don‰Ûªt have to go anywhere. We can just, you know, stay here and hang out in the hot tub.",9
46299,Bernadette,16, Doctor said I can‰Ûªt go in the hot tub.,9
46300,Amy,16," Maybe you should get a new doctor. What, he said you can‰Ûªt laugh either?",9
46301,Scene,16, A bar.,9
46302,Raj,16," I‰Ûªd like to propose a toast to our friend, Howard, his, um, his big heart, his beautiful soul‰Û_",9
46303,Leonard,16, And his tight little pants that somehow did not make him sterile.,9
46304,All,16, Cheers.,9
46305,Howard,16," Well, look at this. I bet whoever invented tiny umbrellas doesn‰Ûªt have to worry about money. He can have all the kids he wants.",9
46306,Sheldon,16, And can keep a small portion of their heads dry.,9
46307,Howard,16," If I‰Ûªm gonna have any chance of raising this kid, I need to come up with a big idea to make some money.",9
46308,Leonard,16, There‰Ûªs no reason you can‰Ûªt.,9
46309,Howard,16, That‰Ûªs easy for you to say. You and Sheldon already came up with your superfluid helium model.,9
46310,Leonard,16, That‰Ûªs just research. We‰Ûªre never gonna make any money from it.,9
46311,Sheldon,16, Forget helium. The real superfluid is the fruit punch in this mug. Reminds me of my daddy‰Ûªs secret don‰Ûªt tell mama juice.,9
46312,Leonard,16," Uh, these are strong, you should slow down.",9
46313,Sheldon,16, Oh. I‰Ûªll just take one last sip. Ah.,9
46314,Scene,16," The same, later.",9
46315,Howard,16," Okay, how about this for an invention, slightly bigger cocktail umbrellas.",9
46316,Leonard,16, How is that a new invention?,9
46317,Howard,16," I don‰Ûªt know, all Apple does is change the size of things and we keep buying them.",9
46318,Raj,16, It‰Ûªs true. I like my giant iPad and my little iPad almost as much as my regular-sized iPad.,9
46319,Sheldon,16, This place is terrific. Why. why have we never been here before?,9
46320,Leonard,16, The same reason we don‰Ûªt do a lot of fun stuff. You.,9
46321,Sheldon,16, That‰Ûªs some smart talk from a guy who can‰Ûªt even keep his face in focus. Where‰Ûªs the bathroom?,9
46322,Raj,16," Uh, it‰Ûªs in the corner.",9
46323,Sheldon,16," Excuse me. Hey, how you doin‰Ûª?",9
46324,Raj,16, I hope the bathroom is clearly marked.,9
46325,Leonard,16, Doesn‰Ûªt matter. He‰Ûªs headed for the kitchen anyway.,9
46326,Howard,16," Maybe that‰Ûªs an idea, guidance systems for drunk people.",9
46327,Raj,16, They have that. It‰Ûªs called Uber.,9
46328,Howard,16," Hey. In your supercooled helium experiments, did you create quantum vortices?",9
46329,Leonard,16, Yeah. Why?,9
46330,Howard,16," Well, if you made a guidance system, couldn‰Ûªt you use those vortices as a gyroscope?",9
46331,Leonard,16, Wow. I‰Ûªve never thought about that.,9
46332,Howard,16," And since it‰Ûªs in a quantum state, it would maintain an infinite persistence.",9
46333,Raj,16," Groundbreaking revelations, tropical drinks. Tell me this isn‰Ûªt like the best episode of Sex and the City.",9
46334,Leonard,16, You may have actually just come up with something.,9
46335,Howard,16, You think so?,9
46336,Leonard,16, I really do.,9
46337,Sheldon,16," You guys, the bathroom here is amazing. There‰Ûªs people cooking in it.",9
46338,Scene,16, Howard and Bernadette‰Ûªs patio.,9
46339,Amy,16, Think about all the fun things you get to do when you have a baby.,9
46340,Penny,16," Yeah, yeah, you get to buy toys and little clothes.",9
46341,Bernadette,16, I kind of already do that for Howie.,9
46342,Penny,16," And whenever you‰Ûªre hungry, you‰Ûªll be in a minivan with Cheerios all over the floor.",9
46343,Amy,16," Oh, and I just found a new travel cup for Sheldon. It only lets out three at a time. So, when did you guys decide to get pregnant?",9
46344,Bernadette,16," Well, we didn‰Ûªt exactly decide. We were talking about it, and then one night we got a little reckless.",9
46345,Penny,16," Oh, tell us.",9
46346,Amy,16," Yeah, tell us.",9
46347,Bernadette,16," No, I‰Ûªm embarrassed.",9
46348,Penny,16," Oh, come on, we‰Ûªre all grown-ups. We‰Ûªve all done it.",9
46349,Amy,16," Me, me, me too. I‰Ûªm a grown-up and I‰Ûªve done it.",9
46350,Bernadette,16," Fine. We were out one night, and things got a little spontaneous.",9
46351,Amy,16," Oh, that sounds juicy.",9
46352,Bernadette,16," Well, Sheldon was going on and on about time zones and railroad schedules, and I went out‰Û_",9
46353,Penny,16," Wait, I remember that. Hang on. You did it at our place?",9
46354,Bernadette,16, Kind of on Sheldon‰Ûªs bed.,9
46355,Amy,16, What?,9
46356,Penny,16, No.,9
46357,Bernadette,16," I was headed to the bathroom, and I passed Howie on his way out. Usually he says, do not go in there, but this time he said, hey, let‰Ûªs go in here.",9
46358,Amy,16, How could you do that?,9
46359,Bernadette,16," I‰Ûªm sorry, but you know what it‰Ûªs like when you‰Ûªre with your man and one thing leads to another.",9
46360,Amy,16, I do know what that‰Ûªs like. I really do.,9
46361,Scene,16, The bar.,9
46362,Leonard,16, I‰Ûªm not seeing anyone using liquid helium vortices like this.,9
46363,Howard,16, I‰Ûªm not finding anything either.,9
46364,Raj,16, It‰Ûªs a good sign.,9
46365,Sheldon,16," Oh, wait, I found something.",9
46366,Howard,16, Damn. What is it?,9
46367,Sheldon,16," This video. The baby panda sneezes, and the mama panda gets so scared.",9
46368,Leonard,16, Can you focus on what we‰Ûªre talking about?,9
46369,Sheldon,16," All right. Look, now, this may be the rum talking, but as long as the unpinning rate of the vortices is kept within 1.1 and 1.3, the Magnus force issue should be negligible.",9
46370,Raj,16," Even drunk, he‰Ûªs still smarter than all of us.",9
46371,Sheldon,16, And stronger. Who wants to see me beat up the bartender?,9
46372,Leonard,16, I‰Ûªd enjoy that.,9
46373,Sheldon,16," Nah, she‰Ûªs a good kid.",9
46374,Howard,16," If this is a viable thing, we could get a patent and license it to companies that make guidance systems.",9
46375,Raj,16, Look at that. You‰Ûªve known you‰Ûªre gonna be a father for less than a day and you‰Ûªre already stepping up.,9
46376,Leonard,16," I‰Ûªm telling you, you got this.",9
46377,Howard,16, Maybe you‰Ûªre right.,9
46378,Sheldon,16, Of course he‰Ûªs right. You and I both know how hard it is growing up without a father. That‰Ûªs why I‰Ûªm confident you‰Ûªre gonna be the best dad you can be.,9
46379,Howard,16," Thank you, Sheldon.",9
46380,Sheldon,16," You‰Ûªre welcome. And if he has twins, we can do all kinds of neat experiments on them.",9
46381,Scene,16, Howard and Bernadette‰Ûªs hot tub.,9
46382,Bernadette,16, You guys can go in if you want.,9
46383,Penny,16," No, we‰Ûªre a team. If you can‰Ûªt go in, we‰Ûªre not going in.",9
46384,Amy,16, Then why are we drinking?,9
46385,Penny,16," Okay, it‰Ûªs not like she‰Ûªs got the Christ child in there, all right? (Checking text) Oh. It‰Ûªs Leonard. He says Sheldon‰Ûªs drunk and they‰Ûªre gonna do karaoke if we want to join them.",9
46386,Bernadette,16, That sounds fun.,9
46387,Amy,16," Oh, no. Sheldon‰Ûªs drunk texting me.",9
46388,Penny,16, What‰Ûªs it say?,9
46389,Amy,16, Would you like to sing karaoke with us.,9
46390,Bernadette,16, How is that a drunk text?,9
46391,Amy,16, He used a period instead of a question mark. He‰Ûªs so wasted.,9
46392,Scene,16, The bar.,9
46393,Raj (rapping),16," Your movie‰Ûªs showing, so you‰Ûªre going. Could care less about the five you‰Ûªre blowing. Theatre gets dark just to start the show. You spot a fine woman sitting in your row, she‰Ûªs dressed in yellow, she says hello, come sit next to me, you fine fellow. You run over there without a second to lose, and what comes next, hey, bust a move.",9
46394,Leonard (singing),16," You want it, you got it, oh, you want it, baby you got it",9
46395,Raj,16," Just bust a move,",9
46396,Leonard,16," You want it, you got it, oh, you want it, baby you got it",9
46397,Raj,16," Just bust a move,",9
46398,Leonard,16," You want it, you got it, oh, you want it, baby you got it",9
46399,Penny,16," Hey, guys. Congratulations.",9
46400,Howard,16, Thank you.,9
46401,Amy,16, Hi. How are you doing?,9
46402,Sheldon,16," Wonderful. I‰Ûªm being musically encouraged to bust a move. If I knew what that meant, I might just do it.",9
46403,Howard,16, I‰Ûªm really glad you‰Ûªre here. Can we talk?,9
46404,Bernadette,16, Sure.,9
46405,Penny,16," So, you gonna get up there later?",9
46406,Sheldon,16," A microphone, a room full of inaccurate depictions of Polynesian religion, and a captive audience to hear about it? You bet I am.",9
46407,Howard,16, I‰Ûªm sorry I freaked out this morning. I want you to know I‰Ûªm done being scared.,9
46408,Bernadette,16," It‰Ûªs okay to be nervous. I am, too.",9
46409,Howard,16," Thank God, ‰Ûªcause I was lying, you might not have to wait nine months to see someone soil their pants. But I‰Ûªm also really excited. I mean it.",9
46410,Bernadette,16," Me, too.",9
46411,Howard,16, I love you. Mmm. And I‰Ûªm not just saying that because your breasts are gonna get bigger.,9
46412,Scene,16," The same, later.",9
46413,Penny (singing),16," Are we an item? Girl, quit playin‰Ûª.",9
46414,Amy (singing),16," We‰Ûªre just friends, what are you sayin‰Ûª?",9
46415,Penny (singing),16, Say there‰Ûªs another and look right in my eyes.,9
46416,Amy (singing),16, My first love broke my heart for the first time.,9
46417,Together,16," And I was like, baby, baby, baby, ooh, like, baby, baby, baby, no, like, baby, baby, baby, ooh, I thought you‰Ûªd always be mine.",9
46418,Scene,16," The same, later.",9
46419,Howard (singing),16," Baby, I need your lovin‰Ûª, got to have all your lovin‰Ûª. Baby, I need your lovin‰Ûª, got to have all your lovin‰Ûª.",9
46420,Scene,16," The same, later.",9
46421,Raj (singing),16," Ooh, baby, baby, baby, baby. Ooh, baby, baby, baby, baby.",9
46422,Leonard (singing),16," Ah, push it.",9
46423,Bernadette,16," I appreciate this, but you really‰Û_",9
46424,Leonard (singing),16, Push it real good.,9
46425,Scene,16," The same, later.",9
46426,Sheldon (singing),16," Land where my fathers died, land of the pilgrims‰Ûª pride, from every mountainside let freedom ring.",9
46427,Scene,16," The same, later.",9
46428,Howard,16," I‰Ûªd like to dedicate my last song of the evening to my wife, best friend, and now the mother of our child. I love you, Bernie. (Singing) Havin‰Ûª my baby, what a lovely way of sayin‰Ûª how much you love me. Havin‰Ûª my baby, what a lovely way of sayin‰Ûª what you‰Ûªre thinkin‰Ûª of me.",9
46429,Sheldon,16, You‰Ûªre kidding. What kind of maniacs have coitus in someone else‰Ûªs bedroom?,9
46430,Howard,16," Thank you, Pasadena. Good night.",9
46431,Scene,16, The apartment.,9
46432,Penny,16, That was such a fun night.,9
46433,Leonard,16, Probably ‰Ûªcause you got to see your man up there rockin‰Ûª the mic.,9
46434,Penny,16," Yeah, yeah. I was a little surprised when you decided to beat-box.",9
46435,Leonard,16, Oh. That was really an asthma attack. I just sold it.,9
46436,Penny,16," Well, I am so happy for Howard and Bernadette.",9
46437,Leonard,16," Me, too. So, you ever think about it?",9
46438,Penny,16," Babies? Well, I‰Ûªm not in a rush but someday, yeah, sure. What about you?",9
46439,Leonard,16, I think we‰Ûªd make amazing parents.,9
46440,Sheldon,16, Will you guys keep it down?,9
46441,Penny,16," On the other hand, we might lack a certain maturity.",9
46442,Scene,17, The stairwell,9
46443,Amy,17," So Sheldon, there‰Ûªs something I‰Ûªve been wanting to talk about but I know it‰Ûªs kind of a touchy subject.",9
46444,Leonard,17, Way to narrow it down to everything.,9
46445,Sheldon,17, What is it?,9
46446,Amy,17," Well, your birthday‰Ûªs coming up, and you‰Ûªve never let us celebrate it, and I was hoping maybe this year we could.",9
46447,Sheldon,17," Oh, I suppose that‰Ûªs a discussion we could have.",9
46448,Amy,17," Okay, great, I mean, it doesn‰Ûªt have to be a big party or anything. I was just, where‰Ûªd he go?",9
46449,Penny,17," W, wait a minute. You mention his birthday and he vanishes?",9
46450,Leonard,17," Well, where‰Ûªs that information been this whole time?",9
46451,Scene,17, The apartment. ,9
46452,Penny,17," Well, where is he?",9
46453,Amy,17, Sheldon?,9
46454,Leonard,17, I‰Ûªll check his room.,9
46455,Sheldon,17, Surprise.,9
46456,Penny,17," Oh, my God.",9
46457,Sheldon,17," Just one example of how birthdays can be terrible. Now, can we please drop this subject and pick a new one? I suggest how thick can a soup get before it becomes a stew? You know, the answer, it may surprise you.",9
46458,Amy,17, I‰Ûªm sorry I brought it up.,9
46459,Penny,17," Yeah, what is the problem? Is it about getting older?",9
46460,Sheldon,17," Please, look at this porcelain skin. I‰Ûªm like a human sink.",9
46461,Amy,17, But it‰Ûªs the one day a year that‰Ûªs just all about you.,9
46462,Leonard,17, One day. Right.,9
46463,Amy,17, Can you please just tell me why?,9
46464,Sheldon,17," Fine. As you know, I have a twin sister with whom I obviously share a birthday. Every year we‰Ûªd have a party. No one I invited would ever come, because they didn‰Ûªt like me.",9
46465,Amy,17, I‰Ûªm sorry.,9
46466,Sheldon,17," Oh, that part wasn‰Ûªt so bad. I didn‰Ûªt like them, either. But then I‰Ûªd inevitably spend the whole day being tortured by my sister‰Ûªs friends.",9
46467,Penny,17," Oh, poor thing.",9
46468,Sheldon,17," When I was six, they told me Batman was coming to my party. I waited by the door for hours. Closest thing to Batman I saw was when a robin flew into the window.",9
46469,Amy,17, You realize none of those things would happen now?,9
46470,Sheldon,17," I do, but why do you care if I celebrate my birthday at all?",9
46471,Amy,17," Well, you made my last birthday so memorable, I wanted to return the favour.",9
46472,Penny,17," You know, if you had a party now, you have plenty of friends that would love to come.",9
46473,Leonard,17," And we live here, so we have no choice.",9
46474,Penny,17, Yeah.,9
46475,Sheldon,17," Very well. You may celebrate my life by throwing a party with cake, presents and a shower of admiration and love. But then you owe me big-time.",9
46476,Scene,17, The comic book store.,9
46477,Howard,17, You have any idea what you‰Ûªre getting Sheldon for his birthday?,9
46478,Raj,17, He‰Ûªs been fascinated with dinosaurs lately. Maybe we could get him a fossil.,9
46479,Leonard,17," Well, just don‰Ûªt get anything Jurassic. He feels like that whole chunk of time has gone Hollywood. Hey, uh, you know, he told a sad story about how his sister tricked him into thinking Batman was coming to his party.",9
46480,Howard,17, That‰Ûªs funny. Let‰Ûªs do that.,9
46481,Leonard,17, Maybe we could get Batman to actually show up.,9
46482,Raj,17," You mean, some guy in a lame suit?",9
46483,Leonard,17," Or a real Batman. Hey, Stuart? Didn‰Ûªt you try to get Adam West to do a signing here once?",9
46484,Stuart,17," Yeah, but there was kind of a scheduling conflict. He, uh, wanted to know when he‰Ûªd get paid. And I wouldn‰Ûªt tell him.",9
46485,Leonard,17, Can I get his contact info?,9
46486,Stuart,17," Sure, uh, but just so you know, he‰Ûªs kind of a diva.",9
46487,Leonard,17, He is?,9
46488,Stuart,17," Oh, yeah. Won‰Ûªt take the bus. He won‰Ûªt pack his own lunch. Won‰Ûªt let you spend the night on his couch.",9
46489,Scene,17, The apartment.,9
46490,Amy,17," Okay, so how do you feel about party balloons?",9
46491,Sheldon,17," Uh, Mylar balloons, yes. Latex balloons, no. Water balloons, I will jump off the roof and aim for your car.",9
46492,Penny,17," All right, what about music?",9
46493,Sheldon,17, I enjoy marching bands and Tibetan throat singing.,9
46494,Penny,17, No music it is.,9
46495,Bernadette,17, What kind of cake do you like?,9
46496,Sheldon,17," Well, my favourite is chocolate with strawberry frosting, three layers, and if there‰Ûªs writing on it, make sure it‰Ûªs not all caps. I don‰Ûªt need my dessert yelling at me.",9
46497,Scene,17, Leonard‰Ûªs car.,9
46498,Raj,17," Hey, so what was Adam West like on the phone?",9
46499,Leonard,17," Uh, nice guy. But it was a little weird to hear Batman say don‰Ûªt ring the doorbell or my poodles will go crazy.",9
46500,Raj,17," You know, Adam West is my favourite Batman? Well, after Michael Keaton, Christian Bale and Batman from The Lego Movie.",9
46501,Howard,17, Don‰Ûªt say that to him.,9
46502,Raj,17," What? He beat out George Clooney, and that‰Ûªs something. Like, I love me some Clooney.",9
46503,Leonard,17, Don‰Ûªt say that to anyone.,9
46504,Scene,17, The apartment.,9
46505,Penny,17," Thank you so much for helping us, Stuart.",9
46506,Stuart,17," Oh, I, I was just glad to be invited. To be honest, I don‰Ûªt always feel like I‰Ûªm part of the group.",9
46507,Penny,17," Okay, sweetie, we‰Ûªre on the clock here. Can you hate yourself and frost at the same time?",9
46508,Barry,17," Hewwo, I hope I‰Ûªm not too earwy.",9
46509,Bernadette,17," No, no, no. Come on in.",9
46510,Barry,17, And how is the wadiant mommy-to-be?,9
46511,Bernadette,17, Doing great.,9
46512,Stuart,17," You, you‰Ûªre pregnant?",9
46513,Bernadette,17, Yeah.,9
46514,Stuart,17, Sounds like something a member of the group might know.,9
46515,Penny,17," Yeah, birthday party first. Pity party later.",9
46516,Scene,17, Leonard‰Ûªs car.,9
46517,Leonard,17, Are you crazy? How can you put Michael Keaton in front of Christian Bale?,9
46518,Adam West,17," Oh, please. Even my poodles know Bale‰Ûªs overrated.",9
46519,Raj,17, Thank you. That‰Ûªs why I say Keaton‰Ûªs number one. He brought a sense of humour to the role.,9
46520,Adam,17," Oh, if you‰Ûªre gonna factor in a sense of humour, then I should be at the top of the list. It should be me, Keaton, Kilmer, Lego, Bale, and that pretty boy Clooney.",9
46521,Howard,17," Really? You‰Ûªre ahead of Bale? The man who personified the words, I‰Ûªm Batman.",9
46522,Adam,17," I never had to say I‰Ûªm Batman. I showed up, people knew I was Batman. Everywhere I went, on the TV show, mall openings, Julie Newmar‰Ûªs bungalow.",9
46523,Leonard,17," I‰Ûªm sold, you‰Ûªre ahead of Bale.",9
46524,Adam,17," There‰Ûªs another reason I should be higher on the list. All those other guys had muscles built into their costumes. All I had in my Batsuit was 100%, grade-A West.",9
46525,Howard,17, Can we just all agree we‰Ûªre worried about Affleck?,9
46526,Leonard,17, Sure.,9
46527,Raj,17," Yeah, of course.",9
46528,Adam,17, What‰Ûªs an Affleck?,9
46529,Scene,17, Penny‰Ûªs apartment.,9
46530,Sheldon,17, Is there a reason I had to leave my own apartment?,9
46531,Amy,17," Well, I think they just want you to see it for the first time all decorated.",9
46532,Sheldon,17, But who‰Ûªs gonna tell them they‰Ûªre doing it wrong?,9
46533,Amy,17," Well, I‰Ûªm, I‰Ûªm sure they‰Ûªll ask you to give a speech, and that‰Ûªs when you just tear ‰Ûªem a new one. Have to say, you, you do look good in that suit.",9
46534,Sheldon,17, Oh. Thank you.,9
46535,Amy,17," Maybe later I‰Ûªll, uh, get to see you in your birthday suit.",9
46536,Sheldon,17, But this is my birthday suit. Are you having a stroke? Because that‰Ûªs the kind of thing that just ruins a birthday party.,9
46537,Scene,17, The apartment.,9
46538,Leonard,17," So, Mother, I‰Ûªm surprised you came all this way for Sheldon‰Ûªs birthday.",9
46539,Beverley,17," Oh, I was happy to. He did come to my 60th.",9
46540,Leonard,17, Oh. You had a party for your 60th?,9
46541,Beverley,17," Oh, I wouldn‰Ûªt call it a party. Just a few close friends. And your sister and brother.",9
46542,Penny,17," You know, to be fair, we did get married in Vegas and didn‰Ûªt invite her.",9
46543,Beverley,17," And I never did thank you for that, dear.",9
46544,Scene,17, Penny‰Ûªs apartment.,9
46545,Amy,17, Oh. Penny says everyone‰Ûªs there. Are you ready?,9
46546,Sheldon,17, I am. Oh. Wait.,9
46547,Amy,17, Are you all right?,9
46548,Sheldon,17," No, I just, I got a little light-headed.",9
46549,Amy,17," Oh, do you need a minute?",9
46550,Sheldon,17," No. No, if I can walk past that pet shop with the parrot in the window, I suppose I can do this.",9
46551,All,17, Happy birthday!,9
46552,Leonard,17, Speech! Speech!,9
46553,Raj,17," Come on, Sheldon, say something.",9
46554,Sheldon,17," Uh, um, uh, thank you all so much for coming. Beverly. Wil Wheaton. Adam West, for some reason.",9
46555,Leonard,17, Batman finally came to your party.,9
46556,Adam,17," Happy birthday, Sherman.",9
46557,Sheldon,17, Thank you. This is all so thoughtful. Excuse me.,9
46558,Adam,17," I still get paid, don‰Ûªt I?",9
46559,Scene,17, A little later.,9
46560,Leonard,17," Okay, I‰Ûªd better go in there and talk to him.",9
46561,Amy,17," Well, don‰Ûªt you think I‰Ûªm the one who should go in?",9
46562,Leonard,17," No offence, but I‰Ûªve known the guy a really long time.",9
46563,Amy,17," Well, I‰Ûªve, you know, seen him without pants on.",9
46564,Leonard,17," Again, no offence, but so have I.",9
46565,Amy,17," Well, he‰Ûªs seen me without pants on.",9
46566,Leonard,17," Again, no‰Û_",9
46567,Penny,17," Okay, this is ridiculous. (Knocking) Sheldon? Can I come in?",9
46568,Sheldon,17, How do you know I‰Ûªm not using the facilities?,9
46569,Penny,17," Because you e-mail me your bathroom schedule once a week, even though I‰Ûªve clicked unsubscribe, like, a thousand times. So, what‰Ûªs going on?",9
46570,Sheldon,17," I don‰Ûªt know. I looked around the room, and I saw all the faces and the presents, and it, it was just too much.",9
46571,Penny,17," I get that. Hey, you want to just bring a few people in here? You know, Wil Wheaton in the bathtub, Batman on the toilet. It‰Ûªll be like the weirdest Comic-Con ever.",9
46572,Sheldon,17, I know that you worked hard to put this together. I‰Ûªm sorry I‰Ûªm ruining it.,9
46573,Penny,17," Oh, pl, you‰Ûªre not ruining it. Look, at some point, Raj will try to get everyone to do the Electric Slide. Now, that will ruin it.",9
46574,Sheldon,17, I don‰Ûªt think I can go back out there.,9
46575,Penny,17," That‰Ûªs fine. You know, I hate that your sister and her friends used to torture you. But what I hate even more is, if I was there, I would have tortured you, too.",9
46576,Sheldon,17," Based on this pep talk, I‰Ûªd say you‰Ûªre still doing it.",9
46577,Penny,17," My point is, there was a time I never would‰Ûªve been friends with someone like you, and now you are one of my favourite people. So, if what you need is to spend your birthday in a bathroom, I‰Ûªm happy to do it with you.",9
46578,Sheldon,17," Well, everyone will think I‰Ûªm weird.",9
46579,Penny,17," Sweetie, you are weird. Everyone knows you‰Ûªre weird, but they‰Ûªre all still here because they care about you so much.",9
46580,Barry (knocking),17, Hewwo. Some of us need to check our hair because we might have a shot with Weonard‰Ûªs mother.,9
46581,Scene,17, Later. ,9
46582,Leslie Winkle,17, Leonard.,9
46583,Leonard,17, Hey.,9
46584,Leslie,17, It‰Ûªs been a while.,9
46585,Leonard,17, Leslie. I can‰Ûªt remember the last time we talked. So much has changed.,9
46586,Leslie,17, Has it?,9
46587,Leonard,17," Yeah, uh, um, Penny and I got married.",9
46588,Leslie,17," Wow, congratulations. You know, actually, I thought you‰Ûªd be living with Sheldon forever.",9
46589,Leonard,17," Yeah, well, don‰Ûªt be a stranger.",9
46590,Penny,17," Okay, everybody, Sheldon is gonna come back out, but I think he‰Ûªs a little embarrassed, so let‰Ûªs all be extra nice, okay?",9
46591,Barry,17, What are you wooking at me for? I‰Ûªm a saint. But a sinner in the sack.,9
46592,Sheldon,17," Hello, everyone. I, I‰Ûªd like to apologize for my behaviour. I hope it hasn‰Ûªt put a damper on the party. So, please, enjoy yourselves. Oh, this is quickly getting out of hand.",9
46593,Amy,17," If I may, I, I‰Ûªd like to propose a toast. Um, thank you all for coming tonight. I know it‰Ûªs customary for the birthday boy to receive presents, but I feel like I got the greatest gift the day he was born.",9
46594,Sheldon,17," Aw, Amy, that was lovely. You know, this is fun. Let‰Ûªs do more. Someone else say something wonderful about me.",9
46595,Howard,17," Sheldon, I don‰Ûªt think everyone‰Û_",9
46596,Sheldon,17," Wolowitz, perfect. Everyone listen to Wolowitz.",9
46597,Howard,17," Okay, then, uh, Sheldon, we‰Ûªve known each other a long time. And it is a pleasure to work with you and call you my friend.",9
46598,Sheldon,17," Little generic. Keep thinking. We‰Ûªll circle back. Wil Wheaton, go.",9
46599,Wil,17," Sheldon, I know that we‰Ûªve had our ups and downs, but I can honestly say that my life is so much more interesting because you are in it. We may have met because you are a fan of Star Trek. But I have become a fan of Sheldon Cooper. Live long and prosper, buddy. And happy birthday.",9
46600,Sheldon,17," That‰Ûªs how you do it, Wolowitz. Now you see why he‰Ûªs famous and you‰Ûªre not.",9
46601,Beverley,17," Sheldon, I know the future holds great things for you, and we all can‰Ûªt wait to see what they are. Happy birthday, dear.",9
46602,Barry,17, Someone caw Animal Contwol. There‰Ûªs a cougar on the woose.,9
46603,Beverley,17," Barry, stop.",9
46604,Leonard,17," Seriously, Barry, stop.",9
46605,Raj,17," And it was Gandhi who said, live as if you were to die tomorrow. Learn as if you were to live forever.",9
46606,Sheldon,17, And it was Sheldon Cooper who said let‰Ûªs speed this up. A lot of people want to talk.,9
46607,Leslie,17," Uh, in the past, I would‰Ûªve said something obnoxious, like, happy birthday, dumbass. But I‰Ûªm not gonna do it. You and I have both grown a lot, and it‰Ûªs just so nice to see you all again. So, happy birthday, Sheldon.",9
46608,Sheldon,17," Oh. Oh, now, you know I hate change. Say it.",9
46609,Leslie,17," Happy birthday, dumbass.",9
46610,Adam,17," Happy birthday, young man. And if any of you have enjoyed seeing me here today, I‰Ûªm also available for Comic-Cons, bachelor parties, bar mitzvahs‰Û_",9
46611,Bernadette,17," I can‰Ûªt think of anything to say that hasn‰Ûªt already been said, so, here‰Ûªs to you, Sheldon.",9
46612,Sheldon,17," Thank you, Bernadette. That was perfect.",9
46613,Howard,17, What? You gotta be kidding me?,9
46614,Leonard,17," Sheldon, we‰Ûªve been together so long, it‰Ûªs hard to remember a time you weren‰Ûªt in my life. And believe me, I try. You make me laugh. You make me a better scientist. You make me crazy. You‰Ûªre more than just my roommate, you‰Ûªre my brother.",9
46615,Sheldon,17, Thank you.,9
46616,Leonard,17," Happy birthday, buddy.",9
46617,Sheldon,17," Thank you. That, that was wonderful.",9
46618,Penny,17," Oh, wait, wait, wait. Stuart didn‰Ûªt get to speak.",9
46619,Stuart,17," Oh, oh, okay. Um, uh, Sheldon, I‰Ûªve spent most of my life feeling invisible, but having you and everyone‰Û_",9
46620,Amy,17," Hey, everybody, listen up.",9
46621,Penny,17, You nailed it.,9
46622,Amy,17, We‰Ûªve got someone who couldn‰Ûªt be here but really wanted to wish you a happy birthday.,9
46623,Stephen Hawking (on Skype),17," Hello, Sheldon.",9
46624,Sheldon,17, Professor Hawking.,9
46625,Stephen,17, Happy birthday to you.,9
46626,Sheldon,17, Thank you so much. I can‰Ûªt believe you‰Ûªre‰Û_,9
46627,Stephen,17, Happy birthday to you.,9
46628,Sheldon,17," Oh, you‰Ûªre singing. Well, I‰Ûªm sorry.",9
46629,Stephen,17," Happy birthday, dear Sheldon.",9
46630,Leonard,17," Uh, Professor Hawking, if you just give us one second, we‰Ûªll light the candles, and we can all sing together.",9
46631,Stephen,17," I was crushing it, but all right.",9
46632,Penny,17," Okay, while they get the cake, Sheldon, I just want to say, I hope you didn‰Ûªt think you were gonna get through tonight without a hug.",9
46633,Sheldon,17," You know, I used to hate these hugs. Now they‰Ûªre just extremely irritating.",9
46634,Leonard,17," Ready when you are, Professor Hawking.",9
46635,Stephen,17," And a one, and a two‰Û_",9
46636,All,17," Happy birthday to you,",9
46637,Adam,17," So, who‰Ûªs taking me home?",9
46638,Scene,18, Outside the University legal office.,9
46639,Howard,18," Okay, I gotta ask, why are you wearing a bow tie?",9
46640,Sheldon,18, I‰Ûªve never applied for a patent before. I wanted to make a good impression.,9
46641,Howard,18, Is the impression that your first name is Pee-Wee?,9
46642,Sheldon,18," Yeah, well, you‰Ûªre an engineer. End of joke, burn.",9
46643,Attorney,18," Come on in, fellas.",9
46644,Howard,18," See, he‰Ûªs not wearing a tie.",9
46645,Leonard,18," Well, he‰Ûªs a patent attorney. Maybe his tie is pending.",9
46646,Attorney,18," So, I‰Ûªve reviewed your paperwork, and it seems like we‰Ûªve got everything we need to file a patent for your infinite persistence gyroscope.",9
46647,Sheldon,18, That‰Ûªs great.,9
46648,Howard,18, Excellent.,9
46649,Leonard,18, So what happens next?,9
46650,Attorney,18," Well, the legal team needs to review existing patents to avoid overlap.",9
46651,Howard,18," Oh, I don‰Ûªt think there will be.",9
46652,Leonard,18," Yeah, we did our own search.",9
46653,Attorney,18," That‰Ûªs nice, but I think ours might be a bit more thorough.",9
46654,Sheldon,18, Get a load of this guy.,9
46655,Howard,18, Can you imagine if we make money with this?,9
46656,Leonard,18," If we do, I am splurging on the best sinus irrigator money can buy.",9
46657,Howard,18," That old sad story, guy gets a little money, goes straight up his nose.",9
46658,Attorney,18, Just need you to review and sign this document acknowledging that you understand the university will own 75% of the patent.,9
46659,Howard,18, Seventy-five percent?,9
46660,Sheldon,18, That‰Ûªs outrageous. This is our idea based on our research. How can you possibly justify owning a majority share?,9
46661,Attorney,18, It‰Ûªs university policy.,9
46662,Sheldon,18, I know when I‰Ûªm beat.,9
46663,Leonard,18," Hold on, hold on. So the three of us do all the work and only end up with 25%?",9
46664,Attorney,18," Dr. Hofstadter, this university has been paying your salaries for over ten years. Did you think we do that out of the goodness of our hearts?",9
46665,Leonard,18," Well, until you just said that mean thing, kinda.",9
46666,Attorney,18," And as far as Mr. Wolowitz is concerned, I‰Ûªm afraid as a federal employee on loan from NASA, your name can be on the patent, but you‰Ûªre not entitled to an ownership share.",9
46667,Howard,18," Wait, so this can turn out to be a financial success, and I get nothing?",9
46668,Attorney,18," Well, sometimes they give you a plaque.",9
46669,Sheldon,18," Well, that‰Ûªs not fair. We should all get plaques.",9
46670,Leonard,18," Sorry, but we can‰Ûªt sign this.",9
46671,Howard,18," Come on, let‰Ûªs go.",9
46672,Leonard,18, Thank you for your time.,9
46673,Sheldon,18, Couple of questions about the plaque.,9
46674,Scene,18, Penny‰Ûªs apartment.,9
46675,Amy,18," So, have you been having any morning sickness?",9
46676,Bernadette,18, A little. And it doesn‰Ûªt help that I‰Ûªve got this heightened sense of smell.,9
46677,Penny,18, Is that a pregnancy thing?,9
46678,Bernadette,18," Yeah. The other day I sniffed out where Howie hid the Girl Scout cookies. No more Tagalongs, my ass.",9
46679,Penny,18, But now you‰Ûªll be able to make your own milk to eat the cookies with.,9
46680,Raj,18," Hey, guys. Hey, Penny. I really appreciate you helping me with this. I don‰Ûªt know what to do.",9
46681,Penny,18," Oh, sure. Let me see it.",9
46682,Amy,18, See what?,9
46683,Raj,18," I hadn‰Ûªt spoken to Emily since I broke up with her, and she left this on my doorstep with a note.",9
46684,Penny,18," Raj, I got you this before we split up, but couldn‰Ûªt return it and thought you‰Ûªd like to have it. Happy belated Valentine‰Ûªs Day, Emily.",9
46685,Bernadette,18, That‰Ûªs nice.,9
46686,Penny,18," Nice, or is she trying to manipulate him?",9
46687,Raj,18," I know. I mean, do I open it? Do I return it?",9
46688,Amy,18, Why wouldn‰Ûªt you open it?,9
46689,Raj,18," Well, she was pretty mad. For all I know it‰Ûªs a voodoo doll of me with a fork stuck in my junk.",9
46690,Bernadette,18," You don‰Ûªt think she‰Ûªd actually send you something gross or dangerous, do you?",9
46691,Penny,18, I know one way to find out. Sniff this.,9
46692,Amy,18," She‰Ûªs pregnant, she‰Ûªs not a bloodhound.",9
46693,Bernadette,18, Although I am getting a little machine oil. I think it‰Ûªs metal.,9
46694,Penny,18," Come on, just open it.",9
46695,Raj,18," You know, on Game of Thrones, Balon Greyjoy received his son‰Ûªs genitals in a box.",9
46696,Penny,18," Well, never hurts to have a spare.",9
46697,Bernadette,18, What is that?,9
46698,Raj,18, Wow. It‰Ûªs an antique sextant. Sailors used these to find their position by the stars.,9
46699,Amy,18, What a nice gift for an astrophysicist.,9
46700,Raj,18," I know, she‰Ûªs so thoughtful.",9
46701,Penny,18," See, she‰Ûªs trying to get you back. Now, that is exactly what I would‰Ûªve gotten you if I had any idea what it is or what you do.",9
46702,Raj,18," You know, I have too much self-esteem to let this girl guilt me into getting back together with her.",9
46703,Amy,18, You don‰Ûªt need to be pregnant to smell that load of crap.,9
46704,Scene,18, The apartment.,9
46705,Leonard,18," Well, what if we go around the university and just get the patent ourselves?",9
46706,Howard,18," We can‰Ûªt. It says on their Web site, as long as we work there, they have a controlling ownership of anything we come up with.",9
46707,Sheldon,18," Great, so they own my idea for a T-shirt that says Dumb as a Bag of Geologists.",9
46708,Leonard,18," Well, our choices are we do this with the university or we don‰Ûªt do it at all.",9
46709,Howard,18," Either way, I get nothing.",9
46710,Leonard,18," Or, if we ended up making money from this, Sheldon and I could split our shares with you.",9
46711,Sheldon,18," To be clear, Leonard is referring to the gyroscope, not the T-shirt and mugs. Oh, now they own the mugs.",9
46712,Howard,18, I guess that is a way around this. You guys would be cool doing it like that?,9
46713,Leonard,18," Of course, we can split any profits three ways.",9
46714,Sheldon,18, I‰Ûªm fine with that.,9
46715,Howard,18," Okay, great.",9
46716,Sheldon,18," It sounds like a, uh, contract might be in order.",9
46717,Leonard,18," Sure, we could write something up.",9
46718,Sheldon,18, But which one of us should be the party who‰Û_,9
46719,Howard,18," You can do it, Sheldon.",9
46720,Sheldon,18, So stipulated.,9
46721,Leonard,18, Once I found a stash of contracts under his bed. It was weird.,9
46722,Scene,18, Penny‰Ûªs apartment.,9
46723,Bernadette,18, I wonder how much she spent on this.,9
46724,Amy,18," Ooh, let‰Ûªs find out.",9
46725,Raj,18, It doesn‰Ûªt matter. It‰Ûªs the thought that counts.,9
46726,Penny,18," Yeah, yeah, and beauty‰Ûªs on the inside, size doesn‰Ûªt matter, how much she spend?",9
46727,Raj,18," Seriously, guys, I don‰Ûªt want to know.",9
46728,Amy,18," Oh, my.",9
46729,Raj,18," Oh, come on, you can‰Ûªt say oh my, and then not tell me.",9
46730,Amy,18, These things go for five hundred dollars and up.,9
46731,Bernadette,18, Damn. All I got for Valentine‰Ûªs Day was a postcard saying my Vermont Teddy Bear was back-ordered.,9
46732,Penny,18," Okay, so, she drops off a five hundred dollar gift and she‰Ûªs not trying to get back together with you?",9
46733,Raj,18, Maybe you‰Ûªre right.,9
46734,Bernadette,18, Or she‰Ûªs telling the truth and just being nice.,9
46735,Raj,18," Maybe you‰Ûªre right. Wow, I am easy to manipulate. (Phone rings) Oh, guys, it‰Ûªs Emily. What should I do?",9
46736,Penny,18," Okay, answer it. Just be strong. And if she starts to cry, don‰Ûªt make any promises. And most importantly, put it on speaker so we can hear.",9
46737,Raj,18, Hello?,9
46738,Emily (voice),18," Hey, it‰Ûªs Emily. Is this a good time?",9
46739,Raj,18," Yeah, yeah. Sure. What‰Ûªs up?",9
46740,Emily,18, Was it okay I left that gift? I‰Ûªm really hoping we can be friends.,9
46741,Raj,18," Maybe, maybe.",9
46742,Emily,18," Um, you think you‰Ûªd want to grab a cup of coffee? Hello?",9
46743,Raj,18," I‰Ûªm sorry, I seem to be taking an annoying amount of time deciding how I feel about this.",9
46744,Emily,18," I just, I miss hanging out with you. It‰Ûªs not like I lost a friend, it‰Ûªs like I lost my best friend. Is there any chance you‰Ûªd want to come over?",9
46745,Raj,18," I‰Ûªm sorry, I don‰Ûªt think that‰Ûªs a good idea.",9
46746,Emily,18," Okay. I‰Ûªm just, I‰Ûªm having a really hard time, but that‰Ûªs not your problem, that‰Ûªs mine. I, I won‰Ûªt bother you again, but please know that you‰Ûªll always have a place in my heart. Bye, Raj. You‰Ûªre a good guy.",9
46747,Raj,18," Good-bye, Emily. That was rough, you guys.",9
46748,Penny,18," I know, but you did it. I‰Ûªm so proud of you.",9
46749,Raj,18," Well, anyway, I‰Ûªll leave you to your girls‰Ûª night.",9
46750,Amy,18, Are you sure you don‰Ûªt want to stay here with us?,9
46751,Raj,18," No, I kind of feel like being alone right now.",9
46752,Bernadette,18," Well, if you change your mind, we‰Ûªll be here.",9
46753,Raj,18, Thank you.,9
46754,Penny,18, Say hi to Emily for us.,9
46755,Raj,18, Will do.,9
46756,Scene,18, The apartment.,9
46757,Howard,18, This contract looks good to me.,9
46758,Sheldon,18," I‰Ûªll say it looks good. It‰Ûªs in my proprietary font, Shelvetica.",9
46759,Leonard,18," I want to say something obnoxious, but it is easy on the eyes.",9
46760,Bernadette,18," I‰Ûªm a little tired, Howie. You ready to go?",9
46761,Howard,18," Yeah, one sec. I just need to sign this contract.",9
46762,Bernadette,18, What is it?,9
46763,Howard,18," Well, we ran into a problem about my share of the patent, so we‰Ûªre forming a partnership to split anything we make equally.",9
46764,Penny,18," Sheldon, did you draft the contract?",9
46765,Sheldon,18, You bet I did.,9
46766,Penny,18, Ooh. You‰Ûªre gonna make out so hard tonight.,9
46767,Bernadette,18," So, you‰Ûªre just gonna sign this without having a lawyer look at it?",9
46768,Sheldon,18, Excuse me. I‰Ûªve been drafting contracts since kindergarten. Didn‰Ûªt need a lawyer to get me out of finger painting. Don‰Ûªt need one now.,9
46769,Bernadette,18," I know, but‰Û_",9
46770,Howard,18," Bernie, the guys were nice enough to find a way to keep me from being cut out.",9
46771,Bernadette,18," Well, I should hope so. The whole thing was your idea.",9
46772,Amy,18," Well, to be fair, Howard‰Ûªs idea was based on Sheldon‰Ûªs math.",9
46773,Leonard,18," Guys, everyone is involved in thios, okay? Howard‰Ûªs invention, Sheldon‰Ûªs math, my original theory that space-time was like a supercooled liquid. Which I‰Ûªm sure Penny would‰Ûªve mentioned if she wasn‰Ûªt working on that hangnail right now.",9
46774,Penny,18, What?,9
46775,Howard,18," Honey, this is fine.",9
46776,Bernadette,18," If you want to sign a contract that Sheldon whipped up, go ahead.",9
46777,Howard,18, Can I talk to you in the hall?,9
46778,Bernadette,18, Sure.,9
46779,Howard,18, Excuse us.,9
46780,Sheldon,18," Hey, Leonard.",9
46781,Leonard,18, What?,9
46782,Sheldon,18," If she doesn‰Ûªt think that we should apply for this patent, she‰Ûªs being patently absurd.",9
46783,Leonard,18, Good one.,9
46784,Sheldon,18," Okay, you got it. See, I was afraid it was a thinker.",9
46785,Howard,18, What are you doing?,9
46786,Bernadette,18, I just want to make sure you‰Ûªve thought this through.,9
46787,Howard,18, What‰Ûªs to think about? We have an invention and want to move forward.,9
46788,Bernadette,18," Howie, you‰Ûªre about to form a legal partnership with Sheldon Cooper.",9
46789,Howard,18," All right, if you‰Ûªre gonna calmly make excellent points, then I don‰Ûªt know if I want to talk to you. Okay. I get it. And it‰Ûªs sweet that you‰Ûªre worried about me, but I can take care of myself.",9
46790,Bernadette,18, I‰Ûªm not worried about you. I‰Ûªm worried about me. I don‰Ûªt want to go through this pregnancy listening to you complain about Sheldon driving you crazy more than you already do.,9
46791,Howard,18, Here we go with the ironclad logic again.,9
46792,Bernadette,18, You‰Ûªve tried to work with him before. It hasn‰Ûªt gone well. Why is this time gonna be any different?,9
46793,Howard,18, Is the foetus helping you? ‰Û÷Cause that‰Ûªs cheating.,9
46794,Scene,18, Raj‰Ûªs car.,9
46795,Raj (answering phone),18, Hello?,9
46796,Claire,18," Hey, Raj. It‰Ûªs Claire. How are you?",9
46797,Raj,18," Hi. I‰Ûªm good. Really good. Well, I don‰Ûªt know why I said really good. I‰Ûªm just regular good. I really just wanted to sound confident. And that really was a real really, not a fake really like the first really.",9
46798,Claire,18, Really?,9
46799,Raj,18," I don‰Ûªt know. I lost track and I missed my exit. So, uh, so what‰Ûªs up?",9
46800,Claire,18," Well, last time we talked, I had just gotten back together with my boyfriend, and I wanted to let you know that things didn‰Ûªt work out.",9
46801,Raj,18, Really? I‰Ûªm sorry. I swear I know other words.,9
46802,Claire,18, So if you were still interested.,9
46803,Raj,18," Yes. Indeed. Absolutely. Indubitably. I‰Ûªm not even sure what the last one means, but it‰Ûªs another word, and I know it. So, uh, when do you want to meet up?",9
46804,Claire,18," Uh, I‰Ûªm almost off work. What are you doing now?",9
46805,Raj,18," Right now, well, well, actually, to, to be completely honest, I‰Ûªm stopping by to see my ex-girlfriend because she‰Ûªs having a tough time. But it‰Ûªs not like we‰Ûªre getting back together or anything.",9
46806,Claire,18," Let me guess, the worst part about breaking up is that she doesn‰Ûªt have her best friend to talk to any more?",9
46807,Raj,18, That‰Ûªs exactly what she said. How do you know that?,9
46808,Claire,18," I‰Ûªm a girl. It‰Ûªs, like, page one out of the playbook.",9
46809,Raj,18, Any chance you could send me a PDF of that playbook?,9
46810,Scene,18, The apartment.,9
46811,Leonard,18, They‰Ûªve been out there a while.,9
46812,Amy,18, I hope everything‰Ûªs okay.,9
46813,Sheldon,18, I wonder what they‰Ûªre talking about.,9
46814,Penny,18," If you guys would shut up, I could tell you. Oh. Be cool, be cool, be cool.",9
46815,Howard,18, Hey.,9
46816,Sheldon,18, Hello.,9
46817,Leonard,18, You guys all right?,9
46818,Howard,18," Yeah. But, um, we were talking, and I‰Ûªm a little concerned about the three of us forming a partnership.",9
46819,Sheldon,18, Are you suggesting a limited liability corporation? ‰Û÷Cause I did not L-L-see that coming.,9
46820,Howard,18," Sheldon, my concern is not with the money or anything. It‰Ûªs, it‰Ûªs with how you treat me.",9
46821,Sheldon,18," Well, I believe I‰Ûªm treating you generously. That‰Ûªs why I‰Ûªve stipulated in the contract that your contributions to our invention are as valuable as my own.",9
46822,Bernadette,18, Are you saying that his contributions aren‰Ûªt as valuable as yours?,9
46823,Sheldon,18," No, I am not saying that, because I kept saying that this morning and Leonard said stop saying that.",9
46824,Howard,18, See? This is what happens every time we work together.,9
46825,Penny,18," You know what, hang on. What if Sheldon had no choice but to be respectful?",9
46826,Leonard,18, What? Is there a switch on the back of his neck we don‰Ûªt know about?,9
46827,Penny,18, No. What I‰Ûªm saying is you could add a clause to the contract that he can‰Ûªt make fun of Howard.,9
46828,Bernadette,18, How would you enforce it?,9
46829,Sheldon,18," Oh, please. Any contract I sign is enforced by my own personal code of ethics.",9
46830,Amy,18, And his obsessive-compulsive disorder.,9
46831,Sheldon,18," Yeah, that, too. And scoot over. Part of your shadow‰Ûªs on my spot.",9
46832,Leonard,18," Howard, what do you think?",9
46833,Howard,18, I‰Ûªm on board.,9
46834,Sheldon,18," I‰Ûªll add it right now. Oh, baby, it‰Ûªs addendum time.",9
46835,Scene,18, Raj‰Ûªs car.,9
46836,Emily (voice),18, Hello?,9
46837,Raj,18," Hey, Emily, listen, I‰Ûªve been thinking, and I‰Ûªm not sure it‰Ûªs a good idea that I come over.",9
46838,Emily,18, Oh. Okay. I understand.,9
46839,Raj,18," No, no. Please don‰Ûªt cry.",9
46840,Emily,18," Okay, I‰Ûªll stop.",9
46841,Claire,18, Hello?,9
46842,Raj,18," Hey, so, listen, Claire, change of plans‰Û_",9
46843,Claire,18," Fine. Do what you want, but she‰Ûªs playing you.",9
46844,Raj,18, I don‰Ûªt think so. She sounded pretty upset.,9
46845,Claire,18," You mean like, I was just really looking forward to seeing you. I‰Ûªm having such a rough day.",9
46846,Raj,18," Emily, listen, I‰Ûªm sorry, but I can‰Ûªt come by.",9
46847,Emily,18, Why not?,9
46848,Raj,18," I think we both know if I come over, we‰Ûªre gonna get back together and‰Û_",9
46849,Emily,18, I told you I needed a friend. What do you think is happening here?,9
46850,Raj,18, Call you right back.,9
46851,Scene,18, The apartment.,9
46852,Sheldon,18," The, the revisions I made start on page four.",9
46853,Penny,18, Wow. That is a lot of whereupons.,9
46854,Amy,18, You should see the Valentine‰Ûªs Day card he gave me.,9
46855,Howard,18," Article three, as it pertains to this project, Dr. Sheldon Cooper promises to abstain from all insulting or disrespectful language directed toward Howard Wolowitz, including but not limited to mockery of engineering, his height, his hair, his wardrobe, and his insane belief that the Ghost Rider movie was, quote, not that bad.",9
46856,Leonard,18," Hang on. Maybe there should be a no insult clause about me, too.",9
46857,Sheldon,18, Do you still like cilantro?,9
46858,Leonard,18, Yeah.,9
46859,Sheldon,18, You‰Ûªre tying my hands here.,9
46860,Howard,18," All right, let‰Ûªs sign this.",9
46861,Penny,18," Wait, wait, wait. What are these changes on page six?",9
46862,Amy,18," Sheldon, what did you do?",9
46863,Howard,18, I should‰Ûªve known.,9
46864,Bernadette,18," 25% of profits due to Sheldon Cooper will be allocated to a scholarship fund for the firstborn child of Howard and Bernadette Wolowitz. Sheldon, that‰Ûªs so nice.",9
46865,Leonard,18, That beats the onesie I was gonna get them from baby Gap.,9
46866,Howard,18," That‰Ûªs very generous, Sheldon.",9
46867,Sheldon,18," Oh, I‰Ûªve always valued education over money. And the very fact that you needed a written guarantee of respect made me realize how dismissive I‰Ûªve been of your contributions.",9
46868,Howard,18, I appreciate that.,9
46869,Sheldon,18, And I just hope that this scholarship can rescue your child from the subpar education and menial life of an engineer.,9
46870,Amy,18, Sheldon.,9
46871,Sheldon,18, What? I didn‰Ûªt sign it yet.,9
46872,Scene,18, Raj‰Ûªs car.,9
46873,Raj,18," I hear what you‰Ûªre saying, but I‰Ûªve known Emily a long time, and I think she deserves the benefit of the doubt.",9
46874,Claire,18," All right, it‰Ûªs your life. But you know how this is gonna end.",9
46875,Raj,18," As a matter of fact, I do. I‰Ûªm gonna comfort her, because I‰Ûªm a caring and decent friend who‰Ûªs happy to be there when she needs someone to talk to.",9
46876,Scene,18, Emily‰Ûªs bed.,9
46877,Raj,18, Good talk.,9
46878,Scene,19, The apartment.,9
46879,Amy (on Skype),19, I didn‰Ûªt understand your e-mail.,9
46880,Sheldon,19," Uh, can you repeat that? You‰Ûªre breaking up.",9
46881,Amy,19, I didn‰Ûªt understand your e-mail.,9
46882,Sheldon,19," Ah. Yeah, I had to get a little creative because the S, R and M keys on my laptop stopped working.",9
46883,Amy,19," Deaw Aby, could you pleathe dwive be to the twain thtow thubtibe tobowow?",9
46884,Sheldon,19," So, is that a yes?",9
46885,Amy,19," Sheldon, why don‰Ûªt you get a new computer? You know that one‰Ûªs out-of-date.",9
46886,Sheldon,19," Oh, but I like this computer.",9
46887,Amy,19," The video is failing, and the sound is cutting out.",9
46888,Sheldon,19," I‰Ûªm sorry, I didn‰Ûªt get that.",9
46889,Amy,19," The video is failing, and the sound is cutting out.",9
46890,Sheldon,19, The sound is cutting out. I can‰Ûªt read that. The video is failing.,9
46891,Amy,19, Get a new computer.,9
46892,Sheldon,19, What?,9
46893,Amy,19, Get a new computer.,9
46894,Sheldon,19, What? (Answering phone) Hello?,9
46895,Scene,19, Howard‰Ûªs workshop.,9
46896,Leonard,19, This is cool. When was the last time you and I built something together?,9
46897,Howard,19, Scientifically? A little over a year ago. LEGOs? Last week in my room.,9
46898,Leonard,19," If there was a Nobel Prize for Millennium Falcons that fall apart when you pick them up, we‰Ûªd be set.",9
46899,Penny,19," Hey, guys.",9
46900,Leonard,19, Hey. What are you doing here?,9
46901,Bernadette,19, We heard there were some sexy scientists working hard all weekend.,9
46902,Penny,19," Yup, so we brought you some lunch and we are gonna go look for ‰Ûªem.",9
46903,Leonard,19," Soup, sandwiches and emasculation, just like my mom used to make.",9
46904,Penny,19," So, how‰Ûªs it goin‰Ûª?",9
46905,Leonard,19, Good. Slow.,9
46906,Howard,19," There‰Ûªs a lot of tedious setup, but once we get through that it should go quicker.",9
46907,Penny,19, Is there anything we can do to help?,9
46908,Leonard,19," You know what, this part isn‰Ûªt that technical. You actually could.",9
46909,Penny,19," Wow, really? Called my bluff. All righty then.",9
46910,Bernadette,19, Can we really help?,9
46911,Howard,19," While we finish soldering these boards, it‰Ûªd be great if you guys could wrap these pipe fittings with Teflon tape.",9
46912,Leonard,19, I‰Ûªll show you how to do one.,9
46913,Penny,19," Hey, wouldn‰Ûªt it be funny if after all your years of hard work, I‰Ûªm the one who makes a scientific breakthrough? He doesn‰Ûªt think that‰Ûªs funny.",9
46914,Scene,19, The apartment.,9
46915,Amy,19, I got here as quickly as I could.,9
46916,Sheldon,19, You‰Ûªre too late.,9
46917,Amy,19," Sheldon, this is silly.",9
46918,Sheldon,19, You got emotional when that lab monkey died.,9
46919,Amy,19, That lab monkey told me he loved me in sign language.,9
46920,Sheldon,19, Great. Now I‰Ûªm gonna have that song in my head all day.,9
46921,Amy,19," Look, I‰Ûªm, I‰Ûªm sorry for your loss, but I think I have something that might make you feel better. I got you a new computer.",9
46922,Sheldon,19, How could you do that?,9
46923,Amy,19, Do what?,9
46924,Sheldon,19," Choosing a new laptop Is an incredibly personal ritual. You have taken away weeks of agonizing thought, tedious research, sleepless nights filled with indecision. I, haven‰Ûªt I lost enough today?",9
46925,Amy,19," Well, the guy at the store said this one is great.",9
46926,Sheldon,19," Oh, oh, the guy. Oh, pardon me. I didn‰Ûªt realize you‰Ûªd spoken to the guy. Yeah, tell me, did the guy choose one with a 4K display and a Thunderbolt port?",9
46927,Amy,19, Yes.,9
46928,Sheldon,19, Yeah? Did the guy make sure that this has a one terabyte solid-state drive?,9
46929,Amy,19, Yes.,9
46930,Sheldon,19," Yeah? Oh, well, was this guy Rick from Computer Solutions on Colorado?",9
46931,Amy,19, Yes.,9
46932,Sheldon,19," Yeah, well, he does know his stuff.",9
46933,Scene,19, Howard‰Ûªs workshop.,9
46934,Leonard,19," After you wrap the body in reflective tape, the ends get Teflon tape so we can get a tight seal.",9
46935,Penny,19, Like this?,9
46936,Leonard,19," Yeah, perfect.",9
46937,Penny,19, Oh.,9
46938,Leonard,19," And it helps to have small, delicate fingers. So don‰Ûªt be discouraged if you can‰Ûªt do it as fast as me and Howard.",9
46939,Howard,19, I don‰Ûªt know if we have enough solder to finish these circuit boards.,9
46940,Leonard,19, We had a full spool yesterday.,9
46941,Howard,19," What can I say, I play hard, I solder even harder.",9
46942,Bernadette,19, Sometimes he solders at home with his shirt off. It‰Ûªs like a beer commercial.,9
46943,Leonard,19," Well, we got to make a run to the hardware store.",9
46944,Penny,19, How can you call yourself a scientist and run out of solder?,9
46945,Leonard,19," Well, funny story. So, we have plenty of the 60/40 tin-to-lead ratio solder, but the spools look a lot like the 63/37 tin-to-lead‰Û_",9
46946,Penny,19," Honey, honey, honey, let me stop you. That is, is not a funny story.",9
46947,Howard,19, You want to come with us?,9
46948,Bernadette,19, I‰Ûªm kind of getting into the groove here.,9
46949,Penny,19," Yeah, you guys run to the store and let the women handle the science for a change.",9
46950,Leonard,19, Okay. We‰Ûªll be back as soon as we can.,9
46951,Penny,19," Okay, so what is solder?",9
46952,Scene,19, The apartment.,9
46953,Sheldon,19," I suppose I should set this up. Or would you like to rob me of that, too?",9
46954,Amy,19, Knock it off or I‰Ûªll start making W-H sounds for words that just have a W.,9
46955,Sheldon,19, You wouldn‰Ûªt.,9
46956,Amy,19, Whatch me.,9
46957,Sheldon,19," Fine. I‰Ûªm sorry. Thank you for the thoughtful gift. I really do appreciate it. As you know, I had become attached to my old laptop. But I‰Ûªm sure, in time, that this one will‰Û_ Jeepers creepers, that started up fast.",9
46958,Amy,19, I thought you might like it.,9
46959,Sheldon,19," Look at the 4K resolution. Next time we Skype, I‰Ûªm gonna count all those nostril hairs.",9
46960,Amy,19, Or you could just look into my eyes.,9
46961,Sheldon,19, But you only have two eyes. You got a lot of nostril hairs.,9
46962,Amy,19," Well, you know, as long as you‰Ûªre happy.",9
46963,Sheldon,19, Oh. I am.,9
46964,Amy,19, And Rick said you could bring in your old one to recycle it.,9
46965,Sheldon,19," Oh. Uh, no, no, no, thank you.",9
46966,Amy,19," Oh, but he said you can get store credit.",9
46967,Sheldon,19," Well, no, I just, I, I don‰Ûªt want to recycle it. And I don‰Ûªt want store credit.",9
46968,Amy,19, But why wouldn‰Ûªt‰Û_,9
46969,Sheldon,19, Can we please change the subject?,9
46970,Amy,19, Okay. How ‰Ûªbout we change it to why you‰Ûªre being weird about this?,9
46971,Sheldon,19," I‰Ûªm not being weird. I, it‰Ûªs hard to explain.",9
46972,Amy,19," Sheldon, just tell me.",9
46973,Sheldon,19, It might be easier to show you.,9
46974,Amy,19, Okay.,9
46975,Sheldon,19, We‰Ûªd have to take your car.,9
46976,Amy,19, All right.,9
46977,Sheldon,19, And I‰Ûªm gonna need you to sign a non-disclosure agreement.,9
46978,Amy,19," Well, I signed one before we slept together. Why not now?",9
46979,Scene,19, A street.,9
46980,Leonard,19, Penny says they‰Ûªre having fun working on the prototype.,9
46981,Howard,19, Remember when her fun was nightclubs and drinking games?,9
46982,Leonard,19, I know. I‰Ûªm lowering the bar so slowly. This time next year she‰Ûªll have a coin collection.,9
46983,Man,19, Excuse me. You guys interested in a free screening of an upcoming movie?,9
46984,Leonard,19," Oh. Sorry, we can‰Ûªt.",9
46985,Howard,19," Well, hang on. What movie is it?",9
46986,Man,19," Oh, I can‰Ûªt tell you. But it does star Will Smith.",9
46987,Howard,19, Wait. I bet it‰Ûªs Suicide Squad. Let‰Ûªs check it out.,9
46988,Leonard,19, What about the girls?,9
46989,Howard,19," Penny just said they‰Ûªre having fun. Honestly, you want to wrap tape around a bunch of pipe fittings all afternoon?",9
46990,Leonard,19," Okay, we‰Ûªll take ‰Ûªem. But, I swear, if it‰Ûªs Will Smith in Shark Tale 2, it better be at least as good as the original.",9
46991,Scene,19, Howard‰Ûªs workshop.,9
46992,Penny,19," I mean, it‰Ûªs crazy, isn‰Ûªt it? I moved here from Nebraska to be an actress, and now I‰Ûªm sitting in an engineering lab at Caltech helping to build a prototype for a high-tech guidance system.",9
46993,Bernadette,19, It is crazy. It‰Ûªs also crazy that I‰Ûªve made fourteen of these and you‰Ûªve made three.,9
46994,Raj,19, Hey. Where are the guys?,9
46995,Penny,19," Oh, they went to the store to get solder, which is metal you melt to make science things.",9
46996,Bernadette,19, Since when do you work on weekends?,9
46997,Raj,19, I‰Ûªm an astrophysicist. The stars don‰Ûªt take a day off.,9
46998,Penny,19, You were home alone and had no one to play with?,9
46999,Raj,19," Well, the cleaning lady was there, but she doesn‰Ûªt like me. You need any help?",9
47000,Bernadette,19, Not with Lightning McQueen here.,9
47001,Penny,19, I think we‰Ûªre good.,9
47002,Raj,19," Okay. That‰Ûªs cool. I guess everybody‰Ûªs involved in this project but me. So, see ya.",9
47003,Bernadette,19, I feel bad. Should we have asked him to stay?,9
47004,Raj (from outside),19, Yes.,9
47005,Scene,19, Amy‰Ûªs car.,9
47006,Amy,19, Will you please tell me where we‰Ûªre going?,9
47007,Sheldon,19," Sorry, you‰Ûªre on a need-to-know basis.",9
47008,Amy,19, I‰Ûªm driving the car. I need to know.,9
47009,Sheldon,19, Right.,9
47010,Amy,19, So where are we going?,9
47011,Sheldon,19," No, I meant turn right, and you missed it. Maybe you do need to know.",9
47012,Scene,19, The cinema.,9
47013,Leonard,19, What are we gonna tell the girls?,9
47014,Howard,19, It‰Ûªs not a problem.,9
47015,Leonard,19, I mean without lying.,9
47016,Howard,19, And now you‰Ûªve made it a problem.,9
47017,Leonard,19, Come on. We‰Ûªre a couple of smart guys. I‰Ûªm sure we can come up with a way to explain this that doesn‰Ûªt make us look bad.,9
47018,"Penny (at Howard‰Ûªs workshop, reading text)",19," Oh, the boys had to drive all the way to San Bernardino for the solder and got a flat.",9
47019,Leonard,19, They bought it.,9
47020,Howard,19, But we‰Ûªre gonna have to put the spare on before we go back.,9
47021,Leonard,19," Oh, you‰Ûªre good at this.",9
47022,Howard,19," Well, I lie a lot.",9
47023,Man,19," Hey, guys, thank you for being a part of our test screening. You‰Ûªre about to be one of the first audiences to see Suicide Squad.",9
47024,Leonard,19," Hey, you were right.",9
47025,Howard,19," Well, I keep telling you, good things happen to bad people.",9
47026,Man,19," Uh, we‰Ûªre gonna get started in a couple minutes. Enjoy.",9
47027,Leonard,19, Who are you texting?,9
47028,Howard,19, Raj. He really wants to see this movie.,9
47029,Leonard,19, He‰Ûªll never make it in time.,9
47030,Howard,19, I know. I want to make him feel bad.,9
47031,Leonard,19," Ha, ha. Leonard and I are about to see Suicide Squad. Spoiler alert, when I see you I‰Ûªm gonna spoil it. You‰Ûªre a good friend.",9
47032,Raj (at the workshop),19, Okay. Would you ladies please leave the room for a moment?,9
47033,Penny,19, Why?,9
47034,Raj,19, I need to rub my genitals on their prototype.,9
47035,Bernadette,19, What‰Ûªs going on?,9
47036,Raj,19, Leonard and Howard don‰Ûªt have a flat. They went to the movies. Look.,9
47037,Penny,19, Un-freakin‰Ûª believable.,9
47038,Bernadette,19, Son of a bitch.,9
47039,Raj,19, Oh. You know what? I‰Ûªm gonna let them know that I‰Ûªm here with you and that they‰Ûªre busted.,9
47040,Penny,19, No. You know what? Don‰Ûªt. Don‰Ûªt. Let‰Ûªs let them think they‰Ûªre getting away with it.,9
47041,Bernadette,19," Yeah, let‰Ûªs see how deep a hole they can dig for themselves.",9
47042,Penny,19, Mm-hmm.,9
47043,Raj,19," Interesting. I mean, it‰Ûªs not testicles on a cryostat, but I like it.",9
47044,Scene,19, A storage facility.,9
47045,Amy,19, Why do you have a storage unit?,9
47046,Sheldon,19, Just wait.,9
47047,Amy,19, How long have you had it?,9
47048,Sheldon,19, Just wait.,9
47049,Amy,19, Do you want me to hold that computer?,9
47050,Sheldon,19," Just wait. You know what? Actually, yes, thank you. Welcome to my Fortress of Shame.",9
47051,Amy,19," I‰Ûªm sorry. What, what am I looking at?",9
47052,Sheldon,19," It‰Ûªs basically everything I‰Ûªve ever owned. Um, every book, every tee shirt, every piece of broken electronics. Just all of it.",9
47053,Amy,19, All of it?,9
47054,Sheldon,19, I have a Ziploc bag filled with all my old Ziploc bags.,9
47055,Amy,19," Okay. Well, I would like to tell you that there is nothing here to be ashamed of. So I‰Ûªm gonna need a minute.",9
47056,Scene,19, Howard‰Ûªs workshop.,9
47057,Penny,19," All right, how are we gonna play this when they return?",9
47058,Raj,19, I know. You guys should totally be making out with me.,9
47059,Penny,19," Sweetie, I know you think jokes like that are funny, but do you really think you could handle making out with both of us?",9
47060,Raj,19," No, ma‰Ûªam.",9
47061,Bernadette,19," Okay. Okay, how about this? They don‰Ûªt know you‰Ûªre here with us, so you hide in the closet. When they show up, we‰Ûªll hear whatever their dumb story is about where they were, we‰Ûªll pretend to believe them and just when they think they got away with it, you jump out.",9
47062,Penny,19," Yeah, that‰Ûªs pretty good.",9
47063,Raj,19," I love it, I‰Ûªll be all like, busted, and they‰Ûªll be like, what? And then we‰Ûªll all be like, oh yeah. Yeah, I get it. I wouldn‰Ûªt make out with me, either.",9
47064,Scene,19, The storage unit.,9
47065,Sheldon,19," In here is every clock radio I‰Ûªve ever owned. Calculators, VHS tapes. Yeah. Oh. Sporting equipment.",9
47066,Amy,19, You have sporting equipment?,9
47067,Sheldon,19," Well, oh, it‰Ûªs just a, it‰Ûªs a, a golf ball that my brother threw at my head. You can still feel the dent. It‰Ûªs right next to the hockey puck dent.",9
47068,Amy,19," Okay, why do you have a bin of pine cones?",9
47069,Sheldon,19," I used to collect them as a child. The spiral of scales open in the Fibonacci sequence. A fact that, when you tell your brother, gets a golf ball thrown at your head.",9
47070,Amy,19," So, why do you feel you need to save these things?",9
47071,Sheldon,19," I‰Ûªd like to say it‰Ûªs nostalgia, but every time I think of throwing anything away, my ears start to ring, and I get butterflies in my stomach. And then it feels like the butterflies get eaten by rats, and then the, the rats get eaten by‰Û_",9
47072,Amy,19, Okay. I get it. I get it.,9
47073,Sheldon,19, It ends with dinosaurs. I‰Ûªm sorry if you think less of me.,9
47074,Amy,19, I don‰Ûªt.,9
47075,Sheldon,19," Really? ‰Û÷Cause every time I come in here, I think less of me.",9
47076,Amy,19, Why?,9
47077,Sheldon,19," Because I‰Ûªm a fraud. No. I purport to be a man of the mind. I‰Ûªve been such a, a vocal champion of the singularity, but how can I leave my body behind and become one with the internet when I‰Ûªve never even thrown a toothbrush away?",9
47078,Amy,19," It‰Ûªs okay, Sheldon. You know, I‰Ûªve saved a lot of weird things, too.",9
47079,Sheldon,19, Like what?,9
47080,Amy,19," Well, um, did you know I have a microscope slide with a little bit of tissue from the first brain I ever dissected?",9
47081,Sheldon,19, I have an old teddy bear I secretly wiped my nose on for years.,9
47082,Amy,19, It‰Ûªs not a contest.,9
47083,Scene,19, Howard‰Ûªs workshop.,9
47084,Penny,19," Okay, here they come.",9
47085,Bernadette,19, Go hide.,9
47086,Raj,19," Oh, man, when I come out of the closet, I‰Ûªm gonna nail those guys. Yeah, I heard it. Shut up.",9
47087,Leonard,19, Hey.,9
47088,Howard,19, Hi.,9
47089,Penny,19," Hey, what‰Ûªs this?",9
47090,Leonard,19," Listen, we did a stupid thing.",9
47091,Howard,19," We went to a movie and lied about it, but we feel bad and want to make it up to you.",9
47092,Leonard,19," So, these are for you, and if you‰Ûªre not too mad, we‰Ûªd love to take you guys to dinner.",9
47093,Howard,19, Yeah. Anywhere you want.,9
47094,Bernadette,19," Oh. Well, thank you for being honest.",9
47095,Penny,19," Yeah. You know, I want to be upset, but we did kind of have fun working on the prototype.",9
47096,Raj (inside cupboard),19, Don‰Ûªt forgive them. Stay mad at them.,9
47097,Howard,19, What is he doing in there?,9
47098,Raj,19, Busting you.,9
47099,Bernadette,19, It‰Ûªs okay. They apologized.,9
47100,Penny,19," Yeah, it‰Ûªs fine.",9
47101,Raj,19, Well this is kind of anti-climactic.,9
47102,Howard,19, You know what wasn‰Ûªt anti-climactic? The end of the movie. Get this.,9
47103,Raj,19, No spoilers. No spoilers.,9
47104,Penny,19, And he‰Ûªs back in the closet.,9
47105,Howard,19, Ready for dinner?,9
47106,Penny,19, Yeah.,9
47107,Bernadette,19, Should we invite Raj?,9
47108,Raj (in cupboard),19, Yes.,9
47109,Scene,19, The storage unit.,9
47110,Amy,19," So, no one else knows about this?",9
47111,Sheldon,19, Only you.,9
47112,Amy,19, Thank you for trusting me.,9
47113,Sheldon,19, What good is having a girlfriend if you can‰Ûªt unload your psychological sewage on her?,9
47114,Amy,19," That‰Ûªs me, your emotional outhouse. You know, if you ever decide you want to do something about this, I‰Ûªm, I‰Ûªm here for you.",9
47115,Sheldon,19, Thank you. I wouldn‰Ûªt even know how to begin.,9
47116,Amy,19," Baby steps, I guess.",9
47117,Sheldon,19, I suppose I could try getting rid of the golf ball.,9
47118,Amy,19, Oh. Okay.,9
47119,Sheldon,19, I will always have the dent to remember it by.,9
47120,Amy,19, You did it. Do you feel okay?,9
47121,Sheldon,19," Actually, yes. I do.",9
47122,Amy,19," Well, I‰Ûªm proud of you.",9
47123,Sheldon,19, Thanks.,9
47124,Scene,19, The apartment.,9
47125,Sheldon,19, I‰Ûªm glad I told you about the storage unit.,9
47126,Amy,19," Well, I feel closer to you now.",9
47127,Sheldon,19," Oh, I feel closer to you, too. You know, it‰Ûªs still a couple of hours until my bedtime.",9
47128,Amy,19, What did you have in mind?,9
47129,Scene,19," The same, shortly afterwards.",9
47130,Sheldon,19," You look amazing. I mean, this resolution is remarkable.",9
47131,Amy (on Skype),19, I really had to go home for this?,9
47132,Sheldon,19," Yes, but it‰Ûªs like you‰Ûªre right here in the room.",9
47133,Amy,19," And yet, I‰Ûªm not.",9
47134,Sheldon,19, But I feel like I could reach out and touch you.,9
47135,Amy,19," And yet, you can‰Ûªt.",9
47136,Sheldon,19, I know.,9
47137,Scene,20, The apartment (initially inside a virtual reality device),9
47138,Sheldon,20," It‰Ûªs nice to get back to nature. Why don‰Ûªt I do this more often? What a beautiful forest. Hello, little butterfly. What‰Ûªs your Na-oh!",9
47139,Leonard,20, Whatcha doing?,9
47140,Sheldon,20," I was enjoying some virtual reality, until you ruined it with your actual face.",9
47141,Penny,20, What am I smelling?,9
47142,Sheldon,20," Oh, it‰Ûªs car air freshener. I was simulating the smell of the forest.",9
47143,Penny,20, That‰Ûªs not what the forest smells like.,9
47144,Sheldon,20," Well, how would I know?",9
47145,Leonard,20, Why are you pretending to be outdoors? You hate it.,9
47146,Sheldon,20, Hmm? Oh. Amy showed me a compelling study that demonstrated the cognitive benefit of spending time in the wilderness.,9
47147,Leonard,20," Buddy, I am ready to drive you into the wilderness any time you want and leave you there.",9
47148,Sheldon,20," Well, make your jokes, but some of the participants who spent four days in the woods away from all technology reported a fifty percent gain in reasoning skills upon their return.",9
47149,Penny,20," Okay, if that‰Ûªs true, why aren‰Ûªt there more genius squirrels?",9
47150,Sheldon,20, You may need this more than I do.,9
47151,Scene,20, The apartment.,9
47152,Amy,20, Here‰Ûªs your tea.,9
47153,Sheldon,20, Oh. Do not sneak up on a guy when he‰Ûªs sitting on a log.,9
47154,Amy,20," You know, if you really want to be in nature, why don‰Ûªt we rent a cabin?",9
47155,Sheldon,20," Look, I‰Ûªm sorry, when did you even get here? I‰Û_",9
47156,Penny,20," You know, there‰Ûªs a cabin in Big Bear that a doctor I work with keeps offering me.",9
47157,Leonard,20, Because he‰Ûªs hitting on you?,9
47158,Penny,20, She.,9
47159,Leonard,20," Oh, good.",9
47160,Penny,20, But I could get her.,9
47161,Amy,20, We could all go for the weekend. It‰Ûªll be fun.,9
47162,Sheldon,20," Excuse me. Here, look up fun, get back to me.",9
47163,Leonard,20, You and I could still go and have a nice weekend.,9
47164,Penny,20, Sure.,9
47165,Amy,20," Come on, Sheldon, let‰Ûªs go with them.",9
47166,Sheldon,20," I hardly think so. You be sure and say hello to all the mosquitoes, bees, bears, snakes, possums, poison oak, oh, and last, but not least, teenagers with guitars.",9
47167,Penny,20, I‰Ûªll see if it‰Ûªs available.,9
47168,Amy,20," You know, if that study‰Ûªs real, Leonard might come back smarter than you.",9
47169,Sheldon,20, Are you trying to manipulate me?,9
47170,Amy,20, Yes.,9
47171,Sheldon,20," Well done, it worked, we‰Ûªre going.",9
47172,Amy,20, Yay.,9
47173,Scene,20, Howard and Bernadette‰Ûªs house.,9
47174,Bernadette,20," Come on, Raj, give me a bag.",9
47175,Raj,20," No, no, you‰Ûªre pregnant. The only thing you carry is our hope for a better tomorrow.",9
47176,Howard,20," Hey, where you been?",9
47177,Bernadette,20," Uh, Raj took me to the baby doctor and then we swung by the grocery store.",9
47178,Howard,20," Did you get graham crackers? I mean, are, wuh, is the baby okay?",9
47179,Bernadette,20, Yes and yes.,9
47180,Howard,20, I didn‰Ûªt know you needed help running errands today.,9
47181,Bernadette,20," I didn‰Ûªt, but Raj volunteered.",9
47182,Howard,20, Really?,9
47183,Bernadette,20," Yeah, ever since you told him I was pregnant, he‰Ûªs really been making a fuss over me.",9
47184,Howard,20," Oh. Well, I guess that‰Ûªs kind of sweet.",9
47185,Raj,20," Bernie, I just forwarded you a list of the top five lactation consultants in Los Angeles. I know my favourite, but I‰Ûªd love to hear what you think.",9
47186,Howard,20, And it just got weird.,9
47187,Scene,20, The apartment.,9
47188,Penny,20, Hey. Amy‰Ûªs downstairs.,9
47189,Leonard,20," Okay, one sec.",9
47190,Penny,20," Uh, what, what you got goin‰Ûª on here?",9
47191,Leonard,20, I bought a baseball cap.,9
47192,Penny,20, I can see that. What team did you get?,9
47193,Leonard,20," Uh, Hufflepuff, from Harry Potter.",9
47194,Penny,20," Well, we‰Ûªll be in the woods.",9
47195,Sheldon,20, I‰Ûªm ready to go.,9
47196,Leonard,20, Anything you‰Ûªd like to say to him?,9
47197,Penny,20," Nice hat, Sheldon.",9
47198,Sheldon,20, Thanks.,9
47199,Leonard,20, Why are you so mean to me?,9
47200,Scene,20, Howard and Bernadette‰Ûªs kitchen. Screams are emanating from Bernadette‰Ûªs tablet.,9
47201,Howard,20, What the hell are you watching?,9
47202,Bernadette,20, Raj found all these childbirth videos online. This one is of a woman giving birth in a river.,9
47203,Howard,20," Okay, that is the least Jewish thing I‰Ûªve ever seen in my life. You feel like Raj is getting a little carried away with all the baby stuff?",9
47204,Bernadette,20, I don‰Ûªt think so. He just wants to be part of the experience.,9
47205,Howard,20," All right, if you say so. What‰Ûªs in the box?",9
47206,Bernadette,20," Oh, it‰Ûªs an ultrasonic microphone so we can hear the baby‰Ûªs heartbeat.",9
47207,Howard,20, Oh. That‰Ûªs cool. Can we try it?,9
47208,Bernadette,20," Actually, Raj ordered it. He made me promise to wait till he was here.",9
47209,Howard,20, So he can be part of the experience?,9
47210,Bernadette,20, Yeah.,9
47211,Howard,20, I‰Ûªm surprised he let us conceive without him.,9
47212,Bernadette,20," It‰Ûªs a sore spot, don‰Ûªt bring it up.",9
47213,Scene,20, Leonard‰Ûªs car.,9
47214,Penny,20, It‰Ûªs so cute and rustic up here.,9
47215,Leonard,20, I know. Did you see they still have a video rental place? it‰Ûªs like Colonial Williamsburg.,9
47216,Sheldon,20," Well, cell service is down to one bar, so if anyone needs medical attention or to tell a stranger their political views are stupid, now‰Ûªs the time.",9
47217,Amy,20, Have you ever been off the grid before?,9
47218,Sheldon,20, Once. The battery ran out on my phone. I had to wait for my iPad to turn on.,9
47219,Leonard,20, I was afraid he was gonna eat me.,9
47220,Scene,20, Howard and Bernadette‰Ûªs apartment.,9
47221,Howard,20, Raj just pulled up. I‰Ûªm gonna say something to him.,9
47222,Bernadette,20, Leave it alone. He means well.,9
47223,Howard,20, So you don‰Ûªt think he needs to rein it in a little?,9
47224,Bernadette,20," No, not really.",9
47225,Howard,20," And you‰Ûªre not concerned he‰Ûªs acting like somehow this is his kid, too?",9
47226,Bernadette,20, He‰Ûªs just trying to be supportive.,9
47227,Howard,20, Just supportive. Not over-the-top in any way?,9
47228,Bernadette,20, No.,9
47229,Raj,20, Hello.,9
47230,Bernadette,20, You saw him carrying that.,9
47231,Howard,20, Astronauts saw him carrying that.,9
47232,Scene,20, The cabin. ,9
47233,Penny,20, This place is great.,9
47234,Leonard,20, So nice of that doctor to just let you use it.,9
47235,Penny,20," Well, she is taking me to an Indigo Girls concert, so hold that thought.",9
47236,Sheldon,20," Okay. Well, shall we check each other for ticks?",9
47237,Amy,20," Sheldon, all we did was walk in from the car.",9
47238,Sheldon,20," Oh. Well, suit yourself. Who wants to check me?",9
47239,Amy,20," On the other hand, safety first.",9
47240,Scene,20," The same, later.",9
47241,Amy,20," Wow, it‰Ûªs really coming down.",9
47242,Penny,20, This sucks.,9
47243,Leonard,20, And there goes our hike.,9
47244,Sheldon,20," Oh, not our hike, now we have to stay safe and warm.",9
47245,Penny,20," You know, we could still go. A little rain isn‰Ûªt gonna kill us.",9
47246,Leonard,20, Have you been outside in the rain with Sheldon?,9
47247,Penny,20, No.,9
47248,Leonard,20, You‰Ûªll wish it would kill you.,9
47249,Amy,20, So what do we do now?,9
47250,Leonard,20, They have some board games.,9
47251,Sheldon,20," Eh, most of the Jenga pieces are missing and the Scrabble only has seven tiles, so unless you want to build an unimpressive structure with the word shnerpf next to it, move on.",9
47252,Penny,20," Hey, let‰Ûªs light a fire.",9
47253,Amy,20," Ooh, that sounds cozy.",9
47254,Leonard,20, I don‰Ûªt think I‰Ûªve lit a real fire before.,9
47255,Sheldon,20," Ah, it‰Ûªs basic thermodynamics. I‰Ûªm sure we can figure that out.",9
47256,Leonard,20, I could stack the logs conically to facilitate airflow.,9
47257,Sheldon,20, That would maximize oxygen for optimal combustion.,9
47258,Leonard,20, Right. So all we need is to‰Û_,9
47259,Penny,20, Got it.,9
47260,Leonard,20, A scientist made that.,9
47261,Scene,20, Howard and Bernadette‰Ûªs house.,9
47262,Howard,20," Look, Raj, you‰Ûªre my best friend in the world and I really appreciate your enthusiasm about the baby.",9
47263,Raj,20," Please, my pleasure.",9
47264,Bernadette,20," And, of course, Howie and I both want you to be a part of all this.",9
47265,Howard,20, But we have to set some boundaries.,9
47266,Raj,20, I don‰Ûªt understand.,9
47267,Howard,20, The three of us aren‰Ûªt having this baby. Just the two of us.,9
47268,Howard,20," Oh. Okay. Yeah, I get it. I‰Ûªll back off.",9
47269,Howard,20, Thanks for understanding.,9
47270,Raj,20, Of course. I‰Ûªll give you guys some space. Let me just get this out of your way.,9
47271,Howard,20, You need some help?,9
47272,Raj,20," No, I got it.",9
47273,Bernadette,20," Raj, Raj, wait.",9
47274,Raj,20," Please, Bernadette. Let me leave with my dignity.",9
47275,Scene,20, The cabin.,9
47276,Penny,20," Hey, you guys want to play a drinking game?",9
47277,Sheldon,20," Oh, well now, we‰Ûªll never win. You always play the drinking game.",9
47278,Penny,20," Not the drinking game, a drinking game.",9
47279,Leonard,20," To be fair, good at both.",9
47280,Amy,20, What‰Ûªs the game?,9
47281,Penny,20," All right, it‰Ûªs called Never Have I Ever. The rules are simple. Someone says something they‰Ûªve never done, but if you have done it, you take a drink.",9
47282,Leonard,20, I‰Ûªve never played that before.,9
47283,Sheldon,20," Hey, now, wait. Have we started? Do I drink? What is happening?",9
47284,Penny,20," Okay. Calm down. I‰Ûªll go first. All right, let‰Ûªs see. Never have I ever‰Û_",9
47285,Amy,20, She‰Ûªs trying to think of something she‰Ûªs never done before. This could take a while.,9
47286,Penny,20," Very funny. Okay, never have I ever‰Û_ yeah, you know what? Let‰Ûªs just circle back.",9
47287,Leonard,20," Okay, I‰Ûªll go. Never have I ever been arrested.",9
47288,Sheldon,20, So I drink.,9
47289,Amy,20," No, it‰Ûªs only if you‰Ûªve done it.",9
47290,Sheldon,20, Got it.,9
47291,Amy,20, I can‰Ûªt believe you‰Ûªve been arrested.,9
47292,Sheldon,20, I can‰Ûªt believe Penny hasn‰Ûªt.,9
47293,Penny,20," Sheldon, what did you do?",9
47294,Sheldon,20," Well, I‰Ûªm not proud of it, but I jaywalked.",9
47295,Leonard,20," Oh, no, it‰Ûªs like a horror movie. We‰Ûªre trapped in a cabin with a maniac.",9
47296,Amy,20, I‰Ûªm surprised you would do that.,9
47297,Sheldon,20," No, I crossed in the middle of the street. And normally, I wouldn‰Ûªt, but I saw an aggressive-looking Girl Scout, and it was the heart of cookie season. Anyway, there was a police officer, and he witnessed the whole thing.",9
47298,Penny,20," What, he arrested you for that?",9
47299,Sheldon,20," No, he didn‰Ûªt do anything. So I said, you just saw me jaywalk, why aren‰Ûªt you doing your job? You know? May, maybe I should arrest you for, for impersonating a police officer.",9
47300,Penny,20, And then you got arrested.,9
47301,Sheldon,20," Oh, and how.",9
47302,Scene,20, Howard and Bernadette‰Ûªs house.,9
47303,Howard,20, I feel like I just made a horrible mistake.,9
47304,Bernadette,20, Yeah.,9
47305,Howard,20," But on the other hand, I didn‰Ûªt kick him out of our lives. I just asked him to back off a little.",9
47306,Bernadette,20, Yeah.,9
47307,Howard,20, What? Are you gonna cry?,9
47308,Bernadette,20, Yeah.,9
47309,Howard,20, Is it baby hormones or actually sad?,9
47310,Bernadette,20, I can‰Ûªt tell anymore.,9
47311,Howard,20, I‰Ûªll go get him.,9
47312,Bernadette,20, And bring back the bear.,9
47313,Scene,20, The cabin. ,9
47314,Leonard,20, This game‰Ûªs dangerous. I could get you in trouble.,9
47315,Penny,20, How?,9
47316,Leonard,20," Well, never have I ever used Sheldon‰Ûªs toothbrush to clean the sink.",9
47317,Penny,20," Fine, is that how you want to play this? All right, never have I ever come up with a nickname for my own genitals.",9
47318,Leonard,20, Never should‰Ûªve told you about Alvin and the Chipmunks.,9
47319,Amy,20," Okay. My turn. Um, never have I ever completely rocked my girlfriend‰Ûªs world in bed.",9
47320,Sheldon,20, Amy.,9
47321,Amy,20, You know the rules. Drink.,9
47322,Penny,20," Yeah, go ahead.",9
47323,Leonard,20, That‰Ûªs right.,9
47324,Sheldon,20," All right, my turn. Mm. Oh, I know. Never have I ever kept a secret bank account, because I think my wife can‰Ûªt handle money. Did I win? I feel like I won.",9
47325,Penny,20, I can‰Ûªt believe this. You realize I make more money than you?,9
47326,Leonard,20," I don‰Ûªt, I know, but this isn‰Ûªt a big deal. It‰Ûªs just a little savings I put aside.",9
47327,Penny,20, We‰Ûªre married. We‰Ûªre supposed to share everything.,9
47328,Leonard,20," What, you mean, like, your massive credit card debt?",9
47329,Sheldon,20, I‰Ûªm calling it. I won.,9
47330,Scene,20, Howard and Bernadette‰Ûªs house.,9
47331,Raj,20," I appreciate the apology, but it‰Ûªs really not necessary. I overstepped my bounds.",9
47332,Howard,20," No, Raj, you‰Ûªve been great. I just, I need to start doing my part around here.",9
47333,Bernadette,20, I hear that.,9
47334,Raj,20," Well, if that‰Ûªs the case, is there anything I can do to help?",9
47335,Howard,20," Well, not right now. But we could try out that microphone you got us, and listen to the baby‰Ûªs heartbeat.",9
47336,Raj,20, Really? It‰Ûªs okay if I listen with you?,9
47337,Bernadette,20, Of course.,9
47338,Raj,20, Can I squirt the ultrasound jelly on your stomach?,9
47339,Howard,20," Hey, look at that. It‰Ûªs weird again.",9
47340,Scene,20, The cabin.,9
47341,Leonard,20," Okay, you have every right to be mad. And what you said is true. You do make more money than me. So I had no right to do what I did. And I‰Ûªm so sorry. I hope you can forgive me.",9
47342,Penny,20, How long have you had this secret account?,9
47343,Leonard,20," A couple years, but I just put a few bucks aside every month for emergencies.",9
47344,Penny,20," Well, how much you got in there?",9
47345,Leonard,20, Six thousand four hundred and twenty seven dollars. Forty seven dollars once my nana‰Ûªs birthday check gets here.,9
47346,Penny,20," My God, Leonard, do you know what I could do with that kind of money?",9
47347,Leonard,20," No, I do, and that‰Ûªs why I hid it.",9
47348,Penny,20, What good is it if you don‰Ûªt use it?,9
47349,Leonard,20," Uh, you have shoes you love, but never wear. I have money I love, but never spend. We‰Ûªre kind of a cute couple that way. Again, I‰Ûªm sorry. I shouldn‰Ûªt have kept it a secret.",9
47350,Penny,20," Well, I have a secret I‰Ûªve been keeping from you, too.",9
47351,Leonard,20, Is it a secret bank account? Because that would be awesome.,9
47352,Penny,20, I hate my job.,9
47353,Leonard,20, Really? Why?,9
47354,Penny,20," Because I don‰Ûªt feel good flirting with doctors for sales. I mean, I know I make a lot of money. But I haven‰Ûªt been happy for a while.",9
47355,Leonard,20, Why didn‰Ûªt you tell me?,9
47356,Penny,20, Because I know how important it is to you that I‰Ûªm having some success.,9
47357,Leonard,20, That‰Ûªs not true.,9
47358,Penny,20," Okay, really? So you‰Ûªd be fine if I went back to acting and waiting tables again?",9
47359,Leonard,20," If that‰Ûªs what you want to do, yes.",9
47360,Penny,20," Well, it‰Ûªs not what I want to do.",9
47361,Leonard,20," Oh, yes.",9
47362,Penny,20," Doesn‰Ûªt matter what I want. Look, this job is gonna get me out of debt. So I‰Ûªm gonna do the grown-up thing and see it through.",9
47363,Leonard,20," Well, that is the grown-up thing.",9
47364,Penny,20, I guess.,9
47365,Leonard,20, I love you.,9
47366,Penny,20," I love you, too.",9
47367,Leonard,20," You know, never have I ever made love in the forest while it was raining.",9
47368,Penny,20," Well, guess I gotta drink.",9
47369,Scene,20, Howard and Bernadette‰Ûªs house.,9
47370,Howard,20," All right, here we go.",9
47371,Bernadette,20, I‰Ûªm not hearing anything.,9
47372,Howard,20," Well, give me a second.",9
47373,Raj,20, Are you sure you can do this?,9
47374,Howard,20," Hey, who found four dollars and change on the beach with his metal detector?",9
47375,Raj,20," I buried it there, so we could go home.",9
47376,Bernadette,20," Wait, that‰Ûªs it.",9
47377,Raj,20, Wow.,9
47378,Bernadette,20, Isn‰Ûªt that the best?,9
47379,Raj,20, You guys made a person.,9
47380,Howard,20, We did.,9
47381,Raj,20, And I like to think I helped.,9
47382,Howard,20, You didn‰Ûªt.,9
47383,Scene,20, The cabin. ,9
47384,Sheldon,20," Oh, never have I ever drunk milk past its expiration date.",9
47385,Amy,20, Never have I ever cancelled a dentist appointment.,9
47386,Sheldon,20," Oh, uh, never have I ever put my foot in the ocean.",9
47387,Amy,20, Never have I ever honked if I liked anything.,9
47388,Sheldon,20," Oh, uh, never have I ever thrown, caught or touched a Frisbee.",9
47389,Amy,20, Never have I ever put salt on my food without trying it first.,9
47390,Sheldon,20, Oh. Never have I ever pushed all the buttons in an elevator.,9
47391,Amy,20," Well, we all have a past.",9
47392,Scene,21, The comic book store. ,9
47393,Sheldon,21," I have a question about Batman. Batman is a man who dresses up like a bat. Man-bat is a part man, part bat hybrid. Now, if Man-Bat dressed up as a man to fight crime, would he be Man-Batman?",9
47394,Leonard,21," No, he‰Ûªd be Bat-Man-Bat.",9
47395,Raj,21, But wouldn‰Ûªt Man-Batman just be a Batman that was bitten by a radioactive man?,9
47396,Howard,21, But Batman is a man. You‰Ûªre talking about a man who would have the powers of a man. That‰Ûªs just Man-Man.,9
47397,Sheldon,21," Well, isn‰Ûªt Man-Man just Man?",9
47398,Leonard,21, But what if Man-Man dressed as a bat?,9
47399,Raj,21," Well, that‰Ûªs just Batman.",9
47400,Leonard,21," No, if a man dresses as a bat, that‰Ûªs Batman, but if Man-Man dresses as a bat, that‰Ûªs Batman-Man.",9
47401,Howard,21, So does that answer your question?,9
47402,Sheldon,21," Oh, I haven‰Ûªt asked it yet.",9
47403,Raj (checking text on phone),21," Oh, that‰Ûªs Claire. Got to run.",9
47404,Leonard,21, I thought you were back with Emily.,9
47405,Raj,21," Uh, actually I‰Ûªm seeing both of them.",9
47406,Leonard,21, You mean like through their window from behind a bush?,9
47407,Raj,21," No, I‰Ûªm actually dating two women. Later.",9
47408,Leonard,21, Really? The guy who for years couldn‰Ûªt even talk to women is suddenly going out with two of them? How is that possible?,9
47409,Howard,21," I know. Scientists have tried to reproduce it with computational models, but, in each case, the world blows up.",9
47410,Leonard,21," Seriously, that guy‰Ûªs dating two women?",9
47411,Scene,21, The apartment.,9
47412,Sheldon,21," What, why did you get a party sub?",9
47413,Leonard,21," People are coming over, it looked fun.",9
47414,Sheldon,21," Well, we‰Ûªre only watching Game of Thrones. A party sub implies it‰Ûªs a party.",9
47415,Leonard,21, Your attendance implies it‰Ûªs not.,9
47416,Sheldon,21," I like a party as much as the next man, as long as the next man doesn‰Ûªt like a party. Oh, by the way, don‰Ûªt forget, tomorrow is our quarterly roommate agreement meeting.",9
47417,Leonard,21," Oh, Sheldon, we don‰Ûªt need a meeting every three months.",9
47418,Sheldon,21," Hmm? Well, it sounds like the kind of thing one would bring up at a quarterly roommate agreement meeting. Lucky for you it‰Ûªs tomorrow.",9
47419,Leonard,21," Oh, you know what? I‰Ûªm not going.",9
47420,Sheldon,21," Well, you have to go. It‰Ûªs Penny‰Ûªs first time leading the Pledge of Allegiance.",9
47421,Leonard,21, This meeting is a waste of time. Whether we make the switch from Post Raisin Bran to Kellogg‰Ûªs Raisin Bran should not require parliamentary procedure.,9
47422,Sheldon,21, You realize one of them has sugar on the raisins.,9
47423,Leonard,21, You‰Ûªre the only one who eats them.,9
47424,Sheldon,21," And yet you get to weigh in. Democracy, it‰Ûªs pretty cool, isn‰Ûªt it?",9
47425,Leonard,21," I‰Ûªm not going, you can‰Ûªt make me.",9
47426,Sheldon,21," Well, we‰Ûªll just see about that.",9
47427,Penny,21, What is the problem?,9
47428,Sheldon,21, He says he‰Ûªs not coming to the roommate agreement meeting tomorrow.,9
47429,Penny,21," Well, why the hell did I memorize the Pledge?",9
47430,Leonard,21, You have fun. I will not be attending.,9
47431,Sheldon,21," Oh, fine. We don‰Ûªt have to have a roommate agreement meeting if you don‰Ûªt want to.",9
47432,Leonard,21, Thank you.,9
47433,Sheldon,21," Of course, it will require a vote. Unfortunately, my official gavel is in my bedroom, but luckily, I have my travel gavel.",9
47434,Leonard,21, You‰Ûªre being ridiculous.,9
47435,Sheldon,21," There‰Ûªs a motion on the floor, I‰Ûªm ridiculous. Do we have a second? Hmm? Hmm? There is no second. The motion is denied. Next time, make sure you have the votes first. That was embarrassing.",9
47436,Leonard,21, Can you please talk to him?,9
47437,Penny,21," Well, why are you fighting him on this?",9
47438,Leonard,21," Because I am tired of him always getting his way. We don‰Ûªt need a stupid meeting. We don‰Ûªt even need a roommate agreement, and I hope that sandwich does cause a party.",9
47439,Penny,21," Well, I will still come to your meeting.",9
47440,Sheldon,21," Well, I should hope so. Tomorrow‰Ûªs picture day.",9
47441,Leonard,21, Why are you taking his side?,9
47442,Penny,21," Because it‰Ûªs important to him, and when we signed the roommate agreement, we made a deal.",9
47443,Sheldon,21," You keep talking like that, you‰Ûªre gonna make colour guard.",9
47444,Scene,21, Howard and Bernadette‰Ûªs house.,9
47445,Raj,21," Man, I‰Ûªm worn out.",9
47446,Howard,21, I know. Imagine if we were actually moving.,9
47447,Raj,21," No, it‰Ûªs just, ever since I started dating Claire and Emily at the same time, it‰Ûªs exhausting.",9
47448,Howard,21, You‰Ûªre exhausted? Try folding every five pages in a pregnancy book so your wife thinks you read it.,9
47449,Raj,21," But, dude, you‰Ûªre so lucky. Getting to stay home at night with the woman you love.",9
47450,Howard,21, I guess I am lucky.,9
47451,Raj,21," You are, because dating two women, I mean, I can‰Ûªt even remember the last time I slept in my own apartment. I wake up and I‰Ûªm like, am I at Claire‰Ûªs or am I at Emily‰Ûªs? Is there a third girl I‰Ûªve forgotten about? Like, where am I?",9
47452,Bernadette,21," Hey, Raj.",9
47453,Raj,21," Hey, how‰Ûªs the mommy-to-be?",9
47454,Bernadette,21, Good. A little tired.,9
47455,Raj,21, I feel you. I‰Ûªve been dating multiple women.,9
47456,Howard,21, You sure you don‰Ûªt want to come watch Game of Thrones with us?,9
47457,Bernadette,21, You guys have fun. I‰Ûªm just gonna snuggle up in bed with a book.,9
47458,Raj,21," Oh, that sounds great, a bed to yourself. Can‰Ûªt even remember what that‰Ûªs like.",9
47459,Scene,21, The apartment.,9
47460,Sheldon,21, Are you up-to-date on Game of Thrones?,9
47461,Penny,21," Mm, I think so. Dragons, snow zombies, and all the hot guys are dead.",9
47462,Sheldon,21," Oh, I don‰Ûªt know. Theon Greyjoy looks pretty good for a guy who had his genitals cut off.",9
47463,Penny,21," Uh-oh, somebody‰Ûªs still pouting.",9
47464,Leonard,21, Leave me alone.,9
47465,Penny,21," If it‰Ûªs because you lost a stick, I know where it went.",9
47466,Leonard,21, Not funny.,9
47467,Penny,21, You know you‰Ûªre gonna make up with him. Can we just skip to that part?,9
47468,Leonard,21," Oh, of course, because I‰Ûªm the only adult around here.",9
47469,Penny,21, Really? The only adult?,9
47470,Leonard,21," Yeah, that‰Ûªs right.",9
47471,Sheldon,21," Tonight I‰Ûªll be watching a show rated M.A., and that stands for mature audiences, buster.",9
47472,Penny,21," All right, you would think the only adult wouldn‰Ûªt let something silly ruin our entire night.",9
47473,Leonard,21, And I‰Ûªd think you‰Ûªd understand why I‰Ûªm annoyed.,9
47474,Sheldon,21, All this could be avoided if you‰Ûªd just come to the meeting.,9
47475,Leonard,21, I don‰Ûªt want to.,9
47476,Sheldon,21," Oh, it‰Ûªs just a meeting. One simple meeting.",9
47477,Leonard,21, Stop saying meeting.,9
47478,Sheldon,21," Meeting, meeting, bo-beeting, banana-fana, fo-feeting, fee-fi mo-meeting.",9
47479,Amy,21, I brought my famous spinach dip.,9
47480,Sheldon,21," Yeah, Amy, just one second. Meeting.",9
47481,Scene,21, Howard‰Ûªs car.,9
47482,Howard,21," I‰Ûªm not sure if I‰Ûªm hoping for a boy or a girl. I mean, if it‰Ûªs a boy, I‰Ûªm gonna have to teach him to play catch. Which means I‰Ûªm gonna have to google how to play catch. If it‰Ûªs a girl, I mean, they‰Ûªre so innocent and you know how guys are.",9
47483,Raj,21," Totally, guys are the worst. I mean, look at me. I let Emily make me a frittata and I kept the leftovers in Claire‰Ûªs fridge that night. I‰Ûªm such a dog.",9
47484,Howard,21, There you go again.,9
47485,Raj,21," I‰Ûªm sorry, have I been complaining about it too much?",9
47486,Howard,21," Actually, what you‰Ûªre doing is pretending to complain, but really trying to brag.",9
47487,Raj,21, How could you say that?,9
47488,Howard,21," Oh, I wish could enjoy a cup of tea without a naked girl bouncing up and down on me.",9
47489,Raj,21, I never said that.,9
47490,Howard,21, Don‰Ûªt you hate it when you can‰Ûªt remember whose bra it is you found wedged in your couch?,9
47491,Raj,21," Okay, that I said. But that‰Ûªs a real problem. You give a girl another woman‰Ûªs bra, and you will not be having sex with her that night. Maybe the other girl, but not her.",9
47492,Scene,21, The apartment.,9
47493,Amy,21, What‰Ûªs going on with him?,9
47494,Penny,21," Oh, he‰Ûªs all bent out of shape about having a roommate agreement meeting.",9
47495,Sheldon,21," Apparently, perfect attendance isn‰Ûªt cool any more.",9
47496,Penny,21," Don‰Ûªt worry, he‰Ûªll come around.",9
47497,Amy,21," Well, I get why he‰Ûªs annoyed.",9
47498,Sheldon,21," Well, then you don‰Ûªt understand what‰Ûªs happening. See, Leonard refused to participate in a mandatory quarterly roommate agreement meeting. This is what a generation raised on Bart Simpson looks like.",9
47499,Leonard,21, You love The Simpsons.,9
47500,Sheldon,21, I love Lisa Simpson.,9
47501,Amy,21," Well, I know how he feels. I never enjoyed our relationship agreement meetings.",9
47502,Sheldon,21, Wait. You were pretending?,9
47503,Amy,21, Sorry.,9
47504,Sheldon,21, No. I don‰Ûªt believe you. I could tell.,9
47505,Amy,21," Oh, Sheldon, I never thought re-filing a matter in a standing subcommittee could be so fascinating.",9
47506,Sheldon,21," Hmm, what do you think?",9
47507,Penny,21, You don‰Ûªt know?,9
47508,Scene,21, The stairwell.,9
47509,Raj,21," Hey, did I say something to upset you?",9
47510,Howard,21," No, I‰Ûªm fine.",9
47511,Raj,21," Really? Because usually we walk side by side, and I just went up two flights of stairs staring at your bottom.",9
47512,Howard,21, Just drop it.,9
47513,Raj,21," Okay, I think I see what‰Ûªs happening here. You‰Ûªre jealous of me.",9
47514,Howard,21," Oh, please. What could you possibly have that I would be jealous of?",9
47515,Raj,21," It‰Ûªs not what I have, it‰Ûªs how many people I‰Ûªm having it with.",9
47516,Penny,21," Come on, Sheldon, we‰Ûªll watch Game of Thrones over here.",9
47517,Sheldon,21, Gladly.,9
47518,Leonard,21," Oh, good, go. You know, it‰Ûªll be nice to watch an episode without someone saying, I read the books, don‰Ûªt get too fond of this character.",9
47519,Sheldon,21," It‰Ûªs not always because they die. In one case, it‰Ûªs because they‰Ûªve become involved with underground tree people from the dawn of time. Yeah, but I won‰Ûªt say who it is. It‰Ûªs Brann.",9
47520,Howard,21," Wait, what is going on?",9
47521,Penny,21," Leonard‰Ûªs being a jerk, so we‰Ûªre gonna watch over here.",9
47522,Amy,21, Do you guys want to watch with us?,9
47523,Howard,21, As long as I don‰Ûªt have to watch with him.,9
47524,Raj,21," Fine, I don‰Ûªt want to watch with you either. I‰Ûªll go over here.",9
47525,Howard,21, Why do you get to pick?,9
47526,Raj,21," Okay, then you go there.",9
47527,Howard,21, Don‰Ûªt tell me where to go.,9
47528,Leonard,21," Howard, just come in here.",9
47529,Penny,21," Yeah, come on, Raj.",9
47530,Raj,21," Wait, did Amy make her spinach dip?",9
47531,Sheldon,21, She did.,9
47532,Howard,21, And I‰Ûªm gonna eat it all.,9
47533,Scene,21, The apartment.,9
47534,Howard,21, So what the hell happened?,9
47535,Leonard,21," Oh, I just ran out of patience with Sheldon‰Ûªs nonsense.",9
47536,Howard,21," Tell me about it. I‰Ûªve had it with Raj, too.",9
47537,Amy,21," You know, like women, men have a monthly hormone cycle. Dips in testosterone can cause irritability.",9
47538,Howard,21, Interesting. Maybe my male cycle synced up with Raj‰Ûªs actual period.,9
47539,Leonard,21," If Sheldon‰Ûªs testosterone dipped, he‰Ûªd become a butterfly. (Knock on door) Oh. Maybe someone‰Ûªs here to apologize.",9
47540,Stuart,21," Hey, Leonard.",9
47541,Leonard,21, Stuart.,9
47542,Stuart,21," Uh, is this not a dress-up party?",9
47543,Leonard,21, No.,9
47544,Stuart,21, Was it ever a dress-up party?,9
47545,Leonard,21, No.,9
47546,Stuart,21," Howard, didn‰Ûªt you tell me it was a dress-up party?",9
47547,Howard,21, Yeah.,9
47548,Scene,21, Penny‰Ûªs apartment. Knock on door.,9
47549,Stuart,21, I was told this is where to go if I‰Ûªm mad at Howard.,9
47550,Penny,21, May I take your cloak?,9
47551,Stuart,21, Thanks. This thing kept getting caught in the chain of my bike.,9
47552,Sheldon,21," Well, I‰Ûªll catch you up. Uh, Penny is angry at Leonard, Leonard‰Ûªs angry at me and Penny, I‰Ûªm angry at Leonard and Amy, Raj is angry at Howard, and I‰Ûªm angry at George R.R. Martin ‰Ûªcause there are no new books for me to spoil for Leonard.",9
47553,Stuart,21, So what happened with you and Howard?,9
47554,Raj,21," Says I was talking too much about dating Claire and Emily, and I accused him of being jealous.",9
47555,Stuart,21, I‰Ûªm jealous. Closest I‰Ûªve come to dating two women was that time I dated one woman.,9
47556,Scene,21, The apartment. ,9
47557,Leonard,21," I don‰Ûªt know how you put up with it. He‰Ûªs impossible. I mean, holding a meeting to decide what breakfast cereal we should buy.",9
47558,Howard,21," Yeah. Cap‰Ûªn Crunch with Crunch Berries, move on.",9
47559,Leonard,21," Anyway, Amy, thank you for sticking up for me.",9
47560,Amy,21," Oh, I honestly couldn‰Ûªt care less.",9
47561,Leonard,21, Sorry?,9
47562,Amy,21," Well, I just took your side ‰Ûªcause sometimes I get annoyed at how close Sheldon and Penny are.",9
47563,Leonard,21," Well, they argue all the time. They aren‰Ûªt that close.",9
47564,Amy,21, Who‰Ûªs always comforting him when he‰Ûªs upset?,9
47565,Leonard,21," Penny, but‰Û_",9
47566,Amy,21, Who‰Ûªs the only one who can make him take his medicine when he‰Ûªs sick?,9
47567,Leonard,21," I try to hide it in his peanut butter, but he spits it out.",9
47568,Amy,21, Okay. And did you know she has him add things to the roommate agreement so she can get her way and not fight with you about it?,9
47569,Leonard,21, Son of a bitch. Why is that funny?,9
47570,Howard,21, I don‰Ûªt know. I like the pain of others.,9
47571,Leonard,21," Oh, well, then you‰Ûªll enjoy this. Bernadette does the same thing with you and Koothrappali.",9
47572,Howard,21," No, she doesn‰Ûªt.",9
47573,Leonard,21, She defends him all the time.,9
47574,Howard,21, She does not.,9
47575,Amy,21, Who told you to stop making all those Gandhi jokes about him?,9
47576,Howard,21," Well, she did. And human resources.",9
47577,Leonard,21, Who do you think told Koothrappali to go to human resources?,9
47578,Howard,21, Son of a bitch.,9
47579,Leonard,21," You‰Ûªre, you‰Ûªre right, it feels good.",9
47580,Scene,21, Penny‰Ûªs apartment.,9
47581,Raj,21," All right, it‰Ûªs almost game time. Get it? Game of Thrones, game time?",9
47582,Stuart,21," Two women, huh?",9
47583,Sheldon (at knock on door),21," Oh, perhaps it‰Ûªs Amy coming to her senses.",9
47584,Penny,21, What‰Ûªs up?,9
47585,Leonard,21," You know, you don‰Ûªt need to use Sheldon to get your way with me in a dumb roommate agreement.",9
47586,Penny,21, Where‰Ûªd you get that from?,9
47587,Leonard,21, From Amy.,9
47588,Penny,21," Ugh. Amy, why did you tell him that?",9
47589,Amy,21, Because you were defending Sheldon like you always do.,9
47590,Penny,21, I don‰Ûªt always defend Sheldon.,9
47591,Leonard,21," Oh, yes, you do. You know you have a weird brother-sister-Elliott-E.T. relationship with him.",9
47592,Penny,21, What about your weird relationship with him?,9
47593,Leonard,21, That‰Ûªs different. I‰Ûªm like the little girl in Poltergeist and he‰Ûªs the creepy thing in the TV.,9
47594,Howard,21," Um, guys? Were there any nuts in that food?",9
47595,Leonard,21, I don‰Ûªt think so. Why?,9
47596,Howard,21, Well just a feeling.,9
47597,Scene,21, A hospital waiting room.,9
47598,Leonard,21, It just said Italian sub. I had no idea mortadella has pistachios in it.,9
47599,Sheldon,21," Interesting fact, in Italian, the morta in mortadella means death.",9
47600,Amy,21, Sheldon.,9
47601,Sheldon,21, I didn‰Ûªt say fun fact. I‰Ûªm not a monster.,9
47602,Bernadette,21, He‰Ûªs gonna be okay.,9
47603,Sheldon,21, Now it‰Ûªs a fun fact.,9
47604,Stuart,21," Boy, stuff like this really puts things in perspective.",9
47605,Bernadette,21, Why are you dressed like that?,9
47606,Stuart,21," Oh, uh, Howard thought it‰Ûªd be funny to tell me it was a costume party.",9
47607,Bernadette,21, That wasn‰Ûªt nice.,9
47608,Stuart,21," No, but he almost died, so we‰Ûªre cool.",9
47609,Raj,21," You know, if you think about it, tonight was kind of like a real-life Game of Thrones.",9
47610,Amy,21, How?,9
47611,Raj,21," Well, Howard eating that pistachio was like when King Joffrey got poisoned.",9
47612,Penny,21," Okay, well, that was murder, this was an accident.",9
47613,Raj,21, Okay. But you using Sheldon to do your dirty work is like when Cersei used the King‰Ûªs Guard to do her bidding.,9
47614,Sheldon,21, Cersei uses her body to manipulate men. Penny just takes me to The LEGO Store.,9
47615,Raj,21," Okay. Oh, how about this? Stuart‰Ûªs dressed like a brother of the Night‰Ûªs Watch, and they don‰Ûªt have sex.",9
47616,Penny,21, There you go.,9
47617,Leonard,21, That‰Ûªs true.,9
47618,Sheldon,21, Fair enough.,9
47619,Howard,21, Hey.,9
47620,Leonard,21, Hey.,9
47621,Bernadette,21, You all right?,9
47622,Howard,21, I‰Ûªm fine. Just a little embarrassed I had to be carried down the stairs like a baby. Thanks.,9
47623,Leonard,21, Let‰Ûªs get out of here.,9
47624,Amy,21, That was scary.,9
47625,Sheldon,21," Well, the important thing is I said that big sandwich would ruin everything, and I was right.",9
47626,Scene,21, The street. ,9
47627,Raj (shouting from upstairs window),21," Hey, Jon Snow. How come your horse has a basket on it?",9
47628,Stuart,21, How come your head has your face on it?,9
47629,Sheldon,21," They don‰Ûªt wear bicycle helmets in Game of Thrones. You‰Ûªre thematically inaccurate, but I applaud your commitment to safety.",9
47630,Stuart,21, Don‰Ûªt you guys have anything better to do?,9
47631,Leonard,21, Better than watching a guy in a fur cloak ride a girl‰Ûªs bike? Nope.,9
47632,Stuart,21," That‰Ûªs it, you just lost bathroom privileges at the comic book store. Horse has a basket on it. Stupid‰Û_ aaargh!",9
47633,Scene,21, Leonard‰Ûªs bedroom.,9
47634,Sheldon,21," (Knock, knock, knock) Leonard. (Knock, knock, knock) Leonard. (Knock, knock, knock) Leonard.",9
47635,Leonard,21, What?,9
47636,Sheldon,21, I never got to ask my question about Batman.,9
47637,Leonard,21, What is it?,9
47638,Sheldon,21," If Batman were bitten by a radioactive Man-Bat, and then fought crime disguised as Man-Bat, would he be Man-Bat-Man-Bat-Man or simply Man-Bat-Man-Bat-Batman?",9
47639,Penny,21, Is he still wearing the Batman suit under the Man-Bat suit?,9
47640,Sheldon,21, I‰Ûªll be back.,9
47641,Scene,22, The apartment,9
47642,Penny,22," Oh, hey, if you guys are free this weekend, I won a night of wine tasting from work.",9
47643,Leonard,22, That sounds fun.,9
47644,Penny,22, Mm-hmm.,9
47645,Leonard,22, How come scientists don‰Ûªt win free stuff like salespeople do?,9
47646,Howard,22, ‰Û÷Cause we‰Ûªre not in it for the stuff. We‰Ûªre in it for the groupies.,9
47647,Sheldon,22," Personally, I find the notion of external rewards demeaning. I pursue science for the intrinsic joy of discovery.",9
47648,Amy,22, But you always say that you want to win a Nobel Prize.,9
47649,Sheldon,22," I also say don‰Ûªt contradict me in front of my friends, but that you don‰Ûªt remember.",9
47650,Penny,22," All right, well, let me know if you guys want to go.",9
47651,Raj,22, I would love to. I do enjoy the complexity of an aged Pinot noir.,9
47652,Leonard,22, I‰Ûªm sure that would pair nicely with your fried nuggets of chicken.,9
47653,Amy,22," Well, it sounds like a nice night. We should go.",9
47654,Sheldon,22," Wine again? Yeah, no, thank you. I like my grapes the old-fashioned way, in a juice box.",9
47655,Amy,22," Well, I‰Ûªm going. You couldn‰Ûªt stop me from getting a massage at the mall, and you‰Ûªre not stopping me now.",9
47656,Sheldon,22, I shouldn‰Ûªt have to see my girlfriend get groped in public by another man.,9
47657,Amy,22, And I shouldn‰Ûªt have to see my boyfriend riding on a train for children around the mall.,9
47658,Penny,22, The little choo-choo for toddlers?,9
47659,Amy,22, And now you know why I needed the massage.,9
47660,Howard,22," Well, we‰Ûªre out. Bernie can‰Ûªt drink ‰Ûªcause she‰Ûªs pregnant. And she‰Ûªs pregnant because we had sex. And we had sex because, well, come on.",9
47661,Bernadette,22," It‰Ûªs okay, you should go.",9
47662,Howard,22, You sure?,9
47663,Bernadette,22, Of course.,9
47664,Penny,22," Yeah, give her a break from, well, come on.",9
47665,Sheldon,22," Well, Bernadette, looks like Saturday night, it‰Ûªs you and me.",9
47666,Bernadette,22, Me? How? Why?,9
47667,Sheldon,22," Well, it makes perfect sense. Because you‰Ûªre an expectant mother, you can‰Ûªt drink alcohol. I don‰Ûªt like to. You can‰Ûªt have sushi. I don‰Ûªt like to. You can‰Ûªt go in hot tubs. I consider them vats of sweaty people soup.",9
47668,Bernadette,22," Gee, Sheldon, I don‰Ûªt know.",9
47669,Sheldon,22," Oh, come on. Roller coasters, caffeine, runny eggs, I‰Ûªve been avoiding these things all my life. And now, because you‰Ûªre pregnant, you have to.",9
47670,Leonard,22," The difference is she‰Ûªs bringing life into the world, and you suck it out.",9
47671,Bernadette,22, I guess we could give it a try.,9
47672,Sheldon,22," Well, little lady, you‰Ûªve heard of party hearty, get ready to party hardly.",9
47673,Howard,22, I bet you‰Ûªd like a drink right now.,9
47674,Scene,22, Howard‰Ûªs workshop,9
47675,Raj,22," Hey, you think it‰Ûªd be okay if I brought Claire to the wine tasting?",9
47676,Leonard,22, Sure. I‰Ûªd like to meet her.,9
47677,Raj,22," Oh, that‰Ûªs great. I‰Ûªve been wanting her to meet you guys, too, so this seems like the perfect opportunity.",9
47678,Sheldon,22," Oh, but I won‰Ûªt be there.",9
47679,Raj,22, Funny how that worked out.,9
47680,Leonard,22, Does this mean Emily‰Ûªs not in the picture anymore?,9
47681,Raj,22," No, I‰Ûªm still dating her.",9
47682,Leonard,22," Okay, help me out. How are you doing this? Do they know about each other?",9
47683,Raj,22," They know that we‰Ûªre not exclusive, and we just don‰Ûªt ask too many questions.",9
47684,Sheldon,22," You know, it‰Ûªs like how I play Warlords of Ka‰Ûªa with you and Elder Sign with Frank and Alicia.",9
47685,Leonard,22, Who‰Ûªs Frank and Alicia?,9
47686,Sheldon,22," You, you and I spend a lot of time together. Can there be a little mystery between us?",9
47687,Howard,22, Okay. Everything‰Ûªs hooked up. We‰Ûªre ready.,9
47688,Sheldon,22, I am going to record this for posterity.,9
47689,Leonard,22," All right, here goes nothing.",9
47690,Sheldon,22, Here goes nothing? This is the initial test of our prototype. Can we give it a little more gravitas?,9
47691,Leonard,22," Fine. Preliminary trial of the infinite persistence gyroscopic navigational system, phase one commencing.",9
47692,Sheldon,22," Eh, maybe it‰Ûªs your voice. I‰Ûªm gonna see if I can get James Earl Jones to do it in post.",9
47693,Raj,22," It‰Ûªs, it‰Ûªs beautiful.",9
47694,Howard,22," Actually, it‰Ûªs making me dizzy.",9
47695,Leonard,22," Good, it‰Ûªs not just me.",9
47696,Scene,22, Raj‰Ûªs apartment.,9
47697,Claire (on phone),22, Hello.,9
47698,Raj,22," Hey, Claire.",9
47699,Claire,22," Hey, what‰Ûªs up?",9
47700,Raj,22," Hi, yeah. Um, I was wondering, if you‰Ûªre free Saturday night, all my friends are going to a wine tasting.",9
47701,Claire,22," Sure, I guess. If you don‰Ûªt think meeting your friends is too big a step.",9
47702,Raj,22, Why would it be too big a step?,9
47703,Claire,22, I don‰Ûªt know. I just don‰Ûªt want things to get weird.,9
47704,Raj,22," Nothing to worry about. People meet people all the time, and it isn‰Ûªt weird. I met Bon Jovi once, which you‰Ûªd think might be weird. Turns out, total sweetheart.",9
47705,Claire,22," Okay, but you and I have been keeping things casual. Uh, will you introduce me as your friend or as your girlfriend? What if I like them and they don‰Ûªt like me? What if they like me and I don‰Ûªt like them?",9
47706,Raj,22," Boy, it wasn‰Ûªt this hard with Bon Jovi. I said you rock, he said, thanks, man, and that was that.",9
47707,Scene,22, The apartment.,9
47708,Penny,22," Hey, you ready to go?",9
47709,Leonard,22, Hang on.,9
47710,Penny,22, What are you doing?,9
47711,Leonard,22," Oh, I found a scratch-and-sniff book about wine tasting. It teaches the different flavour notes to look for.",9
47712,Penny,22, You actually smell the wine?,9
47713,Leonard,22, I mostly just smell my nasal spray.,9
47714,Penny,22, Are your sinuses acting up?,9
47715,Leonard,22, Since my preschool got a bunny.,9
47716,Penny,22," Hey, are you still hanging out with Bernadette tonight?",9
47717,Sheldon,22, Yes. And we‰Ûªre going to prove that we don‰Ûªt need alcohol to enjoy ourselves.,9
47718,Penny,22," Oh, good for you.",9
47719,Sheldon,22," Or caffeine, tobacco, sushi, soft cheese, processed meats and jacuzzis, which can all be harmful to an unborn baby.",9
47720,Penny,22," No honey baked ham in a hot tub, got it.",9
47721,Sheldon,22," Oh, no bubble baths either. They can increase the risk of a urinary tract infection.",9
47722,Leonard,22," Okay, have fun.",9
47723,Sheldon,22," Oh, and no swordfish, king mackerel, shark or tilefish, which are all high in mercury.",9
47724,Leonard,22, We‰Ûªre leaving now!,9
47725,Sheldon,22," Oh, and no contact with guinea pigs or hamsters or their droppings, uh, no-no cat litter boxes, no paint fumes.",9
47726,Penny,22," Okay, we‰Ûªre leaving, love you, bye.",9
47727,Sheldon,22," Boy, do I love restrictions.",9
47728,Scene,22, The wine tasting.,9
47729,Howard,22, Hey. Where is everybody?,9
47730,Amy,22," Oh, we‰Ûªre the first ones here.",9
47731,Howard,22, Oh. Cool.,9
47732,Amy,22, Yeah. Cool.,9
47733,Howard,22," You know, I don‰Ûªt remember the last time it was just you and me hanging out.",9
47734,Amy,22," Oh, I do. It was three years ago.",9
47735,Howard,22," Oh, yeah, and we said we should do it more often. And, and, and, and, and here we are.",9
47736,Amy,22," So, Sheldon and Bernadette are hanging out.",9
47737,Howard,22, I know. What are they gonna talk about?,9
47738,Amy,22, I don‰Ûªt know. I really don‰Ûªt know.,9
47739,Leonard,22, Hey.,9
47740,Howard,22," Oh, good.",9
47741,Amy,22," Oh, thank God.",9
47742,Penny,22, You guys been here long?,9
47743,Howard,22," No, two minutes.",9
47744,Amy,22, But yes.,9
47745,Howard,22, Where‰Ûªs Claire?,9
47746,Raj,22," Oh, she‰Ûªs meeting us here. Hey, guys, do me a favour and don‰Ûªt ask too many questions about the relationship. We‰Ûªre just keeping it casual.",9
47747,Leonard,22," Oh, so I shouldn‰Ûªt ask her how she feels about being a member of your harem?",9
47748,Raj,22," Yeah, I know you‰Ûªre teasing, but watch out for karma.",9
47749,Amy,22," Hey, Penny, isn‰Ûªt that your old boyfriend Zack?",9
47750,Penny,22," Oh, yeah.",9
47751,Amy,22, Are you gonna say hi to him?,9
47752,Penny,22," Uh, I don‰Ûªt know.",9
47753,Raj,22," Hey, while you decide, who was better in bed, big hot Zack or wheezy little Leonard? Neener neener.",9
47754,Scene,22, The apartment.,9
47755,Bernadette,22, I brought sparkling cider.,9
47756,Sheldon,22," Oh, the bubbles tickle my nose. I‰Ûªll just open this now so it can get nice and flat before we drink it.",9
47757,Bernadette,22, So what do you want to do tonight?,9
47758,Sheldon,22," Oh, I have quite the evening planned. Our foetus-friendly festival of fun begins with an in-depth look at the world of model trains, and then we‰Ûªll kick things up a notch and explore all the different ways that you can make toast.",9
47759,Bernadette,22, There‰Ûªs more than one?,9
47760,Sheldon,22, You‰Ûªve heard of French toast?,9
47761,Bernadette,22, Yeah.,9
47762,Sheldon,22, Cinnamon toast?,9
47763,Bernadette,22, Yeah.,9
47764,Sheldon,22, Melba toast?,9
47765,Bernadette,22, Yeah.,9
47766,Sheldon,22, You get where I‰Ûªm going here?,9
47767,Bernadette,22, Yeah.,9
47768,Scene,22, The wine tasting.,9
47769,Amy,22, I‰Ûªm getting an earthy note.,9
47770,Penny,22," Ah, there‰Ûªs definitely some oak.",9
47771,Raj,22," Also, uh, cherries?",9
47772,Leonard,22, I smell nothing.,9
47773,Howard,22, Really? Nothing?,9
47774,Leonard,22, Just a whole lot of Afrin.,9
47775,Zack,22, Penny?,9
47776,Penny,22," Oh. Zack, hi. You guys remember Zack.",9
47777,Howard,22," Yeah, hey, buddy.",9
47778,Amy,22, Hello.,9
47779,Raj,22, Hey.,9
47780,Zack,22," Hey, did you two get married?",9
47781,Penny,22, We did.,9
47782,Leonard,22," Yeah, mm-hmm.",9
47783,Zack,22, To each other?,9
47784,Penny,22, Yes.,9
47785,Zack,22," Cool. ‰Û÷Cause other than when you broke up with him and dated me, then broke up with me, and then dated me one more time before going back to him, I was always rooting for you two.",9
47786,Leonard,22, Thanks.,9
47787,Zack,22, So how‰Ûªs the science world? What are you guys up to?,9
47788,Howard,22, We‰Ûªve actually been working on a prototype for a navigation system we invented.,9
47789,Leonard,22, But we won‰Ûªt bore you with the details.,9
47790,Zack,22," Are you kidding? I love science. Einstein, Stephen Hawking, Mike deGrasse Tyson.",9
47791,Amy,22, Mike deGrasse Tyson?,9
47792,Howard,22," Yeah, you know, the boxer who grew a moustache and became a scientist.",9
47793,Zack,22, So what‰Ûªs your invention?,9
47794,Howard,22," Well, we‰Ûªre using quantum vortices to replace gyroscopes in guidance systems.",9
47795,Leonard,22, What‰Ûªs neat is that they can maintain angular momentum indefinitely.,9
47796,Zack,22, Angular momentum. I was wondering about that.,9
47797,Howard,22," You could put it in a satellite or a rocket, and it‰Ûªll run forever.",9
47798,Zack,22, Cool. Could it be used for missiles and war stuff?,9
47799,Howard,22," Yeah, but we didn‰Ûªt create it for weapons.",9
47800,Leonard,22, And I doubt the military would be interested in our little guidance system.,9
47801,Zack,22, Is it better than the one they use now?,9
47802,Howard,22, A lot.,9
47803,Leonard,22, Way better.,9
47804,Zack,22, Huh. You sure you guys are smart?,9
47805,Scene,22, The apartment.,9
47806,Sheldon,22," H-O gauge trains are 1/87th scale. N gauge are 1/160th scale. And that brings us to Z gauge, at a, you could easily swallow it, don‰Ûªt ask how I know, 1 to 220.",9
47807,Bernadette,22," I‰Ûªm sorry, I have to ask.",9
47808,Sheldon,22," When I was five, I ingested a Z gauge locomotive. I spent the next three days saying, I think I can pass it, I think I can pass it, I think I can pass it.",9
47809,Bernadette,22, What is it about trains that you like so much?,9
47810,Sheldon,22," What an interesting question. When I was a child, life was confusing and chaotic for me, and trains represented order. I could line them up, categorize them, control them. I guess you could say that they gave me a sense of calm in a world that didn‰Ûªt.",9
47811,Bernadette,22," That‰Ûªs lovely, Sheldon.",9
47812,Sheldon,22," Well, other than when they‰Ûªre chugging through your bowels, these things are magic.",9
47813,Scene,22, The wine tasting.,9
47814,Leonard,22," I have to admit, I‰Ûªve been worried about the military applications since we started talking about this.",9
47815,Howard,22," Me, too.",9
47816,Leonard,22, Why didn‰Ûªt you say something?,9
47817,Howard,22, Same reason I don‰Ûªt talk about ass cancer. It‰Ûªs not a pleasant topic.,9
47818,Raj,22, You can‰Ûªt let this stop you. Almost any scientific advancement can be used for destructive purposes.,9
47819,Amy,22, It‰Ûªs true. Even Einstein‰Ûªs theory of relativity was later applied to the development of nuclear weapons.,9
47820,Penny,22," E equals MC squared. Yeah. E is for energy, M for mass, and C for the speed of light.",9
47821,Amy,22, How do you know that?,9
47822,Penny,22," Oh, Leonard mumbles it when he wants sex to last longer.",9
47823,Claire,22," Hey, Raj.",9
47824,Raj,22," Hey, Claire. Good, you‰Ûªre here. Guys, this is my friend Claire. We‰Ûªre casually dating, and there‰Ûªs no need for any further questions about it.",9
47825,Leonard,22, Would you like a glass of wine?,9
47826,Raj,22, I said no questions.,9
47827,Scene,22, The apartment. ,9
47828,Sheldon,22," And last but not least, this is one that I like to call Star Wars Toast because it has a light side and a dark side. All righty, it‰Ûªs time for Dungeons & Dragons.",9
47829,Bernadette,22, Dungeons & Dragons? That sounds about right.,9
47830,Sheldon,22, You‰Ûªre gonna enjoy this. I designed it especially for you.,9
47831,Bernadette,22," Okay, but just for a little bit.",9
47832,Sheldon,22," Oh, I have a feeling that once you start, you‰Ûªre not gonna want to or be allowed to stop.",9
47833,Bernadette,22, All right.,9
47834,Sheldon,22, Ready?,9
47835,Bernadette,22, You bet.,9
47836,Sheldon,22," Your name is Bernatrix. You are a warrior queen. You‰Ûªre strong, beautiful and tall.",9
47837,Bernadette,22, Oh. I like the idea of being tall.,9
47838,Sheldon,22," I think you‰Ûªre gonna like a lot of things I have in store. For example, in this world, only the men get pregnant, so your husband is home trying not to pee when he laughs.",9
47839,Bernadette,22, This is getting fun. What‰Ûªs next?,9
47840,Sheldon,22," You‰Ûªre parched and weary from battle. You stand in front of a tavern that serves the coldest, most delicious ale in all the realm.",9
47841,Bernadette,22," Oh, I haven‰Ûªt had a drink in months.",9
47842,Sheldon,22, What do you do?,9
47843,Bernadette,22," I storm in, slam my sword down, and say, barkeep, bring me the strongest ale you have and serve it in the skull of a goblin.",9
47844,Sheldon,22, He wants to see I.D.,9
47845,Scene,22, The wine tasting.,9
47846,Amy,22," So, Claire, we‰Ûªve heard so many wonderful things about you.",9
47847,Claire,22, Really? Like what?,9
47848,Amy,22," Uh, mostly Penny‰Ûªs heard them.",9
47849,Zack,22," Boy, you get some dirty looks over there when you ask for ice.",9
47850,Raj,22," Zack, this is my friend Claire.",9
47851,Zack,22, You‰Ûªre hot. You seeing anybody?,9
47852,Raj,22," Uh, she‰Ûªs seeing me.",9
47853,Zack,22, Why‰Ûªd you say she‰Ûªs your friend?,9
47854,Raj,22, We‰Ûªre just keeping it casual.,9
47855,Zack,22, Why is he being casual with you? You seem great.,9
47856,Claire,22, I don‰Ûªt know. Ask him.,9
47857,Zack,22, Why are you being casual with her? She seems great.,9
47858,Scene,22, The toilets.,9
47859,Leonard,22, Maybe we should take a step back.,9
47860,Howard,22, Take a step back? I‰Ûªm not a young man any more.,9
47861,Leonard,22," No, I mean re-evaluate what we‰Ûªre doing with the guidance system.",9
47862,Howard,22, But I got a baby on the way. I got to make some money.,9
47863,Leonard,22, What good is money gonna do if we inadvertently bring about Armageddon?,9
47864,Howard,22," Okay, let me stop you right there. We absolutely know our invention will not be used to destroy the world.",9
47865,Leonard,22, How?,9
47866,Howard,22, Because no one from the future has come back to kill us.,9
47867,Leonard,22, Very funny.,9
47868,Howard,22, You got something better?,9
47869,Leonard,22," Well, not really.",9
47870,Howard,22," Okay, then. Geez, how much wine did you drink?",9
47871,Leonard,22, Not a lot. I just couldn‰Ûªt start until you walked away.,9
47872,Scene,22, The apartment.,9
47873,Sheldon,22, The Hell Prawn lunges out of the hot spring. You block it with your shield. Do you attack?,9
47874,Bernadette,22, Does it have eyes?,9
47875,Sheldon,22, Three giant red ones and they never blink. It‰Ûªs unsettling.,9
47876,Bernadette,22, I stab it in the middle eye.,9
47877,Sheldon,22," Good choice. Critical hit. Your sword goes through its eye into its tiny brain. With its final dying gasp, it says, you have reduced me to a pile of sushi. Enjoy me with this packet of soy sauce. It‰Ûªs low sodium. Aaaah.",9
47878,Bernadette,22," Okay, I guess I should eat the Hell Prawn.",9
47879,Sheldon,22," Using your sword, you prepare a beautiful sushi dinner. You slip into the hot spring and enjoy the warm water on your aching joints. As you happily close your eyes, you recall the incredible evening you‰Ûªve had and notice that your feet and ankles are smaller than they‰Ûªve ever been. The end.",9
47880,Bernadette,22," Wow, this night turned out to be so much more fun than I thought.",9
47881,Sheldon,22," Oh, the fun doesn‰Ûªt stop. You‰Ûªre still going home with a goodie bag full of toast.",9
47882,Bernadette,22," Thank you for this. You know, ever since people found out I‰Ûªm having a baby, I feel like I became Pregnant Bernadette. It was nice to take a little break tonight.",9
47883,Sheldon,22," I can understand that. From the moment people realized I was a genius, I‰Ûªve been Sheldon the Genius. Although I‰Ûªve never really wanted a break from that, so I suppose I don‰Ûªt understand. Which is ironic ‰Ûªcause, you know, genius.",9
47884,Bernadette,22," Well, thanks again.",9
47885,Sheldon,22," You‰Ûªre welcome. And any time you need a break from being Bernadette the Pregnant, Bernatrix the Warrior Queen is here waiting.",9
47886,Bernadette,22, I might just take you up on that.,9
47887,Sheldon,22," Well, mind you now, that offer‰Ûªs only good until the third trimester. I can‰Ûªt risk getting amniotic fluid on my spot.",9
47888,Scene,22, The wine tasting. ,9
47889,Raj,22," Hey, dude, you‰Ûªre killing me with Claire.",9
47890,Zack,22, What are you talking about?,9
47891,Raj,22," I mean, come on, look at you. You‰Ûªre classically handsome, you‰Ûªve got a swimmer‰Ûªs body. Next to you, I look like me.",9
47892,Zack,22," Oh, man, I didn‰Ûªt mean to do that. But I do appreciate you recognizing my swimmer‰Ûªs body. Which, incidentally, I got from playing Marco Polo at the YMCA.",9
47893,Raj,22," Yeah, okay, just do me a favour and stop talking about how great Claire is.",9
47894,Zack,22," Anything for you, my little foreign friend.",9
47895,Claire,22," So, I got to ask, does Raj bring around other girls?",9
47896,Penny,22," Uh, you know, I‰Ûªm not really around that much. Amy knows much more than I do.",9
47897,Leonard,22," I don‰Ûªt think you have anything to worry about. Raj is a terrific guy, loyal to a fault.",9
47898,Howard,22, Yeah. He still has an AOL address.,9
47899,Zack,22, I see what you‰Ûªre saying. She‰Ûªs not so great.,9
47900,Raj,22," Don‰Ûªt listen to him. He says crazy things all the time. Uh, watch. Marco.",9
47901,Zack,22, Polo.,9
47902,Raj,22," So, uh, what are you guys talking about?",9
47903,Claire,22, Your friends were just telling me about all the other girls you‰Ûªre dating.,9
47904,Raj,22, Why would you do that? I specifically asked you not to do that.,9
47905,Penny,22, We didn‰Ûªt.,9
47906,Amy,22, You just did.,9
47907,Zack,22, Wow. Maybe none of you guys are smart.,9
47908,Scene,22, The apartment.,9
47909,Leonard,22, Morning.,9
47910,Sheldon,22, Morning.,9
47911,Leonard,22, Ugh. Too much wine.,9
47912,Sheldon,22," Oh, I overdid it myself last night. Hair of the dog.",9
47913,Leonard,22," Hey, did you ever think about the military applications for the guidance system?",9
47914,Sheldon,22, Of course.,9
47915,Leonard,22, Does it bother you?,9
47916,Sheldon,22," No, it did at first, but then I talked it through with Frank and Alicia, and they really helped put things into perspective.",9
47917,Leonard,22, Who are these people?,9
47918,Sheldon,22," Leonard, friends are like toilet paper. It‰Ûªs good to have extras under the sink.",9
47919,Scene,23, The apartment.,9
47920,Penny,23, Helium.,9
47921,Sheldon,23, Yes.,9
47922,Penny,23, Yes.,9
47923,Sheldon,23, Taylor Swift.,9
47924,Penny,23, Yes. Pi.,9
47925,Sheldon,23, Yes. Kardashian.,9
47926,Penny,23, More specific.,9
47927,Sheldon,23, Khloe?,9
47928,Penny,23, Yes.,9
47929,Sheldon,23," See, I remembered because if it looks like Kim it‰Ûªs Kim, if it looks kind of like Kim it‰Ûªs Kourtney, and if it looks nothing like Kim it‰Ûªs Khloe.",9
47930,Penny,23," Oh, that‰Ûªs a Venn Diagram, and I remember because I thought to myself, venn is he gonna stop talking about this diagram?",9
47931,Leonard,23, What are you guys doing?,9
47932,Sheldon,23," Oh, well, we decided to use our breakfast time to expand our respective knowledge bases.",9
47933,Leonard,23," Oh, let me try.",9
47934,Penny,23, Okay.,9
47935,Leonard,23," Hmm, atom of hydrogen, Adam of Maroon 5, mic drop.",9
47936,Sheldon,23," I‰Ûªm sorry, who is Mike Drop?",9
47937,Leonard,23," Oh, hey, Penny, do you want to go to the airport with me later to pick up my mother?",9
47938,Penny,23, Sure.,9
47939,Leonard,23, Thanks.,9
47940,Penny,23, No problem.,9
47941,Leonard,23," Hey, Penny, um, since you‰Ûªre already gonna be at the airport, do I need to go?",9
47942,Sheldon,23, Why don‰Ûªt you want to get your mother from the airport?,9
47943,Leonard,23," Well, I can do without the 40-minute car ride where she criticizes every aspect of my life.",9
47944,Sheldon,23, She can cover it in a car ride? I could do 40 minutes on your posture alone.,9
47945,Penny,23, You really want me to pick up your mother all by myself?,9
47946,Leonard,23," Hmm, I just feel like it would be a good chance for you to bond.",9
47947,Penny,23, Or a way for you to avoid her?,9
47948,Leonard,23," I don‰Ûªt know what he‰Ûªs putting on those cards, but you are smarter than ever.",9
47949,Penny,23," Fine, if you really want me to, I will pick your mom up.",9
47950,Leonard,23, Seriously?,9
47951,Penny,23," Yeah, you know what, she is my mother-in-law, and I‰Ûªd like for us to have a good relationship.",9
47952,Leonard,23," That is very mature of you, so I‰Ûªm gonna go ahead and say, suckah.",9
47953,Sheldon,23," All right, back to learning.",9
47954,Penny,23, Okay.,9
47955,Sheldon,23," Oh, easy, Bill Nye the Science Guy.",9
47956,Penny,23, Or as I know him?,9
47957,Sheldon,23, Creepy old dude from Dancing with the Stars.,9
47958,Penny,23," Ding, ding, ding, ding, ding.",9
47959,Scene,23, The comic book store.,9
47960,Raj,23, Did you guys see there‰Ûªs an Avengers screening? Joss Whedon‰Ûªs gonna show some deleted scenes and do a question and answer session.,9
47961,Sheldon,23," Oh, well, I have a few questions for him about the last Avengers movie, and a whole lot of answers.",9
47962,Leonard,23, When‰Ûªs the screening?,9
47963,Raj,23," Uh, it‰Ûªs tonight, but it‰Ûªs first-come, first-served, so we should probably get there early and wait in line.",9
47964,Howard,23, Let‰Ûªs do it.,9
47965,Leonard,23," Penny‰Ûªs busy with my mother, so I‰Ûªm in.",9
47966,Sheldon,23," Oh, bad news. Amy‰Ûªs making me go shopping with her later, so looks like none of us can go.",9
47967,Leonard,23, You do realize we‰Ûªre allowed to have fun without you?,9
47968,Howard,23," In fact, that‰Ûªs usually the trick to it. What time do we need to get there?",9
47969,Raj,23," Uh, I‰Ûªd say by three.",9
47970,Sheldon,23, You‰Ûªre really going without me?,9
47971,Leonard,23," It‰Ûªs not a big deal. Go shopping with Amy, and we‰Ûªll save a spot in line for you.",9
47972,Sheldon,23," You don‰Ûªt have the authority to save places in the line. If I do that, I‰Ûªll be cutting.",9
47973,Leonard,23, People do it all the time.,9
47974,Sheldon,23," You know the golden rule of line etiquette. No cuts, no buts, no coconuts.",9
47975,Howard,23," If you really care that much, there are apps now that‰Ûªll let you hire people to do stuff like errands and wait in lines.",9
47976,Stuart,23," People are actually waiting in lines as a job? Boy, makes me feel better about my life.",9
47977,Howard,23, Some of these guys make over $20 an hour.,9
47978,Stuart,23, And now I feel worse again.,9
47979,Scene,23, Penny‰Ûªs car.,9
47980,Beverly,23, I‰Ûªm not surprised Leonard chose to avoid picking me up. He‰Ûªs battled intimacy issues his whole life. Does he have difficulty maintaining erections?,9
47981,Penny,23," Wow. Didn‰Ûªt even make it out of the parking lot. Uh, you know what, enough about Leonard. Let‰Ûªs talk about you. What would you like to do while you‰Ûªre here?",9
47982,Beverly,23," Dear, I‰Ûªm a psychiatrist. You don‰Ûªt have to avoid having intimate conversations with me.",9
47983,Penny,23," Well, I‰Ûªd actually like for us to be close, but maybe we start with our favourite books and work our way up to my husband‰Ûªs sex organs.",9
47984,Beverly,23, Very well. What‰Ûªs the last book you read?,9
47985,Penny,23," Um, does Pottery Barn, Spring count?",9
47986,Beverly,23," Penny, it‰Ûªs only natural to want your mother-in-law to like you, and I acknowledge I can be an intimidating person. So what can I do to make this process easier for you?",9
47987,Penny,23," Uh, for starters, maybe you can not psychoanalyze everything I say?",9
47988,Beverly,23, And how does it make you feel when I psychoanalyze everything you say?,9
47989,Penny,23, Uncomfortable.,9
47990,Beverly,23," That was a joke, dear.",9
47991,Penny,23," Oh. Sorry. Didn‰Ûªt know you made those. Hey, listen, what if we have a little mother-in-law, daughter-in-law dinner tonight?",9
47992,Beverly,23, So just the two of us?,9
47993,Penny,23," Or I invite a few girlfriends, ‰Ûªcause hearing you say the two of us just sent a chill right down my spine.",9
47994,Scene,23, Amy‰Ûªs car.,9
47995,Stuart,23, Hey.,9
47996,Amy,23, What are you doing here? You‰Ûªre not Sheldon.,9
47997,Stuart,23, I thought that might come up. Sheldon hired me to go shopping with you.,9
47998,Amy,23, Hold on. He paid you to get out of spending time with me?,9
47999,Stuart,23," No, it‰Ûªs not like that. There‰Ûªs a long line he‰Ûªd rather stand in. So what are we doing? Old Navy, Build-A-Bear? I get paid either way.",9
48000,Amy,23, We‰Ûªre not going shopping together.,9
48001,Stuart,23, You sure? I‰Ûªm happy to hold your bag. And Sheldon gave me money for a hotdog on a stick.,9
48002,Amy,23, Can you understand why I might be annoyed right now?,9
48003,Stuart,23," Look, lady, I just work here.",9
48004,Scene,23, The cinema line.,9
48005,Howard,23," We‰Ûªve waited in a lot of lines together, haven‰Ûªt we?",9
48006,Sheldon,23, Remember when we camped out for the Doctor Who panel at Comic-Con?,9
48007,Raj,23," Yeah, sleeping under the stars with other fans who love the show as much as we do.",9
48008,Leonard,23," Waking up, wondering which one of those fans stole our wallets.",9
48009,Sheldon,23," Stuart, what are you doing here?",9
48010,Stuart,23," Sheldon, you are the most inconsiderate person I have ever met in my entire life. Where do you get off sending me to shop with your girlfriend?",9
48011,Sheldon,23," I don‰Ûªt understand. You were happy to do this when I hired you. Why, why are you upset with me now?",9
48012,Stuart,23," Oh, I‰Ûªm not upset with you, but Amy‰Ûªs pretty bent out of shape, so she hired me to let you have it.",9
48013,Sheldon,23," Well, I suppose turnabout is fair play.",9
48014,Stuart,23," You‰Ûªre darn right it‰Ûªs fair play, you selfish jerk.",9
48015,Scene,23, Penny‰Ûªs apartment.,9
48016,Amy,23," You know, just when I think we‰Ûªre making progress in our relationship, we revert to our old patterns where thoughts and feelings go unexpressed. I mean, if he didn‰Ûªt want to go shopping with me, why didn‰Ûªt he just say so?",9
48017,Beverly,23, Maybe he couldn‰Ûªt get a word in edgewise.,9
48018,Amy,23," I‰Ûªm sorry, I‰Ûªve been going on and on.",9
48019,Beverly,23," Oh, it‰Ûªs all right, dear. Sheldon has a brilliant and complicated mind. It‰Ûªs understandable that being in a relationship with him could be trying.",9
48020,Amy,23, I called him babe once. He asked me to get a drug test.,9
48021,Beverly,23," Well, I do admire your resolve. You‰Ûªre an extraordinary woman.",9
48022,Amy,23, Thank you.,9
48023,Penny,23," You know, she‰Ûªs my mother-in-law. Why can‰Ûªt I bond with her like that?",9
48024,Bernadette,23," Amy‰Ûªs with Sheldon who she loves like a son. You‰Ûªre with her son, who she doesn‰Ûªt.",9
48025,Amy,23, Do you realize it took me five years to get a massage from him?,9
48026,Beverly,23," Oh, well, that still could be a big step for Sheldon.",9
48027,Amy,23, Three minutes. And he used a kitchen timer. I felt like a soft-boiled egg.,9
48028,Penny,23," You know, being in a relationship with Leonard also comes with its challenges.",9
48029,Beverly,23," Yes. Well, what can you do?",9
48030,Amy (knock on door),23," Maybe it‰Ûªs Sheldon, here to say he‰Ûªs sorry.",9
48031,Stuart,23, Sheldon says he‰Ûªs sorry.,9
48032,Amy,23," Bernadette, I‰Ûªll give you five dollars to slam the door.",9
48033,Stuart,23, I would have done it for three.,9
48034,Scene,23, The cinema line.,9
48035,Raj,23," Boy, all this standing‰Ûªs making me tired. Good thing I brought my collapsible stick chair.",9
48036,Howard,23, Not the stick chair. You look like an idiot on that thing.,9
48037,Raj,23," Sticks and stones may break my bones, but chairs on sticks are comfy.",9
48038,Stuart,23, Hey.,9
48039,Sheldon,23, Hey. Is everything smoothed out with Amy?,9
48040,Stuart,23," Uh, no, she‰Ûªs still pretty mad.",9
48041,Sheldon,23, Did you make the apology as sincere as I would have?,9
48042,Stuart,23," I said, Sheldon says he‰Ûªs sorry.",9
48043,Sheldon,23," Oh, well, that‰Ûªs laying it on a little thick.",9
48044,Leonard,23, You think it‰Ûªs time you apologize to her yourself?,9
48045,Sheldon,23," I suppose so. But if I get out of the line, I‰Ûªll lose my spot.",9
48046,Stuart,23, I‰Ûªm happy to hold your place till you get back.,9
48047,Sheldon,23, You would do that?,9
48048,Stuart,23, Consider it my way of getting more of your money.,9
48049,Sheldon,23, You‰Ûªre a good man.,9
48050,Scene,23, Penny‰Ûªs apartment.,9
48051,Bernadette,23," So, Beverly, did you know Penny is the number three sales rep at our pharmaceutical company?",9
48052,Beverly,23," Oh, I didn‰Ûªt realize you two work together.",9
48053,Bernadette,23," Well, we don‰Ûªt exactly. I‰Ûªm a microbiologist for the research team.",9
48054,Beverly,23," Oh, what are you currently developing?",9
48055,Bernadette,23, Some exciting new anti-anxiety drugs.,9
48056,Beverly,23, That‰Ûªs interesting. I just attended a lecture on pediatric anxiety.,9
48057,Amy,23," Oh, was it, uh, Dr. Jenofski? I just saw his TED Talk.",9
48058,Beverly,23, It was.,9
48059,Bernadette,23," Well, let‰Ûªs get back to Penny. Hey, weren‰Ûªt you telling me something great about your company car?",9
48060,Penny,23," Um, it has seat warmers.",9
48061,Sheldon,23," (Knock, knock, knock) Amy. (Knock, knock, knock) Amy. (Knock, knock, knock) Amy.",9
48062,Amy,23, Come in.,9
48063,Sheldon,23," Hello, everyone. Oh, Beverly, good to see you. I‰Ûªd love to chat, but there‰Ûªs a line that could start moving any minute, so let‰Ûªs do this. Amy? A proper apology requires three steps. Step one, an admission of wrongdoing. Amy, I was wrong. Step two, a promise never to repeat said action. Amy, that action will never be repeated, and that‰Ûªs a promise. Step three, an earnest request for forgiveness. Amy, I hope you can forgive me. And I hope you do it right now, ‰Ûªcause there‰Ûªs an Uber waiting downstairs, and I don‰Ûªt want to repeat this apology nonsense with my driver Ganesh.",9
48064,Amy,23, Fine.,9
48065,Sheldon,23," Oh, thanks, you‰Ûªre a peach. Beverly, we‰Ûªll catch up soon. Bernadette, it was a pleasure as always, Penny, you have spinach in your teeth.",9
48066,Penny,23, How long have I had spinach in my teeth?,9
48067,Beverly,23," Since the airport, dear.",9
48068,Scene,23, The cinema line.,9
48069,Howard,23, You look like you come with a kickstand.,9
48070,Raj,23, You can‰Ûªt make me feel bad.,9
48071,Howard,23," Hmm, maybe not. Leonard?",9
48072,Leonard,23," So, when the aliens brought you back, they just left the probe in?",9
48073,Sheldon,23, I‰Ûªm back.,9
48074,Leonard,23," Hey, how‰Ûªd it go?",9
48075,Sheldon,23," It went well. Yeah, I‰Ûªve learned that if you never say you‰Ûªre sorry, the times you do really puts them on their heels. Uh, Stuart, I relieve you of your line duties.",9
48076,Stuart,23, Anyone else need anything before I go?,9
48077,Howard,23, I‰Ûªll give you a dollar if you make fun of Raj.,9
48078,Stuart,23, That‰Ûªs mean.,9
48079,Howard,23, Five.,9
48080,Stuart,23, You look like Tigger if Tigger looked like a jackass.,9
48081,Howard,23," Uh, if you ever need a reference or anything, just let me know.",9
48082,Man,23," Hey, guys.",9
48083,Woman,23, You made it.,9
48084,Sheldon,23, Did you see that? He just cut the line.,9
48085,Leonard,23, He‰Ûªs just joining his friends; it‰Ûªs fine.,9
48086,Sheldon,23," No, it‰Ûªs not fine. It is a breach of line etiquette.",9
48087,Howard,23, We‰Ûªre near the front of the line. We‰Ûªll get in either way.,9
48088,Sheldon,23, What if every person in front of us let someone cut?,9
48089,Leonard,23, We‰Ûªd still get in.,9
48090,Sheldon,23, What if each of those people let someone cut?,9
48091,Leonard,23, Still get in.,9
48092,Sheldon,23, But then each of those people let someone cut?,9
48093,Leonard,23," We‰Ûªd still get in, but first I‰Ûªd hit you over the head with his stick chair.",9
48094,Sheldon,23, Excuse me.,9
48095,Leonard,23," Oh, please don‰Ûªt.",9
48096,Sheldon,23," Uh, uh, I couldn‰Ûªt help but notice that you cut the line.",9
48097,Man,23," Oh, uh, I‰Ûªm with my friends. It‰Ûªs cool.",9
48098,Sheldon,23," Well, no. It‰Ûªs not cool. If there were reserved seating, and we all had tickets, that would be fine. But this line is first-come, first-served. Not show up tardy and nevertheless be first served. Right here.",9
48099,Leonard,23, No.,9
48100,Sheldon,23, You need to go to the back of the line.,9
48101,Man,23," Uh, who made you line monitor?",9
48102,Sheldon,23, Mrs. Wunch in fourth grade. And my slogan was a line that‰Ûªs straight is a line that‰Ûªs great.,9
48103,Man,23, Is this guy for real?,9
48104,Leonard,23," Boy, I wish I could say no.",9
48105,Scene,23, Penny‰Ûªs apartment.,9
48106,Beverly,23, That was very nice of Sheldon to apologize.,9
48107,Amy,23," Well, he‰Ûªs come a long way. Or a short way very slowly, so it feels like a long way.",9
48108,Beverly,23," Your relationship with him is fascinating. I‰Ûªm preparing to write a book on high-achieving couples, and I would love to interview the both of you.",9
48109,Amy,23," Oh, sure. I‰Ûªll, I‰Ûªll talk to Sheldon about it. You know, Bernadette‰Ûªs husband is a former astronaut.",9
48110,Beverly,23, Really? Do you think he would be interested in being interviewed as well?,9
48111,Bernadette,23, Do I think he‰Ûªd be interested? Sometimes I hear him pretending to be interviewed when he‰Ûªs alone in the bathroom.,9
48112,Beverly,23, Wonderful. I‰Ûªll give you my contact information.,9
48113,Bernadette,23," Um, you should probably talk to Penny, too.",9
48114,Beverly,23, About what?,9
48115,Penny,23," Okay, you know what? This is ridiculous. I‰Ûªve been trying to make a connection with you all day, and clearly I‰Ûªm getting nowhere.",9
48116,Beverly,23," Well, are you seeking a connection or just some form of validation?",9
48117,Penny,23," What I was seeking was some sort of friendship. But at this point, I‰Ûªll take you not insulting me to my face.",9
48118,Beverly,23, My intention was never to insult you.,9
48119,Penny,23, You‰Ûªve been doing it all day. Do you even know what an insult is?,9
48120,Beverly,23," Well, it‰Ûªs not a clinical term. But one example would be your marrying my son, and not inviting me or even telling me the wedding was taking place.",9
48121,Penny,23," Okay, good example.",9
48122,Scene,23, The cinema line.,9
48123,Sheldon,23, What about Joss Whedon‰Ûªs work makes you think he‰Ûªd be okay with rule-breakers and line-cutters?,9
48124,Man,23, The Avengers are rule-breakers. Being vengeful is in their job description.,9
48125,Sheldon,23," They work for SHIELD, which is a sanctioned department of the U.S. Government. Do you work for a sanctioned department of the U.S. Government?",9
48126,Man,23, As a matter of fact I do. At a little place called the DMV.,9
48127,Raj,23, He‰Ûªs got him there. The D even stands for department.,9
48128,Sheldon,23," Excuse me, excuse me, can I please see a show of hands? Who here takes issue with this person cutting the line?",9
48129,Man,23, Told you.,9
48130,Sheldon,23," Well, what a sad state of affairs. That you‰Ûªve all been so ground down by life, you don‰Ûªt even notice when someone disrespects you.",9
48131,Howard,23," I can‰Ûªt believe we‰Ûªre gonna get beat up, and it‰Ûªs not because of your chair.",9
48132,Sheldon,23," You know, right now, at the back of this line, there‰Ûªs a movie fan like you who‰Ûªs not going to get in, because this person simply doesn‰Ûªt care. Yeah, well, 61 years ago, there was another person at the back of the line and her name was Rosa Parks.",9
48133,Leonard,23," Okay, you may have to pretend you‰Ûªre black to get us out of here.",9
48134,Sheldon,23," Now, let‰Ûªs follow in that brave woman‰Ûªs footsteps, and stand up for ourselves. And, and I realize that she stood up by remaining seated, but now is not the time to enjoy the irony of that. Now, I ask you again. Who here takes issue with this person‰Û_",9
48135,Woman,23, Why should we listen to you? You cut the line yourself.,9
48136,Sheldon,23, I most certainly did not.,9
48137,Woman,23, I saw you.,9
48138,Man,23," If you‰Ûªre feeling dizzy, it‰Ûªs because the tables have turned.",9
48139,Sheldon,23," Excuse me, I paid someone to wait in line for me, and then when I arrived, he left, so what you saw, my good woman, was swapsies, not cutsies. Oh, no, no, no, no, wait, I ask you all again, a show of hands. Who here takes issue‰Û_ well, stop moving. he‰Ûªs gonna get in.",9
48140,Leonard,23," Buddy, let it go.",9
48141,Sheldon,23," No, I can‰Ûªt. This isn‰Ûªt right.",9
48142,Leonard,23, You did everything you could.,9
48143,Sheldon,23," No, I could‰Ûªve done more.",9
48144,Leonard,23," Now, now, you denigrated the memory of a great civil rights pioneer. That‰Ûªs all anyone could ask.",9
48145,Scene,23, Penny‰Ûªs apartment.,9
48146,Penny,23," To be honest, I‰Ûªm surprised you cared about the wedding at all.",9
48147,Beverly,23," I‰Ûªm still human, Penny. Not getting invited to my own son‰Ûªs wedding is difficult to ignore.",9
48148,Amy,23, I know how you feel. She didn‰Ûªt invite any of us.,9
48149,Penny,23, It was spur of the moment.,9
48150,Bernadette,23, But we did get to see a live stream of it on the Internet.,9
48151,Beverly,23, I could‰Ûªve watched it on the Internet?,9
48152,Penny,23," Thank you. So if we would have asked you to come to Vegas to see us get married, you would‰Ûªve come?",9
48153,Beverly,23," No, I would‰Ûªve said you‰Ûªre making a huge mistake. But an invitation would‰Ûªve been nice.",9
48154,Penny,23, You really think we made a mistake?,9
48155,Beverly,23," At the time I did. But I‰Ûªve never seen Leonard so happy, so perhaps I was wrong.",9
48156,Penny,23," Wow. Okay. Well, um, how about this? Maybe while you‰Ûªre still in town, Leonard and I could have another small ceremony. You know, if you‰Ûªre interested.",9
48157,Beverly,23, I would find that perfectly acceptable.,9
48158,Penny,23, She would find it perfectly acceptable. You guys saw it. We bonded.,9
48159,Scene,23, Howard and Bernadette‰Ûªs bedroom.,9
48160,Bernadette,23, Howie? You doing okay? You‰Ûªve been in there a while.,9
48161,Howard (through bathroom door),23," I‰Ûªm fine. Be right out. Am I an American hero? Well, that‰Ûªs a good question, Jim. Don‰Ûªt you think once an astronaut leaves the planet, he‰Ûªs a hero to all the nations of the Earth? Okey dokey. I think I have time for one more question.",9
48162,Scene,24, Leonard and Penny‰Ûªs bedroom.,9
48163,Leonard,24, Hey.,9
48164,Penny,24," Hi, how was the screening?",9
48165,Leonard,24," Oh, Sheldon invoked Rosa Parks to make somebody who cut the line feel bad, but only the white people felt bad.",9
48166,Penny,24," Ugh, I should‰Ûªve never bought him that colouring book that explains Black History Month.",9
48167,Leonard,24, How‰Ûªd it go with my mother?,9
48168,Penny,24," Uh, you know, it started a little rocky, but I think we got to a good place.",9
48169,Leonard,24, Wow. Well done.,9
48170,Penny,24," Yeah, and when I dropped her off at the hotel, she even gave me a hug.",9
48171,Leonard,24," Did she think you were choking or‰Û_ I‰Ûªm sorry, that‰Ûªs great. Thank you for spending time with her.",9
48172,Penny,24," No problem. Um, so listen, I don‰Ûªt know if you have any plans next weekend, but I kind of promised your mom we‰Ûªd have another wedding ceremony so she could attend this time.",9
48173,Leonard,24," Wait, we‰Ûªre gonna get married again?",9
48174,Penny,24," Yeah, kind of, but now we can invite our friends and family.",9
48175,Leonard,24, Seems like a lot of trouble for a hug.,9
48176,Penny,24," Come on, it‰Ûªll be fun, and, you know, your mom was genuinely hurt we didn‰Ûªt invite her to the first one.",9
48177,Leonard,24," Look, in our defence, it was kind of a spur of the moment thing, and also, we don‰Ûªt like her.",9
48178,Penny,24," Leonard, come on, she‰Ûªs your mom. If we can do something to make her happy, why wouldn‰Ûªt we?",9
48179,Leonard,24," I just said why, we don‰Ûªt like her.",9
48180,Penny,24," Hey, look, then forget about her, let‰Ûªs do it for us. We could keep it small and informal. This time we can invite our families.",9
48181,Leonard,24, Is your brother out of prison?,9
48182,Penny,24," Thanks to overcrowding, yeah.",9
48183,Leonard,24, I‰Ûªd love it if my dad could come.,9
48184,Penny,24," Oh, you have to invite him. I haven‰Ûªt seen him since the divorce.",9
48185,Leonard,24," Oh, he‰Ûªs like a different man. He stopped twitching, and I think he grew an inch and a half.",9
48186,Penny,24," Well, then it‰Ûªs settled. Yay. So funny. I never thought my second marriage would be to you.",9
48187,Scene,24, The apartment.,9
48188,Penny,24," Okay, so it‰Ûªs not a legal ceremony, it‰Ûªs just a chance for us to redo our vows so everyone can be part of it.",9
48189,Amy,24, So there‰Ûªs no maid of honour?,9
48190,Penny,24, No.,9
48191,Amy,24," Huh. But if I were to, say, wear a purple satin dress with a sweetheart neckline and stand near you, you wouldn‰Ûªt be able to stop me, right?",9
48192,Penny,24, I don‰Ûªt see how I could.,9
48193,Amy,24, Then I graciously accept.,9
48194,Bernadette,24, Who‰Ûªs going to officiate?,9
48195,Penny,24, I was kind of hoping you would.,9
48196,Amy,24," Wait, now I‰Ûªm just some lousy maid of honour?",9
48197,Sheldon,24," Hey, good news, I just got off the phone with my mother. She is coming to the wedding.",9
48198,Penny,24," Okay, wait, you‰Ûªre inviting people to our wedding?",9
48199,Sheldon,24," Yes, I‰Ûªm inviting people to our wedding. Yeah, I‰Ûªve already asked Stephen Hawking and Robert Downey Jr, and, now don‰Ûªt get your hopes up, ‰Ûªcause he‰Ûªs pretty busy, but Erno Rubik.",9
48200,Bernadette,24, Who‰Ûªs Erno Rubik?,9
48201,Sheldon,24, Seriously? He invented the Rubik‰Ûªs Cube.,9
48202,Penny,24," Okay, fine, but why would you invite him to our wedding?",9
48203,Sheldon,24," Because, despite his fame and fortune, he strikes me as a lonely man.",9
48204,Bernadette,24," Well, it‰Ûªs very sweet of you to go to all this trouble for Leonard‰Ûªs mother.",9
48205,Penny,24," Yeah, I‰Ûªm also doing it for Leonard. I think this could really help their relationship.",9
48206,Scene,24, Leonard‰Ûªs car.,9
48207,Beverly,24, How dare you invite your father without consulting me.,9
48208,Leonard,24," Sorry, but I don‰Ûªt think I need your permission to have my father at my wedding.",9
48209,Beverly,24, You do understand our marriage ended because he had an affair.,9
48210,Leonard,24," I know, and there‰Ûªs no excuse for that.",9
48211,Beverly,24," He claimed I was cold, emasculating, and hadn‰Ûªt shown him any physical affection for years.",9
48212,Leonard,24," I was wrong, there‰Ûªs three excuses for that.",9
48213,Scene,24, Howard‰Ûªs workshop.,9
48214,Howard,24," Oh, my God. It‰Ûªs working.",9
48215,Raj,24, You sure?,9
48216,Howard,24," Look. The system is maintaining its own stability, the quantum vortex apparatus is now controlling the orientation.",9
48217,Raj,24, You‰Ûªre right. You realize what this means?,9
48218,Howard,24, Yeah. I do. It‰Ûªs proof of concept. We‰Ûªve got a workable guidance system.,9
48219,Raj,24, Congratulations.,9
48220,Howard,24," Thanks. Hey, I just got an e-mail from the U.S. Air Force.",9
48221,Raj,24, Open it.,9
48222,Howard,24," Hmm. We request a meeting at your earliest convenience regarding your quantum guidance system, provisional patent 62/295118. That‰Ûªs weird.",9
48223,Raj,24, Is there a window around here we don‰Ûªt know about?,9
48224,Howard,24, I‰Ûªm sure it‰Ûªs just a coincidence.,9
48225,Raj,24," Yeah, of course. What else could it be? Boy, do I love America.",9
48226,Scene,24, Amy‰Ûªs car.,9
48227,Mary Cooper,24, Thank you for picking me up.,9
48228,Sheldon,24," Oh, you‰Ûªre welcome.",9
48229,Mary,24, I was speaking to your young lady.,9
48230,Amy,24," My pleasure, Mrs. Cooper.",9
48231,Mary,24," Oh, please call me Mary.",9
48232,Amy,24," Okay, Mary.",9
48233,Sheldon,24," You know, that doesn‰Ûªt work for me, let‰Ûªs stay with Mrs. Cooper.",9
48234,Mary,24," Sheldon, don‰Ûªt be silly.",9
48235,Sheldon,24," Wu-wu, what? That‰Ûªs what I called you till I got to know you better.",9
48236,Mary,24, It was so nice of Leonard and Penny to invite me.,9
48237,Sheldon,24," Well, actually, I‰Û_",9
48238,Amy,24, It sure was.,9
48239,Mary,24, I‰Ûªve always had a special place in my heart for Leonard. Taking care of my baby all these years.,9
48240,Sheldon,24," Excuse me, I take care of him.",9
48241,Mary,24, Sure you do. So who else is coming to this shindig?,9
48242,Amy,24," Oh, well, the usual gang. Penny‰Ûªs family is coming tomorrow.",9
48243,Sheldon,24," Yeah, and Leonard‰Ûªs mother‰Ûªs already here.",9
48244,Mary,24," Oh, Beverly. How nice.",9
48245,Amy,24," You‰Ûªve met her, right?",9
48246,Mary,24," Yes, I have.",9
48247,Sheldon,24," Mother, she‰Ûªs an atheist, not a vampire.",9
48248,Mary,24," Either way, let‰Ûªs stop and get some garlic.",9
48249,Scene,24, The apartment.,9
48250,Beverly,24," So, Mary, how have you been?",9
48251,Mary,24," Well, thank you so much for asking. I‰Ûªve been well, and you?",9
48252,Beverly,24, Very good.,9
48253,Mary,24, Good.,9
48254,Sheldon,24," I don‰Ûªt know what we were worried about, they‰Ûªre getting along great.",9
48255,Mary,24, Sheldon tells me your husband‰Ûªs coming.,9
48256,Beverly,24, My ex-husband.,9
48257,Mary,24," Oh, I‰Ûªm so sorry.",9
48258,Beverly,24, Don‰Ûªt be.,9
48259,Mary,24, All right.,9
48260,Penny,24," Whew, chilly.",9
48261,Amy,24, I think I can see my breath.,9
48262,Beverly,24, We can hear you.,9
48263,Penny,24, Sorry.,9
48264,Amy,24, Sorry.,9
48265,Scene,24, Howard and Bernadette‰Ûªs kitchen.,9
48266,Howard,24, I can‰Ûªt believe I was so naive. The military is just gonna take over the whole project. And you know what happens if we object? We disappear. Like off the map. Like every American Idol winner since season four.,9
48267,Bernadette,24," Come on, Howard, you‰Ûªre overreacting.",9
48268,Howard,24," Am I? Am I? What, what do you want to bet some black ops guy is reprinting my high school yearbook and I‰Ûªm no longer in it? That chess club picture is now just David Zimmerman and Elaine Cho.",9
48269,Raj,24," Okay, look, I‰Ûªm on the Air Force Web site, and the department that e-mailed you is in charge of acquisitions. So maybe they just want to give you a lot of money for your invention.",9
48270,Howard,24," Oh, please, that‰Ûªs not how it works. You saw E.T., Avatar, Jurassic World. The military just shows up and takes over.",9
48271,Bernadette,24," You do realize those weren‰Ûªt documentaries, right?",9
48272,Howard,24," I‰Ûªm sorry, you find this funny?",9
48273,Raj,24," No, I was just thinking about Jurassic World. Boy, that was terrible.",9
48274,Scene,24, The foyer.,9
48275,Leonard,24," Oh, we have to use the stairs.",9
48276,Alfred Hofstadter,24, When are they gonna fix your elevator?,9
48277,Leonard,24," Uh, I don‰Ûªt, any day now.",9
48278,Alfred,24," Well, the stairs are fine. Besides, your mother is up there. Maybe I‰Ûªll have a heart attack and not have to see her.",9
48279,Leonard,24," Hey, I, I know things are a little rough with you and Mom, but I‰Ûªm really glad you‰Ûªre here.",9
48280,Alfred,24," Me, too. I should have never had that angioplasty because I feel fine.",9
48281,Leonard,24, Penny‰Ûªs really looking forward to seeing you.,9
48282,Alfred,24," Ah, she‰Ûªs a sweetie. You got a good one there, Leonard.",9
48283,Leonard,24," Thanks, Dad.",9
48284,Alfred,24, How the hell did you do that?,9
48285,Scene,24, The apartment.,9
48286,Sheldon,24, Isn‰Ûªt this nice?,9
48287,Leonard,24," Hey, we‰Ûªre here.",9
48288,Penny,24, Alfred. Thank you for coming!,9
48289,Alfred,24," Oh. Well, happy to be here. And congratulations.",9
48290,Penny,24, Thank you.,9
48291,Leonard,24," Dad, you remember Sheldon.",9
48292,Sheldon,24, Dr. Hofstadter.,9
48293,Alfred,24, Dr. Cooper.,9
48294,Leonard,24," This is Sheldon‰Ûªs mother, Mary.",9
48295,Alfred,24, How do you do?,9
48296,Mary,24, Nice to meet you.,9
48297,Leonard,24," And his girlfriend, Amy.",9
48298,Alfred,24, A pleasure.,9
48299,Amy,24, Hi.,9
48300,Leonard,24," And, of course, Mom.",9
48301,Alfred,24," Hello, my hateful shrew.",9
48302,Beverly,24," Hello to you, you wrinkled old bastard.",9
48303,Sheldon,24," All right, now I‰Ûªm starting to sense a little tension.",9
48304,Leonard,24," All right, you two, don‰Ûªt start. Penny and I are throwing this second wedding for your benefit. Can you please not ruin it?",9
48305,Alfred,24, Of course. I‰Ûªm sorry.,9
48306,Beverly,24," Oh, look at that, you can apologize.",9
48307,Leonard,24, Mom.,9
48308,Beverly,24, I‰Ûªm sorry.,9
48309,Mary,24," You know, the Bible says forgiveness‰Û_",9
48310,Sheldon,24, Mom.,9
48311,Mary,24, I‰Ûªm sorry.,9
48312,Penny,24," Uh, who‰Ûªs hungry? We have a reservation at the best restaurant in town.",9
48313,Sheldon,24, It only got three-and-a-half stars on Yelp.,9
48314,Amy,24, Sheldon.,9
48315,Sheldon,24, I‰Ûªm not sorry. That‰Ûªs true.,9
48316,Scene,24, Howard and Bernadette‰Ûªs kitchen.,9
48317,Howard,24," I don‰Ûªt know what to do. It‰Ûªs the Air Force. I mean, should I respond to their e-mail? Ignore it?",9
48318,Raj,24, You can‰Ûªt ignore it. It‰Ûªs not that postcard that says it‰Ûªs time to go back to the dentist.,9
48319,Bernadette,24," Guys, come on. We‰Ûªre meeting everyone for dinner.",9
48320,Howard,24," One sec. I‰Ûªm just afraid if I respond, then they‰Ûªll know I got it.",9
48321,Raj,24," Oh, dude. The minute you opened that e-mail, they knew you got it. I mean, they‰Ûªre probably looking at you through the camera right now. I love America.",9
48322,Bernadette,24, Are you done with this nonsense?,9
48323,Howard,24, It‰Ûªs not nonsense. This is how the U.S. military works.,9
48324,Raj,24," Oh, if it‰Ûªs even the U.S. Military. It could be foreign military pretending to be American.",9
48325,Howard,24," You‰Ûªre right. We turn our guidance system over to them, next thing we know, they‰Ûªre using it against us.",9
48326,Raj,24, I also love the enemies of America.,9
48327,Scene,24, Leonard‰Ûªs car.,9
48328,Beverly,24," Penny, I hope the example of my failed marriage to Leonard‰Ûªs father doesn‰Ûªt discourage you from the commitment you‰Ûªve made to one another.",9
48329,Penny,24," No, of course not.",9
48330,Beverly,24, Although Alfred and I had a lot more going for us than you two.,9
48331,Leonard,24," Mom, please save something for the toast.",9
48332,Scene,24, Amy‰Ûªs car.,9
48333,Mary,24," So, Alfred, what is it that you do for a living?",9
48334,Alfred,24," Oh, I‰Ûªm an anthropologist. I study ancient peoples and cultures.",9
48335,Mary,24," My goodness, so all the way back to the Flood.",9
48336,Sheldon,24," Don‰Ûªt laugh, she wasn‰Ûªt joking.",9
48337,Amy,24, Play with your phone.,9
48338,Alfred,24," Well, on that note, there are many cultures that have an apocalyptic flood as part of their mythology.",9
48339,Mary,24, I don‰Ûªt have a mythology. I have the unerring Word of God. But that‰Ûªs very interesting.,9
48340,Alfred,24," Oh. I, I didn‰Ûªt mean to disparage your faith. Actually, I admire it.",9
48341,Mary,24, Really?,9
48342,Alfred,24," Yes. Yes, I‰Ûªm an agnostic myself, but I have prayed, many times, to God, to turn my wife into a pillar of salt.",9
48343,Mary,24," Well, He came close. Turned her into a giant block of ice.",9
48344,Scene,24, Howard‰Ûªs car.,9
48345,Raj,24," Howard, there must be someone at the university you can go to for help.",9
48346,Howard,24, Are you kidding? They‰Ûªre probably the ones who leaked it to the military in the first place.,9
48347,Raj,24," What about the guy on the Channel Four News? You know, Four on Your Side? Maybe he can be on your side.",9
48348,Howard,24," I‰Ûªm being harassed by the government, not trying to get to the bottom of a dog-walking scam.",9
48349,Bernadette,24," Oh, stop. You know what‰Ûªs really happening? All the movies you‰Ûªve watched, the TV shows, the comic books, they‰Ûªve completely twisted your thinking. No one‰Ûªs after you, no one‰Ûªs listening to you, no one cares about you.",9
48350,Raj,24, I‰Ûªd like to think the Four on Your Side guy cares about me.,9
48351,Scene,24, Leonard‰Ûªs car.,9
48352,Penny,24," You know, Beverly, I know you and Alfred have your differences, but if you think about it, if you hadn‰Ûªt married him, there‰Ûªd be no Leonard. So that‰Ûªs good, right?",9
48353,Beverly,24, Yeah.,9
48354,Leonard,24, Is that Howard in front of us?,9
48355,Penny,24," Oh, maybe. Get closer.",9
48356,Howard,24," Oh, God. I think someone‰Ûªs following us.",9
48357,Bernadette,24, You‰Ûªre being ridiculous.,9
48358,Howard,24," I‰Ûªm not being ridiculous, he‰Ûªs right on my tail.",9
48359,Raj,24," Uh, turn left here and see if he turns with us.",9
48360,Penny,24," Well, why is he turning here? The restaurant‰Ûªs the other way.",9
48361,Leonard,24, I don‰Ûªt know. He uses that traffic app. Maybe there‰Ûªs an accident.,9
48362,Penny,24," Oh, so follow him.",9
48363,Raj,24," Oh, no.",9
48364,Howard,24, I told you.,9
48365,Bernadette,24," It‰Ûªs probably just a coincidence. Speed up a little, see if he stays with you.",9
48366,Penny,24," Well, go faster. You‰Ûªre losing him.",9
48367,Leonard,24, What is his hurry?,9
48368,Penny,24," You know what, flash your lights. Let him know it‰Ûªs you.",9
48369,Howard,24, He‰Ûªs flashing his lights. What‰Ûªs that mean?,9
48370,Raj,24," I, I think he wants us to pull over.",9
48371,Bernadette,24, Do not pull over. I‰Ûªm not raising this baby alone.,9
48372,Howard,24, Hang on.,9
48373,Scene,24, The restaurant.,9
48374,Alfred,24," So, after your husband passed, you never remarried?",9
48375,Mary,24," No, just focused on work and the church.",9
48376,Alfred,24, Ah. And what do you do?,9
48377,Mary,24, I work at the church.,9
48378,Alfred,24," Well, they‰Ûªre lucky to have you.",9
48379,Mary,24," Well, thank you.",9
48380,Alfred,24, You‰Ûªre welcome.,9
48381,Amy,24, Do you realize what‰Ûªs happening here?,9
48382,Sheldon,24," Yeah, I do. They‰Ûªre filling up on bread and ruining their meal.",9
48383,Leonard,24, Hey.,9
48384,Penny,24, Hey.,9
48385,Amy,24, What took you guys so long?,9
48386,Leonard,24," Oh, we were following Howard, but for some reason, he turned off his headlights and went up a one-way street.",9
48387,Penny,24," So, what did we miss?",9
48388,Alfred,24," Oh, just Mary and I getting to know each other a little.",9
48389,Mary,24," Leonard, your father is just charming.",9
48390,Beverly,24, He‰Ûªs also broke. Did he mention that?,9
48391,Leonard,24," Okay, Mom, you sit over there.",9
48392,Penny,24," Yeah, I‰Ûªm gonna call Bernadette and see what‰Ûªs keeping them.",9
48393,Sheldon,24," If I‰Ûªd known you were broke, I wouldn‰Ûªt have made a big deal about the bread.",9
48394,Scene,24, Howard‰Ûªs car.,9
48395,Bernadette (on phone),24," Hey, Penny. What are you talking about? Oh, that was you? Long story. Why don‰Ûªt you go ahead and eat. We‰Ûªre gonna be a while.",9
48396,Howard,24," I‰Ûªm telling you, I‰Ûªm not on drugs. The government‰Ûªs out to get me.",9
48397,Scene,24, The restaurant.,9
48398,Alfred,24," Now, one of the more exciting things to be found recently is that Neanderthals and Homo Sapiens frequently mated with each other.",9
48399,Mary,24," Well, that certainly explains my marriage to Sheldon‰Ûªs father.",9
48400,Sheldon,24," That‰Ûªs funny, because my father was not a very clever man.",9
48401,Amy,24, I‰Ûªd be lost without you.,9
48402,Leonard,24," Uh, I would like to propose a toast to my wife and bride-to-be.",9
48403,Sheldon,24," See, that‰Ûªs funny because‰Û_",9
48404,Amy,24, Back to your phone.,9
48405,Leonard,24," Penny, I‰Ûªve always known I loved you, but this last year has shown me that I also love being married to you. Thank you for saying yes.",9
48406,Penny,24," Oh, thanks for asking until I did.",9
48407,Amy,24," Hear, hear.",9
48408,Leonard,24, Cheers.,9
48409,Alfred,24," I, uh, I would also like to make a toast.",9
48410,Penny,24, Aw.,9
48411,Alfred,24," Leonard, I am so happy that you have found a woman who loves and cares for you.",9
48412,Beverly,24, What the hell is that supposed to mean?,9
48413,Alfred,24, Why don‰Ûªt you take a pill?,9
48414,Beverly,24, Like you did before sex?,9
48415,Alfred,24, What I really needed was a blindfold.,9
48416,Beverly,24," Oh, dear woman, can you please read another book?",9
48417,Mary,24," When God writes one, I will.",9
48418,Penny,24," Um, if, if we want to order the soufflÌ©, we might want to get on that.",9
48419,Alfred,24," Leonard, if you don‰Ûªt mind, I, I think I‰Ûªm a little tired. I‰Ûªm gonna call it a night.",9
48420,Leonard,24," Sure, Dad.",9
48421,Mary,24," I‰Ûªm a little tuckered out myself, so I will see you all in the morning.",9
48422,Alfred,24, Would you like to share a cab?,9
48423,Mary,24, That would be fine.,9
48424,Alfred,24, Where are you staying?,9
48425,Mary,24, I‰Ûªm at the Westin.,9
48426,Alfred,24," Oh, so am I. Can I interest you in a nightcap?",9
48427,Mary,24, I think that you could.,9
48428,Leonard,24, What is happening there?,9
48429,Sheldon,24, I think it‰Ûªs pretty obvious. They don‰Ûªt want dessert ‰Ûªcause they filled up on bread.,9
48430,Scene,24, The apartment.,9
48431,Sheldon,24, She‰Ûªs still not answering.,9
48432,Leonard,24, My father‰Ûªs not texting me back.,9
48433,Penny,24, ‰Û÷Cause they both turned their phones off.,9
48434,Sheldon,24, I don‰Ûªt like this at all.,9
48435,Leonard,24, I don‰Ûªt like it either.,9
48436,Penny,24, Really? ‰Û÷Cause I love it.,9
48437,Sceme,1, Leonard and Penny‰Ûªs bedroom.,10
48438,Sheldon,1, Leonard? Leonard?,10
48439,Leonard,1, What?,10
48440,Sheldon,1, You realize you and I could become brothers.,10
48441,Leonard,1, We‰Ûªre not gonna be brothers. We‰Ûªre not gonna be stepbrothers. Go to sleep.,10
48442,Sheldon,1, I hope you‰Ûªre right. ‰Û÷Cause a grown man living with his brother and his brother‰Ûªs wife is weird.,10
48443,Leonard,1, Go to sleep.,10
48444,Sheldon,1, Okay. Do you think your father‰Ûªs doing unspeakable things to my mother?,10
48445,Leonard,1, No.,10
48446,Sheldon,1, Are you saying that because the things are unspeakable?,10
48447,Sheldon,1, Very well.,10
48448,Leonard,1, I‰Ûªm sorry if this stuff is gonna make the ceremony awkward.,10
48449,Penny,1," God, I thought my brother fresh out of jail was gonna make everyone uncomfortable, but now this.",10
48450,Sheldon,1," Hey, if you want me to sleep you‰Ûªre gonna have to stop talking.",10
48451,Scene,1, The apartment. ,10
48452,Penny,1," Okay, I‰Ûªm gonna go pick up my family. Like an hour and half, two hours, depending on traffic.",10
48453,Leonard,1," Yeah, drive safe. ",10
48454,Penny,1," Oh, hey, and do yourself a favour, all right? When Beverly gets here, do not bring up last night. All right? As far as you‰Ûªre concerned, you don‰Ûªt know anything, you didn‰Ûªt see anything. I want you just to play dumb.",10
48455,Sheldon,1, It was nice of her to show us playing dumb with an example.,10
48456,Penny,1," What? Oh. Hi. Okay, hey there, I got, I‰Ûªm sorry, I got to go now.",10
48457,Beverley,1," Penny, wait.",10
48458,Penny,1, Why?,10
48459,Beverley,1," I wanted to thank you for going through all the trouble of planning a second wedding ceremony for me, but unfortunately I cannot attend.",10
48460,Leonard,1," Well, why? What‰Ûªs wrong?",10
48461,Sheldon,1," Whuh, are we still doing the dumb thing? Okay, why, what‰Ûªs wrong?",10
48462,Beverley,1, I just cannot stay here while your father goes out of his way to humiliate me.,10
48463,Sheldon,1," Oh, golly, however did he humiliate you?",10
48464,Beverley,1," Stop it, Sheldon.",10
48465,Sheldon,1," Do I say stop what, or just throw in the towel?",10
48466,Beverley,1, I don‰Ûªt see why I should have to watch your father parade around with some bible-thumping bumpkin.,10
48467,Sheldon,1," Oh, excuse me, that is my mother you‰Ûªre talking about, however accurately.",10
48468,Penny,1," Okay, Beverley, aren‰Ûªt you overreacting a little? All we know is they shared a cab and had a nightcap. ",10
48469,Sheldon,1, And turned their phones off.,10
48470,Leonard,1," Not helping, buddy. Mother, Penny and I really want you to be part of this. Please stay.",10
48471,Penny,1," Yeah, plus if you leave, Alfred will know he got under your skin.",10
48472,Beverley,1," Well, we can‰Ûªt have that.",10
48473,Sheldon,1," You know, also, if they did have coitus, we‰Ûªll all be needing a skilled psychiatrist.",10
48474,Scene,1, Howard and Bernadette‰Ûªs kitchen.,10
48475,Raj,1, It is funny when you think about it.,10
48476,Howard,1, Maybe to you. You didn‰Ûªt get a $500 traffic ticket.,10
48477,Bernadette,1, Because you were driving like a lunatic.,10
48478,Howard,1," Hey, if thinking secret government agents are chasing you makes you a lunatic, then, yeah, okay.",10
48479,Raj (doorbell rings),1," Oh, I‰Ûªll get it.",10
48480,Bernadette,1, It didn‰Ûªt help that you couldn‰Ûªt walk a straight line when the cop pulled you over.,10
48481,Howard,1, I have performance anxiety. You of all people should know that.,10
48482,Raj,1, Hello.,10
48483,Air Force Officer,1, I‰Ûªm looking for Howard Wolowitz.,10
48484,Raj,1, Howard Wolowitz?,10
48485,Air Force Officer,1," I have the right address, don‰Ûªt I?",10
48486,Raj,1, Address?,10
48487,Air Force Officer,1, Is he here?,10
48488,Raj,1," Um, no. ",10
48489,Air Force Officer,1, Do you know where I can find him?,10
48490,Raj,1, May I ask what this is about?,10
48491,Air Force Officer,1," No, you may not.",10
48492,Raj,1, Very well.,10
48493,Air Force Officer,1, Have him call me.,10
48494,Raj,1, Okay.,10
48495,Howard (off),1," Raj, who‰Ûªs at the door?",10
48496,Raj,1, That‰Ûªs not him.,10
48497,Scene,1, Penny‰Ûªs car. ,10
48498,Penny,1," Oh, I can‰Ûªt wait for you to meet everyone. I told them all about you.",10
48499,Susan (Penny‰Ûªs mother),1, Like what? Do they know about your brother?,10
48500,Penny,1," Uh, not everything, just, like, the jail and drugs part.",10
48501,Susan,1, Why would you do that?,10
48502,Penny,1, What?,10
48503,Susan,1, The world doesn‰Ûªt need to know our problems.,10
48504,Penny,1," Well, Mom, I‰Ûªm sorry, but‰Û_",10
48505,Wyatt (Penny‰Ûªs father),1," Hey, look, they got Walgreens here, too.",10
48506,Susan,1," You really think it‰Ûªs helpful to change the subject, Wyatt?",10
48507,Wyatt,1," Just trying to make this a happy trip, dear.",10
48508,Susan,1," Well, quit it.",10
48509,Penny,1," So, uh, Randall, can‰Ûªt believe after all these years you finally get to visit me in California.",10
48510,Randall (Penny‰Ûªs brother),1," Well, good thing I was a non-violent offender, otherwise I couldn‰Ûªt have left the state.",10
48511,Susan,1," All right, that‰Ûªs enough jail talk.",10
48512,Randall,1," Penny knows where I was, she sent me cigarettes.",10
48513,Susan,1, You sent your brother cigarettes?,10
48514,Wyatt,1," He was cooking and selling crystal meth, Susan, I think we can let the cigarettes slide.",10
48515,Susan,1," Stop trying to be the cool dad, you have a shirt with our cat‰Ûªs picture on it.",10
48516,Wyatt,1," Anyway, we‰Ûªre here, slugger.",10
48517,Scene,1, Howard and Bernadette‰Ûªs kitchen.,10
48518,Howard,1," That‰Ûªs great, now they know where I live.",10
48519,Raj,1, What are you talking about? They‰Ûªve always known where you live.,10
48520,Bernadette,1," Yeah, if you want to go off the grid, you have to move out of your mother‰Ûªs house.",10
48521,Raj,1, Can we take a moment to discuss that I just lied to the government for you?,10
48522,Howard,1, Yeah. I would not have done that for you.,10
48523,Bernadette,1," Howard, please just call the man, see what he wants.",10
48524,Howard,1," All right, all right.",10
48525,Raj,1," Hey, make sure you tell him that you weren‰Ûªt home when he came by and that your Indian friend gave you the message the moment you stepped through the door.",10
48526,Howard,1," Yes, hello. Uh, this is Howard Wolowitz for Colonel Richard Williams.",10
48527,Raj,1," Oh, I take it back, don‰Ûªt mention me.",10
48528,Howard,1," Hi, Colonel Williams, how can I help you? What? Oh, uh, yes, he is from India. No, I don‰Ûªt know his immigration status. Relax, I‰Ûªm still on hold. Speaking. Okay, sure, I can meet with you on Thursday. Caltech is fine. Yeah, and may I ask what this is about? I may not?",10
48529,Raj,1, That‰Ûªs what he said to me.,10
48530,Scene,1, The apartment.,10
48531,Leonard,1," Here you are, Mother.",10
48532,Beverley,1, Thank you.,10
48533,Leonard,1, I‰Ûªm glad you decided to stay. It‰Ûªs gonna be special for Penny and me to share this with you.,10
48534,Beverley,1, I can‰Ûªt wait for this day to be over.,10
48535,Leonard,1," Yeah, special, like that. (Knock on door) That‰Ûªs them. Please don‰Ûªt make things any more awkward than they already are.",10
48536,Sheldon,1," All right, so less or equally awkward, got it.",10
48537,Leonard,1," Hey, guys, come on in.",10
48538,Alfred,1," Oh, thank you.",10
48539,Mary,1, Good morning.,10
48540,Beverley,1, Morning.,10
48541,Sheldon,1, Hello.,10
48542,Alfred,1, How is everyone today?,10
48543,Beverley,1," Good, and you?",10
48544,Alfred,1," Good, good.",10
48545,Beverley,1, Good.,10
48546,Mary,1," I‰Ûªm good, too.",10
48547,Beverley,1, Good.,10
48548,Sheldon,1," So, did you defile my mother or not?",10
48549,Mary,1, Sheldon. You‰Ûªre being rude.,10
48550,Alfred,1," If I may, I can assure you, your mother and I did nothing more than share a cab and a conversation.",10
48551,Sheldon,1, Did that conversation include the phrase your genitals are a joy to behold?,10
48552,Mary,1, That‰Ûªs enough.,10
48553,Alfred,1," Look, I promise you, neither I, nor anyone, has ever said that.",10
48554,Leonard,1, You don‰Ûªt know his girlfriend very well.,10
48555,Sheldon,1, Or what a joy it is to behold my genitals.,10
48556,Scene,1, Penny‰Ûªs apartment. ,10
48557,Penny,1," All right, you guys, uh, get settled in, then we‰Ûªll go across the hall and say hi to everyone.",10
48558,Randall,1," You know, It‰Ûªs hard to believe I‰Ûªve never met Leonard.",10
48559,Wyatt,1," Well, he probably buys his illegal drugs from a local vendor.",10
48560,Susan,1," Not funny, Wyatt.",10
48561,Penny,1, I thought it was really funny.,10
48562,Wyatt,1, Thanks.,10
48563,Susan,1," Well, fine, if everyone wants to make jokes about our problems, then I can, too. Knock, knock. Who‰Ûªs there? Our family is an embarrassment.",10
48564,Randall,1, That‰Ûªs not much of a joke.,10
48565,Penny,1," Okay. Listen, Mom, I know you‰Ûªre nervous, but I promise you, no one is gonna judge you or this family.",10
48566,Susan,1," Oh, I‰Ûªm sorry. It‰Ûªs just we‰Ûªre meeting Leonard‰Ûªs parents for the first time, and, and they‰Ûªre academics and, and intellectuals, and I don‰Ûªt want them thinking we‰Ûªre white trash.",10
48567,Randall,1," Well, what colour trash do you think they‰Ûªll believe?",10
48568,Scene,1, The apartment.,10
48569,Mary,1, How could you think that I would spend the night with a man I just met?,10
48570,Sheldon,1, A man named Jesus convinced you to build a church in Africa. You‰Ûªre kind of a sucker.,10
48571,Leonard,1," Well, nothing happened, right? It‰Ûªs over. Until we get married a third time, you guys will never have to see each other again.",10
48572,Alfred,1," Well, you know, actually that‰Ûªs not the case. Mary may visit me in New York.",10
48573,Mary,1, Mm-hmm. And he‰Ûªs never been to Texas.,10
48574,Alfred,1, Maybe we meet halfway.,10
48575,Sheldon,1, What? In the Chattahoochee National Forest in Georgia? I can‰Ûªt be the only one that knows that‰Ûªs halfway.,10
48576,Beverley,1, You‰Ûªre not seriously going to visit each other.,10
48577,Alfred,1, And why wouldn‰Ûªt we?,10
48578,Beverley,1," Oh please, you‰Ûªre just saying this to antagonize me.",10
48579,Alfred,1," Oh, not at all. Mary happens to be a wonderful woman. And if it antagonizes you, that‰Ûªs just a bonus.",10
48580,Leonard,1," Mary, I‰Ûªm sorry you‰Ûªre in the middle of this.",10
48581,Mary,1," No, no, nothing to be sorry about. I genuinely like your father.",10
48582,Sheldon,1," What? But he‰Ûªs a mediocre academic. And according to Beverley, his sexual prowess is sub-par. He‰Ûªs basically Leonard with a bigger prostate.",10
48583,Leonard,1, Are you saying that my dad‰Ûªs not good enough for your mom?,10
48584,Sheldon,1," Yes, while also getting in a solid dig at you. Pretty efficient, huh?",10
48585,Leonard,1, This is ridiculous. I‰Ûªm going across the hall.,10
48586,Sheldon,1, But why should you get to go and leave me here with your bickering parents?,10
48587,Leonard,1," Fine, then you go.",10
48588,Mary,1," Well, I don‰Ûªt want to stay here with her. I‰Ûªll go.",10
48589,Alfred,1, I‰Ûªll go with you.,10
48590,Leonard,1, That still leaves me here with him.,10
48591,Amy,1, Who‰Ûªs ready for a wedding?,10
48592,Sheldon,1," Great, now I have to start all over.",10
48593,Scene,1, Penny‰Ûªs apartment.,10
48594,Wyatt,1, So how‰Ûªs the world of pharmaceuticals treating you?,10
48595,Penny,1, Pretty good. I actually just got assigned a much better territory.,10
48596,Susan,1, See what happens when you work hard?,10
48597,Randall,1," Hey, she just sells drugs. I had to make ‰Ûªem.",10
48598,Susan,1," Okay, that‰Ûªs enough. No more drug talk for the rest of this trip.",10
48599,Wyatt,1, I‰Ûªll drink to that.,10
48600,Susan,1, Haven‰Ûªt you had enough?,10
48601,Wyatt,1, Penny drinks more than I do.,10
48602,Penny,1," Well, I learned from the best.",10
48603,Wyatt,1, Aw.,10
48604,Penny,1, Aw.,10
48605,Susan,1," Very nice, Wyatt. And you wonder why this one turned out the way he did.",10
48606,Randall,1, You see what I‰Ûªve gotta put up with.,10
48607,Susan,1, What you‰Ûªve gotta put up with? Why did you have to go to jail?,10
48608,Randall,1," It‰Ûªs called getting caught, Mother.",10
48609,Leonard,1, Hello.,10
48610,Wyatt,1," Hey, there he is.",10
48611,Penny,1, Hey.,10
48612,Susan,1," Oh, Leonard. It‰Ûªs so nice to see you again.",10
48613,Leonard,1," Oh, you, too. Hey, everyone, this is my mother, Beverley.",10
48614,Beverley,1, Hello.,10
48615,Susan,1, Hi.,10
48616,Randall,1, We are not white trash.,10
48617,Scene,1, The apartment.,10
48618,Amy,1, Are you excited to see your son walk down the aisle?,10
48619,Alfred,1," Yes, I am. I‰Ûªm just feeling a little guilty about all the trouble I‰Ûªve caused.",10
48620,Mary,1," Oh, so am I.",10
48621,Sheldon,1," You made God sad today, Mom.",10
48622,Amy,1," Sheldon, they haven‰Ûªt done anything wrong. I think it‰Ûªs nice they‰Ûªre hitting it off.",10
48623,Sheldon,1," Well, that‰Ûªs still no reason to rush into anything. I mean, look at us. We took things remarkably slow. You and I, we didn‰Ûªt even hold hands for two years.",10
48624,Amy,1, It was a lot hotter than it sounds.,10
48625,Alfred,1, You‰Ûªre a patient young lady.,10
48626,Sheldon,1," Hey, hey. She‰Ûªs mine, take a cold shower, grandpa.",10
48627,Scene,1, Howard and Bernadette‰Ûªs kitchen.,10
48628,Howard,1, Why wouldn‰Ûªt that colonel say what the meeting‰Ûªs about? It has to be bad news.,10
48629,Raj,1," Calm down, okay? Try not to think about it.",10
48630,Howard,1, That‰Ûªs really stupid advice.,10
48631,Raj,1, You know that hurts my feelings.,10
48632,Howard,1," Calm down, try not to think about it.",10
48633,Raj,1, Okay. ,10
48634,Howard,1, Why do I bother talking to you?,10
48635,Raj,1," Oh, come on. What‰Ûªs the worst that could come of this meeting?",10
48636,Howard,1," I don‰Ûªt know. They take the invention away, and I get nothing?",10
48637,Raj,1," Okay, that‰Ûªs not so bad. You know what happened to the scientists that worked on the Manhattan Project? The government forced them to move to the desert. They had to live in secret, and when Oppenheimer objected to what they made him do, they destroyed his reputation.",10
48638,Howard,1, What‰Ûªs the point of that story?,10
48639,Raj,1," I just read a book about Oppenheimer, seemed like a chance to show off. (Howard laughs) There he is, there‰Ûªs my happy Hebraic homeboy. Yeah, that‰Ûªs the smile I‰Ûªm gonna remember when you‰Ûªre living in the desert and I‰Ûªm living with your wife.",10
48640,Scene,1, Penny‰Ûªs apartment. ,10
48641,Beverley,1," So, what do you do for a living?",10
48642,Randall,1," Mommy, you want to take this one?",10
48643,Susan,1," Um, Randall‰Ûªs in between jobs. ",10
48644,Randall,1, And court appearances.,10
48645,Wyatt,1, It‰Ûªs nice to meet the woman who raised this fine young man. I‰Ûªm looking forward to meeting his father.,10
48646,Beverley,1, Prepare to be disappointed.,10
48647,Leonard,1," And he can‰Ûªt wait to meet you, too. Can I get anyone a drink?",10
48648,Wyatt,1," Well, I could use another beer. ",10
48649,Susan,1, You‰Ûªre done. He‰Ûªs done.,10
48650,Penny,1, Hey. Is everyone getting to know each other?,10
48651,Randall,1, Not at all.,10
48652,Scene,1, The wedding ceremony. ,10
48653,Stuart,1," Nice to see you again, Dr. Hofstadter. I‰Ûªm, uh, Leonard‰Ûªs friend, Stuart.",10
48654,Beverley,1," Nice to see you, too.",10
48655,Stuart,1," Hi, I‰Ûªm Stuart.",10
48656,Alfred,1," Oh, I‰Ûªm Alfred. Leonard‰Ûªs father.",10
48657,Stuart,1," Oh. Oh, hi. Uh, I‰Ûªm sorry, did you two want to sit together?",10
48658,Together,1, No.,10
48659,Stuart,1, I was wondering why the front row was available.,10
48660,Bernadette,1," Okay, I think we‰Ûªre ready.",10
48661,Sheldon,1, Why do people cry at weddings?,10
48662,Mary,1, They‰Ûªre practicing for what‰Ûªs coming later.,10
48663,Susan,1, Thank you for cleaning yourself up for your sister‰Ûªs wedding.,10
48664,Randall,1, Thank you for my new teeth.,10
48665,Wyatt,1," Welcome to the family, Leonard. Don‰Ûªt lend your new brother-in-law money.",10
48666,Bernadette,1, We‰Ûªre here today to celebrate love.,10
48667,Beverley,1, Urgh.,10
48668,Alfred,1," Sigh louder, no one heard you.",10
48669,Stuart,1," Really, I can move.",10
48670,Bernadette,1," Not just Leonard and Penny‰Ûªs love, but the love we have for them, as well as each other.",10
48671,Sheldon,1," Speaking of love, STDs among the elderly are skyrocketing.",10
48672,Bernadette,1," Love is patient, but it‰Ûªs not gonna put up with all the side chatter, so let‰Ûªs knock it off.",10
48673,Howard,1, At least she‰Ûªs yelling at someone else for a change.,10
48674,Bernadette,1, Howard.,10
48675,Penny,1," Okay, I understand everyone‰Ûªs a little tense today, so I am just gonna get to the important stuff. Leonard, standing here with you in front of our family and friends is bringing up a lot of feelings. Like what a good idea it was to elope the first time. But also how incredibly happy you make me. Thank you for marrying me. Hopefully for the last time.",10
48676,Leonard,1," Penny, as a scientist, my job is to figure out why things happen. But I don‰Ûªt think I‰Ûªll ever understand how someone like me could get to be with someone like you. You know, maybe I don‰Ûªt",10
48677,Penny,1, Oh.,10
48678,Bernadette,1, Anybody have anything snarky to say about that? Didn‰Ûªt think so.,10
48679,Alfred,1," I‰Ûªd like to say something. Beverly, I know that we don‰Ûªt bring out the best in each other. ",10
48680,Beverley,1, I couldn‰Ûªt agree more.,10
48681,Stuart,1, That‰Ûªs beautiful.,10
48682,Bernadette,1," Thank you. All right, let‰Ûªs continue.",10
48683,Sheldon,1," Yeah, excuse me, I need to say something to someone pretty special, and I just can‰Ûªt wait any longer.",10
48684,Amy,1, It‰Ûªs happening.,10
48685,Sheldon,1," Leonard, you and I have our ups and downs. But I have always considered you my family. Even before the recent threat of our parents fornicating like wrinkly old rabbits. I don‰Ûªt always show it, but you are of great importance to me. Both of you. ",10
48686,Penny,1, Oh.,10
48687,Leonard,1, Thank you.,10
48688,Bernadette,1, Okay. I now pronounce you husband and wife. And weird other husband who came with the apartment.,10
48689,Scene,1, Leonard‰Ûªs car.,10
48690,Beverley,1, Thank you for taking us to the airport.,10
48691,Leonard,1," Hey, I‰Ûªm just thrilled we‰Ûªre all getting along for a minute.",10
48692,Alfred,1," Yeah, me, too. Beverly, I‰Ûªm sorry if I upset you.",10
48693,Beverley,1," Water under the bridge, Alfred. Leonard, why don‰Ûªt you get into the carpool lane?",10
48694,Alfred,1," Well, that‰Ûªs a solid line. He can‰Ûªt cross that.",10
48695,Leonard,1, That‰Ûªs okay. I can make it over.,10
48696,Beverley,1," No, no, let‰Ûªs plod along. It‰Ûªll make your father feel more comfortable.",10
48697,Alfred,1, What makes me comfortable is knowing I don‰Ûªt have to wake up tomorrow morning and see your sour face.,10
48698,Beverley,1," Do the world a favour, and don‰Ûªt wake up tomorrow morning.",10
48699,Leonard,1, That was almost a minute.,10
48700,Scene,1, Amy‰Ûªs car.,10
48701,Mary,1, There‰Ûªs a lot of traffic. Are we gonna be okay?,10
48702,Amy,1, You‰Ûªll be at the airport an hour before your flight.,10
48703,Mary,1, Good. Thank you.,10
48704,Sheldon,1, Plenty of time for you to meet another geriatric boy toy.,10
48705,Mary,1, Hey. I will not have you be disrespectful to me.,10
48706,Sheldon,1, Yes ma‰Ûªam.,10
48707,Amy,1," Sheldon, you‰Ûªre mother‰Ûªs an attractive woman. You need to get use to the fact that men are going to be interested in her.",10
48708,Sheldon,1," Well, and you need to drive the car and mind your business.",10
48709,Amy,1, I will not have you be disrespectful to me.,10
48710,Sheldon,1," What, you‰Ûªre not my mother.",10
48711,Mary,1, Don‰Ûªt you be disrespectful to her.,10
48712,Sheldon,1, Yes ma‰Ûªam.,10
48713,Mary,1, You‰Ûªll get there. You‰Ûªve just gotta put some zing on it.,10
48714,Scene,1, Penny‰Ûªs car.,10
48715,Susan,1," Penny, I don‰Ûªt know what I was worried about. You‰Ûªre friends are just lovely.",10
48716,Penny,1," Oh, thanks, Mom.",10
48717,Susan,1, Although that Sheldon is a bit peculiar.,10
48718,Penny,1, Is he? I never noticed.,10
48719,Wyatt,1, He reminds me of that turkey we had who drowned looking up at the rain.,10
48720,Randall,1," Cops, cops, be cool.",10
48721,Scene,2, The apartment.,10
48722,Sheldon,2, Look at this. Elon Musk has a theory that we‰Ûªre all just characters in some advanced civilization‰Ûªs video game.,10
48723,Leonard,2, So some alien kid spent his money on the asthma-and-glasses upgrade for me?,10
48724,Sheldon,2," Well, he doesn‰Ûªt say it‰Ûªs a good game.",10
48725,Howard (entering),2," All right, we got a problem.",10
48726,Leonard,2, What‰Ûªs up?,10
48727,Howard,2, The Air Force contacted me about our quantum gyroscope. They want to have a meeting.,10
48728,Leonard,2, Really?,10
48729,Raj,2, Yeah. This military guy showed up at Howard‰Ûªs door. He was terrifying.,10
48730,Sheldon,2," Oh, what did he say?",10
48731,Raj,2, He gave me his business card and asked me to please pass it along to Howard.,10
48732,Sheldon,2, That doesn‰Ûªt sound terrifying.,10
48733,Raj,2," To a white guy born here, no. If you are a brown guy whose name has a lot of syllables in it, terrifying.",10
48734,Leonard,2," You realize if the military declares our research classified, they can take the whole thing away from us.",10
48735,Howard,2," And if that happens, we‰Ûªll never be able to sell it commercially.",10
48736,Leonard,2, There goes our big payday.,10
48737,Howard,2, I was counting on that money. I need to make as much as my wife so I don‰Ûªt have to try so hard in bed.,10
48738,Leonard,2," You do that, too?",10
48739,Howard,2," Oh, yeah. How do you think I stay this thin?",10
48740,Sheldon,2," Gentlemen, I think we are losing sight of the real issue. We are on the precipice of becoming faceless cogs in the military-industrial complex. Isn‰Ûªt that exciting?",10
48741,Raj,2," Well, you‰Ûªre kidding, right?",10
48742,Sheldon,2," Not at all. In Star Wars, when the stormtroopers would march in perfect formation, harassing civilians, didn‰Ûªt you ever think, hey, that could be me?",10
48743,Howard,2," Sheldon, we could be contributing to a weapons system that oppresses mankind for the next thousand years.",10
48744,Sheldon,2," Okay, Howard‰Ûªs on board. What do you think, Leonard?",10
48745,Scene,2, Penny‰Ûªs apartment.,10
48746,Bernadette,2," I‰Ûªm worried about Howard. Ever since that guy from the Air Force showed up, he‰Ûªs been a nervous wreck.",10
48747,Penny,2," All right, we work at a giant pharmaceutical company. Get him some anti-anxiety meds.",10
48748,Bernadette,2, He won‰Ûªt take any pills that aren‰Ûªt chewable and shaped like a Flintstone.,10
48749,Penny,2," You know, when Leonard‰Ûªs feeling anxious I make him take a long walk.",10
48750,Amy,2, Does that help?,10
48751,Penny,2," Well, for a while. Then he comes back.",10
48752,Bernadette,2, I don‰Ûªt believe this.,10
48753,Amy,2, What‰Ûªs wrong?,10
48754,Bernadette,2, This guy from the office just congratulated me on being pregnant.,10
48755,Amy,2," You did already know, right?",10
48756,Bernadette,2, No one at the office did. Did you tell anyone?,10
48757,Penny,2, No. You told me not to.,10
48758,Bernadette,2," I bet it was Barbara Chen in retrovirus. She might have heard me throwing up one morning. Every since she got the hearing aid, she thinks she‰Ûªs so great.",10
48759,Amy,2, Why don‰Ûªt you want anyone to know?,10
48760,Bernadette,2," ‰Û÷Cause I‰Ûªm up for a major immunotherapy study, and if they find out I‰Ûªm pregnant they might give it to someone else.",10
48761,Penny,2, Would they really do that?,10
48762,Bernadette,2," I know they would, they did it to Barbara Chen last year when I told everyone she was pregnant.",10
48763,Scene,2, The apartment.,10
48764,Raj,2, Wail till I Snapchat that my friends might be working on a top secret government project.,10
48765,Leonard,2, Are you crazy? You can‰Ûªt put that on Snapchat.,10
48766,Raj,2," Fine, I‰Ûªll put it on Facebook like a caveman.",10
48767,Howard,2," You know, maybe before our meeting we should talk to a lawyer.",10
48768,Leonard,2, That‰Ûªs not a bad idea.,10
48769,Raj,2," Well, you must have someone in your family that‰Ûªs a lawyer.",10
48770,Howard,2," Why? Because I‰Ûªm Jewish? That‰Ûªs like me saying, hey, you‰Ûªre Indian, doesn‰Ûªt your cousin work in a call centre?",10
48771,Raj,2, My cousin does work in a call centre.,10
48772,Howard,2, And my cousin‰Ûªs a lawyer.,10
48773,Sheldon,2," We don‰Ûªt need Howard‰Ûªs cousin. No, we have me. ",10
48774,Leonard,2," You‰Ûªre not a lawyer, Sheldon, you‰Ûªre just a know-it-all.",10
48775,Sheldon,2, I am not a know-it-all. I‰Ûªm a person who knows lots of things and likes to correct other people when they‰Ûªre wrong.,10
48776,Leonard,2, That‰Ûªs the definition of being a know-it-all.,10
48777,Sheldon,2," Or in German, a Besserwisser.",10
48778,Scene,2, Penny‰Ûªs apartment. ,10
48779,Penny,2, How did you think you were gonna hide your pregnancy?,10
48780,Bernadette,2, I had a plan. I kept leaving Dove Bar wrappers around to explain any weight gain.,10
48781,Amy,2, Where did you get empty Dove Bar wrappers?,10
48782,Bernadette,2," From all the Dove Bars I ate. I‰Ûªm pregnant. Try to keep up. I‰Ûªm sorry, I have to go find out if my boss knows.",10
48783,Amy,2," Well, whatever happens, we‰Ûªre here for you.",10
48784,Bernadette,2, Thanks. You guys are the best.,10
48785,Penny,2," Yeah, drive safe. We love you. And give us a call‰Û_ Oh, my God, it was me, it was me. I‰Ûªm the one who blabbed she was pregnant!",10
48786,Amy,2, What?,10
48787,Penny,2, I didn‰Ûªt mean to. It just slipped out in front of her assistantone day. I‰Û_,10
48788,Bernadette,2, I forgot my coat.,10
48789,Penny,2," Oh, here‰Ûªs your coat, honey. That‰Ûªs such a cute jacket. Oh God, I feel so bad, I just lied to her.",10
48790,Amy,2," Oh, but you did it so well. That‰Ûªs amazing, it‰Ûªs like watching a sculptor, but your clay was lies.",10
48791,Penny,2, Is that really what‰Ûªs important right now?,10
48792,Amy,2," I mean, seriously, you have got to let me scan your brain when you‰Ûªre being dishonest so I can see what lights up.",10
48793,Penny,2," That‰Ûªs super helpful, Amy. Thanks a lot. I can‰Ûªt wait to do that.",10
48794,Amy,2, I can see a clump of bitch cells lightin‰Ûª up from here.,10
48795,Scene,2, Howard‰Ûªs workshop.,10
48796,Howard,2, Give me a second to call my cousin.,10
48797,Sheldon,2, I don‰Ûªt see how a tax lawyer from Fort Lauderdale could be helpful regarding intellectual property.,10
48798,Howard,2," First of all, he‰Ûªs in Boca Raton, which is better than Fort Lauderdale. But more importantly, he lasted two days on Jeopardy, so he‰Ûªs clearly a smart guy.",10
48799,Howard‰Ûªs cousin (on skype),2, Hello.,10
48800,Howard,2," Hey, Marty. Thanks for talking to us.",10
48801,Marty,2," Hey, no problem. Thanks for going to outer space so no matter what I do my mom will be disappointed in me.",10
48802,Howard,2," Well, I married a little Catholic girl, so we‰Ûªre even. Anyway, this is Leonard and Sheldon. The three of us came up with the guidance system.",10
48803,Leonard,2, Hi. ,10
48804,Sheldon,2, Hello.,10
48805,Howard,2," And this is my friend, Raj.",10
48806,Raj,2," Oh, I‰Ûªm not on the patent. I‰Ûªm just here because there‰Ûªs a bumblebee in my office.",10
48807,Leonard,2, I saw it. It‰Ûªs big.,10
48808,Howard,2," Anyway, like I said in the e-mail, this meeting‰Ûªs on Thursday. Do you have any advice for us?",10
48809,Marty,2," Well, I don‰Ûªt know much about patent law. But, uh, my advice is hear them out, offer as little information as possible, and whatever you do, don‰Ûªt sign anything.",10
48810,Sheldon,2," Don‰Ûªt sign anything? That‰Ûªs your advice? Okay, so, uh, if during this meeting, one of us were to, say, complete an oil painting, you‰Ûªd recommend that we leave that unsigned?",10
48811,Marty,2, That‰Ûªs not what I meant.,10
48812,Sheldon,2, That‰Ûªs what you said.,10
48813,Marty,2, That‰Ûªs not what I meant.,10
48814,Sheldon,2," This must be how you practice law in Boca Raton, by saying things you don‰Ûªt mean and meaning things you don‰Ûªt say.",10
48815,Marty,2," Howard, why is he yelling at me?",10
48816,Howard,2," Marty, let me call you back.",10
48817,Leonard,2," Someday, when I‰Ûªm up on murder charges, you‰Ûªll be hearing from me.",10
48818,Sheldon,2, You don‰Ûªt need him. I‰Ûªll represent you.,10
48819,Scene,2, Bernadette‰Ûªs office.,10
48820,Penny,2, Hi.,10
48821,Bernadette,2, Hey. What brings you by?,10
48822,Penny,2," Oh, had to go to a sales seminar on our new sleeping pill.",10
48823,Bernadette,2, Oh. How was it?,10
48824,Penny,2, Great.,10
48825,Bernadette,2, Fell asleep?,10
48826,Penny,2," In, like, two minutes. Yeah. So, how is everything going around here? Are you still upset about people finding out you‰Ûªre pregnant?",10
48827,Bernadette,2, I‰Ûªm furious.,10
48828,Penny,2," Sure, sure. Uh, did you ever figure out who told?",10
48829,Bernadette,2," No. I confronted Barbara Chen, but she claimed she didn‰Ûªt know what I was talking about.",10
48830,Penny,2," Hmm. Well, I guess it‰Ûªs just gonna remain a mystery, you know, like whatever happened in that seminar after they dimmed the lights.",10
48831,Bernadette,2, It had to be Barbara. I‰Ûªve been trying to figure out a way to get back at her. Do you think using her work computer to Google how to be a prostitute is over the line?,10
48832,Penny,2," Uh, you know, when I was in high school, there was this girl who was talking about me behind my back, so me and all my friends, we cornered her in the bathroom and forgave her.",10
48833,Bernadette,2, What kind of revenge is that? This woman screwed with my job. She‰Ûªs got to pay.,10
48834,Penny,2," Okay, all right, honey, you know what? There was something I was too scared to tell you yesterday, and now I‰Ûªm just balls-out terrified to tell you, but the truth is it wasn‰Ûªt Barbara Chen, it was me. I‰Ûªm the reason everyone knows.",10
48835,Bernadette,2, Why did you do that?,10
48836,Penny,2," Well, it was an accident.I am so sorry I lied.",10
48837,Bernadette,2, Get out.,10
48838,Penny,2," Oh, you know, I also lied about the girl in the bathroom. Yeah, we actually dumped her retainer in the toilet and put it back in her mouth.",10
48839,Scene,2, Howard‰Ûªs workshop.,10
48840,Sheldon,2, I don‰Ûªt understand why I can‰Ûªt talk at this meeting.,10
48841,Leonard,2," ‰Û÷Cause when you talk, it enrages people.",10
48842,Sheldon,2, Okay. Quick question. Am I allowed to exchange pleasantries upon meeting this colonel?,10
48843,Leonard,2, Yes.,10
48844,Sheldon,2, Am I allowed to inform him that Colonel Sanders was never actually in the military?,10
48845,Leonard,2, I‰Ûªm getting enraged.,10
48846,Sheldon,2, Fine. Ooh. Can I use text-to-speech software?,10
48847,Howard,2, No.,10
48848,Leonard,2, Don‰Ûªt speak.,10
48849,Sheldon‰Ûªs phone,2," Aw, nuts.",10
48850,Colonel Williams,2," Gentlemen, I‰Ûªm Colonel Williams. Thank you for meeting with me.",10
48851,Leonard,2, Hi.,10
48852,Howard,2, Hello.,10
48853,Colonel Williams,2," So, which one of you is the brains behind all this?",10
48854,Howard,2," It‰Ûªs a group effort, but I guess if we had to pick a main brain, it would be me.",10
48855,Sheldon,2, (Strangled sound) ,10
48856,Scene,2," The same, shortly after, demonstrating the quantum gyroscope. ",10
48857,Colonel Williams,2," And because of the quantum vortices, this can run perpetually?",10
48858,Leonard,2," Exactly. Yeah, you have a good grasp of the physics.",10
48859,Colonel Williams,2," Well, I‰Ûªm a scientist by training.",10
48860,Howard,2, Really? You‰Ûªre a physicist?,10
48861,Colonel Williams,2, Better. I‰Ûªm an engineer.,10
48862,Leonard,2, Where did you go to school?,10
48863,Colonel Williams,2, MIT.,10
48864,Howard,2," Oh. Well, hey, me, too.",10
48865,Colonel Williams,2," I should have known. Behind every great invention is an MIT mind. I‰Ûªll cut to the chase. The Air Force believes there‰Ûªs an application for this technology, and we‰Ûªre interested in funding your research.",10
48866,Howard,2," Well, thanks, but you should know we‰Ûªre a little concerned about this being used in weapons.",10
48867,Colonel Williams,2," Oh, well, let me put your mind at ease. What we use it for is none of your business.",10
48868,Leonard,2, I don‰Ûªt know how I feel about this.,10
48869,Colonel Williams,2," Look, guys, it‰Ûªs just a guidance system. It‰Ûªs not like you‰Ûªre handing us the Death Star from Star Trek. All you need to worry about is, right now, it‰Ûªs this big, and we need it to be this big.",10
48870,Leonard,2, That‰Ûªs a lot less big.,10
48871,Colonel Williams,2," Yes, it‰Ûªs this much less big.",10
48872,Howard,2, I‰Ûªm not even sure that‰Ûªs possible.,10
48873,Colonel Williams,2," Well, I ran it by some colleagues at MIT, and they thought they could get it done in four months.",10
48874,Howard,2, Four months?,10
48875,Sheldon,2," Yeah, we‰Ûªll do it in two. Hi. I‰Ûªm Dr. Sheldon Cooper. I‰Ûªm the actual brains behind this project. Also, engineers aren‰Ûªt real scientists, MIT‰Ûªs a trade school, and the Death Star is from Star Wars, not Star Trek. But otherwise, thank you for your service.",10
48876,Scene,2, Bernadette‰Ûªs office.,10
48877,Amy,2," Hi. Howard told me you were working late, so I brought dinner.",10
48878,Bernadette,2," Oh, thanks. You know, I just wanted to get some work done without people congratulating me about the baby every five minutes.",10
48879,Amy,2, I spent my day alone in the lab waiting for a rat to die of anthrax.,10
48880,Bernadette,2, Did you come here to bring me dinner or to gloat?,10
48881,Amy,2," Well, I came to see how you were feeling, but I‰Ûªm guessing still angry?",10
48882,Bernadette,2," I‰Ûªm sorry. My boss wants to meet with me, and I‰Ûªm stressing.",10
48883,Amy,2, You really think they‰Ûªre gonna start treating you differently?,10
48884,Bernadette,2," Are you kidding? I‰Ûªve always been treated differently. Look at me. Listen to me. I mean, the first thought when you see me isn‰Ûªt that‰Ûªs a scientist, it‰Ûªs I wonder if her mommy",10
48885,Amy,2, I am really regretting that I got you a Happy Meal.,10
48886,Bernadette,2," I‰Ûªve worked so hard to get where I am, and I don‰Ûªt want to get sent back to square one because I‰Ûªm pregnant.",10
48887,Amy,2, I understand how you feel.,10
48888,Bernadette,2, Thank you.,10
48889,Amy,2, I wish there were some way I could make it better.,10
48890,Bernadette,2," Well, you brought me French fries. That‰Ûªs a start.",10
48891,Amy,2," Uh, actually, I got you apple slices ‰Ûªcause you‰Ûªre pregnant.",10
48892,Bernadette,2, Apple slices? What kind of lunatic goes to McDonald‰Ûªs and gets fruit?,10
48893,Amy,2, I‰Ûªll be right back.,10
48894,Bernadette,2, And a chocolate shake.,10
48895,Scene,2, The apartment.,10
48896,Penny,2, Hi.,10
48897,Sheldon,2, Hello.,10
48898,Penny,2, What are you doing?,10
48899,Sheldon,2," Oh, Leonard‰Ûªs mad at me, so I‰Ûªm making him lemon bars.",10
48900,Penny,2, Does he even like lemon bars?,10
48901,Sheldon,2," Not really. But I‰Ûªm mad at him, too, so lemon bars it is.",10
48902,Penny,2, Something happen at the meeting?,10
48903,Sheldon,2, They made me promise I wouldn‰Ûªt talk.,10
48904,Penny,2, And you talked?,10
48905,Sheldon,2," Well, now, see? You knew what was gonna happen. Why didn‰Ûªt they? Anyway, now we‰Ûªre committed to completing this project in a ridiculously short time frame, and everyone‰Ûªs upset with me.",10
48906,Penny,2," Well, if it makes you feel any better, Bernadette‰Ûªs mad at me, too.",10
48907,Sheldon,2," Mm. If it makes you feel any better, a parasitoid wasp known as Oobius depressus has been rediscovered after 101 years of presumed extinction.",10
48908,Penny,2, Why would that make me feel better?,10
48909,Sheldon,2, Why would your Bernadette thing make me feel better? At least mine was educational.,10
48910,Penny,2, Okay. Never mind.,10
48911,Sheldon,2," Look, I‰Ûªm sorry. Tell me why Bernadette is upset with you.",10
48912,Penny,2," Well, I told people at work that she‰Ûªs pregnant. She wasn‰Ûªt ready for them to know.",10
48913,Sheldon,2, Why would you do that?,10
48914,Penny,2," Well, it just slipped out. I feel terrible.",10
48915,Sheldon,2," See, that‰Ûªs exactly what happened to me, except that I said it on purpose, and I have no regrets.",10
48916,Scene,2, Howard‰Ûªs workshop.,10
48917,Raj,2, Is it even possible to get this done in two months?,10
48918,Howard,2," Well, maybe. I don‰Ûªt know. We‰Ûªll have to work 12 hours a day, seven days a week.",10
48919,Leonard,2," Which means I won‰Ûªt be able to make Penny breakfast every day, and she‰Ûªll realize my brioche French toast was the only thing keeping her in the marriage.",10
48920,Howard,2, I love your French toast.,10
48921,Leonard,2," Oh, thanks, man. ",10
48922,Raj,2," So, why did you guys even agree to the deadline?",10
48923,Howard,2, We didn‰Ûªt. Sheldon did.,10
48924,Raj,2, And you just let him?,10
48925,Leonard,2," Well, the colonel said it was for the good of the country, and the funding is substantial.",10
48926,Howard,2," No, but mostly, there was an awkward pause, and I broke it by saying okay.",10
48927,Raj,2, So I guess I won‰Ûªt be seeing you guys for a while.,10
48928,Leonard,2," Oh, looks like it.",10
48929,Raj,2," Wow. You‰Ûªre going off to work with the military, leaving me behind. Now I know how all those army wives feel.",10
48930,Howard,2, Would you stop? We‰Ûªre just gonna be on the other side of campus.,10
48931,Raj,2, And right here.,10
48932,Howard,2, You are a deeply silly man.,10
48933,Raj,2, He is so afraid of his feelings.,10
48934,Scene,2, Outside Penny‰Ûªs door.,10
48935,Penny,2," Oh, hi.",10
48936,Bernadette,2, Got a minute?,10
48937,Penny,2," Yeah, come on in.",10
48938,Bernadette,2, I just wanted to apologize. I know what you did was an accident.,10
48939,Penny,2," Oh, thank you, and I‰Ûªm sorry I lied about it. ",10
48940,Bernadette,2," For what it‰Ûªs worth, you‰Ûªre a great liar.",10
48941,Penny,2," Oh, that‰Ûªs what Amy said. So what‰Ûªs going on with the research project? Are they gonna let you run it?",10
48942,Bernadette,2," Well, my boss said he hadn‰Ûªt decided yet, so I gently reminded him that he‰Ûªs an old rich white guy, and I‰Ûªm a sweet little pregnant lady who‰Ûªs not afraid to crying front of a jury.",10
48943,Penny,2, You threatened to sue?,10
48944,Bernadette,2," Hey, I learned a long time ago, when you‰Ûªre four feet eleven and eye level with every guy‰Ûªs crotch, that‰Ûªs where you punch.",10
48945,Penny,2, That‰Ûªs funny. I learned something totally different.,10
48946,Bernadette,2, Do you know what? It‰Ûªs just a research project. The most important job in the world is gonna be raising this child. It‰Ûªs all I need to give my life meaning.,10
48947,Penny,2," Oh, that‰Ûªs so beautiful.",10
48948,Bernadette,2," You believe me? Oh, good. 11 more chumps like you, I‰Ûªll have the jury eating out of my hand.",10
48949,Scene,2, A corridor at the university. ,10
48950,Sheldon,2, I never realized this building was classified.,10
48951,Howard,2, Maybe that‰Ûªs because it‰Ûªs classified.,10
48952,Leonard,2, Wish we weren‰Ûªt so far from my parking space.,10
48953,Sheldon,2," The way you put away those lemon bars, perhaps that‰Ûªs a good thing.",10
48954,Leonard,2, I‰Ûªd like to reinstate the you-not-talking rule.,10
48955,Sheldon,2, Why? It clearly doesn‰Ûªt work.,10
48956,Howard,2, I guess this is it. ,10
48957,Leonard,2, Is that a retinal scanner?,10
48958,Howard,2, Let‰Ûªs find out.,10
48959,Scanner,2," Howard Wolowitz, access granted.",10
48960,Leonard,2, No way.,10
48961,Sheldon,2, Impressive.,10
48962,Leonard,2," Oh, my turn, my turn.",10
48963,Scanner,2," Leonard Hofstadter, access granted.",10
48964,Leonard,2, I didn‰Ûªt even have to take my glasses off/,10
48965,Scanner (as Leonard and Sheldon try to fool it with one eye each),2, Access denied.,10
48966,Leonard and Sheldon,2, It knows.,10
48967,Howard,2," Oh, oh, oh, oh, guys, hold me upside down.",10
48968,Scanner,2," Howard Wolowitz, access granted.",10
48969,All,2, Yay.,10
48970,Scene,3, The new laboratory.,10
48971,Howard,3, It‰Ûªs pretty late. You think I‰Ûªve got time to run some more simulations on the cooling system?,10
48972,Leonard,3," Sure, I‰Ûªm still figuring out the thermo-acoustic expander.",10
48973,Sheldon,3," Oh, while you do that I am going to pump cerebral spinal fluid through my brain cells to remove the metabolic by-products of the day‰Ûªs thoughts.",10
48974,Howard,3, What?,10
48975,Sheldon,3," It‰Ûªs called sleep and it‰Ûªs my bedtime. Nighty-night, y‰Ûªall.",10
48976,Howard,3," Hey, hey, hey, you‰Ûªre not going anywhere.",10
48977,Leonard,3, We only have two months to deliver this to the Air Force because of you.,10
48978,Sheldon,3," I know, I was there.",10
48979,Howard,3," Well, wake up, we‰Ûªre gonna put in a lot of late nights.",10
48980,Sheldon,3, How late?,10
48981,Howard,3," Well, I don‰Ûªt know, midnight, one.",10
48982,Sheldon,3, One o‰Ûªclock? I‰Ûªm not a raccoon.,10
48983,Howard,3," If you‰Ûªre tired, have some coffee.",10
48984,Sheldon,3, What? You have some coffee.,10
48985,Howard,3, I am having coffee.,10
48986,Sheldon,3, And look how irritable it‰Ûªs making you!,10
48987,Leonard,3," Guys, we‰Ûªre not gonna get anything done if we start fighting. Now, can you please try",10
48988,Sheldon,3, Fine. (Time passing montage) I don‰Ûªt think I can go much longer.,10
48989,Leonard,3," It‰Ûªs been three and a half minutes, wake up.",10
48990,Scene,3, The apartment.,10
48991,Sheldon,3, I had a bad dream that my best friend became a tyrant and forced me to stay up all night to work.,10
48992,Leonard,3," Oh, I had a good dream that when I carried you to bed, I let your head hit the wall and I laughed.",10
48993,Penny,3, Good morning.,10
48994,Leonard,3, What is this?,10
48995,Amy,3," Well, we didn‰Ûªt see you last night, we‰Ûªre not gonna see you today, so we thought we could have breakfast together.",10
48996,Leonard,3," Oh, that is so nice.",10
48997,Sheldon,3," Ow, it does hurt.",10
48998,Leonard,3," So, what are you guys gonna do today?",10
48999,Amy,3," Well, Sheldon was supposed to go to this party with me this afternoon, but I don‰Ûªt think that‰Ûªs happening.",10
49000,Sheldon,3," Oh, that was never happening.",10
49001,Penny,3," Oh, I‰Ûªll go. I like a party.",10
49002,Amy,3," Well, to be honest, it‰Ûªs not like a party party, it‰Ûªs more like a gathering where scientists of different disciplines get together to share their work and keep current on what‰Ûªs going on in other fields. I don‰Ûªt know why I called it a party, sorry.",10
49003,Penny,3," It‰Ûªs okay, I‰Ûªll still go.",10
49004,Leonard,3, You don‰Ûªt think you‰Ûªll be bored?,10
49005,Penny,3," Oh, I‰Ûªll have some wine and listen to people go on about crap I don‰Ûªt understand. I mean, how is it any different than every single day of my life?",10
49006,Sheldon,3, I won‰Ûªt be there.,10
49007,Scene,3, Howard and Bernadette‰Ûªs kitchen.,10
49008,Howard,3, Sorry I have to work all weekend.,10
49009,Bernadette,3, It‰Ûªs okay.,10
49010,Howard,3, Thanks again for breakfast.,10
49011,Raj,3," Well, I didn‰Ûªt get to see you last night. It was the least I could do.",10
49012,Bernadette,3, You shouldn‰Ûªt have made the alarm code his birthday.,10
49013,Raj,3," So, what should we do today?",10
49014,Bernadette,3," Oh, I appreciate it, but you don‰Ûªt have to spend your day off with me.",10
49015,Raj,3," Well, I don‰Ûªt mind. Oh, you want go to the mall and look at baby stuff?",10
49016,Bernadette,3, Not really.,10
49017,Raj,3," Oh, come on, we could share a pretzel and get sideways glances from racist old ladies.",10
49018,Bernadette,3, I get enough of that when I take Howard to my grandmother‰Ûªs for Christmas.,10
49019,Raj,3," Oh, I know, why don‰Ûªt we get started on clearing out the baby‰Ûªs room?",10
49020,Bernadette,3, Isn‰Ûªt it a little early for that?,10
49021,Raj,3, You have to get to it eventually.,10
49022,Bernadette,3," Oh, there‰Ûªs so much junk in there, it‰Ûªs embarrassing.",10
49023,Raj,3, How can you be embarrassed around me? I‰Ûªm gonna be in the room with you when you give birth.,10
49024,Bernadette,3, I don‰Ûªt think you are.,10
49025,Raj,3," You didn‰Ûªt think I was gonna be in your kitchen this morning, yet here I am.",10
49026,Scene,3," In the university, Sheldon is asleep against a vending machine.",10
49027,Voice,3," Psst, hey, kid.",10
49028,Sheldon,3," Huh, what?",10
49029,The Flash (the voice),3, You look tired. Why don‰Ûªt you have an energy drink? Everyone‰Ûªs doing it.,10
49030,Sheldon,3," Oh, no, thank you, those have caffeine in them.",10
49031,The Flash,3," Oh sorry, I thought you were cool.",10
49032,Sheldon,3," I am cool. This is Yoo-hoo, chocolate milk‰Ûªs delicious watery cousin.",10
49033,The Flash,3," All right. But if you ever want to feel like you have superpowers, try one of these.",10
49034,Sheldon,3, Superheroes take performance-enhancing chemicals?,10
49035,The Flash,3, You bet. You know why Hulk is so strong? Steroids. You know why Batman wanders around at night getting into fights? Scotch.,10
49036,Sheldon,3, I am facing a great deal of work. And I do like things better when famous people also like them.,10
49037,The Flash,3, Here. It‰Ûªs on the house.,10
49038,Sheldon,3," The first one‰Ûªs free? Flash, how do you stay in business?",10
49039,The Flash,3, You want to know my secret? I bought stock in Marvel.,10
49040,Scene,3, Bert‰Ûªs apartment.,10
49041,Amy,3," Hi, Bert. This is my friend, Penny.",10
49042,Penny,3, Hi.,10
49043,Bert,3," Hey, come on in. I‰Ûªll gonna go turn on some rock music. That‰Ûªs a geology joke. ",10
49044,Amy,3, Bert‰Ûªs a geologist. ,10
49045,Bert,3, And a joker.,10
49046,Penny,3, How early are we?,10
49047,Amy,3," Oh, actually, we‰Ûªre an hour late.",10
49048,Penny,3, I suddenly wish Sheldon was here.,10
49049,Scene,3, Howard and Bernadette‰Ûªs spare room.,10
49050,Bernadette,3, I don‰Ûªt even know where to begin.,10
49051,Raj,3," Well, in The Sound of Music, Julie Andrews says let‰Ûªs start at the very beginning, a very good place to start.",10
49052,Bernadette,3," Oh, I was gonna start at the end. Thank God you‰Ûªre here.",10
49053,Raj,3," Well, I think the first thing we should get rid of is that tone.",10
49054,Bernadette,3, Sorry. I should probably keep this in case we have a girl.,10
49055,Raj,3," Oh, that‰Ûªs a nice one. Was it yours when you were little?",10
49056,Bernadette,3, My dad built it for me.,10
49057,Raj,3," Wow, it‰Ûªs so cute.",10
49058,Bernadette,3," This was the husband and this was the wife. They‰Ûªd go out on adventures together. Cruises, skiing, horseback riding. That was really me just duct taping them to our dog.",10
49059,Raj,3," Oh, and did they have kids?",10
49060,Bernadette,3," They did, but the mommy and daddy didn‰Ûªt like them, so they shipped them off to an orphanage I made out of a shoebox.",10
49061,Raj,3," Yeah, that‰Ûªs not worrisome at all.",10
49062,Bernadette,3, Not every girl dreams about being a mom. Sometimes you think you‰Ûªre never gonna have kids and one day you wake up and you‰Ûªre pregnant. And it doesn‰Ûªt matter that your career‰Ûªs going great right now and that you and your husband never even got to go anywhere taped to a dog.,10
49063,Raj,3, I skipped spin class for this.,10
49064,Scene,3, The lab.,10
49065,Howard,3, Why is it taking him so long to get a drink out of a vending machine?,10
49066,Leonard,3," Oh, it‰Ûªs complicated. He finds pushing that little door and reaching up into the machine",10
49067,Sheldon,3," Gentlemen, I am ready to work. To quote The Martian, let‰Ûªs science the faeces out of this. That‰Ûªs The Martian the book and The Martian the movie, not Marvin the Martian. Although to quote Marvin the Martian, I claim this planet in the name of Mars.",10
49068,Leonard,3, Are you okay?,10
49069,Sheldon,3," Oh, I‰Ûªm fantastic, never been better. I had my first energy drink and I feel great. Hey, you guys want to wrestle? We can do arm, thumb, mud, sumo. Nah, we‰Ûªre not fat enough, or wearing diapers.",10
49070,Howard,3, You wanted him awake.,10
49071,Scene,3, Bert‰Ûªs apartment.,10
49072,Penny,3, So should we talk to each other or mingle?,10
49073,Amy,3, I don‰Ûªt know where everyone is.,10
49074,Penny,3," Yeah, I mean, I could see him eating one or two guests, but not a whole party.",10
49075,Bert,3," Well, I guess this is kind of a bust. You don‰Ûªt have to stay. I‰Ûªm gonna start cleaning up.",10
49076,Amy,3, Okay. I feel so bad about leaving him here.,10
49077,Penny,3," Oh, it‰Ûªs funny, I was just thinking the same thing about you.",10
49078,Bert,3," Hey, listen, could you not say anything about this to the people at the university? You know, ‰Ûªcause you‰Ûªre you and I‰Ûªm me, and it‰Ûªs kind of embarrassing.",10
49079,Penny,3," Wait, what do you mean she‰Ûªs her?",10
49080,Bert,3," Well, you know how Amy‰Ûªs the coolest girl on campus, right?",10
49081,Penny,3, No.,10
49082,Amy,3, No.,10
49083,Bert,3," Oh yeah, everybody thinks so.",10
49084,Penny,3," What? You tell me about your foot fungus, but this is a secret?",10
49085,Amy,3, I‰Ûªm sure it‰Ûªs just ‰Ûªcause I‰Ûªm dating Sheldon.,10
49086,Bert,3," Mm, actually, I think Sheldon‰Ûªs popular because he‰Ûªs dating you.",10
49087,Penny,3, Now Sheldon‰Ûªs popular? What is happening?,10
49088,Scene,3, The lab.,10
49089,Howard,3, Maybe we should break for lunch. What time is it?,10
49090,Leonard,3," According to the world‰Ûªs worst cuckoo clock, it‰Ûªs two.",10
49091,Sheldon,3, My head hurts and I‰Ûªm more tired than ever.,10
49092,Howard,3, Why don‰Ûªt you just go home?,10
49093,Sheldon,3," No, I can do this. I just, I just need another energy drink. Oh, no.",10
49094,Leonard,3, What?,10
49095,Sheldon,3, I want another one.,10
49096,Leonard,3, So?,10
49097,Sheldon,3, That‰Ûªs a craving. That‰Ûªs a sign of chemical dependency.,10
49098,Leonard,3, You only had one.,10
49099,Sheldon,3," No, I know, but plenty of things are addictive after a single exposure. I mean, crack cocaine, nicotine, Pringles. You know once one pops one just can‰Ûªt stop.",10
49100,Howard,3, You can‰Ûªt develop a problem that fast.,10
49101,Sheldon,3," You want to bet? Oh, great, now I‰Ûªm addicted to gambling.",10
49102,Leonard,3, We can‰Ûªt afford to lose any more time.,10
49103,Howard,3," Well, this probably won‰Ûªt work, but has anyone ever tried to just haul off and whup the crazy out of him?",10
49104,Leonard,3," That‰Ûªs not helpful. It‰Ûªs fun to think about, but it‰Ûªs not helpful. Hey, Sheldon, we are on a serious time crunch. We can‰Ûªt do this without you. Can you please pull it together?",10
49105,Sheldon,3," I‰Ûªm sorry. Yes, of course.",10
49106,Leonard,3, Thank you.,10
49107,Sheldon,3," Just, please, bear with me if I display symptoms of caffeine withdrawal.",10
49108,Howard,3, No worries.,10
49109,Sheldon,3, You guys stink.,10
49110,Scene,3, Howard and Bernadette‰Ûªs kitchen.,10
49111,Bernadette,3, Sorry I flipped out on you. I think it‰Ûªs just hormones.,10
49112,Raj,3," I think you were mean before you were pregnant, but it‰Ûªs fine. So, uh, instead of cleaning out the room, why don‰Ûªt we just decide on a theme for the nursery?",10
49113,Bernadette,3, Does it really need one?,10
49114,Raj,3, Of course it does. Didn‰Ûªt your baby room have a theme?,10
49115,Bernadette,3," Well, it doubled as my dad‰Ûªs office, and he was a cop, so I guess the theme was bloody homicide photos.",10
49116,Raj,3," Oh. Mine was Winnie the Pooh. But anyway, why don‰Ûªt we just take a step back and start with a colour? Right? There are so many amazing ones. Red, blue, green, purple.",10
49117,Bernadette,3, Are you just gonna name all the colours?,10
49118,Raj,3," Well, not now.",10
49119,Bernadette,3, I don‰Ûªt care what colour the room is.,10
49120,Raj,3," Okay, well, I‰Ûªm just trying to help you.",10
49121,Bernadette,3," Well, you‰Ûªre not, so just drop it. (Off) I‰Ûªm clearly upset. Why aren‰Ûªt you following me?",10
49122,Raj,3, Sorry. Sorry.,10
49123,Scene,3, Bert‰Ûªs apartment. ,10
49124,Bert,3," And when Amy started using a solution of chromic acid and white vinegar to clean all her lab equipment, all of a sudden, everybody was doing it.",10
49125,Penny,3, You trend setter.,10
49126,Amy,3, Just the right idea at the right time.,10
49127,Penny,3," Okay, okay, so Amy‰Ûªs cool, Sheldon‰Ûªs cool. Tell me about Leonard.",10
49128,Bert,3, Who?,10
49129,Penny,3, Leonard Hofstadter.,10
49130,Bert,3," Oh, him. I guess he‰Ûªs all right. Apparently he tricked some hot girl into marrying him.",10
49131,Penny,3," That‰Ûªs me, I‰Ûªm her. You know, he didn‰Ûªt trick me, he just wore me down.",10
49132,Bert,3," It makes sense you two are friends. I mean, hot girls always stick together.",10
49133,Amy,3, And you thought this wasn‰Ûªt gonna be a great party.,10
49134,Penny,3," You know, I had no idea Caltech is exactly like my high school.",10
49135,Amy,3," Well, it‰Ûªs not exactly like it. We‰Ûªre all extremely smart.",10
49136,Penny,3," Wow, you popular girls are mean.",10
49137,Scene,3, The lab.,10
49138,Leonard,3, I‰Ûªm gonna get some coffee. You want some?,10
49139,Sheldon,3," Uh, you‰Ûªre really going to have caffeine in front of me when I‰Ûªm trying to get my life back on track?",10
49140,Leonard,3," Uh, okay, let‰Ûªs pretend you do have a problem.",10
49141,Sheldon,3, I do.,10
49142,Leonard,3, You don‰Ûªt.,10
49143,Sheldon,3," Yeah, but I do.",10
49144,Leonard,3," No, you don‰Ûªt. But let‰Ûªs say you do. And don‰Ûªt say you do, because you don‰Ûªt. Now, wouldn‰Ûªt you think that throwing yourself into your work would be the best way to deal with it?",10
49145,Sheldon,3, With what?,10
49146,Leonard,3, Your problem.,10
49147,Sheldon,3, I thought I didn‰Ûªt have a problem.,10
49148,Howard,3, That was painful to watch.,10
49149,Scene,3, Bernadette‰Ûªs car.,10
49150,Raj,3, So where are we going?,10
49151,Bernadette,3, I don‰Ûªt know.,10
49152,Raj,3, Okay. How Thelma and Louise of us.,10
49153,Bernadette,3," Raj, why don‰Ûªt I care about anything?",10
49154,Raj,3, I‰Ûªm sorry?,10
49155,Bernadette,3," It‰Ûªs my baby. I, I should care about nurseries and colours, and I don‰Ûªt. What‰Ûªs wrong with me?",10
49156,Raj,3," Well, crime-scene photos near your crib spring to mind.",10
49157,Bernadette,3," I keep waiting to feel excited, but it‰Ûªs not happening. What if it never happens?",10
49158,Raj,3," Bernadette, come on, look, you‰Ûªre overthinking this, okay? You‰Ûªre gonna be an amazing mom. Even if you don‰Ûªt believe it, I know you have maternal instincts.",10
49159,Bernadette,3," Once, I was supposed to babysit my brothers. Our neighbour found them naked in the backyard eating crickets.",10
49160,Raj,3," Happy and well-fed. You see, that‰Ûªs what I‰Ûªm taking from that story.",10
49161,Scene,3, The lab. ,10
49162,Sheldon,3," Leonard, can I ask you a question?",10
49163,Leonard,3, Is it about the rotational symmetries you should be figuring out or your fake caffeine problem?,10
49164,Sheldon,3," Howard, can I ask you a question?",10
49165,Howard,3, No.,10
49166,Sheldon,3," All right, I‰Ûªll just toss this out to the room. Um, I was thinking that the best way to fight my addiction is by weaning myself off in steps. Now, I couldn‰Ûªt find a caffeine patch, but I did find what claims to be a mind-boosting caffeine suppository. You know, the interesting fact about the rectum‰Û_",10
49167,Leonard,3," Sheldon. We are dealing with an impossible deadline from the Air Force because of you. So have an energy drink, don‰Ûªt have an energy drink. Order suppositories and shove ‰Ûªem wherever you want, I don‰Ûªt care.",10
49168,Sheldon,3, You don‰Ûªt shove them. They come with an easy-glide applicator.,10
49169,Leonard,3, Right. Listen to me. We can‰Ûªt do anything until you do your part. So get up in front of this whiteboard and do it.,10
49170,Sheldon,3, I can‰Ûªt.,10
49171,Leonard,3," Yes, you can.",10
49172,Sheldon,3," No, I can‰Ûªt figure out the math. I‰Ûªve been racking my brain for days, and I‰Ûªve got nothing.",10
49173,Leonard,3, Seriously?,10
49174,Sheldon,3, I can‰Ûªt do it. I‰Ûªm not as smart as I think I am. I‰Ûªm so sorry. This is all my fault.,10
49175,Leonard,3," It‰Ûªs okay, we‰Ûªll figure something out.",10
49176,Sheldon,3, But what if we can‰Ûªt?,10
49177,Leonard,3, It‰Ûªll be fine. You‰Ûªll see. Sheldon? Buddy? (Sheldon snores),10
49178,Howard,3," When the baby gets here, you gotta teach me that.",10
49179,Amy,3," Thank you so much, Bert. This was great.",10
49180,Bert,3, My pleasure. You girls want to take home a two-gallon tub of potato salad?,10
49181,Amy,3, I think we‰Ûªre good.,10
49182,Bert,3," Okay, well, thanks for coming by. You‰Ûªre nice people.",10
49183,Penny,3," Well, so are you. In fact, you know what? We will never take you for granite. Did you get that? Granite? A little geology joke.",10
49184,Bert,3, You need to leave. I‰Ûªm in love with both of you now.,10
49185,Penny,3, Okay.,10
49186,Amy,3, Bye.,10
49187,Scene,3, Bernadette‰Ûªs car. ,10
49188,Raj,3," Uh, pull over.",10
49189,Bernadette,3," What? Why? Who are you calling? You‰Ûªre gonna rat me out to Howard, aren‰Ûªt you? You‰Ûªre such a snitch, no wonder I don‰Ûªt like you.",10
49190,Raj,3," Whoa, I‰Ûªm calling my dad, okay? He‰Ûªs got experience dealing with pregnant ladies because he‰Ûªs an OBGYN. And experience with crazy ladies because of my mom.",10
49191,Dr Koothrapalli (on facetime),3," Hello, Rajesh. Are you calling to ask for money?",10
49192,Raj,3, What? No.,10
49193,Dr Koothrapalli,3, Are you calling to ask for things that cost money?,10
49194,Raj,3, No.,10
49195,Dr Koothrapalli,3, Great. What‰Ûªs up?,10
49196,Raj,3," This is my friend, Bernadette. She‰Ûªs pregnant, and she‰Ûªs a bit worried, so I thought maybe you could talk to her.",10
49197,Dr Koothrapalli,3, Of course. What seems to be the trouble?,10
49198,Bernadette,3," Something‰Ûªs wrong. I don‰Ûªt care about any of the baby stuff every other mom is so into. Honestly, I‰Ûªm not even sure I like babies.",10
49199,Dr Koothrapalli,3," Look, some people are baby people, and some people are not baby people. It doesn‰Ûªt mean you won‰Ûªt love your own baby.",10
49200,Bernadette,3, But I thought I‰Ûªd be more excited.,10
49201,Dr Koothrapalli,3," Oh, being excited isn‰Ûªt a guarantee of anything. Rajesh‰Ûªs mother was thrilled when she was pregnant with him. After he was born, she doted on his every move. And you know what happened? He broke her heart, moved halfway around the world, and dates only poor white women. So you never know.",10
49202,Bernadette,3, Thank you. I feel better now.,10
49203,Raj,3, Well I don‰Ûªt.,10
49204,Dr Koothrapalli,3," Good. Bernadette, I hope you have a daughter.",10
49205,Scene,3, Colonel Williams‰Ûª office.,10
49206,Leonard,3," Um, I don‰Ûªt really know how to say this.",10
49207,Colonel Williams,3," Well, you could try starting with sir.",10
49208,Leonard,3," Right. Sorry, sir.",10
49209,Sheldon,3," He said start with it, not end with it.",10
49210,Leonard,3, Sir.,10
49211,Colonel Williams,3, Hmm?,10
49212,Howard,3, We‰Ûªve hit a bit of a snag. We‰Ûªre already behind schedule.,10
49213,Sheldon,3, The computations required to overcome the deployability issues are more significant than we thought.,10
49214,Leonard,3," I understand that we‰Ûªre under contract, and I don‰Ûªt know what the consequences of violating that are, but, uh, we‰Ûªre not gonna be able to deliver in the time we promised.",10
49215,Colonel Williams,3, How long do you need?,10
49216,Howard,3," We, we‰Ûªre thinking, two years.",10
49217,Colonel Williams,3, All right.,10
49218,Howard,3, That‰Ûªs it? You‰Ûªre okay with that?,10
49219,Colonel Williams,3," What, you think you‰Ûªre the first government contractor who isn‰Ûªt gonna deliver on time? We‰Ûªre still waiting for a big space laser Reagan ordered to beat the commies.",10
49220,Leonard,3," Thanks for understanding, sir.",10
49221,Howard,3," Yes, thank you so much.",10
49222,Sheldon,3," We, we really appreciate it.",10
49223,Leonard (off),3," All right, pressure‰Ûªs off",10
49224,Howard (off),3, Wanna see a movie?,10
49225,Sheldon (off),3, Popcorn‰Ûªs on me.,10
49226,Scene,4, The foyer.,10
49227,Amy,4," And there was water everywhere, it was such a mess.",10
49228,Leonard,4, That stinks. How long are you out of the apartment?,10
49229,Amy,4, About five weeks.,10
49230,Penny,4," Ugh, did you lose anything valuable?",10
49231,Amy,4," Well, the pipe was over my closet, so all my clothes are gone.",10
49232,Penny,4," Oh, so nothing. Great. Do they know why the pipe burst?",10
49233,Amy,4, They didn‰Ûªt say.,10
49234,Leonard,4, Buildings that have a combination of copper and galvanized steel are susceptible to pinholes and corrosion caused by the mobility of ions in the water. Can‰Ûªt have your head shoved in a toilet as much as I did and not pick up a few things about plumbing.,10
49235,Penny,4," Well, if you need a place to crash, you can stay with us.",10
49236,Amy,4, Really?,10
49237,Penny,4," Of course. You can stay in Leonard‰Ûªs room, and we‰Ûªll stay at my place.",10
49238,Amy,4, You‰Ûªre sure that‰Ûªs not an inconvenience?,10
49239,Penny,4," No, not at all.",10
49240,Leonard,4," And we live with Sheldon, so the word inconvenience has really lost all meaning.",10
49241,Amy,4," So, technically, I‰Ûªd be moving in with my boyfriend?",10
49242,Penny,4, I guess so. And I‰Ûªd finally get to live alone with my husband.,10
49243,Amy,4," Oh, my, this is a big step.",10
49244,Leonard,4," Mm-hmm. For two of us, it‰Ûªs in the right direction.",10
49245,Sheldon,4, Why are you all smiling like crazy people?,10
49246,Scene,4, The apartment. ,10
49247,Sheldon,4, Cohabitation with my girlfriend? That‰Ûªs a great deal to process.,10
49248,Leonard,4, It‰Ûªs only for five weeks.,10
49249,Penny,4," Yeah, and we‰Ûªll be right across the hall.",10
49250,Amy,4, What do you think?,10
49251,Sheldon,4, I don‰Ûªt know. What if living together kills the romance?,10
49252,Penny,4," Okay, you guys had sex one whole time. Nothing can put out a fire like that.",10
49253,Sheldon,4," Yeah, but what happens when we each get a peek behind the curtain? I mean, she‰Ûªs never even seen me unshaven.",10
49254,Leonard,4, You just shaved yesterday. You‰Ûªre good for three months.,10
49255,Amy,4," Sheldon, I understand your apprehension, but let me appeal to the scientist in you. Given the five-week end date, isn‰Ûªt it the perfect opportunity to consider this an experiment and collect data on our compatibility?",10
49256,Sheldon,4, Don‰Ûªt try luring me in with sexy talk.,10
49257,Leonard,4," Okay. Star Trek, the original series, the Enterprise was on a five-year mission to explore new worlds. Think of this as your personal five-week mission to do the same.",10
49258,Sheldon,4," If you want to lure me in with sexy talk, that‰Ûªs how you do it.",10
49259,Penny,4, Don‰Ûªt be proud of that.,10
49260,Amy,4," So, is that a yes?",10
49261,Sheldon,4," Not yet. How will I learn if I‰Ûªm comfortable living with Amy or just comfortable because I‰Ûªm in my own apartment? Now, if this experiment is going to be valid, I suggest a neutral environment.",10
49262,Penny,4," Well, where would you go?",10
49263,Sheldon,4," Well, ideally, an enclosed, self-sustaining biodome in New Mexico, where we would eat crops fertilized with our own waste. ",10
49264,Penny,4," Wait. Why don‰Ûªt you guys stay across the hall, and we will live here?",10
49265,Sheldon,4," Interesting. If my official residence were across the hall, I wonder if I‰Ûªd need to knock every time I came over here.",10
49266,Leonard,4, That‰Ûªs a good question. Maybe just don‰Ûªt come over.,10
49267,Sheldon,4," Historically, I don‰Ûªt do well with change.",10
49268,Penny,4," Okay, it won‰Ûªt be that bad. We wouldn‰Ûªt even sit in your spot while you‰Ûªre gone.",10
49269,Sheldon,4," You‰Ûªre darn right, you wouldn‰Ûªt. No matter where I am, this will always be my spot. Like an embassy in a foreign country, this seat is the sovereign soil of my bottom.",10
49270,Leonard,4, Just nod and smile. He‰Ûªs almost gone.,10
49271,Amy,4," Sheldon, what do you think?",10
49272,Sheldon,4, Very well. I‰Ûªm on board.,10
49273,Amy,4, Seriously?,10
49274,Sheldon,4, Yes. I accept this five-week mission to share a living space with my girlfriend.,10
49275,Amy,4, Oh. This is so exciting.,10
49276,Sheldon,4," Well, now, don‰Ûªt be surprised if, like Star Trek, it‰Ûªs cancelled in three.",10
49277,Scene,4, Howard and Bernadette‰Ûªs kitchen.,10
49278,Raj,4," I have to say, I am happy with your OBGYN.",10
49279,Howard,4, Cool. ‰Û÷Cause she says you‰Ûªre doing a great job as weird friend who doesn‰Ûªt have to be at every appointment.,10
49280,Raj,4, I‰Ûªm the son of a gynaecologist. I could be helpful. ,10
49281,Bernadette,4, It would help if you stopped telling me I have a textbook cervix.,10
49282,Raj,4," The polite response is, thank you for noticing.",10
49283,Bernadette,4," Let me see the sonogram again. Oh, yeah, that‰Ûªs a good-looking baby for a little grey blob.",10
49284,Howard,4," Yeah, we could name him Blobert.",10
49285,Bernadette,4, What if it‰Ûªs a girl?,10
49286,Howard,4, Bloberta. Or Blobbi with an I.,10
49287,Bernadette,4, Are we being silly not finding out the sex?,10
49288,Howard,4," Yeah, I was just thinking the same thing.",10
49289,Raj,4," If you want, you can find out right now.",10
49290,Howard,4, Mm.,10
49291,Bernadette,4," Hmm. The doctor‰Ûªs gone for the day, so it doesn‰Ûªt matter.",10
49292,Raj,4," Well, somebody else knows because they saw it in the folder.",10
49293,Bernadette,4, You looked in our folder?!,10
49294,Raj,4, It was an accident. The doctor left the folder out on her desk. It‰Ûªs not my fault I opened it and looked.,10
49295,Howard,4," So you know the sex of our baby, and we don‰Ûªt?",10
49296,Raj,4, Flip a coin. You got a fifty-fifty shot.,10
49297,Howard,4, It‰Ûªs unbelievable.,10
49298,Bernadette,4," God, Raj.",10
49299,Raj,4," What? This is not a problem, okay? If you don‰Ûªt want to know, I don‰Ûªt have to tell you.",10
49300,Bernadette,4, We don‰Ûªt want you to know.,10
49301,Raj,4," Okay, well, that‰Ûªs a problem.",10
49302,Scene,4, Penny‰Ûªs apartment.,10
49303,Penny,4," You know, I‰Ûªm very proud of you for trying to live with Amy.",10
49304,Sheldon,4, Oh. Thank you.,10
49305,Penny,4, Mm. ,10
49306,Sheldon,4," Of course, the ideal way to conduct this experiment would be with four pairs of identical Sheldons and Amys. One pair that was neither dating nor living together. One pair that was dating but not living together. One pair that was living together but not dating. And then, of course, one pair that was living together and dating. Although, with that many Sheldons, it‰Ûªd be such a party, we‰Ûªd never get anything done.",10
49307,Penny,4," That was a cute story. So, um, what did you want to ask me?",10
49308,Sheldon,4," Well, you‰Ûªve lived with your significant other for some time. I would like this experiment to go well. Are there any insights you can share?",10
49309,Penny,4," Mm. Well, the biggie is, if she has an insane roommate, kick him out as soon as possible.",10
49310,Sheldon,4," You know, Leonard and I were very happy before you came along.",10
49311,Scene,4, The apartment. ,10
49312,Amy,4, You‰Ûªve been roommates with Sheldon forever. Do you have any advice?,10
49313,Leonard,4, I‰Ûªm trying to think of an answer that won‰Ûªt stop you from doing this. ,10
49314,Penny,4," I know it sounds like a clichÌ©, but compromise is key. ",10
49315,Leonard,4," Never leave a belt on the floor. At night, they look like snakes.",10
49316,Penny,4," Do little things, like bring her a cup of coffee in bed.",10
49317,Leonard,4, Keep M&M‰ÛªS in your pocket in case you have to wait in a long line.,10
49318,Penny,4," You‰Ûªre gonna be seeing each other a lot, so respect each other‰Ûªs personal space.",10
49319,Leonard,4," He startles easily, so, please, no flash photography.",10
49320,Scene,4, Sheldon‰Ûªs bedroom.,10
49321,Sheldon,4, How many pairs of underwear did you pack for the move?,10
49322,Amy,4, I don‰Ûªt know. I didn‰Ûªt count.,10
49323,Sheldon,4, You truly are the Goofus to my Gallant.,10
49324,Amy,4," That‰Ûªs me. Listen, you and I are gonna be sharing a bed. You know, this is uncharted territory for both of us. How are you feeling about that?",10
49325,Sheldon,4," Oh, excited, concerned, a little scared. All the same emotions I feel in line at Space Mountain.",10
49326,Amy,4," Well, if you‰Ûªre nervous about the sleeping arrangements, maybe we should talk about it.",10
49327,Sheldon,4, Okay. Talk.,10
49328,Amy,4," Well, I imagine one of your concerns might be coital expectations. ",10
49329,Sheldon,4," Wow, no foreplay or anything, just right to it. ",10
49330,Amy,4," Look, I know this experiment is a big step outside of your comfort zone. So why don‰Ûªt we take being physical off the table and maybe later on, once we‰Ûªre more settled in, we can revisit it.",10
49331,Sheldon,4, You‰Ûªre really okay with that?,10
49332,Amy,4," I‰Ûªve never lived with someone, either. This is a lot for me, too.",10
49333,Sheldon,4," This is such a relief. Honestly, if it didn‰Ûªt get you all worked up, I‰Ûªd kiss you right now.",10
49334,Amy,4, Good call. Seeing your Teen Titans underwear really got my motor running.,10
49335,Sheldon,4, I know. They probably shouldn‰Ûªt sell those to children.,10
49336,Scene,4, The hallway.,10
49337,Penny,4," Well, here‰Ûªs your key.",10
49338,Amy,4, Thank you.,10
49339,Sheldon,4, Enjoy having the place to yourselves.,10
49340,Leonard,4, You enjoy your mission to boldly go where no man has gone before.,10
49341,Sheldon,4, It‰Ûªs Penny‰Ûªs bedroom. Plenty of men have gone before.,10
49342,Penny,4," Now, now, there‰Ûªs no need to make this emotional.",10
49343,Amy,4, Shall we?,10
49344,Sheldon,4, I guess this is it.,10
49345,Leonard,4, You guys have fun.,10
49346,Sheldon,4," You, too. Oh, don‰Ûªt forget. Tuesday the air filters need to be changed.",10
49347,Penny,4," Yeah, you wrote it on my hand.",10
49348,Sheldon,4," Oh. Oh, and every other day, check the water level on the avocado pit.",10
49349,Leonard,4," I‰Ûªm on it. 15 years from now, we‰Ûªll make guacamole together.",10
49350,Sheldon,4," Leonard, please, let me go.",10
49351,Amy,4," Come on, Sheldon.",10
49352,Sheldon,4, Oh. Bye.,10
49353,Leonard,4, Good night.,10
49354,Penny,4, Good night.,10
49355,Amy,4," Well, that‰Ûªs it. For the next five weeks, we are officially living together.",10
49356,Sheldon,4, I guess the experiment begins.,10
49357,"Penny (off, screaming)",4," Wa-how, we did it.",10
49358,"Leonard (off, also screaming)",4, Yeah.,10
49359,Scene,4, Penny‰Ûªs bedroom.,10
49360,Sheldon,4, Which side of the bed would you prefer?,10
49361,Amy,4, Doesn‰Ûªt matter to me. Your choice.,10
49362,Sheldon,4," No, no, we‰Ûªre living together now, everything‰Ûªs equal. You know? I know that I have a tendency to be controlling, so I would rather you choose.",10
49363,Amy,4," Well, Sheldon, I really appreciate that, but these things mean more to you than they do to me, so whatever you want.",10
49364,Sheldon,4," Well, clearly, it‰Ûªs not whatever I want, because what I want is for you to make this decision, and you refuse to do that.",10
49365,Amy,4," Well, I‰Ûªm not refusing. I‰Ûªm just trying to be considerate.",10
49366,Sheldon,4," Like when you let me get those shoes with the wheels on the bottom, and then watched me roll right into traffic?",10
49367,Amy,4," Sheldon, will you please just pick a side?",10
49368,Sheldon,4," Fine. Okay. Now, on this side, I am closer to the exit in case of emergency.",10
49369,Amy,4, Great. That‰Ûªs your side.,10
49370,Sheldon,4," No, but I‰Ûªm also closer to the entrance in case of attack.",10
49371,Amy,4," Okay, I‰Ûªll take that side.",10
49372,Sheldon,4," Ah, then again, what are the odds of someone attacking me?",10
49373,Amy,4, Rising rapidly.,10
49374,Sheldon,4," Now, this side offers me proximity to the bathroom, but I am closer to the window where perverts can watch me sleep.",10
49375,Amy,4, Okay. What if we do this?,10
49376,Sheldon,4, I suppose that works.,10
49377,Amy,4, Great.,10
49378,Sheldon,4, Although now I‰Ûªm kind of worried someone‰Ûªs hiding behind those drapes.,10
49379,Scene,4, Howard and Bernadette‰Ûªs bedroom. ,10
49380,Bernadette,4," This is ridiculous. The doctor knows what the baby is, the ultrasound tech knows, Raj knows, his Grey‰Ûªs Anatomy online fan group probably knows. Is it weird we don‰Ûªt?",10
49381,Howard,4, I don‰Ûªt know. Maybe the surprise will make it more fun. Like magic tricks. Remember how disappointed you were when I explained the never-ending hanky?,10
49382,Bernadette,4, I was disappointed to see the man I was engaged to pulling rainbow scarves out of his fly.,10
49383,Howard,4, But how delightful was it when I pulled out a bouquet at the end of those scarves? It‰Ûªll be the same thing when the doctor pulls a beautiful surprise out of you.,10
49384,Bernadette,4, Everyone said I could do better.,10
49385,Howard,4," But you didn‰Ûªt listen, and presto change-o, my baby‰Ûªs inside you. Ta-da.",10
49386,Scene,4, Penny‰Ûªs bedroom.,10
49387,Amy (off),4, Ugh. What is that? (Entering) Why did you switch sides?,10
49388,Sheldon,4, Be grateful I‰Ûªm still in the room.,10
49389,Amy,4, Comfy?,10
49390,Sheldon,4," Oh, I‰Ûªm just happy I don‰Ûªt know what this memory foam remembers.",10
49391,Amy,4," Sheldon? I know we took coitus off the table, but I was wondering how you feel about other forms of intimacy, such as snuggling.",10
49392,Sheldon,4," Well, it‰Ûªs funny you should ask, because I was wondering how you‰Ûªd feel about separating the two of us with a pillow wall.",10
49393,Amy,4," Sheldon, I‰Ûªve made more than enough accommodations for you. We‰Ûªre both grown adults, we‰Ûªve been far more intimate than this. If you don‰Ûªt want to snuggle, fine, but we‰Ûªre not building a pillow wall.",10
49394,Sheldon,4," Okay, well, I am sorry. I‰Ûªm just worried that my sensitivity to temperature could make this a rough night. And no offence, but your bottom radiates enough heat, I‰Ûªm surprised there aren‰Ûªt iguanas lying on it.",10
49395,Scene,4, The apartment. ,10
49396,Leonard,4," That‰Ûªs it. It‰Ûªs Sheldon‰Ûªs bedtime, he is in for the night.",10
49397,Penny,4, Wow. I cannot believe we are alone in our own apartment.,10
49398,Leonard,4," It‰Ûªs weird. This must be how parents feel when their kid goes off to college. Unless they feel sad, then it‰Ûªs different.",10
49399,Penny,4," So, what do you want to do?",10
49400,Leonard,4, I know exactly what we are gonna do.,10
49401,Penny,4," Really? You‰Ûªre a genius, and that‰Ûªs the first thing you come up with?",10
49402,Leonard,4," Hey, Sheldon‰Ûªs not here, so we are going to put on music and dance in our underwear.",10
49403,Penny,4, Ugh. Can we just have sex?,10
49404,Leonard,4," Oh, don‰Ûªt worry. Once you see my sweet moves, sex is inevitable.",10
49405,Penny,4," Inevitable, you say?",10
49406,Leonard,4, I‰Ûªll just let my hips do the talkin‰Ûª.,10
49407,Scene,4, Howard and Bernadette‰Ûªs bedroom.,10
49408,Howard,4, Screw it. I‰Ûªm calling and finding out.,10
49409,Bernadette,4," Good. Call him. Wait, I‰Ûªm not sure I want to know.",10
49410,Howard,4, But you just said you wanted to know.,10
49411,Bernadette,4," Well, now I don‰Ûªt know if I want to know!",10
49412,Raj,4, Hello?,10
49413,Howard,4, Call you back.,10
49414,Scene,4, Penny‰Ûªs bedroom.,10
49415,Sheldon,4," No, Dr. Feynman. If I solve it for you, you‰Ûªll never learn.",10
49416,Scene,4, The apartment. ,10
49417,Penny,4," Wow, where did you learn these moves?",10
49418,Leonard,4," The world may have forgotten about Dance Dance Revolution, but not this smooth criminal.",10
49419,Scene,4, Howard and Bernadette‰Ûªs bedroom.,10
49420,Howard,4," Okay, you‰Ûªre positive you want to know?",10
49421,Bernadette,4, Yes.,10
49422,Howard,4, Okay. Here we go. It‰Ûªs ringing.,10
49423,Raj,4, Hello?,10
49424,Bernadette,4, Wait.,10
49425,Howard,4, Wrong number.,10
49426,Scene,4, The apartment.,10
49427,Penny,4, I told you not to do the worm.,10
49428,Leonard,4, You were right. ,10
49429,Scene,4, Raj‰Ûªs bedroom. Phone rings.,10
49430,Raj,4, Hello.,10
49431,Bernadette (off),4," I changed my mind, hang up, hang up.",10
49432,Scene,4, Penny‰Ûªs bedroom.,10
49433,Amy,4," Oh, oh, oh.",10
49434,Sheldon,4, What are you doing down there?,10
49435,Amy,4, Hang on.,10
49436,Sheldon,4, Who are you calling? Aaargh!,10
49437,Scene,4, The apartment. ,10
49438,Amy,4, I‰Ûªm so sore. I don‰Ûªt think I slept two minutes last night.,10
49439,Penny,4," Yeah, get it, girl.",10
49440,Amy,4, It‰Ûªs not what you think.,10
49441,Leonard,4, I feel like I pulled something. Why didn‰Ûªt you tell me to stop?,10
49442,Penny,4, Even more not what you think.,10
49443,Amy,4, I don‰Ûªt know if I can make it through five weeks living with him.,10
49444,Leonard,4," If you ever need a break, the owner of the train store will let you leave him there while you get a coffee.",10
49445,Penny,4, Yeah.,10
49446,Sheldon,4," Good morning. See? I didn‰Ûªt knock, but it‰Ûªs fine. I didn‰Ûªt knock, but it‰Ûªs fine. I didn‰Ûªt knock, but it‰Ûªs fine. So, how is everyone?",10
49447,Amy,4, Miserable and exhausted.,10
49448,Sheldon,4, Really? I slept great.,10
49449,Amy,4," Well, I didn‰Ûªt, and it‰Ûªs your fault.",10
49450,Sheldon,4, How? You had the whole floor to yourself.,10
49451,Amy,4," Sheldon, maybe living together is a bad idea.",10
49452,Sheldon,4," Well, but what kind of scientists would we be, drawing a conclusion after only 12 hours of data?",10
49453,Amy,4, The kind who almost put a pillow over your face last night.,10
49454,Sheldon,4," Wow. I anticipated we‰Ûªd have problems, but I never thought your scientific rigour would be one of them.",10
49455,Amy,4," I‰Ûªm sorry, are you questioning my integrity as a scientist?",10
49456,Sheldon,4, If the lab room disposable shoe cover fits.,10
49457,Penny,4, Was that a science diss?,10
49458,Leonard,4, Yeah.,10
49459,Penny,4, Was it a good one?,10
49460,Leonard,4, Eh.,10
49461,Penny,4, Oh.,10
49462,Amy,4," What would a theoretical physicist understand about an experiment anyway? I mean, you wouldn‰Ûªt know a confounding variable if two of them hit you in the face at the same time. And you don‰Ûªt even get that joke, ‰Ûªcause you don‰Ûªt even work with confounding variables.",10
49463,Sheldon,4, How dare you?,10
49464,Amy,4," Oh, you heard me. Your experimental bona fides are laughable.",10
49465,Sheldon,4," Whoa, whoa! Now you‰Ûªre making fun of my bona fides?",10
49466,Amy,4, Can‰Ûªt make fun of something that‰Ûªs a null set.,10
49467,Penny,4, I feel like I should say damn.,10
49468,Leonard,4, Do it.,10
49469,Penny,4, Damn. ,10
49470,Sheldon,4," Well, if you are so protective of the scientific method, perhaps we should use the next five weeks to finish what we started.",10
49471,Amy,4," Well, for science, maybe I will.",10
49472,Sheldon,4," For science, maybe you should.",10
49473,Amy,4, Fine.,10
49474,Sheldon,4, Fine.,10
49475,Amy,4, Good.,10
49476,Sheldon,4, Great.,10
49477,Amy,4, Do you want to go to our place and make out?,10
49478,Sheldon,4, Does Stephen Hawking roll through the quad?,10
49479,Penny,4, The new neighbours are weird.,10
