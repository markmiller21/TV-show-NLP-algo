1,2,"Morty: I know how to vacuum Mom and Dad, Summer, I've been doing it for six months!"
1,2,
1,2,Summer: Then you've been doing it wrong for six months. Oh my god is that mildew?
1,2,
1,2,Morty: It's not my fault we froze time on a humid day!

1,2,
1,2,Summer: A competent one.
1,2,
1,2,Rick: Who cares about the *belch* thing you guys are talking about. The whole point of freezing time is to stop giving a f***. Put a shirt on your dumb dad and let's get this dumb universe rolling. Let's do this thing.
1,2,
1,2,(Morty puts shirt on Jerry backwards.)
1,2,
1,2,"Rick: Alright, listen you two, we froze time for a pretty long time, so when I unfreeze it, the world's time is gonna be fine, but our time's gonna need a little time to, you know, stabilize."
1,2,
1,2,Morty: Our time is gonna be unstable? What does that even mean?
1,2,
1,2,"Rick: It means relax and stop being a pussy, Morty. I thought you learned that by now. It also means don't touch your parents or we could shatter into countless theoretical shards."

1,2,
1,2,Morty: W-We just missed you a lot.
1,2,

1,2,(Rick motions Summer and Morty behind him.)
1,2,
1,2,"Rick: Yeah it would literally destroy them. Now listen, why do—why do—why—why don't you guys go get a free sunday ice cream, (Rick puts a rubber band around a rolled up wad of cash) go out there and get some ice creams. Here's five hundred dollars cash in unmarked moneys. I'm just gonna put it on the floor and uh, kick it on over to ya. You guys go nuts."
1,2,
1,2,"Jerry: This better not be a bribe. If I find a single thing out of place in this house, my love of ice cream won't save you. I'll get my jacket."

1,2,
1,2,All Ricks: Our time is fractured. You two somehow created a feedback loop of uncertainty that's split our reality into two equally possible impossiblities. W-we're exactly like a man capable of sustaining a platonic friendship with an attractive female co-worker. We're entirely hypothetical.

2,1,"Rick: Yeah, well, since when are we taking this guy's advice on anything?"
2,1,"Morty: Hey, you know what? You got a really good point there, Rick. Like, if the truth was that we could hide, it's not like he'd be sharing that information with us, you know? I-I-I think it's a good idea, Rick."
