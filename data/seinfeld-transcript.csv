      [Scene",1, Comedy club]
1,[Scene,1," Pete's luncheonette. Jerry and George are sitting at a 
              table.]"
2,GEORGE,1, Are you through? [kind of irritated]
3,JERRY,1," You do of course try on, when you buy?"
4,GEORGE,1," Yes, it was purple, I liked it, I don't actually recall 
              considering the buttons."
5,JERRY,1," Oh, you don't recall?"
6,GEORGE,1," [pretends he's talking into a microphone] Uh, no, not at 
              this time."
7,JERRY,1," Well, senator, I just like to know, what you knew and when 
              you knew it. [a waitress approaches the table]"
8,WAITRESS,1," Mister Seinfeld. [she pours coffee in his cup] Mister 
              Costanza. [she wants to pour coffee, but George stops her]"
9,GEORGE,1," Are, are you sure this is decaf? Where's the orange indicator?"
10,JERRY,1," Can you relax, it's a cup of coffee, Claire is a professional 
              waitress."
11,GEORGE,1, How come you're not doin' the second show tomorrow?
12,JERRY,1," Well, there's this uh, woman might be comin' in."
13,GEORGE,1," Wait a second, wait a second, what coming in, what woman 
              is coming in?"
14,JERRY,1," I told you about Laura, the girl I met in Michigan?"
15,GEORGE,1," No, you didn't!"
16,JERRY,1," I thought I told you about it, yes, she teaches political 
              science? I met her the night I did the show in Lansing...[looks 
              in the milk can] There's no milk in here, what..."
17,GEORGE,1," Wait wait wait, what is she, [takes the milk can from Jerry 
              and puts it on the table] what is she like?"
18,JERRY,1," Oh, she's really great. I mean, she's got like a real warmth 
              about her and she's really bright and really pretty and uh...the 
              conversation though, I mean, it was...talking with her is like talking 
              with you, but, ya know, obviously much better."
19,GEORGE,1," [with a big smile] So, ya know, what, what happened?"
20,JERRY,1," Oh, nothing happened, ya know, but is was great."
21,GEORGE,1," Oh, nothing happened, but it was..."
22,JERRY,1, Yeah.
23,GEORGE,1, This is great!
24,JERRY,1, Yeah.
25,GEORGE,1," So, ya know, she calls and says she wants to go out with 
              you tomorrow night? God bless! Devil you!"
26,JERRY,1," Yeah, well...not exactly. I mean, she said, you know, she 
              called this morning and said she had to come in for a seminar and 
              maybe we'll get together. "
27,GEORGE,1," [whistles disapproving] Ho ho ho, ""Had to""? ""Had 
              to come in""?"
28,JERRY,1," Yeah, but..."
29,GEORGE,1," ""Had to come in"" and ""maybe we'll get together""? 
              ""Had to"" and ""Maybe""?"
30,JERRY,1, Yeah!
31,JERRY,1," [indignant] What, are you serious...why, why did she call?"
32,GEORGE,1," How do I know, maybe, ya know, maybe she wanted to be polite. 
            "
33,JERRY,1, To be polite? You are insane!
34,GEORGE,1," All right, all right, I didn't want to tell you this, you 
              wanna know why she called you?"
35,JERRY,1, Yes!
36,GEORGE,1," You're a back-up, you're a second-line, a just-in-case, 
              a B-plan of contingency!"
37,JERRY,1," Oh, I get it, this is about the button."
38,GEORGE,1," [The waitress(Claire) passes the table; George stops her 
              and writes something on his note-block] Claire, Claire, you're a 
              woman, right?"
39,CLAIRE,1," What gave it away, George?"
40,GEORGE,1," Uhm...I'd like to ask you...ask you to analyze a hypothetical 
              phone call, ya know, from a female point of view."
41,JERRY,1," [to George] Oh, come on now, what are you asking her? Now, 
              how is she gonna know?"
42,GEORGE,1," [to Claire] Now, a woman calls me, all right? She says 
              she has to [makes some gestures to accent ""has to""] come 
              to New York on business..."
43,JERRY,1, Oh you are beautiful! [ironically] 
44,GEORGE,1," and, and maybe [again some gestures] she'll see me when 
              she gets there, does this woman intend to spend time with me?"
45,GEORGE,1, [to Claire] So why did she call?
46,CLAIRE,1, To be polite.
47,GEORGE,1," To be polite, I rest my case."
48,JERRY,1," Good. Did you have fun? You have no idea, what you're talking 
              about, now, come on, come with me [stands up], I, I gotta go get 
              my stuff out of the dryer anyway."
49,GEORGE,1, I'm not gonna watch you do laundry.
50,JERRY,1," Oh, come on, be a ""come-with-guy""."
51,GEORGE,1," Come on, I'm tired."
52,GEORGE,1," [takes off his glasses and rubs his eyes; panics] Right, 
              I knew I felt something...! [Jerry is laughing, Claire walks away 
              with a smile]"
53,[Scene,1," Laundry. Jerry and George are there; George is staring 
              at one of the dryers]"
54,GEORGE,1," I need a break, Jerry, ya know, I gotta get out of the 
              city, I feel so cramped..."
55,JERRY,1, And you didn't even hear how she sounded.
56,GEORGE,1, What?!
57,JERRY,1, Laura.
58,JERRY,1," Yeah, but how could you be so sure?"
59,GEORGE,1," [gets up] 'Cause it's signals, Jerry [starts snapping his 
              fingers], it's signals! Don't you....all right. Did she even ask 
              you, what you were doin' tomorrow night, if you were busy?"
60,JERRY,1, No.
61,GEORGE,1," She calls you today and she doesn't make a plan for tomorrow? 
              What is that? It's Saturday night!"
62,JERRY,1, Yeah.
63,GEORGE,1," What is that? It's ridiculous! [Jerry bobs agreeingly] 
              You don't even know, what hotel she's staying at, you can't call 
              her. That's a signal, Jerry, that's a signal! [snaps his fingers 
              again] Signal!"
64,JERRY,1, Maybe you're right.
65,GEORGE,1, Maybe I'm right? Of course I'm right.
66,JERRY,1," This is insane. You know, I don't even know where she's 
              staying! She, she's not gonna call me, this is unbelievable."
67,GEORGE,1," [puts an arm around Jerry and whispers] I know, I know. 
              [normal voice] Listen, your stuff has to be done by know, why don't 
              you just see if it's dried?"
68,JERRY,1," No no no, don't interrupt the cycle. The machine is working, 
              it, it knows what it's doing, just let it finish."
69,GEORGE,1," You're gonna ""overdry"" it."
70,JERRY,1," You, you can't ""overdry""."
71,GEORGE,1, Why not?
72,GEORGE,1," [looks at the other persons in the laundry and says to 
              them pointing to Jerry] Any questions?"
73,[Scene,1, Comedy club]
74,[Scene,1, Jerry's apartment. Jerry is watching TV]
75,KRAMER,1, [enters] Are you up?
76,JERRY,1," [To Kramer] Yeah...[in the phone] Yeah, people do move! 
              Have you ever seen the big trucks out on the street? Yeah, no problem 
              [hangs up the phone]."
77,KRAMER,1," Boy, the Mets blew it tonight, huh? "
78,JERRY,1," [upset] Ooohhhh, what are you doing? Kramer, it's a tape! 
              [actually I can't understand the name; maybe ""Kramer"" 
              wasn't named ""Kramer"" in the pilot!] I taped the game, 
              it's one o'clock in the morning! I avoided human contact all night 
              to watch this."
79,KRAMER,1," Hey, I'm sorry, I...ya know, I, I thought you knew...[takes 
              two loaves of bread out of his pockets] You got any meat?"
80,JERRY,1," [a little irritated] Meat? I don't, I don't know, go...hunt! 
              [Kramer walks to the refrigerator and sticks his head in] Well what, 
              what happened in the game anyway?"
81,KRAMER,1," [still with his head in the refrigerator] What happened? 
              Well, they STUNK, that's what happened! [takes some meat from the 
              refrigerator and closes it] Ya know, I almost wound up going to 
              that game."
82,JERRY,1," [cynical] Yeah you almost went to the game. You haven't 
              been out of the building in ten years!"
83,JERRY,1, No.
84,KRAMER,1," [glues the article back with his own saliva and puts the 
              magazine back on the table] When you're done, let me know."
85,JERRY,1," Yeah, yeah...you can have it tomorrow."
86,KRAMER,1, I thought I wasn't allowed to be in here this weekend.
87,JERRY,1," No, it's OK now, that, that girl is not comin' uh, I, I 
              misread the whole thing."
88,KRAMER,1, You want me to talk to her?
89,JERRY,1, I don't think so.
90,KRAMER,1," Oh, I can be very persuasive. Do you know that I was almost... 
              a lawyer. [shows with his fingers how close it was]"
91,JERRY,1," That close, huh?"
92,KRAMER,1," You better believe it. [The phone rings. Jerry picks it 
              up]"
93,JERRY,1," Hello...Oh, hi, Laura."
94,KRAMER,1, Give me it...let me talk to her [continues this way].
95,JERRY,1," [gestures Kramer to shut up] No believe me, I'm always up 
              at this hour. How are you?...great...sure...What time does the plane 
              get in?...I got my friend George to take me...[Kramer suddenly notices 
              something in the Mets-game on TV]..."
96,KRAMER,1, A SLIDE!...Wow!
97,[Scene,1," Jerry's apartment. Jerry and George enter, lifting a heavy 
              mattress]"
98,JERRY,1," If my father was moving this he'd had to have a cigarette 
              in his mouth the whole way. [talks from now on like he has a cigarette 
              in his mouth] Have you got your end?...Your end's got to come down 
              first, easy now, drop it down...drop it down, your end's got to 
              come down."
99,GEORGE,1," Ya know, I can't believe you're bringin' in an extra bed 
              for woman, that wants to sleep with you. Why don't you bring in 
              an extra guy too? [sits down]"
100,JERRY,1," [hands George a beer] Look, it's a very awkward situation, 
              I, I don't wanna be presumptuous."
101,GEORGE,1," All right, all right, one more time, one more time! What 
              was the EXACT phrasing of the request?"
102,JERRY,1," All right, she said she couldn't find a decent hotel- room..."
103,GEORGE,1, A decent hotel-room...
104,JERRY,1," Yeah, a decent hotel-room, would it be terribly inconvenient 
              if she stayed at my place."
105,JERRY,1," [cynical] This is the signal. Thank you, mister Signal, 
              where were you yesterday?"
106,GEORGE,1," I think I was affected by the caffeine. [suddenly a dog 
              enters the apartment and jumps George at the couch] HO, HO, HO, 
              GOOD DOG [etc.]"
107,KRAMER,1," [walks in behind the dog and closes the door] He really 
              likes you, George."
108,GEORGE,1," [ironically] Well, that's flattering. "
109,KRAMER,1," [the dog runs to the bathroom and apparently starts drinking 
              from the toilet] Oh, he's getting' a drink of water. [sees the mattress 
              on the floor] Is this for that girl?"
110,JERRY,1, Yeah.
111,KRAMER,1, Why even give her an option?
112,GEORGE,1," Right, can we go? 'Cause I'm double-parked, I'm gonna get 
              a ticket."
113,JERRY,1," Yeah, OK. Oh, wait a second. Oh, I, I forgot to clean the 
              bathroom."
114,GEORGE,1, So what? That's good.
115,JERRY,1," Now, how could that be good?"
116,JERRY,1, This is how you operate?
117,GEORGE,1," Yeah, I wish."
118,JERRY,1, Let me just wipe the sink.
119,KRAMER,1," [stands up from the couch and yells.] WHY EVEN GIVE HER 
              AN OPTION FOR? [Jerry walks to the bathroom and closes the door; 
              to George, while pointing to the mattress] It's unbelievable."
120,GEORGE,1, Yeah.
121,KRAMER,1, ...How's the real estate-business?
122,GEORGE,1,"...[surprised he asked] It's uh, not bad, it's comin' along...Why? 
              Did you need something."
123,KRAMER,1, Do you handle any of that commercial...real estate?
124,GEORGE,1," Well, I might be getting in to that."
125,KRAMER,1, [slaps George on the arm] You keep me posted!
126,GEORGE,1," I'm aware of you, all right, let's go [opens the bathroom 
              door], let's go! [Jerry and the dog come out] You're on stage in 
              25 minutes."
127,[Scene,1, Comedy club.]
128,[Scene,1, Airport. Jerry and George are waiting for Laura]
129,JERRY,1," Wouldn't it be great if you could ask a woman what she's 
              thinking?"
130,GEORGE,1," What a world that would be, if you just could ask a woman 
              what she's thinkin'."
131,GEORGE,1," Listen, listen, don't get worked up, 'cause you're gonna 
              know the whole story the minute she steps off the plane."
132,JERRY,1, Really? How?
133,GEORGE,1, 'Cause it's all in the greeting. 
134,JERRY,1, Uh-huh.
135,GEORGE,1," All right, if she puts the bags down before she greets 
              you, that's a good sign."
136,JERRY,1, Right.
137,GEORGE,1," Ya know, anything in the, in the ""lip-area"" is 
              good."
138,JERRY,1," ""Lip-area""."
139,JERRY,1, Hug is definitely good.
140,GEORGE,1, Sure.
141,JERRY,1," Although what if it's one of those hugs where the shoulders 
              are touching, the hips are eight feet apart?"
142,GEORGE,1," That's so brutal, I hate that."
143,JERRY,1, Ya know how they do that?
144,GEORGE,1," That's why, ya know, a shake is bad."
145,JERRY,1," Shake is bad, but what if it's the ""two-hander""? 

              The hand on the bottom, the hand on the top, the warm look in the 
              eyes?"
146,GEORGE,1, Hand-sandwich.
147,JERRY,1, Right.
148,GEORGE,1," I see, well, that's open to interpretation. Because so 
              much depends on the layering and the quality of the wetness in the 
              eyes...[suddenly a woman approaches Jerry from behind and puts her 
              hands over Jerry's eyes]"
149,LAURA,1, Guess who?
150,JERRY,1," Hey, hey."
151,LAURA and JERRY,1," Heeeey! [they take each others hands like they're 
              planning to do a folk dance; George is looking puzzled]"
152,JERRY,1, It's good to see you.
153,LAURA,1, Hi.
154,JERRY,1, This is my friend George.
155,LAURA,1," [shakes George's hand] Hi, how nice to meet you."
156,GEORGE,1," Hi, how are you?"
157,JERRY,1, This is Laura.
158,GEORGE,1," Laura, sure."
159,JERRY,1, [to Laura] I can't believe you're here.
160,GEORGE and JERRY,1," Ooh yeah, the bags, sure. [they pick up the bags]"
161,LAURA,1," Oh, thank you."
162,JERRY,1," [privately to George] Now that was an interesting greeting, 
              did you notice that, George?"
163,GEORGE,1," Yes, the ""surprise-blindfold-greeting"". That 
              wasn't in the manual, I don't know."
164,[Scene,1, Jerry's apartment. Jerry shows Laura the apartment]
165,JERRY,1," So uh, what do ya think?"
166,LAURA,1," Ooohhh, wow! This place isn't so bad."
167,JERRY,1," Yeah, it kind a motivates me to work on the road...So uh, 
              make yourself at home. [Laura sits down on the couch, takes off 
              her shoes and opens some buttons of her shirt] So uh, can I get 
              you anything? Uuhhh, bread, water...salad-dressing?"
168,LAURA,1," [laughs] Actually uhm, do you have any wine?"
169,LAURA,1," Oh, do, do you mind if I turn this down? [points to the 
              lamp]"
170,JERRY,1," Uh, no, yeah, go right ahead. [she turns down the lamp]"
171,JERRY,1," Uh, yeah, yeah, sure, why don't you stay? Yeah, uhm...What 
              is your, what is your schedule for tomorrow? Are you, are you doin' 
              anything?"
172,LAURA,1," No, I'd love to do something, uh, I have my seminar in the 
              morning, then after that I'm right open."
173,JERRY,1, Really? What would you like to do?
174,LAURA,1," Well...now I know this sounds touristy, but I'd just love 
              to go on one of those five-hour-boat-rides around Manhattan."
175,JERRY,1," [doubtfully] Yeah, we could do that...why not, why not. 
              [pours the wine] I'm just, I'm really glad you're here. [the phone 
              rings; he picks it up] Yeah, hello...yes...yes, she is, hold on. 
              [to Laura] Uhm, it's for you."
176,LAURA,1," [she takes the phone] Hello?...Hi!...no no it was great, 
              right on time...no, I, I'm gonna stay here tomorrow...yes, yes it's 
              fine..no, we're goin' on a boat-ride...don't be silly...I'm not 
              gonna have this conversation...look I, I'll call you tomorrow...OK, 
              bye [she hangs up the phone]. Never get engaged."
177,JERRY,1, You're engaged?
178,LAURA,1," You, you really have no idea what it's like until you actually 
              do it and I'm on this emotional roller coaster."
179,JERRY,1, You're engaged? [still can't believe it]
180,LAURA,1," Ya know, I can't believe it myself sometimes. You have to 
              start thinking in terms of ""we"", uh, it's a very stressful 
              situation."
181,JERRY,1, You're engaged! [like he's answering his own question]
182,LAURA,1," Yeah...yeah, he's a great guy..."
183,JERRY,1, Yeah.
184,LAURA,1," You'd really like him...ya know, I can't wait to get on 
              that boat."
185,JERRY,1, Me too!
186,[Scene,1, Comedy club.]
187,"e-eeehh, eehhh, eehhh, this man is out of ideas. How does it...? 
              [imitates horn again] e-e-e-eeeehhhh, ""I don't think she likes 
              me""...The amazing thing is, that we still get women, don't 
              we. Men, I mean, men are with women. You see men with women. How 
              are men getting women, many people wonder. Let me tell you a little 
              bit about our organization. ""Where ever women are?"", we 
              have a man working on the situation right now. Now, he may not be 
              our best man, OK, we have a lot of areas to cover, but someone from 
              our staff is on the scene...That's why, I think, men get frustrated, 
              when we see women reading articles, like",1," ""Where to meet men?"". 
              We're here, we are everywhere. We're honking our horns to serve 
              you better."

              if"
198,Elaine,2," Okay, what're we doing here? I have seen *everything*."
199,Jerry,2, Oh yeah? I don't believe you've seen... this.
200,Elaine,2," Oh, lovely..."
201,Jerry,2, Yeah...
202,Elaine,2, What do you think their parents think?
203,Jerry,2," ""So, uh, what's your son doing now, Dr. Stevens?"""
204,Elaine,2," Y'know what? This would be a really funny gift for Pamela's 
            "
205,Jerry,2, Pamela? Do I know her?
206,Elaine,2," Yeah, you met her when we were going out."
207,Jerry,2," Oh yeah, right..."
208,Elaine,2," You have *no* idea who I'm talking about, do you?"
209,Jerry,2, [quickly] No.
210,Elaine,2," Blonde hair remember? Glasses? [pause] Have you *totally* 
              blocked"
211,Jerry,2, Riverside Drive.
212,Elaine,2," Right! In fact... No, never mind..."
213,Jerry,2," Well, what is it?"
214,Elaine,2," Well, a bunch of people are getting together tomorrow night 
              at some"
215,Jerry,2," Wait a second, wait a second. We could work out a little 
              deal here."
216,Elaine,2, What little deal?
217,Jerry,2," I will go to that, if you go with me to a little family 
              wedding I "
218,Elaine,2," A *wedding*!? Have you *lost* it, man?"
219,Jerry,2," Y'know, my parents are coming in for this..."
220,Elaine,2, They're coming in?
221,Jerry,2," Yeah, tomorrow."
222,Elaine,2," Hey, did your father ever get that hair weave?"
223,Jerry,2," No, no... Still doin' the big *sweep* across."
224,Elaine,2, Why does he do that?
225,Jerry,2, Doesn't think anyone can tell?
226,Jerry,2," So c'mon, do we have a deal?"
227,Elaine,2, A *wedding*?
228,Jerry,2, There's a lot of people to mock...
229,Elaine,2," Alright, what the Hell."
230,Jerry,2, Great!
231,Woman,2," When you're dead, you're dead. That's it. You're not goin'"
232,Elaine,2," C'mon lets go, c'mon..."
233,Jerry,2, Was I supposed to bring something?
234,Elaine,2, You could have.
235,Jerry,2, I met her *one* time...
236,Elaine,2, It is not necessary.
237,Jerry,2, What did you say then?
238,Elaine,2, Sssshhhhhh!!!
239,Pamela,2, Hi
240,Elaine,2," Hi Pamela, you remember Jerry."
241,Pamela,2," Yes, we met."
242,Jerry,2," Hi, happy birthday."
243,Pamela,2," Ahh, everybody, this is Elaine and Jerry."
244,Guests,2, Hi
245,Jerry,2, I didn't bring anything.
246,Pamela,2," Ahh, I put you two right here."
247,Jerry,2," Oh, Okay (turns to rest of table) I'm sorry, I didn't know 
              what"

249,Vanessa,2, How big a tip do you think it'd take to get him to stop?
250,Jerry,2, I'm in for five...
251,Vanessa,2, I'll supply the hat.
252,Jerry,2, [To himself] Uh-oh... What do we have here...
253,Vanessa,2, Why don't you relax and take your jacket off?
254,Jerry,2," Oh, I can't-- I have a tendency to get chilly."
255,Vanessa,2, How masculine...
256,Jerry,2," Plus I'm wearing short sleeves, I don't want to expose my 
              tattoos."
257,Roger,2," [To Vanessa] Hey, this guy says he knows Bricker..."
258,Vanessa,2," Oh, you know Bricker! From where?"
259,Jerry,2," [To himself] What's going on here? Gotta be her boyfriend, 
              she's"
260,Vanessa,2, [To Jerry] How do you know Pamela?
261,Jerry,2, Friend of a friend. And you?
262,Vanessa,2, We went to law school together.
263,Elaine,2," Oh, Jerry!"
264,Jerry,2," [To himself] Oh no, not *now*..."
265,Elaine,2, I had this dream last night and you were in it.
266,Jerry,2," Oh really... [To himself] Oh God, I gotta get out of this..."
267,Elaine,2," You were you, but, you weren't you..."
268,Jerry,2," No kidding... [To himself] Why is this happening? Please, 
              make "
269,Elaine,2," I think, I think we were in my house where I grew up, and 
              you were "
270,Jerry,2, [To himself] This is *brutal*...
271,Elaine,2, You turned around and you had these wooden teeth...
272,Jerry,2," How do you like that... [To himself] Can I turn now? Is 
              this "
273,Elaine,2, Jerry? Are you listening to me?
274,Jerry,2," Yes, I *heard* you."
275,Pamela,2," Elaine, what's the name of that jewelry store you took 
              me to that "
276,Jerry,2," [To himself] Thank *you*, Pamela!"
277,Jerry,2," [To Vanessa] So, you're a lawyer..."
278,Vanessa,2," Sagman, Bennet, Robbins, Oppenheim and Taft."
279,Jerry,2," [To himself, quickly] Sagman, Bennet, Robbins, Oppenheim 
              and Taft. "
280,Vanessa,2," Oh, that was you!"
281,Jerry,2," Imagine, spelling ""Mom"" with two O's..."
282,Vanessa,2, Very funny! What do you do?
283,Jerry,2, Comedian.
284,Vanessa,2, Really... That explains it...
285,Jerry,2," [To himself, quickly] Sagman, Bennet, Robbins, Oppenheim 
              and Taft."
286,Roger,2, Are you ready?
287,Vanessa,2, We gotta run. Happy birthday!
288,Jerry,2," [To himself] I can't believe it-- I got *nothing*! I don't 
              even "
289,Jerry,2," [To himself, *very* quickly] Sagman, Bennet, Robbins, Oppenheim 
              and "
290,Jerry,2," That wasn't so bad, really..."
291,Elaine,2," Y'know, uh, you could use a little work on your manners."
292,Jerry,2, Why? What did I do?
293,Elaine,2," Well, I just don't appreciate these little ""courtesy 
              responses"", "
294,Jerry,2, I was listening!
295,Elaine,2," No! You couldn't wait to get back to your little... ""conversation""."
296,Jerry,2," No, you were talking about the, the um, the dream you had."
297,Elaine,2, Uh-huh...
298,Jerry,2," Where you had, uh, wooden teeth."
299,Elaine,2," No! No! *You* had wooden teeth! *You* had wooden teeth! 
              *I* "
300,Jerry,2," Alright, so *I* had wooden teeth, so what?"
301,Elaine,2, So nothing... Nothing...
302,Jerry,2," Apparently Plato, who came up with the concept of the platonic

303,"you there were guys who tried to do it, just went",2," ``Hi, my name's 
            "
304,Jerry,2, Hey!
305,Morty,2," Ah, there he is!"
306,Jerry,2," This is what I like, see? You come home and your parents 
              are in your"
307,Helen,2," Y'know, Jerry, we don't have to do this..."
308,Jerry,2," What are you talkin' about? It's fine, I love having you 
              here..."
309,Helen,2, Tomorrow we'll go to a hotel.
310,Jerry,2," Ma, will you stop?"
311,Helen,2," No, why should we take over your apartment?"
312,Jerry,2, I don't care-- I'm sleeping next door.
313,Helen,2, Your friend Kramer doesn't mind?
314,Jerry,2," No, he's making a bouillabaisse."
315,Jerry,2," So Dad, lemme ask you a question. How many people work at 
              these big"
316,Morty,2, Depends on the firm.
317,Jerry,2," Yeah, but if you called up and described someone, do you 
              think they "
318,Morty,2, What's the matter? You need a lawyer?
319,Jerry,2," No, I met someone at this party, and I know where she works, 
              but I "
320,Morty,2, So why don't you ask someone who was at the party?
321,Jerry,2," Nah, the only one I could ask is Elaine, and I can't ask 
              her."
322,Helen,2, Why not?
323,Jerry,2, Because it's complicated-- there's some tension there.
324,Helen,2, He used to go with her...
325,Helen,2, Which one is she?
326,Morty,2," From Maryland. The one who brought you the chocolate covered 
            "
327,Morty,2," Oh yeah, very alert. Warm person."
328,Jerry,2," Oh yeah, she's great."
329,Helen,2," So, how come nothing materialized there?"
330,Jerry,2," Well, it's a tough thing to talk about... I dunno..."
331,Helen,2, I know what it was...
332,Jerry,2, You don't know what it was...
333,Helen,2," So, what was it?"
334,Jerry,2," Well, we fight a lot for some reason..."
335,H + M,2," Oh, well..."
336,Jerry,2, And there was a little problem with the physical chemistry...
337,Helen,2," Well, I think she's a very attractive girl."
338,Jerry,2," Oh, she is, she absolutely is."
339,Helen,2, I can see if there was a *weight* problem...
340,Jerry,2," No, it's not that. It wasn't all one-sided."
341,Helen,2," You know, you can't be so particular. Nobody's perfect."
342,Jerry,2," I know, I know..."
343,Morty,2," Y'know Jerry, it's a good thing I wasn't so particular."
344,Helen,2," Idiot... [To Jerry] So who're you looking for, Sophia Loren?"
345,Jerry,2, That's got *nothin'* to do with it.
346,Morty,2, How about Loni Anderson?
347,Helen,2, Where do you get Loni Anderson?
348,Morty,2," Why, what's wrong with Loni Anderson?"
349,Helen,2, I like *Elaine* more than Loni Anderson...
350,Jerry,2," What are you two talking about? Look, Elaine just wasn't 
              ""the one""."
351,Helen,2," And this other one's ""the one""?"
352,Jerry,2," I dunno, maybe..."
353,Morty,2, So ask Elaine there for the number.
354,Jerry,2," I can't-- she'll get upset. I never talk about other women 
              with her,"
355,Helen,2, How could you still see her if your not interested?
356,Jerry,2, We're *friends*.
357,Morty,2," Doesn't sound like you're friends to me. If you were friends 
              you'd "
358,Jerry,2, Oh yeah...
359,Morty,2," Well, go up to the office."
360,Helen,2, Up to her office?
361,Morty,2," Go to the building. She goes out to lunch, doesn't she?"
362,Jerry,2, I guess...
363,Morty,2," So, you stand in the lobby, by the elevator, and wait for 
              her to "
364,Jerry,2," You mean ""stakeout"" the lobby?"
365,Helen,2," Morty, that's ridiculous. Just ask Elaine for the number!"
366,Morty,2, He doesn't want to ask Elaine for the number.
367,Helen,2," So you've got him standing by the elevator like a *dope*! 
              What "
368,Morty,2, He pretends he *bumped* into her!
369,Jerry,2, Y'know what? This is *not* that *bad* an idea...
370,George,2, What does she look like?
371,Jerry,2, I dunno. Hard to say.
372,George,2, What actress does she remind you of?
373,Jerry,2, Loni Anderson.
374,George,2, Loni Anderson?!
375,Jerry,2," What, there's something wrong with Loni Anderson?"
376,Jerry,2," Hey listen, thanks again for running over here. I appreciate 
              it."
377,George,2," Yeah, sure. I was showing a condo on 48th st. Besides, 
              you think"
378,Jerry,2, I'm a little nervous.
379,George,2," Yeah, me too..."
380,Jerry,2," If I see her, what do I say that I'm doing here in the building?"
381,George,2, You came to see me; I work in the building.
382,Jerry,2, What do you do?
383,George,2, I'm an *architect*.
384,Jerry,2, You're an *architect*?
385,George,2, I'm not?
386,Jerry,2, I don't see architecture comin from you...
387,George,2, I suppose *you* could be an architect...
388,Jerry,2, I never said that I was the architect. Just somethin' else...
389,George,2," Alright, she's not even gonna ask, if we *see* her, which 
              is remote."
390,Jerry,2," Well what'dya want me to say, that I just wandered in here?!"
391,George,2, We're having lunch with a friend-- he works in the building.
392,Jerry,2, What is *his* name?
393,George,2, Bert... Har... bin... son. Bert Har-bin-son.
394,Jerry,2, Bert Harbinson? It sounds made up.
395,George,2," No good? Alright, how about Art... Corr..... "
396,Jerry,2, Art Corr...
397,George,2, ...velay...
398,Jerry,2, Corvelay?
399,George,2," Yeah, right."
400,Jerry,2," Well, what does *he* do?"
401,George,2, He's an importer.
402,Jerry,2," Just imports, no exports?"
403,George,2," He's an importer/exporter, okay? "
404,George,2," Say, did Elaine ever call you back?"
405,Jerry,2," No, I guess she's still mad."
406,George,2," I don't understand, you never talk to her about other women?"
407,Jerry,2, Never.
408,Jerry,2, Wait a second... That's her... on the right.
409,George,2, I forgot who I am! Who am I?!
410,Jerry,2, You're you. We're having lunch with Art Corvelay.
411,George,2, Vandelay!
412,Jerry,2, Corvelay!
413,George,2," Let me be the architect, I can do it!"
414,Jerry,2," Hey, hey... Pamela's birthday party, didn't I see you there... 
            "
415,Vanessa,2, Sure! Hi!
416,Jerry,2," This is George. [""Grasps"" for her name] I'm sorry..."
417,Vanessa,2, Vanessa.
418,George,2, Nice to meet you.
419,Jerry,2," Ah, Sagman, Bennet, Robbins, Oppenheim and Taft."
420,Vanessa,2, That's right! What're you doing here?
421,Jerry,2," Oh, were meeting a friend of ours for lunch. He works here 
              in the"
422,George,2," Yeah, Art *Vandelay*."
423,Vanessa,2, Really? Which company?
424,Jerry,2, I don't know. He's an importer.
425,Vanessa,2, Importer?
426,George,2, ...And exporter.
427,Jerry,2, He's an importer/exporter.
428,George,2," I'm, uh, I'm an architect."
429,Vanessa,2, Really. What do you design?
430,George,2," Uh, railroads, uh..."
431,Vanessa,2, I thought engineers do that.
432,George,2, They can...
433,Jerry,2, Y'know I'm sorry you had to leave so early the other night.
434,Vanessa,2," Oh, me too. My cousin had to go back to Boston."
435,Jerry,2," Oh, that guy was your *cousin*!"
436,Vanessa,2," Yeah, and that woman was your--"
437,Jerry,2, Friend!
438,George,2," I'll just, uh, get a paper..."
439,Jerry,2," So, um, do you date immature men?"
440,Vanessa,2, Almost exclusively...
441,Helen,2, Bum bum bum bum... I have no letters... Bum bum bum bum...
442,Jerry,2," Ma, will you go already?"
443,Helen,2, Bum bum bum bum...
444,Jerry,2, What are you doing?!
445,Helen,2," Wait, I just want to see something..."
446,Jerry,2," You can't look in there, we're playing!"
447,Morty,2," Evening, Mr. Kramer!"
448,Kramer,2, Hey Morty! [To Jerry] Salad dressing?
449,Jerry,2, Look.
450,Helen,2," ""Quo""? Is that a word?"
451,Jerry,2, Maybe!
452,Helen,2, Will you challenge it?
453,Jerry,2," Ma, you can't look up words in the dictionary! Dad, she's 
              cheating!"
454,Kramer,2," ""Quo""? That's not a word."
455,Helen,2, [To Jerry] You're such a stickler...
456,Jerry,2," Well put *something* down, you're taking twenty minutes 
              on this."
457,Helen,2," They'll be here at two o'clock... Oh, Elaine called. She 
              said "
458,she'd be here at 2,2,"30. Oh, and she says ``Hope your meeting went 
            "
459,Jerry,2, She said *what*?
460,Helen,2," Just what I said, here."
461,Jerry,2," She knows! Oh, I am *such* a *jackass*..."
462,Helen,2, She knows what?
463,Jerry,2, She knows the whole stupid thing... Vanessa and the elevator...
464,Helen,2," No, no, no, that won't do. He may have a ""Z""..."
465,Morty,2," So, how did she find out?"
466,Jerry,2," Because, Vanessa probably told Pamela, and Pamela probably 
              told "
467,Morty,2," So, what are you? Afraid of her?"
468,Jerry,2, Yes. *Yes* *I* *am*!
469,Jerry,2, What else did she say on the phone?
470,Helen,2, Whatever I wrote down.
471,Jerry,2," Yeah, but what was the tone in her voice? How did she sound?"
472,Helen,2," Who am I, Rich Little?"
473,Morty,2," Well, she can't be too mad-- she's still coming to the wedding."
474,Jerry,2," Yeah, but now I'm nervous."
475,Helen,2," Oh, stop it."
476,Jerry,2," ""Quone""?"
477,Helen,2, ...30...31...
478,Jerry,2," ""Quone""? No, I'm afraid that I'm going to have 
              to challenge that."
479,Helen,2, ...32...
480,Kramer,2," No, you don't have to challenge that. That's a word. That's 
              a "
481,Jerry,2, I am challenging...
482,Jerry,2, Uh-huh...
483,Helen,2, I'm not playing with you anymore...
484,Morty,2, Quone's not a word...
485,Jerry,2, No good. Sorry. There it is. Get it off...
486,Helen,2, Why did you make me put that down?
487,Kramer,2," Nah, we need a *medical* dictionary! If a patient gets 
              difficult, "
488,Carol,2," You want some funny material, you oughta come down to where 
              I work,"
489,Jerry,2, You must have quite a time down there. [Checks his watch]
490,Carol,2, We got plenty of time...
491,Jerry,2," Oh, I'm sorry. I'm just waiting for someone..."
492,Mac,2," Watch what you say to this guy-- he'll put it in his next 
              act!"
493,Jerry,2," Yeah, yeah..."
494,Mac,2," Jerry, did I tell you that I'm writing a book? An autobiography."
495,Jerry,2," Yeah, Uncle Mac, you mentioned it..."
496,Mac,2, It's based on all my experiences!
497,Jerry,2," That's perfect. [Elaine enters] Could you excuse me one 
              second. "
498,Jerry,2," How do you do, Jerry Seinfeld."
499,Elaine,2," Oh, how do you do. Elaine Benes."
500,Jerry,2," Um, do you want to do this now, or do you want to wait until 
              we get"
501,Elaine,2," Oh no, let's do it now."
502,Jerry,2," Alright, the whole elevator business, let me just explain--"
503,Elaine,2, Okay...
504,Artie,2," Jerry, were you goin' with us?"
505,Jerry,2," No, I'm gonna take my car."
506,Artie,2," That's why I brought the wagon. Why the Hell did I bring 
              the wagon?"
507,Jerry,2," Anyway, you know why I didn't ask you, I mean I felt so 
            "
508,Elaine,2," Well, Jerry, I never saw you flirt with anyone before. 
              It was "
509,Carol,2," Jerry, we'll see you there. Bye, Elaine."
510,Elaine,2," Oh, bye. Good to see you."
511,Artie,2," Oh, we didn't meet."
512,Jerry,2," Oh, I'm sorry. Elaine, this is my cousin Artie Levine."
513,Artie,2, Le*vine*.
514,Jerry,2," Yeah, ""Le*vine*"". And I'm Jerry Cougar Mellencamp... 
              Anyway, I "
515,Elaine,2," Yeah, obviously."
516,Jerry,2," I mean, if we're gonna be friends, we gotta be able to talk 
              about"
517,Elaine,2, Couldn't agree more.
518,Jerry,2, Good.
519,Elaine,2, Good.
520,Jerry,2, Good.
521,Elaine,2, Great!
522,Jerry,2," Great? Where do you get ""great""?"
523,Elaine,2, It's great to... talk about... other people...
524,Jerry,2, ...Guys.
525,Elaine,2, Yeah.
526,Jerry,2," Uh-huh... Yeah... So, anybody specific?"
527,Elaine,2, No. A general guy.
528,Jerry,2, Oh *really*... Elaine Marie Benes...
529,Elaine,2," What? No, it's not a big deal."
530,Jerry,2," No, that's great! That's terrific!"
531,Elaine,2," No, we just met..."
532,Jerry,2," Doesn't matter. What's the young man's name? I would like

866,KRAMER,4," Oh, they've got a cure for cancer. See, it's 
              all big business.. Oh hey, Jerry just walked in. Hi, George. (resumes 
              talking on the phone) Yeah, yeah yeah,"
867,JERRY,4, (to Kramer) Who is it?
868,KRAMER,4, Take it.
869,JERRY,4, Who is it?
870,KRAMER,4, It's for you.
871,JERRY,4," (into phone) Hello? Oh, hi Joel. (Jerry hits 
              Kramer with a magazine.) .. No. I was out of town. I just got back.. 
              Kramer doesn't know anything.. He's just"
872,KRAMER,4," Well, it's your phone. He wanted to talk to 
              you"
873,JERRY,4, Maybe I didn't want to talk to him.
874,KRAMER,4," Well, why not?"
875,JERRY,4," He bothers me. I don't even answer the phone 
              anymore because of him. He's turned me into a screener. Now I gotta 
              go see him on Wednesday."
876,GEORGE,4," What do you mean Wednesday? I though we had 
              tickets to the Knick game Wednesday. We got seats behind the bench! 
              What happened? We're not"
877,JERRY,4, We're going. That's next Wednesday.
878,GEORGE,4, Oh. Who is this guy?
879,JERRY,4," His name is Joel Horneck. He lived like three 
              houses down from me when I grew up. He had a Ping Pong table. We 
              were friends. Should I suffer the rest of"
880,KRAMER,4," That's for me. (into phone) Kramerica Industries.. 
              Oh, hi, Mark.. No, no, no. Forget that. I got a better idea. A pizza 
              place where you make your own"
881,JERRY,4, Can you conduct your business elsewhere?
882,KRAMER,4," (ignoring Jerry) No, no, no. I'm talking about 
              a whole chain of 'em. Yeah. (Kramer leaves Jerry's apartment while 
              still on the phone.)"
883,GEORGE,4," I don't know why you even bother with this 
              ping pong guy, I'll tell you that."
884,JERRY,4," I don't bother with him. He's been calling 
              me for seven years. I've never called him once! He's got the attention 
              span of a five-year-old. Sometimes I sit"
885,GEORGE,4," I don't understand why you spend time with 
              this guy."
886,JERRY,4," What can I do? Break up with him? Tell him 
              ""I Don't think we're right for each other.."" He's a guy. 
              At least with a woman, there's a precendent. You know,"
887,GEORGE,4," No, no, no,no you have to approach this as 
              if he was a woman."
888,JERRY,4, Just break up with him?
889,GEORGE,4, Absolutely. You just tell him the truth.
890,[Setting,4, Nightclub]
891,JERRY,4," As a guy I don't know how I can break up with 
              another guy. You know what I mean? I don't know how to say, ""Bill, 
              I feel I need to see other men."" Do"
892,[Setting,4, Coffee Shop]
893,JOEL,4," ..so my shrink wants me to bring my mother in 
              for a session. This guy is a brilliant man. Lenny Bruce used to 
              go to him.. and I think, uh, Geraldo."
894,JERRY,4," You know, I read the Lenny Bruce biography, 
              I thought it was really - interesting.. he would-"
895,JOEL,4," (interrupting) Hey, hey, hey, hey we're starving 
              here! We've been waiting here for ten minutes already!"
896,JERRY,4," (testing Joel) So, I'm thinking about going 
              to Iran this summer."
897,JOEL,4," I have to eat! I mean, I'm hypoglycemic."
898,JERRY,4," Anyway, the Hizballah has invited me to perform. 
              You know, it's their annual terrorist luncheon. I'm gonna do it 
              is Farsi."
899,JOEL,4, Do you think I need a haircut?
900,WAITRESS,4, Are you ready?
901,JERRY,4," Yeah, I'll have the egg salad on whole wheat."
902,JOEL,4," Let me ask you a question. This, uh, this turkey 
              sandwich here, is that real turkey, or is it a turkey roll? I don't 
              want that processed turkey. I hate it."
903,WAITRESS,4, I think it's real turkey.
904,JOEL,4, Is there a real bird in the back?
905,WAITRESS,4," No, there's not bird but-"
906,JOEL,4," Well, how do you know for sure? Look, why don't 
              you do me a favor. Why don't you go in the back and find out, okay?"
907,JOEL,4, (cont.) Unbelievable..
908,JERRY,4, How can you talk to someone like that?
909,JOEL,4," What are you saying? What, you like turkey roll?"
910,JERRY,4," Listen, Joel. There's something I have to tell 
              you."
911,JOEL,4," Wait, you'll never guess who I ran into."
912,JERRY AND JOEL,4, Howard metro.
913,JOEL,4," He asked me if I still saw you. I said, ""Sure, 
              I see him all the time. We're great friends."" Anyway, Howard 
              says hello."
914,JERRY,4," ..listen, Joel.. I don't think we should see 
              each other anymore."
915,JOEL,4, what?
916,JERRY,4, This friendship.. it's not working.
917,JOEL,4, Not working? What are you talking about?
918,JERRY,4, We're just not suited to be friends.
919,JOEL,4, How can you say that?
920,JERRY,4," Look, you're a nice guy, it's just that - we 
              don't have anything in common."
921,JOEL,4," (starting to cry) Wait. Wat did I do? Tell me.. 
              I want to know."
922,JERRY,4," You didn't do anything. It's not you, it's 
              me. It's.. this is very difficult."
923,JOEL,4," Look, I know I call you too much, right? I mean, 
              I know you're a very busy guy."
924,JERRY,4," No, it's not that."
925,JOEL,4," (crying) You're one of the few people I can 
              talk to."
926,JERRY,4," Oh, come on. That's not true."
927,JOEL,4," I always tell everybody about you; tell everybody 
              to go see your show. I mean, I'm your biggest fan!"
928,JERRY,4," I know, I know."
929,JOEL,4," I mean, you're my best friend."
930,JERRY,4, Best friend? I've never been to your apartment.
931,JOEL,4," I cannot believe that this is happening. I can't 
              believe it."
932,JERRY,4," Okay, okay. Forget it. It's okay. Id didn't 
              mean it."
933,JOEL,4, Didn't mean what?
934,JERRY,4, What I said. I've been under a lot of stress.
935,JOEL,4," Oh, you've been under a lot of stress."
936,JERRY,4," Just, can we just forget the whole thing ever 
              happend? I'm sorry. I din't mean it. I took it out on you. We're 
              still friends. We're still friends. Still friends."
937,JOEL,4, Tonight?
938,JERRY,4," No, next Wednesday. If it was tonight, I would've 
              said tonight."
939,JOEL,4, Do you really want me to go?
940,JERRY,4, (faking) Yes.
941,JOEL,4," Okay. yeah, okay. Great! That would be, that'd 
              be great.. so, next Wednesday."
942,JERRY,4, Next Wednesday.
943,JOEL,4, Where is that waitress?! Hey! ..
944,[Setting,4, Bank]
945,GEORGE,4," ..she calls me up at my office, she says, 
              ""We have to talk."""
946,JERRY,4," Uh, the four worst words in the English language."
947,GEORGE,4," That, or ""Who's bra is this?"""
948,JERRY,4, That is worse.
949,GEORGE,4," So we order lunch, and we're talking. Finally, 
              she blurts out how it's ""not working""."
950,JERRY,4, Really.
951,JERRY,4, Hm? You ate.
952,GEORGE,4," We sat there for twenty minutes, chewing, 
              staring at each other in a defunct relationship."
953,JERRY,4," Someone says, ""Get out of my life!"" 
              and that doesn't affect your appetite?"
954,GEORGE,4, Have you ever had their egg salad?
955,JERRY,4, It is unbelievable.
956,GEORGE,4," It's unbelievable. You know what else is unbelievable? 
              I picked up the check. She didn't even offer. She ended it. The 
              least she could do is send me off"
957,JERRY,4, Yeah? Where'd he go? To and arcade?
958,GEORGE,4, (sarcastic) That's funny. You're a funny guy.
959,JERRY,4," C'mon, move up."
960,CUSTOMER,4," Oh great, Ewing's hurt."
961,GEORGE,4, Ewing's hurt? How long is he going to be out?
962,CUSTOMER,4, A couple of days at the most but..
963,GEORGE,4, Geez.
964,JERRY,4," Oh, God."
965,GEORGE,4," I got scared there for a second. The Knicks 
              without Ewing."
966,JERRY,4," Listen, George, little problem with the game."
967,GEORGE,4, What about it?
968,JERRY,4," The thing is, yesterday, I kind of.. uh.."
969,GEORGE,4, What?
970,JERRY,4, I geve your ticket to Horneck.
971,GEORGE,4, You what?!
972,JERRY,4," Yeah, I'm sorry. I had to give it to Horneck."
973,GEORGE,4, No! My ticket?! You gave my ticket to Horneck?
974,JERRY,4," (talking about the line) C'mon, c'mon, go ahead, 
              move up."
975,GEORGE,4, Why did you give him my ticket for?
976,JERRY,4, You didn't see him. It was horrible.
977,GOERGE,4," Oh, c'mon, Jerry. I can't believe this."
978,JERRY,4, I had to do it.
979,GEORGE,4," Oh, please. (to the teller) Can you change 
              this into bills?"
980,TELLER,4," I'm sorry, sir. We can't do that."
981,JERRY,4," Do you want to go with him? You go. I don't 
              mind."
982,GEORGE,4," I'm not going with him. I don't even know 
              the guy. (to the teller) Look, they did this for me before."
983,TELLER,4," Look, I can give you these and you can roll 
              them yourself."
984,GEORGE,4," You want me to roll six thousand of these?! 
              What, should I quit my job?!"
985,[Setting,4, Nightclub]
986,JERRY,4," I do not like the bank. I've heard the expression 
              ""Laughing all the way to the bank."" I have never seen 
              anyone actually doing it. And those bank lines. I hate"
987,[Setting,4, Jerry's apartment]
988,GEORGE,4," ..Thirty-two, thirty-three-"
989,JERRY,4, George.
990,GEORGE,4, (raises his hand) Not now.. (counts to himself).
991,JERRY,4, Could you stop the counting?
992,GEORGE,4, Nnnnnnnninngaaa! (Dumping out roll) What?!
993,JERRY,4," Can I make it up to you? I'll give you fifty 
              bucks for the jug."
994,GEORGE,4," Oh, yeah, sure. Keep your money."
995,JERRY,4," Well, then I'm not going to the game either. 
              Okay? I'll give him both tickets."
996,GEORGE,4," (pantomimes sticking an imaginary knife in 
              his heart, and twists it) Oh geeeee.. Go, go!"
997,JERRY,4," I.. no, I don't want to go."
998,GEORGE,4, He was really crying?
999,JERRY,4," I had to give him a tissue. In fact, let me 
              call his machine now and I'll just make up some excuse why I can't 
              go to the game either."
1000,GEORGE,4," Wait a minute. Wait a minute. As long as you're 
              going to lie to the guy, why don't you tell him that you lost both 
              of the tickets, then we could go?"
1001,JERRY,4," George, the man wept."
1002,KRAMER,4," Oh, hey guys. Man, I'm telling you. This pizza 
              idea, is really going to happen."
1003,GEORGE,4," This is the thing where you go and you have 
              to make your own pizza?"
1004,KRAMER,4," Yeah, we give you the dough, you smash it, 
              you pound it, you fling it in the air; and then you get to put your 
              sauce and you get to sprinkle your cheese,"
1005,GOERGE,4," You know, you have to know how to do that. 
              You can't have people shoving their arms into a six-hundred degree 
              oven."
1006,KRAMER,4, It's all supervised.
1007,GEORGE,4," Oh, well."
1008,KRAMER,4, All of it. You want to invest?
1009,GEORGE,4, My money's all tied up in change right now.
1010,KRAMER,4," No, I'm tellin' ya, people, they really want 
              to make their own pizza pie."
1011,JERRY,4," I have to say something. With all due respect, 
              I just never.. I can't imagine anyone in any walk of life, under 
              any circumstance, wanting to make their own"
1012,KRAMER,4, That's you.
1013,JERRY,4, I'm just saying..
1014,KRAMER,4," Okay, okay. I just wanted to check with you 
              guys."
1015,JERRY,4, Okay.
1016,KRAMER,4," You know, this business is going to be big. 
              I just wanted .. okay. (he exits quickly, then sticks his head back 
              through the door) One day, you'll beg me to"
1017,JERRY,4," Hi, Joel. This is Jerry. I hope you get this 
              before you - Oh, Hi. Joel.. oh, you just came in.. listen, I can't 
              amke it to the game tonight. I, uh, have to tutor my"

              this guy. I need some kind of excuse Rolodex."

1021,ELAINE,4," Come on, let's go do something. I don't want 
              to just sit around here."
1022,JERRY,4, Okay.
1023,ELAINE,4, Want to go get something to eat?
1024,JERRY,4, Where do you want to go?
1025,ELAINE,4," I don't care, I'm not hungry."
1026,JERRY,4," We could go to one of those cappuccino places. 
              They let you just sit there."
1027,ELAINE,4, What are we gonna do there? Talk?
1028, JERRY,4, We can talk.
1029, ELAINE,4, I'll go if I don't have to talk.
1030, JERRY,4, We'll just sit there.
1031,ELAINE,4, Okay. I'm gonna check my machine first.

1035,JERRY,4," It's a list of excuses, it's for that guy, 
              Horneck, who's at the game tonight with my tickets. I have that 
              list now so in case he calls, I just consult it and i don't"
1036,ELAINE,4, I got some for you.
1037,JERRY,4, I don't need anymore.
1038,JERRY,4, (sarcastic) Very funny.
1039,JERRY,4," I'm Dan. Can I have my list back, please?"
1040,ELAINE,4," (gives Jerry the list) Here, here. Jerry Seinfeld, 
              I cannot believe you're doing this. This is absolutely infantile."
1041,JERRY,4, What can I do?
1042,ELAINE,4, Deal with it. Be a man!
1043,JERRY,4," Oh no. That's impossible. I'd rather lie to 
              him for the rest of my life that go through that again. He was crying, 
              tears accompanied by mucus."
1044,ELAINE,4," You made a man cry? I've never made a man 
              cry. I even kicked a guy in the groin once and he didn't cry.. I 
              got the cab."
1045,JERRY,4, A couple of touch monkeys.
1046,KRAMER,4," Oh, hi Elaine, hey. (to Jerry) Hey, you missed 
              a great game tonight, buddy!"
1047,JERRY,4, Game?
1048,KRAMER,4," Knock game. Horneck took me. We were sitting 
              two rows behind the bench. We were getting hit by sweat!"
1049,JERRY,4, Wait. How does Horneck know you?
1050,KRAMER,4," Last week. When I, you know, game you the 
              phone. He's really into my pizza place idea!"
1051,JERRY,4, This is too much.
1052,ELAINE,4," Wait, what pizza place idea?"
1053,JERRY,4," Oh, no."
1054,KRAMER,4, You make your own pie!
1055,ELAINE,4," Oh, that sounds like a great idea. It would 
              be fun."

1063,JOEL,4," So, I though you were tutoring your nephew?"
1064,JERRY,4," Oh, we finished early."
1065,JOEL,4," Uhm, I'll bet. So, are you going to introduce 
              me to your - nephew?"
1066,JERRY,4," Elaine Benes, this is Joel Horneck."

              week, I'm going to take you. You about next Tuesday night? (to Elaine) 
              And why don't you come along?"
1071,ELAINE,4," Oh, no, no. Tuesday's no good becasue we've 
              got choir practice."
1072,JERRY,4, Right. I forgot about choir.
1073,ELAINE,4," We're doing that evening of Eastern European 
              National Anthems."
1074,JERRY,4," Right. You know, the wall being down and everything."
1075,JOEL,4," (to Jerry) What about Thursday night? I mean 
              they're playing the Sonics."
1076,ELAINE,4," Huh... Thursday is not good because we've

1089,JERRY,5," But it's common sense. He's got super strength, super speed.. 
              I'm sure he's got super humor."
1090,GEORGE,5," You would think that, but either you're born with a sense 
              of humor, or you're not. It's not going to change even if you go 
              from the red sun of Krypton all"
1091,JERRY,5," Why? Why would that one area of his mind not be affected 
              by the yellow sun of Earth?"
1092,GEORGE,5, I don't know but he ain't funny.
1093,ELAINE,5," I know, I know. I'm sorry I'm late."
1094,JERRY,5, No problem.
1095,ELAINE,5, I dropped a grape.
1096,GEORGE,5, Pardon?
1097,ELAINE,5," I dropped a grape in the kitchen and it disappeared. I 
              couldn't find it. I was... I was literally on my knees for ten minutes 
              looking for this stupid grape. I"
1098,JERRY,5," Were you crying? I mean, it's just a grape. You'll find 
              it."
1099,ELAINE,5," No, I'm just getting over an allergy attack. This guy I'm 
              going out with - "
1100,JERRY,5, Robert.
1101,ELAINE,5," Robert. Yes.. thank you. He has two cats and I'm allergic 
              to them. You know, I finally meet a normal man, and I can't even 
              go into his apartment, you"
1102,GEORGE,5, Guys with cats.. I don't know.
1103,JERRY,5," I've been thinking about asking this girl I'm, uh, seeing 
              -"
1104,ELAINE,5, Vanessa.
1105,JERRY,5," Vanessa, thank you.. I've been thinking about asking her 
              to go away for a couple of days."
1106,GEORGE,5," Oh no. No, no,no,no,no. I'd have to advise against that. 
              What do you know this woman, a month? Let's see, you're going to 
              be with her seventy-two"
1107,ELAINE,5," (balancing a spoon on her nose) Hey, why don't you take 
              her to that place in Vermont I was telling you about? You know, 
              that really charming place with"
1108,GEORGE,5," (To Elaine) That's exquisite. Listen, uh, if it's not too 
              much trouble, could you pass me that paper over there?"
1109,JERRY,5," You better find that grape before it mutates into another 
              life form. (Elaine laughs) There was once a mutant grape that terrorized 
              an entire town in the Texas"
1110,GEORGE,5," (To himself) Up again?! This is incredible. I'm.. I'm getting 
              it."
1111,ELAINE,5, You're getting what?
1112,GEORGE,5, A stock.
1113,JERRY,5, What stock?
1114,GEORGE,5," Did you ever meet my friend, Simons?"
1115,JERRY,5, Maybe.
1116,GOERGE,5," He knows this guy, Wilkinson. He made a fortune in the 
              stock market. Now he's got some new thing - you know, there's supposed 
              to be a big merger."
1117,JERRY,5, How high's it suppose to go?
1118,GEORGE,5," I don't know. But Simons said that if I wanted to get involved, 
              that Wilkinson would tell me the exact right minute to sell. You 
              wanna do it?"
1119,JERRY,5, Boy.. I don't know.
1120,ELAINE,5, I'd do it but I don't have any money.
1121,JERRY,5, What kind of company is it?
1122,GEORGE,5," It's Sendrax. They've got some new kind of technique for 
              televising opera."
1123,ELAINE,5, Televising opera?
1124,GEORGE,5, Some sort of electronic thingy.
1125,JERRY,5," Well, how much are you going to invest?"
1126,GEORGE,5, (Unsure) Five thousand.. ten. Ten thousand.. Five thousand.
1127,JERRY,5, Boy..
1128,GEORGE,5," C'mon. Wilkinson's got millions invested in this stock. 
              It's gone up three points since I've been watching it."
1129,JERRY,5, What if I lose it?
1130,GEORGE,5," C'mon, go for twenty-five hundred. We'll do it together. 
              Come on, come on. We're in it together."
1131,JERRY,5, (gives in) All right -- twenty-five hundred.
1132,GEORGE,5, That's it.
1133,WAITRESS,5," Yeah, can I take your order?"
1134,GEORGE,5, (Gesturing to Jerry) Check the raiser.
1135,JERRY,5, My bet? All right.. I'll open with a tuna sandwich.
1136,ELAINE,5, Tuna?
1137,JERRY,5," Oh, the dolphin thing?"
1138,ELAINE,5, They're dying in the nets.
1139,JERRY,5," Ooohhh.. You know, the whole concept of lunch is based on 
              tuna."
1140,ELAINE,5," Jerry, can't you incorporate one unselfish act in your 
              daily routine?"
1141,JERRY,5," Hey, when I'm driving, I let people in ahead of me all the 
              time. I'm always waving everybody in. ""Go ahead, go ahead, 
              go ahead."" ..Alright.. alright. I'll have"
1142,ELAINE,5," And I'm going to have an English muffin with margarine 
              on the side and a cup of coffee."
1143,WAITRESS,5, Okay. (To George) What about you?
1144,GEORGE,5, I'll have the tuna.
1145,[Setting,5, A Korean Market]
1146,JERRY,5," I have to say. Those people talking behind us really ruined 
              that movie for me."
1147,VANESSA,5, Why didn't you do something?
1148,JERRY,5," What do you want me to do? I have the guy the half-turn. 
              Then I have him the full-turn with the eye roll! I mean, beyond 
              that, I'm risking a punch in the"
1149,STOCK BOY,5, No puffs. Just flakes.
1150,JERRY,5, Have you thought any more about that trip?
1151,VANESSA,5," Yeah, I've been thinking about it."
1152,JERRY,5," You know, my friend told me about this great place in Vermont."
1153,VANESSA,5," I don't know. I just worry about trips like this.. It's 
              a lot of pressure."
1154,JERRY,5," It's great! It speeds up the intimacy level. It's like putting 
              the relationship in a time compressor. Where we would be six months 
              from now we accomplish"
1155,VANESSA,5," Oh, so you want to move our relationship into Phase Two..?"
1156,JERRY,5," Exactly. I love Phase Two. Extra toothbrushes, increased 
              call frequency, walking around naked.. You know, the presents get 
              a lot better in Phase Two."
1157,VANESSA,5," (Starting to like the idea) Really? Could we go fishing 
              up there?"
1158,JERRY,5," Yeah. We can fish. What? Blues, carp, marlin?"
1159,VANESSA,5, They have marlin in Vermont?
1160,JERRY,5," Oh, big fighting marlin."
1161,VANESSA,5," Jerry, the stock is the same as when you checked it earlier. 
              There are no changes after the market closes. The stock is still 
              down."
1162,JERRY,5," I know. But this is a different paper. I thought maybe they 
              have, uh, different.. sources."

              is looking at the paper]"
1164,JERRY,5, Is that my paper?

1166,JERRY,5, What? What news?
1167,KRAMER,5, Sendrax.
1168,JERRY,5," Oh, c'mon! It's down again?!"
1169,KRAMER,5, Two and a half points.
1170,JERRY,5," Oh, I can't believe it. Let me see that. (Looks at the paper) 
              That's four and a half points in three days! That's almost half 
              my money!"
1171,KRAMER,5," Hey, I told ya."
1172,JERRY,5," (Sarcastic) Yeah, you told me."
1173,KRAMER,5, It's all manipulated with junk bonds. You can't win.
1174,JERRY,5," (Holding the phone, calling George) There's one thing I 
              don't understand. Why does it please you? (Into phone) George Costanza, 
              please."
1175,KRAMER,5," Hey, I don't care. I'm just telling you to (yelling) get 
              rid of that stock, now!"
1176,JERRY,5," (Into phone) George, what's going on?!"
1177,KRAMER,5," Sell it, just say I'm selling!"
1178,JERRY,5," (Into phone) Well, where is the guy?! Nothing? Almost half 
              my money's gone.. Well, call me right back. (Hangs up) Nobody can 
              reach Wilkinson. He"
1179,KRAMER,5," You know, I can't believe you put your money in that Sendrax. 
              And you could've invested in my roll-out tie dispenser."
1180,JERRY,5, Roll-out tie dispenser? What was that one?
1181,KRAMER,5," Okay, you're in a restaurant. You've got a very big meeting 
              coming up."
1182,JERRY,5, Okay.
1183,KRAMER,5," You just (makes noise) tear it off, and you got a new one 
              right here. Then you're gone."
1184,JERRY,5, You're gone alright.
1185,KRAMER,5," (Looking at map) Hey, where.. where are you going? You 
              gonna take a trip? The map.. what.."
1186,JERRY,5," Yeah, I'm going to Vermont with Vanessa for a few days."
1187,KRAMER,5," Hey, can I use your place? I got a bunch of friends coming 
              over this weekend."
1188,JERRY,5, What friends?
1189,KRAMER,5," Well, it's just some people I met at a rock concert."
1190,KRAMER,5," Do you mind if they use your bed? (Jerry give him a look) 
              'Cause they're really good people, Jerry. I'm telling you. You know, 
              they're anarchists."
1191,JERRY,5," George.. what?! You're kidding.. Well, what's wrong?.. So, 
              what are we gonna do?.. Great! Alright, I'll speak to you later. 
              (Hangs up) Wilkinson, the guy"
1192,[Setting,5, Dry-Cleaning store; Jerry and George are in line]
1193,JERRY,5, So you don't know what's wrong with him?
1194,GEORGE,5, All Simons was able to find out is that he's in the hospital.
1195,JERRY,5," Okay, fine. Has Simons been in touch with him?"
1196,GEORGE,5," Of course he's been in touch with him. He's left two messages. 
              He just hasn't heard back yet, that's all."
1197,JERRY,5," Well, this is it. I'm selling."
1198,GEORGE,5, Just give it a little more time.
1199,JERRY,5," I never should've gotten involved in this. I'm a nervous 
              wreck. I""m not cut out for investing."
1200,GEORGE,5," Alright, alright. That's it. I'm gonna go down there."
1201,JERRY,5, Where?
1202,GEORGE,5, To the hospital.
1203,JERRY,5, The hospital?
1204,GEORGE,5, I'm going to find out what's going on. Alright?
1205,JERRY,5, Are you nuts? You don't even know they guy.
1206,GEORGE,5," So what? I'll start talking to him, you know, casual, and 
              I'll work my way around to it."
1207,JERRY,5," What if he's in an iron lung or something? What are you 
              gonna do? (knocking on glass) ""How you feeling, Mr. Wilkinson? 
              (makes hissing sound) By the"
1208,GEORGE,5, Maybe he's resting.
1209,JERRY,5, Who goes to the hospital to rest?
1210,GEORGE,5," What are you, a doctor?"
1211,JERRY,5," Okay, fine, fine. When are you going down there?"
1212,GEORGE,5," Today. I'm going today. Just don't do anything until you 
              hear from me."

              a bathroom."
1215,DRY CLEANER,5, May I help you?
1216,JERRY,5," Yeah. I picked up this shirt here yesterday. It's completely 
              shrunk. There's absolutely no way I can wear it."
1217,DRY CLEANER,5, When did you bring it in?
1218,JERRY,5," What's the difference? Look at it! Do you see the size of 
              this shirt?!"
1219,DRY CLEANER,5, You got a receipt?
1220,JERRY,5, I can't find the receipt.
1221,DRY CLEANER,5, You should get the receipt.
1222,JERRY,5," Look, forget about the receipt, all right? Even if I had 
              the receipt- look at it! It's a hand puppet. What am I gonna do 
              with this?!"
1223,DRY CLEANER,5," Yes, but how do I know we did the shirt?"
1224,JERRY,5," What do you think this is a little scam I have? I take this 
              tiny shirt all over the city conning dry cleaners out of money?! 
              In fact, forget the money. I don't even"
1225,DRY CLEANER,5, Maybe you asked for it to be washed?
1226,JERRY,5, No.. dry-cleaned.
1227,DRY CLEANER,5," Let me explain to you something. Okay? With certain 
              types of fabrics, different chemicals can react, causing.."
1228,JERRY,5," (Interrupting) You shrunk it! You know you shrunk it! Just 
              tell me that you shrunk it!"
1229,DRY CLEANER,5, I shrunk it.
1230,[Setting,5, Night club]
1231,JERRY,5," I think the only reason we go to the dry cleaner is so I 
              can say to the dry cleaner, ""Well, it's ruined."" And of 
              course, the dry cleaner can respond, ""It's not"

1235,JERRY,5, So what are you gonna do?
1236,ELAINE,5," I don't know. I can't think of any solution, unless of 
              course they should meet with some unfortunate accident. What do 
              you think a hit man would charge to"
1237,JERRY,5," Well, it couldn't be too expensive. Thirteen, fourteen bucks 
              a cat?"
1238,ELAINE,5," What do you think, Jerry? You wanna make twenty-eight bucks?"
1239,JERRY,5, I'm no cat killer.
1240,ELAINE,5, How about we go over there right now and we shave them?
1241,JERRY,5," I'd really like to go, Elaine. But, George is coming back 
              from the hospital. I gotta wait for him. But otherwise I would definitely 
              go."
1242,ELAINE,5, He actually wen to the hospital?
1243,JERRY,5, Yeah.

              Kramer, holding a paper) I know, I know. It's down again."

1247,JERRY,5, I don't know.. fifteen hundred dollars.
1248,KRAMER,5, Wow.

              And there's that smile again. Well, what is that?"

              Take a look at this."

1253,KRAMER,5, What a body. Yeeaahh.. that's for me.
1254,JERRY,5," Yeah, and you're just what she's looking for too - a stranger 
              leering through a pair of binoculars ten floors up."
1255,KRAMER,5, I'm gonna go down there and try and talk to her. (leaves)
1256,JERRY,5," What? What? Did you go down there? (George nods) Did he 
              tell you what's gonna happen? (George shakes his head ""no"".) 
              How long were you there?"
1257,GEORGE,5, Fifteen seconds.
1258,JERRY,5, You told him you knew Simons?
1259,GEORGE,5," Yeah, I mentioned Simons. Next thing I know - I'm in the 
              parking lot. Perhaps they had some sort of a falling out. I'll tell 
              you one thing.. I don't know"
1260,JERRY,5," Well, that's it. Look, I'm going to Vermont. I don't want 
              to think about this. I'm selling."

1262,GEORGE,5, (Laughs) Not quite.
1263,ELAINE,5," Well, what are you gonna do about the stock?"

              the Old Man's Bundle."" (To himself) Maybe I can get an extension 
              cord and hang myself. (To Vanessa) What"
1277,VANESSA,5," Oh, you've never heard of it."
1278,JERRY,5," No, what? What kind is it?"
1279,VANESSA,5, I can't tell you.
1280,JERRY,5," (To himself) Yeah, that's normal. (Out loud, to a man nearby) 
              Excuse me, Sir. Could I have a look at that business section?"
1281,VANESSA,5, That stock? I thought you got out of that?
1282,JERRY,5," I did. I'm just curious. It's been almost a week. I want 
              to check it out. (finds stock) Six points. It's up six points!"
1283,VANESSA,5, I told you not to sell.
1284,JERRY,5, You did not tell me not to sell.
1285,VANESSA,5," I said, the market fluctuates. Remember?"
1286,JERRY,5," Look, Vanessa, of course the market fluctuates. Everybody 
              knows that. I just got fluctuated out of four thousand dollars!"
1287,VANESSA,5, That's probably why.. (stops herself)
1288,JERRY,5, What?
1289,VANESSA,5, Forget it.
1290,JERRY,5," No, what? 'That's probably why..'"
1291,VANESSA,5," That's probably why we're staying here, because you lost 
              money on the stock."
1292,JERRY,5," (To himself) So, what am I looking at here? Twenty=nine 
              hours to go. Well, at least I got plenty of time to find out the

              me"" gesture.) So, Big daddy. I'm just curious. How much did 
              you clear on your little trasaction"
1300,GEORGE,5, I don't like to discuss figures.
1301,JERRY,5, How much?
1302,GEORGE,5," I don't know, what? Eight thousand. It's a Hyundai. Get 
              out of here.. I told you not to sell. Simons made money, Wilkinson 
              cleaned up."

              from a nose job."
1305,JERRY,5, Is taht still from the cats?
1306,ELAINE,5," No, I just have a cold."
1307,JERRY,5," So, what ever happened with that?"
1308,ELAINE,5, I gave him an ultimatum. (Shrugs)
1309,GEORGE,5, He chose the cats?
1310,ELAINE,5, They're very clean animals.
1311,JERRY,5," I gotta say, that's pretty sad. Losing out to a cat."
1312,ELAINE,5, Almost as bad as losing out to a perfume.
1313,GEORGE,5," I told you those trips were relationship killers. Too bad 
              you can't get your buddy Superman to fly around the Earth at super 
              speed and reverse time."
1314,ELAINE,5, Superman can go back in time?
1315,JERRY,5, We went over that.
1316,GEORGE,5," Wilkinson's got a bite on a new one.. Petramco Corp. Out 
              of, hu, Springfield. I think. They're about to introduce some sort 
              of robot butcher."
1317,JERRY,5, A robot butcher?
1318,GOERGE,5," Shhhhh. If you want to get in - there's very little time. 
              (Calling to waitress) Sweetheart.. (Waitress tears of check, George 
              stops her) No, no, no. That'"
1319,[Setting,5, Night club]
1320,JERRY,5," I'm not an investor. People always tell me, you should have 
              your money working for you. I've decided I'll do the work. I'm gonna 
              let the money relax. You"

1326,JERRY,6," I'm always in traffic with the lane expert. You know this 
              type of person? Constantly reevaluating their lane choice.. Never 
              quite sure, ""Is this the best lane for"
1327,[Setting,6, Jerry's car]
1328,GEORGE,6, She can't kill me right?!
1329,JERRY,6," No, of course not."
1330,GEORGE,6, People break up all the time.
1331,JERRY,6, Everyday.
1332,GEORGE,6," It just didn't work out. What can I do? I wanted to love 
              her. I tried to love her. I couldn't."
1333,JERRY,6, You tried.
1334,JERRY,6, Did you tell her you loved her?
1335,GEORGE,6," Oh, I had no choice. She squeezed it out of me! She'd tell 
              me she loved me. Alright, at first, I just look at her. I'd go ""Oh, 
              really?"" or ""Boy, that's, that's"
1336,JERRY,6, You're a human being.
1337,GEORGE,6," And I didn't even ask her out. She asked me out first. 
              She called me up. What was I supposed to do? Say no? I can't do 
              that to someone."
1338,JERRY,6, You're too nice a guy.
1339,GEORGE,6," I am. I'm a nice guy.. (realizing) And she seduced me! 
              We were in my apartment, I'm sitting on the couch, she's on the 
              chair - I get up to go to the"
1340,JERRY,6, You're flesh and blood.
1341,GEORGE,6," I had nothing to do wtih any of this! I met all her friends, 
              I didn't want to meet them. I kept trying to avoid it. I knew it 
              would only get me in deeper. But"
1342,JERRY,6, I told you when I met her..
1343,GEORGE,6, My back is killing me.
1344,JERRY,6," You gotta go to my chiropractor, he's the best."
1345,GEORGE,6," Oh yeah, everybody's guy is the best."
1346,JERRY,6, I'm gonna make an appointment for you. We'll go together.
1347,GEORGE,6," Please. They don't do anything.. Look, do I have to break 
              up with her in person? CAn't I do it over the phone? I have no stomach 
              for these things."
1348,JERRY,6," You should just do it like a Band-Aid. One motion! Right 
              off!"
1349,ELAINE,6, Hi.
1350,JERRY,6, Hi.
1351,ELAINE,6," Hey, what are you doing?"
1352,GEORGE,6, I'm letting you in.
1353,ELAINE,6," Oh no. No. I don't want to sit in the back. I'll be left 
              out of the conversation."
1354,GEORGE,6," No, you won't."
1355,ELAINE,6," Yes, I will, George. I'll have to sick my chin on top of 
              the seat."
1356,GEORGE,6, Okay..
1357,ELAINE,6, Why can't you sit in the middle?
1358,GEORGE,6," Please, it doesn't look good. Boy, boy, girl."
1359,ELAINE,6," I think you're afraid to sit next to a man. You're a little 
              homophobic, aren't you?"
1360,GEORGE,6, Is it that obvious?
1361,ELAINE,6," Hello, Jerry."
1362,JERRY,6, Hello.
1363,ELAINE,6, Did you get a haircut?
1364,JERRY,6," No, shower. So, where are we eating?"
1365,"And then the verbal hellos stopped, and we just went into these 
              little sort of nods of recognition. So, fine. I figure, that's where 
              this relationship is finally gonna settle",6,
1366,GEORGE,6," (imitating Tony Bennett) ""You know, I'd go from nods 
              to nothing.."""
1367,ELAINE,6," And now, there's this intense animosity whenever we passs. 
              I mean, it's like we really hate each other. It's based on nothing."
1368,JERRY,6," A relationship is an organism. You created this thing and 
              then you starved it so it turned against you. Same thing happened 
              to The Blob."
1369,GEORGE,6," I think you absolutely have to say something to this guy. 
              Confront him."
1370,ELAINE,6, Really?
1371,GEORGE,6, Yes.
1372,ELAINE,6, You would do that?
1373,GEORGE,6, If I was a different person.
1374,[Setting,6, Jerry's apartment; Jerry's on the phone]
1375,JERRY,6," Hello.. hello. Is Glenn there? I'm sorry. Is this 805-555-3234?.. 
              Yes, I know I have the wrong number. But I just want to know if 
              I dialed wrong or if.."
1376,KRAMER,6, Come on up.
1377,JERRY,6," (Into phone) Oh, it's you again. See? Now if you had answered 
              me, I wouldn't have had to do this. Now that's too long distance 
              calls I made to you why"
1378,KRAMER,6, Taste this.
1379,JERRY,6," No, I just had a sandwich."
1380,KRAMER,6," No, taste it. Taste it."
1381,JERRY,6, I don't want cantaloupe now.
1382,KRAMER,6, You've never had cantaloupe like this before.
1383,JERRY,6, I only eat cantaloupe at certain times.
1384,KRAMER,6, Jerry. This is great cantaloupe.
1385,JERRY,6, Alright.. (tastes it)
1386,KRAMER,6," Ah, huh. It's good?"
1387,JERRY,6, It's very good.
1388,KRAMER,6," Good, huh?"
1389,JERRY,6, Good.
1390,KRAMER,6, I got it at Joe's.
1391,JERRY,6, Uh-Huh.
1392,KRAMER,6," Forty-nine cents a pound. That's practically half than 
              what you're paying at the supermarket. I don't know why you don't 
              go to Joe's."
1393,JERRY,6, It's too far.
1394,KRAMER,6, It's three blocks further. You can use my shopping cart..
1395,JERRY,6," I'm not pulling a shopping cart. What am I suppose to wear? 
              A kerchief? Put stockings on and roll 'em down below my knee?"
1396,KRAMER,6," See, the other thing is, if you don't like anything, he 
              takes it right back."
1397,JERRY,6," I don't return fruit. Fruit is a gamble. I know that going 
              in."
1398,GEORGE,6, I'm outta there. I did it! It's over.
1399,JERRY,6, You did it? What happened?
1400,GEORGE,6," I told her. In the kitchen - which was risky 'cause it's 
              near all the knives. I started with the word ""Listen."""
1401,JERRY,6, Ah ha.
1402,"though the crying and I keep running. Then the cursing started. 
              She's firing at me from the guard tower",6," ""Son of a bang! Son 
              of a boom!"" I get to the top of the wall -"
1403,JERRY,6," See, it's never as bad as you imagine."
1404,KRAMER,6, I liked Marlene. What's her number?
1405,GEORGE,6," No, I, I don't think so."
1406,JERRY,6, Could you stop that smacking?
1407,KRAMER,6," George, I want you to taste this cantaloupe."
1408,GEORGE,6," Oh no, thank you."
1409,KRAMER,6, It's the best cantaloupe I ever had.
1410,GEORGE,6," No, really. No, no, thanks."
1411,KRAMER,6," Jerry, tell him how good this cantaloupe is."
1412,JERRY,6," It's very good cantaloupe. (changing subject) So that's 
              it? You're out?"
1413,GEORGE,6," Except for one small problem. I left some books in her 
              apartment."
1414,JERRY,6," So, go get them."
1415,GEORGE,6," Oh, no. No, I can't go back there. Jerry, it's so awkward 
              and, you know, it could be dangerous - sexually. Something could 
              happen, I'd be right back"
1416,JERRY,6, So forget about the books. Did you read them?
1417,GEORGE,6," Well, yeah."
1418,JERRY,6, What do you need them for?
1419,GEORGE,6, I don't know. They're books.
1420,JERRY,6," What is this obsession people have with books? They put 
              them in their houses - like they're trophies. What do you need it 
              for after you read it?"
1421,GEORGE,6, They're MY books.
1422,JERRY,6, So you want me to get those books? Is that it?
1423,[Setting,6, Coffee Shop]
1424,MARLENE,6," ..So, it must've been ninety-five degrees that night, 
              and everyone's just standing around the pool with little drinks 
              in their hands. I was wearing my old"
1425,JERRY,6, So what'd you do?
1426,MARLENE,6," Well, nothing. It's not skin off my hide if people like 
              to look. I just didn't see what the big attraction was."
1427,JERRY,6," Well, I have a general idea what it was. I could take a 
              guess."
1428,MARLENE,6," (Laughs) Hey, you know, Jerry, just because George and 
              I don't see each other anymore, it doesn't mean we shouldn't stay 
              friends."
1429,JERRY,6, No.
1430,MARLENE,6, Good enough. I'm really glad we got that settled.
1431,[Setting,6, Chiropractor waiting room]
1432,JERRY,6, (Irritated) I don't know how this happened.
1433,GEORGE,6," Jerry, it's not my fault."
1434,JERRY,6," No, no. It's not your fault. Books, books, I need my books. 
              Have you re-read those books yet, by the way? You know the great 
              thing? When you read"
1435,GEORGE,6," That's standard. Has she left you one of those messages 
              where she uses up the whole machine?"
1436,JERRY,6," Ohh.. you know, and sometimes she'll go, ""Hello, Jerry?"" 
              and I'll go ""Oh, hi Marlene."" And then it's ""Jerry.."""
1437,GEORGE,6, What about getting off the phone?
1438,JERRY,6," Ohhhh.. you can't. It's impossible. There's no break in 
              the conversation where you can go, ""Alright, then.. "" 
              You know, it just goes on and on and on with"
1439,GEORGE,6," Just do it like a Band-Aid. One motion, right off! She 
              is sexy though. Don't you think?"
1440,JERRY,6," Yeah. Yes, she is."
1441,RECEPTIONIST,6, Mr. Costanza?
1442,GEORGE,6, Yeah.
1443,RECEPTIONIST,6, The doctor'll see you now.
1444,GEORGE,6," (To Jerry, sarcastically) Yeah, doctor. I'm going to have 
              to wait in that little room by myself, aren't I? (Picks up a crossword 
              puzzle) I better take this. I"
1445,[Setting,6, Night club]
1446,JERRY,6," Waiting room. I hate when they make you wait in the room. 
              'Cause it says ""Waiting room."" There's no chance of not 
              waiting, 'cause they call it the waiting"
1447,[Setting,6, Waiting room]
1448,JERRY,6," So, how was it?"
1449,GEORGE,6," I was in there for two minutes. He didn't do anything. 
              (Imitating doctor) Touch this, feel that. Seventy-five bucks."
1450,JERRY,6," Well, it's a first visit."
1451,GEORGE,6," What's seventy-five bucks? What, am I seeing Sinatra in 
              there?! Amd I being entertained? I don't understand this. I'm only 
              paying half."
1452,JERRY,6, You can't do that.
1453,GEORGE,6, Why not?
1454,JERRY,6, He's a doctor. You gotta pay what he says.
1455,GEORGE,6," Oh, no, no, no. I pay what I say."
1456,[Setting,6, Jerry's car]
1457,MARLENE,6, Are you feeling weird?
1458,JERRY,6," No, I'm fine."
1459,MARLENE,6, Nothing really happened.
1460,JERRY,6," Yeah, I know."
1461,MARLENE,6, We just kissed a little. People kiss.
1462,JERRY,6, Yeah.
1463,MARLENE,6, Well.. night.
1464,JERRY,6, Good night.
1465,[Setting,6, Jerry's apartment]
1466,KRAMER,6, Hey.
1467,JERRY,6, Hey.
1468,KRAMER,6," I got it! This time, I got it!"
1469,JERRY,6, Alright.
1470,KRAMER,6," Hips! See, it's all hips."
1471,JERRY,6, Uh-huh.
1472,KRAMER,6, You gotta come through with the hips first. (Demonstrates)
1473,JERRY,6, That is out there.
1474,KRAMER,6, Joe's?
1475,JERRY,6," No, supermarket."
1476,KRAMER,6," Well, is it good?"
1477,JERRY,6, It's okay.
1478,KRAMER,6," Let me taste it. (Takes a bite, spits it out) See, that 
              stinks. You can't eat that. You should take it back."
1479,JERRY,6, I'm not taking it back.
1480,KRAMER,6," Alright, I'll take it back. I'm going by there."
1481,JERRY,6, I don't care about it.
1482,KRAMER,6," Jerry, you should care. Cantaloupe like this should be 
              taken out of circulation."
1483,JERRY,6, Alright. Take it back.
1484,JERRY,6," (On his answering machine) Leave a message, I'll call you 
              back."
1485,MARLENE,6," (Leaving a message) Jerry, have you ever taken a bath 
              in the dark? If I'm not talking into the soap right now, call me 
              back."
1486,KRAMER,6, Well?
1487,JERRY,6, Marlene
1488,KRAMER,6," (Smiles) Oh. Oh, Marlene."
1489,JERRY,6," Yeah, I took her home one night - we kinda started up a 
              little bit in the car."
1490,KRAMER,6, I thought you were trying to get rid of her?
1491,JERRY,6," I was. She's got me, like, hypnotized."
1492,KRAMER,6, Does George know?
1493,JERRY,6," No, he'd go nuts."
1494,KRAMER,6," Yeah, no kidding."
1495,JERRY,6," I feel terrible. (Kramer smiles) I mean, I've seen her a 
              couple of times since then, and I know I can't go any further, but.. 
              I've just got this like,"
1496,KRAMER,6," Woah, psycho-sexual."
1497,JERRY,6, I don't know how I'm going to tell him.
1498,KRAMER,6," Man, I don't understand people. I mean, why would George 
              want to deprive you of pleasure? Is it just me?"
1499,JERRY,6," It's partially you, yeah."
1500,KRAMER,6," You're his friend. Better that she should sleep with someone 
              else. Some jerk that he doesn't even know."
1501,JERRY,6," Well, he can't kill me, right?"
1502,KRAMER,6, You're a human being.
1503,JERRY,6," I mean, she called me. I haven't called her. She started 
              it."
1504,KRAMER,6, You're flesh and blood.
1505,JERRY,6, I'm a nice guy.
1506,ELAINE,6, Hi. (Hands Jerry the lamp)
1507,JERRY,6," Oh, my little airplane lamp."
1508,ELAINE,6," You know, you have the slowest elevator in the entire city? 
              That's hard to get used to when you're in so many other fast ones."
1509,JERRY,6," Well, the apartment elevators are always slower than the 
              offices, because you don't have to be home on time."
1510,ELAINE,6, Unless you're married to a dictator..
1511,JERRY,6, Yeah.. because they would be very demanding people.
1512,ELAINE,6," Right. Exactly. So I imagine at some point, somebody's 
              going to offer me some cantaloupe."
1513,KRAMER,6, Nope. No good.
1514,KRAMER,6," Well, I'm taking this back. (Leaves)"
1515,ELAINE,6," So, I had what you might call a little encounter this morning."
1516,JERRY,6, Really? That guy who stopped saying hello?
1517,ELAINE,6, Yep.
1518,JERRY,6, You talked to him?
1519,ELAINE,6," Yep. I spotted him getting his mail. And at first, I was 
              just going to walk on by, but then I thought ""no, no, no, no. 
              Do not be afraid of this man."""
1520,JERRY,6, Right.
1521,ELAINE,6," So, I walked up behind him and I tapped him on the shoulder. 
              And I said, ""Hi, remember me?"" And he furrows his brow 
              as if he's really trying to figure it"
1522,JERRY,6," ""You little phony""?"
1523,ELAINE,6," I did. I most certainly did. And he said, he goes, ""Oh, 
              yeah. You're Jeanette's friend. We did meet once."" And I said, 
              ""Well, how do you go from that to"
1524,JERRY,6, Amazing.
1525,ELAINE,6," And he says, he says, ""Look, I just didn't want to 
              say hello anymore, alright?"" And I said, ""Fine. Fine I 
              didn't want to say hello anymore either, but I"
1526,JERRY,6," You are the Queen of Confrontation. You're my new hero. 
              In fact, you've inspired me. I'm gonna call George about something 
              right now."
1527,ELAINE,6, This cantaloupe stinks. (Spits it out)
1528,[Setting,6, Coffee Shop]
1529,GEORGE,6, I don't care.
1530,JERRY,6, You're kidding.
1531,GEORGE,6," No, I don't care."
1532,JERRY,6, You mean that?
1533,GEORGE,6, Absolutely.
1534,JERRY,6, You don't care?
1535,GEORGE,6, No.
1536,JERRY,6, How could you not care?
1537,GEORGE,6," I don't know. But I don't. I'm actually almost happy to 
              hear it."
1538,JERRY,6, I thought you'd be upset.
1539,GEORGE,6, I guess I should be but I'm not.
1540,JERRY,6, Am I a bad person? Did I do something terrible?
1541,GEORGE,6," No, you're a fine person. You're a humanitarian. She's 
              very sexy."
1542,JERRY,6, That voice. That voice. She's driving me crazy.
1543,GEORGE,6," I know, I know."
1544,JERRY,6," So I can see her tonight, and you don't care?"
1545,GEORGE,6," See her tonight. See her tomarrow. Go. Knock yourself out. 
              She's too crazy for me."
1546,JERRY,6," Alright. As long as you're okay. Because I can't stop thinking 
              about her."
1547,GEORGE,6," I'm okay. I'm fine. I'm wonderful. I never felt better 
              in my whole life."
1548,JERRY,6," Good. And I'll tell you what.. You don't have to pay me 
              back the thirty-five I gave to the chiropractor for the rest of 
              your bill."
1549,GEORGE,6, (Angry) You paid that crook?!
1550,JERRY,6, I had to.
1551,GEORGE,6," He didn't do anything, Jerry. It's a scam! Who told you 
              to do that?"
1552,JERRY,6, It was embarrassing to me.
1553,GEORGE,6, I was trying to make a point.
1554,JERRY,6," Why don't you make a point with your own doctor? (George 
              gulps) What's wrong?"
1555,GEORGE,6," (Gasping) I think I swallowed a fly! ..I swallowed a fly! 
              What do I do? What can happen?"
1556,[Setting,6, Jerry's car]
1557,JERRY,6," ..So, you want to come up for a few minutes?"
1558,MARLENE,6," ..I'm sorry, Jerry. I just don't think this is going to 
              work."
1559,JERRY,6, Really? I thought..
1560,MARLENE,6," I know, I'm sorry."
1561,JERRY,6," I guess I just didn't expect it from the way you've been 
              acting."
1562,MARLENE,6, You sure you want to talk about this? 'Cause I sure don't.
1563,JERRY,6, Of course I want to talk about it.
1564,MARLENE,6," Well, okay. I guess things changed for me on Tuesday night."
1565,JERRY,6, Tuesday night? What happened Tuesday night?
1566,MARLENE,6, ..I saw your act.
1567,JERRY,6, My act? What does that have to do with anything?
1568,MARLENE,6," Well, to be honest, it just didn't make it for me. It's 
              just so much fluff."
1569,JERRY,6," I can't believe this. So what are you saying? You didn't 
              like my act, so that's it?"
1570,MARLENE,6, I can't be with someone if I don't respect what they do.
1571,JERRY,6, You're a cashier!
1572,MARLENE,6," Look, Jerry, it's just not my kind of humor."
1573,JERRY,6," You can't go by the audience that night. It was late. They 
              were terrible."
1574,MARLENE,6, I heard the material.
1575,JERRY,6, I have other stuff. You should come see me on the weekend.
1576,[Setting,6, Night club]
1577,JERRY,6," Women need to like the job of the guy they're with. If they 
              don't like the job, they don't like the guy. Men know this. Which 
              is why we make up the phony"

1582,[Setting,7, Night club]
1583,JERRY,7," My parents live in Florida now. They moved there last year. 
              They didn't want to move to Floriday, but they're in their sixties, 
              and that's the law. You know"
1584,[Setting,7, Jerry's apartment]
1585,HELEN,7," (To Morty) You have so many nice jackets. I don't know why 
              you had to bring this jacket. Who wears a jacket like this? (He 
              doesn't respond) What's"
1586,MORTY,7, Are you getting that?
1587,HELEN,7, I thought you were getting it.
1588,MORTY,7, Should I pick up?
1589,HELEN,7, You want me to get that?
1590,MORTY,7, I'll get it!
1591,HELEN,7, I'll get it!
1592,HELEN,7, Hello?.. Hello?
1593,JERRY,7," (Talking about the loud T.V.) Would you make this thing 
              lower! I can hear it on the street! (Turns it off)"
1594,MORTY,7," So, how'd you do?"
1595,JERRY,7," We won. I made an incredible play in the field! There was 
              a tag-up at third base and I threw the guy out from left field on 
              a fly! We'll be in the championship"
1596,HELEN,7, This is your greatest moment? A game?
1597,JERRY,7," Well, no. Sharon Besser, of course."
1598,MORTY,7," You know what my greatest moment was, don't you? 1946. I 
              went to work for Harry Flemming and I came up with the idea for 
              the beltless trench coat."
1599,HELEN,7," Jerry, look at this sport jacket. Is this a jacket to wear 
              to an anniversary party?"
1600,JERRY,7," Well, the man's an individualist. He worked for Harry Flemming. 
              He knows what he's doing."
1601,HELEN,7, But it's their 50th anniversary.
1602,MORTY,7," You know, I spoke to Manya and Isaac on the phone today. 
              They invited you again. I think you should go."
1603,JERRY,7," First of all, I made plans with Elaine."
1604,HELEN,7, So bring her.
1605,JERRY,7," I don't even know them. What is she, your second cousin? 
              I mean, I've met them three times in my life."
1606,MORTY,7," I don't know her either. (Gesturing to Helen) She makes 
              me fly all the way from Floriday for this, and then she criticizes 
              my jacket."
1607,HELEN,7," At least come and say hello, have a cup of coffee, then 
              you'll leave."
1608,MORTY,7, How come he gets to leave?
1609,JERRY,7," If I wind up sitting nest to Uncle Leo, I am leaving. He's 
              always grabbing my arm when he talks to me. I guess it's because 
              so many people have left in the"
1610,MORTY,7," And it's always about Jeffrey, right?"
1611,JERRY,7," Hey, he talks about him like he split the atom. The kid 
              works for the Parks Department."
1612,KRAMER,7," Morty, are you coming in?"
1613,MORTY,7," Oh, yeah. I forgot all about it."
1614,KRAMER,7," (To Jerry) Hey, how'd you do?"
1615,JERRY,7, We won. We're in the finals on Wednesday..
1616,KRAMER,7, Yeah!
1617,JERRY,7, (To Kramer and Morty) What is this about?
1618,KRAMER,7," I'm completely changing the configuration of the apartment. 
              You're not gonna believe it when you see it. A whole new lifestyle."
1619,JERRY,7, What are you doing?
1620,KRAMER,7, Levels.
1621,JERRY,7, Levels?
1622,KRAMER,7," Yeah, I'm getting rid of all my furniture. All of it. And 
              I'm going to build these different levels, with steps, and it'll 
              all be carpeted with a lot of pillows. You"
1623,JERRY,7, You drew up plans for this?
1624,KRAMER,7," No, no. It's all in my head."
1625,MORTY,7, I don't know how you're going to be comfortable like that.
1626,KRAMER,7," Oh, I'll be comfortable."
1627,JERRY,7, When do you intend to do this?
1628,KRAMER,7, Ohh.. should be done by the end of the month.
1629,JERRY,7, You're doing this yourself?
1630,KRAMER,7," It's a simple job. Why, you don't think I can?"
1631,JERRY,7," Oh, no. It's not that I don't think you can. I know that 
              you can't, and I'm positive that you won't."
1632,KRAMER,7," Well, I got the tools. I got the pillows. All I need is 
              the lumber."
1633,MORTY,7," Hey, that's some big job."
1634,JERRY,7, I don't see it happening.
1635,KRAMER,7," Well, this time, this time you're wrong. C'mon. I'll even 
              bet you."
1636,JERRY,7, Seriously?
1637,HELEN,7," I dont' want you betting. Morty, don't let him bet."
1638,KRAMER,7," A big dinner with dessert. But I've got till the end of 
              the month."
1639,JERRY,7, I'll give you a year.
1640,KRAMER,7," No, no, no. End of the month."
1641,JERRY,7," It's a bet. (They both ""pinkie swear"" to lock 
              the deal)"
1642,[Setting,7, Manya's apartment]
1643,JERRY,7," Seriously, do you wnat to switch chairs?"
1644,ELAINE,7," No, no. I'm fine."
1645,LEO,7," Jerry, are you listening to this?"
1646,JERRY,7," Yeah, Uncle Leo."
1647,LEO,7," So, so, now the parks commissioner is recommending Jeffrey 
              for a citation."
1648,JERRY,7, Right. For reducing the pond scum?
1649,LEO,7," No, for the walking tours."
1650,JERRY,7," Oh, yeah. Where the people eat the plant life - the edible 
              foliage tour."
1651,LEO,7," That's exactly right. He knows the whole history of the park. 
              For two hours he's talking and answering questions. But you want 
              to know something? Whenever"
1652,JERRY,7, Mickey Mantle?
1653,ELAINE,7," (Helping him worm out of the conversation with Leo) Jerry, 
              Jerry. Did you taste these peas? These peas are great!"
1654,JERRY,7," (Eating a forkful) These peas are bursting with country-fresh 
              flavor."
1655,ELAINE,7, Mmm.. phenomenal peas..
1656,MORTY,7, Are you ready for dessert?
1657,JERRY,7," Well, actually, we do have to kind of get going."
1658,MANYA,7, (Surprised) You're going?
1659,ELAINE,7, I don't really eat dessert. I'm dieting.
1660,JERRY,7," Yeah, I can't eat dessert either. The sugar makes my ankles 
              swell up, and I can't dance."
1661,MANYA,7, Can't dance?
1662,HELEN,7," He's kidding, Manya."
1663,MANYA,7, Is that a joke?
1664,HELEN,7," (Canging subject) So, did you hear Claire's getting married?"
1665,MANYA,7," Yeah, yeah.."
1666,HELEN,7," I hear the fella owns a couple of racehorses. You know, 
              trotters, like at Yonkers."
1667,JERRY,7, Horses. They're like big riding dogs.
1668,ELAINE,7," What about ponies? What kind of abnormal animal is that? 
              And those kids who had their own ponies.."
1669,JERRY,7," I know, I hated those kids. In fact, I hate anyone that 
              ever had a pony when they were growing up."
1670,MANYA,7, ..I had a pony.
1671,JERRY,7," ..Well, I didn't really mean a pony, per se."
1672,MANYA,7," (Angry) When I was a little girl in Poland, we all had ponies. 
              My sister had pony, my cousin had pony, ..So, what's wrong with 
              that?"
1673,JERRY,7, Nothing. Nothing at all. I was just merely expressting..
1674,HELEN,7, Should we have coffee? Who's having coffee?
1675,MANYA,7, He was a beautiful pony! And I loved him.
1676,JERRY,7," Well, I'm sure you did. Who wouldn't love a pony? Who wouldn't 
              love a person that had a pony?"
1677,MANYA,7, You! You said so!
1678,JERRY,7," No, see, we didn't have ponies. I'm sure at the time in 
              Poland, they were very common. They were probably like compact cars.."
1679,MANYA,7, That's it! I've had enough! (She leaves the room)
1680,ISAAC,7," Have your coffee, everyone. She's a little upset. It's been 
              an emotional day."
1681,JERRY,7," I didn't know she had a pony. How was I to know she had 
              a pony? Who figures an immigrant's going to have a pony? Do you 
              know what the odds are on"
1682,[Setting,7, Jerry's apartment]
1683,JERRY,7, I'll drive you to the airport.
1684,HELEN,7," No, we're taking a cab."
1685,JERRY,7," I just hope that whole pony incident didn't put a damper 
              on the trip."
1686,HELEN,7, Don't be rediculous. It was a misunderstanding.
1687,MORTY,7," Hey, I agree with him. Nobody likes a kid with a pony."
1688,JERRY,7," Well, if you ever talk to her, tell her I'm sorry. Elaine 
              too. She feels terrible."
1689,HELEN,7," You know, you should give Manya a call."
1690,JERRY,7, Maybe I will.
1691,KRAMER,7," Oh, hi. I just came to say goodbye. (Gestures to the bags) 
              ..Need any help with those?"
1692,MORTY,7," It's nothing. I got it. So, how are your levels coming along?"
1693,KRAMER,7," Oh, well.. I decided I'm not gonna do it."
1694,JERRY,7, (Sarcastically) Really? What a shock.
1695,HELEN,7," Goodbye, Jerry."
1696,JERRY,7, Take care.
1697,HELEN,7, We'll call you. (Leaves)
1698,MORTY,7," Bye, Jer."
1699,JERRY,7," Bye, Dad. Take it easy."
1700,MORTY,7," Bye, Mr. Kramer."
1701,KRAMER,7," Yeah. So long, Morty. (Morty leaves)"
1702,JERRY,7," So, when do I get my dinner?"
1703,KRAMER,7, There's no dinner. The bet's off. I'm not gonna do it.
1704,JERRY,7, Yes. I know you're not gonna do it. That's why I bet.
1705,KRAMER,7, There's not bet if I' not doing it.
1706,JERRY,7, That's the bet! That you're not doing it!
1707,KRAMER,7," Yeah, well, I could do it. I don't want to do it."
1708,JERRY,7," We didn't bet on if you wanted to. We bet on if it would 
              be done."
1709,KRAMER,7, And it could be done.
1710,JERRY,7," Well, of course it could be done! Anything could be done! 
              But it only is done if it's done. Show me the levels! The bet is 
              the levels."
1711,KRAMER,7, But I don't want the levels!
1712,JERRY,7," That's the bet! (Phone rings, Jerry answers it) Hello? ..No, 
              oh, hi.. no, they just left.. Oh my God.. hand on a second. Maybe 
              I can still catch them. (Jerry"
1713,[Setting,7, Jerry's apartment]
1714,HELEN,7, Who did you talk to?
1715,JERRY,7, Uncle Leo.
1716,HELEN,7, And when's the funeral?
1717,JERRY,7, I don't know. He said he'd call back.
1718,MORTY,7," You know what this means, don't you? We lost the supersaver. 
              Those tickets are non-refundable."
1719,HELEN,7, She just had a check-up. The doctor said she was fine. Unless..
1720,JERRY,7, What?
1721,HELEN,7, What? Nothing.
1722,JERRY,7, You don't think.. What? The pony remark?
1723,HELEN,7," Oh, don't be ridiculous. She was an old woman."
1724,JERRY,7, You don't think that I killed her?
1725,MORTY,7, You know what the flight back'll cost us?
1726,JERRY,7," It was just an innocent comment! I didn't know she had a 
              pony!"
1727,MORTY,7," Maybe we can get an army transport flight. They got a base 
              in Sarasota, I think."
1728,JERRY,7," The whole thing ws taking out of context. It was a joke. 
              (Phone rings) That's probably Uncle Leo."
1729,HELEN,7," Hello? ..Yes, I know.. Well, it's just one of those things.. 
              Sure, sure, we'll see you then. (Hangs up) The funeral's Wednesday."
1730,JERRY,7," Wednesday? What, what Wednesday?"
1731,HELEN,7," Two o' clock, Wednesday. (Jerry shrugs) What?"
1732,JERRY,7, I've got the softball game on Wednesday. It's the championship.
1733,HELEN,7, So? You're not obligated. Go play in your game.
1734,JERRY,7, I didn't even know the woman.
1735,HELEN,7, So don't go.
1736,JERRY,7, I mean I met her three times. I don't know her last name.
1737,HELEN,7," Jery, no one's forcing you."
1738,JERRY,7," I mean, who has a funeral on a Wednesday? That's what I 
              want to know. I mean, it's the championship. I'm hitting everything."
1739,HELEN,7," I don't have a dress to wear. (To Morty) And you. You don't 
              have anything."
1740,MORTY,7, I got a sport jacket.
1741,HELEN,7, You're not wearing that to a funeral.
1742,MORTY,7, What's wrong with it?
1743,HELEN,7, It looks ridiculous.
1744,MORTY,7, What? I'm gonna buy a new jacket now?
1745,JERRY,7, I don't know what to do.
1746,MORTY,7," ..You know what this funeral's gonna wind up costing me? 
              Oh boy!"
1747,[Setting,7, Night club]
1748,JERRY,7," We don't understand death. And the proof of this is that 
              we give dead people a pillow. And, uh, I mean, hey, you know. I 
              think if you can't stretch out and"
1749,[Setting,7, Coffee Shop]
1750,ELAINE,7," I actually like ponies. I was just trying to make conversation. 
              What time's your game?"
1751,JERRY,7, Two Forty-Five.
1752,ELAINE,7, And what time's the funeral?
1753,JERRY,7, Two o' clock.
1754,ELAINE,7, How long does a funeral take?
1755,JERRY,7," Depends on how nice the person was. But you gotta figure, 
              even Oswald took forty-five minutes."
1756,ELAINE,7, So you cna't do both?
1757,JERRY,7," You know, if the situation were reversed and Manya had some 
              mah-jongg championship or something, I wouldn't expect her to go 
              to my funeral. I would"
1758,ELAINE,7, How can you even consider not going?
1759,GEORGE,7," You know, I've been thinking.. I cannot envision any circumstances 
              in which I'll ever have the opportunity to have sex again. How's 
              it gonna happen? I"
1760,ELAINE,7," You know, funerals always make me think about my own mortality 
              and how I'm actually going to die someday. Me, dead. Imagine that."
1761,GEORGE,7," They always make me take stock of my life and how I've 
              pretty much wasted all of it, and how I plan to continue wasting 
              it."
1762,JERRY,7," I know, and then you say to yourself, ""From this moment 
              on, I'm not going to waste any more of it."" But then you go, 
              ""How? What can I do that's not"
1763,ELAINE,7," Is this a waste of time? What should we be doing? Can't 
              you hae coffee with people?"
1764,GEORGE,7," You know, I can't believe you're even considering not playing. 
              We need you. You're hitting everything."
1765,ELAINE,7, He has to go. He may have killed her.
1766,JERRY,7, Me? What about you? You brought up the pony.
1767,ELAINE,7," Oh, yeah, but I didn't say I hated anyone who had one."
1768,GEORGE,7, (To Jerry) Who's going to play left field?
1769,JERRY,7, Bender.
1770,GEORGE,7," Bender? He can't play left. He stinks. I just don't see 
              what purpose is it going to serve your going? I mean, you think 
              dead peole care who's at the"
1771,ELAINE,7, Maybe she's there in spirit. How about that?
1772,GEORGE,7," If you're a spirit, and you can travel to other dimensions 
              and galaxies, and find out the mysteries of the universe, you think 
              she's going to want to hang"
1773,ELAINE,7," George, I met this woman! She is not traveling to any other 
              dimensions."
1774,GEORGE,7," You know how easy it is for dead people to travel? It's 
              not like getting on a bus. One second. It's all mental."
1775,JERRY,7, Fifty years they were married. Now he's moving to Pheonix.
1776,ELAINE,7, Phoenix? What's happening with his appartment?
1777,JERRY,7," I don't know. They've been in there since, like, World War 
              II. The rent's three hundred a month."
1778,ELAINE,7, Three hundred a month? Oh my God.
1779,[Setting,7, Funeral home]
1780,MAN,7," Although this may seem like a sad even, it should not be a 
              day of mourning.. for Manya had a rich, fulfilling life. She grew 
              up in a different world - a simpler"
1781,[Setting,7, Anteroom of funeral parlor]
1782,JERRY,7," (Looking at his watch) Well, the game's starting just about 
              now."
1783,HELEN,7, It was good that the two of you came. It was a nice gesture.
1784,INTERN,7," I'm not a doctor yet, Uncle Morty. I'm just an intern. 
              I can't write a note to an airline."
1785,MORTY,7," You've got your degree. They don't care. They just want 
              to see something."
1786,JERRY,7, (To Isaac) I just wanted to say how sorry I was..
1787,LEO,7," (Interrupting) Jerry, you wanna hear something? Your cousin, 
              Jeffrey, is switching parks. They're transferring him to Riverside 
              - so he'll completely revamp that"
1788,MORTY,7," You don't understand, I've never paid a full fare."
1789,JERRY,7," (To Isaac) Once again, I just want to say how sorry I am 
              abou tthe other night."
1790,ELAINE,7," Oh, me too."
1791,ISAAC,7," Oh no, no, no. She forgot all about that. She was much mor 
              upset about the potato salad."
1792,ELAINE,7," So, I understand you're moving to Phoenix?"
1793,ISAAC,7," Yeah, my brother lives there. I think Manya would've liked 
              Phoenix."
1794,ELAINE,7," Mmm.. gorgeous, exquisite town. Who, what's happening with 
              your apartment?"
1795,ISAAC,7, Of course it's very hot there. I'l lhave to get an air conditioner.
1796,ELAINE,7," Oh, you can have mine. I'll ship it out ot you.. but what 
              about that big apartment on West End Avenue?"
1797,ISAAC,7, Although they say it's a dry heat.
1798,ELAINE,7," Dry, wet.. what's happening with your apartment?"
1799,ISAAC,7, I don't even know if I should take my winter clothing.
1800,ELAINE,7," I have an idea. Leave the winter clothing in the apartment, 
              and I'll watch it for you and I'll live there and I'll make sure 
              that nothing happens to it."
1801,ISAAC,7," Oh, the apartment. Jeffrey's taking the apartment."
1802,ELAINE,7," (to Jerry) Oh, Jeffrey."
1803,JERRY,7, (To Elaine) You know Jeffery?
1804,ELAINE,7," Yeah, from what I understand, he works for the Parks Department."
1805,HELEN,7, It's raining.
1806,JERRY,7," (Moves to the window) It's raining? It's raining. The game 
              will be postponed. We'll play tomarrow."
1807,MORTY,7," Believe me, I wouldn't bother you if the army hadn't closed 
              that base in Sarasota. Here, scribble a little something here."
1808,INTERN,7, I can't. I'll get in trouble.
1809,MORTY,7," Oh, for God's sakes!"
1810,[Setting,7, Coffee Shop]
1811,GEORGE,7, Who gets picked off in softball? It's unheard of.
1812,JERRY,7, It's never happend to me before.
1813,ELAINE,7," I remember saying to myself, ""Why is Jerry so far 
              off the base?"""
1814,JERRY,7, I'll have to live with this shame for the rest of my life.
1815,GEORGE,7," And they in the fifth inning, why did you take off on the 
              pop fly?"
1816,JERRY,7, I thought there were two outs.
1817,ELAINE,7," I couldn't believe it when I saw you running. I thought 
              maybe they had changed the rules or something."
1818,JERRY,7, It was the single worst moment of my life.
1819,GEORGE,7, What about Sharon Besser?
1820,JERRY,7," Oh, well, of course. 1973."
1821,ELAINE,7," Makes you wonder, though, doesn't it?"
1822,JERRY,7, Wonder about what?
1823,ELAINE,7, You know.. the spirit world.
1824,JERRY,7," You think Manya showed up during the game and put a hex 
              on me?"
1825,ELAINE,7, I never saw anyone play like that.
1826,JERRY,7, But I went ot the funeral.
1827,ELAINE,7," Yeah, but that doesn't make up for killing her."
1828,GEORGE,7," Maybe Manya missed the funeral because she was off visiting 
              another galaxy that day."
1829,JERRY,7, Don't you think she would've heard I was there?
1830,GEORGE,7, Not necessarily. (Elaine laughs)
1831,JERRY,7, Who figures and immigrant's gonna have a pony?
1832,[Setting,7, Night Club]
1833,JERRY,7," What is the pony? What is the point of the pony? Why do 
              we have these animals, these ponies? What do we do with them? Besides 
              the pony ride. Why"

1839,JERRY,8," I hate clothes, okay? I hate buying them. I hate picking 
              them out of my closet. I can't stand every day trying to come up 
              with little outfits for myself. I think"
1840,[Setting,8, Clothing store]
1841,JERRY,8, I think I've seen enough.
1842,SALESMAN,8," Well, I might have something in the back."
1843,ELAINE,8," The back? They never find anything in the back. If they 
              had anything good in the back, they'd put it out in the front."
1844,JERRY,8," Why don't they open up an entire store for the back? Call 
              it, ""Just Back."" All back. No front. You walk in the front, 
              you're immediately in the back. (Picks"
1845,CUSTOMER,8," (Sees the book Elaine is holding) Oh, I just read that. 
              That's terrific."
1846,JERRY,8, (Pointing to Elaine) Her father wrote that.
1847,CUSTOMER,8, Alton Benes is your father?
1848,ELAINE,8, Yeah.
1849,CUSTOMER,8, I always felt he deserved a wider audience.
1850,ELAINE,8," I'm not so sure he wants one. (Customer leaves) Hey, don't 
              forget Sunday, okay? You and George are coming, right? Hotel Westbury, 
              eight o' clock."
1851,JERRY,8, ..I guess I'm coming.. I mean..
1852,ELAINE,8," What? What, you don't want to go now?"
1853,JERRY,8," No, I'll go. I'm going."
1854,ELAINE,8," No, Jerry, you have to. I need a buffer. You know, I haven't 
              seen my father in a while and.. you know."
1855,JERRY,8," I'm worried I won't be able to talk to him. He's such a 
              great writer. Frankly, I perfer the company of nitwits."
1856,ELAINE,8," So, that's why we're not togeter anymore."
1857,JERRY,8," (Looks at a jacket) What is this? (Holds it up) This is 
              beautiful.. but these jackets never fit me right."
1858,ELAINE,8," Try it on. (Feels it) Wow, this is soft suede."
1859,JERRY,8," This may be the most perfect jacket I have ever put on. 
              (Elaine grabs the tag) How much is it?"
1860,ELAINE,8, (Shocked) Oh my God.
1861,JERRY,8, Bad? (Elaine nods) ..Very bad?
1862,ELAINE,8, You have no idea.
1863,JERRY,8, I have some idea.
1864,ELAINE,8, No idea.
1865,JERRY,8, I've got a ballpark.
1866,ELAINE,8, There is no park and the team has relocated.
1867,JERRY,8, (Looks at the tag) ..That is high.
1868,ELAINE,8," Oh man, that is a beautiful jacket, though."
1869,JERRY,8," (Looking at the insides of the jacket) What's with the pink 
              lining and the candy stripes?"
1870,ELAINE,8," Well, it's just a lining. You can always have it changed."
1871,JERRY,8," Should I get it? I hate these moments. I'm hearing the dual 
              voices now, you know. ""What about the money?"" ""What's 
              money?"""
1872,SALESMAN,8, It looks wonderful on you.
1873,[Setting,8, Jerry's apartment]
1874,JERRY,8, Hey.
1875,KRAMER,8, Hey. New jacket?
1876,JERRY,8, What do you think?
1877,KRAMER,8, It's beautiful.
1878,JERRY,8, Is it me?
1879,KRAMER,8, That's definitely you.
1880,JERRY,8, Really?
1881,KRAMER,8," That's more you than you've ever been. (Starts looking 
              the jacket over) What is with the pink lining?"
1882,JERRY,8, I don't know. It's got a pink lining.
1883,KRAMER,8," Oh.. So, what did you pay for this?"
1884,JERRY,8, I paid what it costs.
1885,KRAMER,8, How much?
1886,JERRY,8, What's the difference?
1887,KRAMER,8," What, you're not gonna tell me?"
1888,JERRY,8, I'd rather not say it out loud. It's embarrassing.
1889,KRAMER,8, Over three hundred?
1890,JERRY,8," Yes, but let's just stop it right there."
1891,KRAMER,8, It's over four hundred?
1892,JERRY,8," Really, I'm not answering anymore."
1893,KRAMER,8, Is it over four hundred?
1894,JERRY,8, Would you?
1895,KRAMER,8," (Finds the tag) Woah, Nelson!"
1896,JERRY,8," I know, I know."
1897,KRAMER,8," (Talking about his old jacket) What are you gonna do with 
              the leather one?"
1898,JERRY,8, I don't know.
1899,KRAMER,8," Well, are you gonna wear it?"
1900,JERRY,8, Maybe.
1901,KRAMER,8," (Looking over the leather jacket) You're not going to wear 
              this."
1902,JERRY,8, Do you want it?
1903,KRAMER,8," Well, yeah. Okay. I'll take it.. I like the jacket."
1904,JERRY,8," (Takes one last look at the leather jacket) ..Okay, take 
              it."
1905,KRAMER,8," Good karma for you. (Kramer puts on his new jacket, and 
              stands next to Jerry, looking in the mirror.) Oh baby."
1906,[Setting,8, Jerry's apartment]
1907,GEORGE,8," ""Master of the house.. doling out the charm, ready 
              with a handshake and an open palm. Tells a saucy talke, loves to 
              make a stir everyone appreciates a.."""
1908,JERRY,8, What is that song?
1909,GEORGE,8," Oh, it's from Les Miserables. I went to see it last wee. 
              I can't get it out of my head. I just keep singing it over and over. 
              It just comes out. I have no"
1910,JERRY,8," You know, Schumann went mad from that."
1911,GEORGE,8, Artie Schumann? From Camp Hatchapee?
1912,JERRY,8," No, you idiot."
1913,GEORGE,8," What are you, Bud Abbott? What, are you calling my an idiot?"
1914,JERRY,8, You don't know Rober Schumann? The composer?
1915,GEORGE,8," Oh, Schumann. Of course."
1916,JERRY,8," (Trying to scare George) He went crazy from one note. He 
              couldn't get it out of his head. I think it was an A. He kept repeating 
              it over and over again. He"
1917,GEORGE,8," Really? ..Well, what if it doesn't stop? (Jerry gestures 
              ""That's the breaks."" George gasps) Oh, that I really needed 
              to hear. That helps a lot! Alright, just"
1918,JERRY,8," I know exactly what's goin to happen tonight. I'm gonna 
              try and act like I'm not impressed, he's gonna see right through 
              it."
1919,GEORGE,8," Yeah, he'll be looking at us like he's backstage at a puppet 
              show."
1920,JERRY,8, Let me just get my jacket. (Moves to the bedroom)
1921,GEORGE,8," ""Master of the house, keeper of the inn.."" (Jerry 
              proudly models his new jacket infront of George. George looks in 
              admiration at the jacket) This is huge!"
1922,JERRY,8," Wednesday. This jacket has completely changed my life. When 
              I leave the house in this, it's with a whole different confidence. 
              Like tonight, I might've been"
1923,GEORGE,8," (Nods) Can I say one thing to you? And I say this wiht 
              an unblemished record of staunch heterosexuality."
1924,JERRY,8, Absolutely.
1925,GEORGE,8, ..It's fabulous.
1926,JERRY,8, I know.
1927,GEORGE,8," And I'll tell you something else, I'm not even going to 
              ask you. I want to know. But I'm not going to ask. You'll tell me 
              when you feel comfortable.. So"
1928,KRAMER,8," Hey. Hey, would you do me a solid?"
1929,JERRY,8," Well, what kind of solid?"
1930,KRAMER,8," I need you to sit in the car for two minutes while it's 
              double-parked. I gotta pick up some birds."
1931,JERRY,8, Birds?
1932,KRAMER,8," Yeah. A friend of mine, he's a magician. He's going away 
              on vacation. He asked me to take care of his doves."
1933,JERRY,8, So take a cab.
1934,KRAMER,8, They won't take a cage full of birds.
1935,JERRY,8, I can't. I'm on my way out. There's no way I can do it.
1936,KRAMER,8," George, do me a solid? Two minutes."
1937,GEORGE,8," Well, I'm going with him. I'd like to, I've never done 
              a solid before."
1938,KRAMER,8," Alright.. yeah.. alright, have a good one."
1939,JERRY,8," (Scoffs) Two minutes. Believe me, I know his two minutes.. 
              By his conception of time, his life will last over two thousand 
              years."
1940,[Setting,8, Hotel lobby]
1941,GEORGE,8," ""Master of the House. Quick to catch your eye, never 
              wants a passerby to pass him by."""
1942,JERRY,8," (Points to his head) Schumann. (George gets visibly scared) 
              Where are they?"
1943,GEORGE,8, Maybe he didn't show up.
1944,JERRY,8," What, you don't want to do this?"
1945,GEORGE,8," I don't think there's ever been an appointment in my life 
              where I wanted the other guy to show up."
1946,GEORGE,8," (Sees an elderly man sitting on a leather chair) Wait a 
              second, is that him?"
1947,JERRY,8," Yeah, I think it is. (They walk tward him) Where's Elaine?"
1948,GEORGE,8, I'm nervous.
1949,JERRY,8, Excuse me.. Mister Benes?
1950,ALTON,8, Yeah?
1951,JERRY,8, I'm Jerry. Elaine's friend.. and this is George.
1952,GEORGE,8," (Holds out his hand for a handshake) It's a great thrill 
              to meet you, Sir."
1953,ALTON,8, Sit down. Want a drink?
1954,JERRY,8, Sure.
1955,ALTON,8, (Summons waiter) What do you have?
1956,JERRY,8, (To waiter) I'll have a cranberry juice with two limes.
1957,GEORGE,8," And, I'll have a club soda with no ice."
1958,BENES,8," (Gives both Jerry and George a look) I'll have another Scotch 
              with plenty of ice."
1959,GEORGE,8, You like ice?
1960,ALTON,8, Huh?
1961,GEORGE,8," I said, do you like ice?"
1962,ALTON,8, Like it?
1963,GEORGE,8, Don't you think you get more without it?
1964,ALTON,8, (Pauses) Where's Elaine?
1965,JERRY,8," Well, we thought she was meeting you earlier. She's usually 
              pretty punctual. (Alton remains quiet) ..Don't you find that, George?"
1966,GEORGE,8," Yeah, yeah. She's punctual.. and she's been late sometimes."
1967,JERRY,8," Yeah, yeah. Sometimes she's on time, and sometimes she's 
              late."
1968,GEORGE,8, I guess today she's late.
1969,JERRY,8, It appears that way.
1970,GEORGE,8, Yep.
1971,JERRY,8, Yep.
1972,ALTON,8, Looks like rain.
1973,GEORGE,8," (Perks up) I know, I know, that's what they said."
1974,ALTON,8, Who said?
1975,GEORGE,8," The weather guy, Dr. Waldo."
1976,ALTON,8, I don't need anybody to tell me it's gonna rain.
1977,GEORGE,8," No, of course not. I didn't.."
1978,ALTON,8," All I have to do is stick my head out the window. (Waiter 
              shows up with the drinks) Which one's suppose to be the funny guy?"
1979,GEORGE,8," (Pointing at Jerry) Oh, he's the comedian."
1980,JERRY,8, I'm just a regular person.
1981,GEORGE,8," No, no. He's just being modest."
1982,ALTON,8," We had a funny guy with us in Korea. A tailgunner. They 
              blew his brains out all over the Pacific. (Long pause) There's nothing 
              funny about that."
1983,JERRY,8," Would you excuse me a minute? I'm gonna go to the bathroom. 
              I'll be right back."
1984,GEORGE,8," I just wanted to tell you that I really enjoyed Fair Game. 
              I thought it was just brilliant."
1985,ALTON,8, Drivel.
1986,GEORGE,8, Maybe some parts.
1987,ALTON,8, What parts?
1988,GEORGE,8," The drivel parts.. Oh my gosh, I just realized - I have 
              to make a phone call. I can believe.. would you.. (Gets up, and 
              leaves)"
1989,GEORGE,8, Thank you for leaving me alone with him!
1990,JERRY,8, That was brutal. I can't go back out there.
1991,GEORGE,8," Well, let's just leave."
1992,JERRY,8, Elaine'll kill me.
1993,GEORGE,8, Where is she?
1994,JERRY,8, She's gotta be here soon.
1995,GEORGE,8," How could she leave us alone with this lunatic? Ten more 
              minutes, and that's it! I'm leaving. I have to tell you, this guy 
              scares me."
1996,JERRY,8, The waiter was trembling.
1997,GEORGE,8," If she doesn't show up, we can't possibly have dinner with 
              him alone."
1998,JERRY,8, How are we gonna get out of it?
1999,GEORGE,8, We'll say we're frightened and we have to go home.
2000,JERRY,8," Yeah, that's good. He'd clunk our heads together like Moe."
2001,GEORGE,8," I don't know. Just start scratching. Tell him you have 
              the crabs. He was in the military. He'll understand that."
2002,[Setting,8, Night club]
2003,JERRY,8," All fathers are intimidating. They're intimidating because 
              they are fathers. Once a man has children, for the rest of his life, 
              his attitude is, ""To hell with the"
2004,[Setting,8, Hotel lobby]
2005,ALTON,8, Who'd you call?
2006,GEORGE,8," (Caught off guard) My uncle is having an operation. I just 
              wanted to see how he was."
2007,ALTON,8, What kind of operation?
2008,GEORGE,8, Bone marrow.
2009,MANAGER,8, Mister Benes?
2010,ALTON,8, Yes?
2011,MANAGER,8, A message for you. (Hands him a message)
2012,ALTON,8," From Elaine. She got tied up. She'll be here in thirty minutes. 
              (Jerry and George freeze)"
2013,[Setting,8, Hotel lobby]
2014,ALTON,8," Yeah, they should've taken care of Castro when they had 
              the chance. Like we did in Guatamala in 'fifty-three."
2015,JERRY,8," (Adding) Well, Guatamala."
2016,GEORGE,8," Sure, Guatamala."
2017,ALTON,8," (Gets up) Alright, you boys get yourselves together. We'll 
              head up to the restaurant. I'll leave a note for Elaine. I'm going 
              to the bathroom. (Leaves)"
2018,GEORGE,8," Come on, let's go!"
2019,JERRY,8, What about Elaine?
2020,GEORGE,8, To hell with Elaine!
2021,JERRY,8, She'll be furious.
2022,GEORGE,8, We're dying here!
2023,JERRY,8, That's her! She's here!
2024,ELAINE,8, I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. Where is Dad?
2025,GEORGE,8, (Mocking Alton's voice) He's in the bathroom.
2026,JERRY,8, Where have you been?!
2027,ELAINE,8," Kramer, that .. Kramer! I'm just about to leave, he calls 
              me up. He begs me to sit in his car for two minutes, so he can pick 
              up these birds.."
2028,JERRY,8," Oh, you didn't.."
2029,ELAINE,8," Well, he said he'd drive me here right after. So, I am 
              sitting in his car twenty minutes! he doesn't come down. I am freezing. 
              Then a cop comes by, tells me"
2030,JERRY,8," (After hearing Elaine's story, his is..) Great."
2031,GEORGE,8, Couldn't be better.
2032,ELAINE,8, Good. 'Cause Dad can make some people a little uncomfortable.
2033,JERRY,8," Oh, no, no."
2034,GEORGE,8, Get outta here..
2035,ELAINE,8," Man, Kramer! I could kill him."
2036,JERRY,8," I can't believe it. You know better than to get involved 
              with Kramer."
2037,ELAINE,8, He said he'd give me a lift.
2038,JERRY,8," Ah, the lift. Like the lure of the siren's song. Never what 
              it seems to be, yet who among us can resist?"
2039,GEORGE,8, Where do you come up with this stuff?
2040,ALTON,8," (Returns) Well, look who's here."
2041,ELAINE,8," Oh, Hi, Dad."
2042,ALTON,8," (Kisses Elaine) Hello, dear. Who's the lipstick for?"
2043,ELAINE,8, No one.
2044,ALTON,8, ..How's your mother?
2045,ELAINE,8, Fine.
2046,ALTON,8, How about you? Are you working?
2047,ELAINE,8," Yeah, I'm reading manuscripts for Pendant Publishing. I 
              told you ten times."
2048,ALTON,8," Pendant, those bastards.. Alright, boys. We'll go to that 
              Pakistani restaurant on 46th Street. You're not afraid of a little 
              spice, are you?"
2049,GEORGE,8," ""Master of the house, doling out the charm. Ready 
              with a handshake and an open.."""
2050,ALTON,8," Pipe down, chorus boy."
2051,ELAINE,8, Ohh.. it's snowing. It's beautiful.
2052,JERRY,8," (To George) Snow.. snow, that can't be good for suede, can 
              it?"
2053,GEORGE,8, I wouldn't think so.
2054,JERRY,8," What should I do? (To Alton) We're taking a cab, aren't 
              we?"
2055,ALTON,8, Cab? It's only five blocks.
2056,GEORGE,8, (To Jerry) Why don't you just turn it inside out?
2057,JERRY,8, Inside out! Great.
2058,ALTON,8, Wait a minute. What the hell do you call this?
2059,JERRY,8," Oh, I turned my jacket inside out."
2060,ALTON,8," Well, you look like a damn fool!"
2061,JERRY,8," (Like a child) Well, it's a new suede jacket. It might get 
              ruined."
2062,ALTON,8," Well, you're not going to walk down the street with my and 
              my daughter dressed like that! That's for damn sure!"
2063,GEORGE,8, It's only a few blocks.
2064,[Setting,8, Jerry's apartment]
2065,JERRY,8, (Into intercom) Elaine?
2066,ELAINE,8, Yeah.
2067,JERRY,8, Come on up.
2068,KRAMER,8, Hey.
2069,JERRY,8, Hey.
2070,KRAMER,8, I've gotta feed the birds.
2071,JERRY,8, So?..
2072,KRAMER,8, You got any of those mini Ritzes?
2073,JERRY,8, I can't believe I do.
2074,KRAMER,8," Yeah! ..Well, are you going out?"
2075,JERRY,8, Yeah.
2076,KRAMER,8," Hey, where's your new jacket? (Jerry points to the jacket 
              hanging in the bathroom. It's ruined, and unwearable) What? (Kramer 
              enters the bathroom,"
2077,JERRY,8, I was out in the snow last night.
2078,KRAMER,8, Don't youk now what that does to suede?
2079,JERRY,8," I have an idea. (Elaine enters) We can make the nine-thirty 
              at Cinema III."
2080,ELAINE,8," Okay.. (To Kramer) Hello. (To Jerry) Listen, thanks again 
              for coming last night. Dad said he had a great time."
2081,JERRY,8, Is he still in town?
2082,ELAINE,8," No, he's driving back to Maryland tonight."
2083,KRAMER,8," (Talking about the ruined jacket) So, uh.. what are you 
              gonna do with that one now?"
2084,JERRY,8, I don't know.
2085,KRAMER,8, Well?..
2086,ELAINE,8," (To Jerry) I didn't want to tell you this, but usually 
              he hates everyone."
2087,JERRY,8, Really?
2088,KRAMER,8, You gonna throw this out?
2089,JERRY,8," Well, I can't wear it."
2090,ELAINE,8," (To Jerry) Yeah, he like you though. Said you reminded 
              him of somebody he knew in Korea."
2091,KRAMER,8," Well, if you're just gonna throw it out, you know, I could 
              take it."
2092,JERRY,8," Yeah, go ahead, take it."
2093,ELAINE,8, Dad thinks George is gay.
2094,JERRY,8," Oh, because of all that singing?"
2095,ELAINE,8," No, he pretty much thinks everyone is gay."
2096,KRAMER,8," Hey, see, I like it like this. "
2097,ELAINE,8," (Pointing at the jacket Kramer's wearing) Isnt' that..? 
              (Jerry nods) Oh, is this fromt he snow last night? (Jerry nods again) 
              Ugh.. you know what you"
2098,JERRY,8, I'll try and remember that.
2099,KRAMER,8," (Talking about the leather jacket from the start of the 
              show) Boy, it's too bad you gave me this one too."
2100,JERRY,8," (Sarcastic) Yeah, too bad."
2101,KRAMER,8, I'm gonna have to do something about this lining.

2110,Jerry,9, So you didn't ask?

              office, "
2114,Jerry,9, He said wuss?

2116,Jerry,9, So you called. (They sit at counter)
2117,George,9," Right. And, and to cover my nervousness I started eating 
              an apple, "

2138,George,9, Yeah. We should do this again.

              clean "
2182,Jerry,9, No kidding. Did you tell him that was the reason?

              his "
2184,tub,9," germs were building a town in there - they were constructing 
              offices. "

2188,Jerry,9, She thinks you're a guy that doesn't like coffee.
2189,George,9," She invited me up. Coffee's not coffee, coffee is sex."

              o clock at "
2192,Elaine,9, Well some people drink coffee that late.

2194,watch. Everything was going along so great,9," she was laughing, I 
              was funny. I "
2195,Elaine,9," It's all in your head. All she knows is she had a good 
              time. I "
2196,George,9," I can't call her now, it's too soon. I'm planning a Wednesday 
              call."
2197,Elaine,9," Oh, why? I love it when guys call me the next day."
2198,George,9," Of course you do, but you're imagining a guy you like, 
              not a guy who "
2199,Elaine,9, All she'll think is that you like her.

              doesn't like "
2201,Elaine,9, I don't know what your parents did to you.

              Alright, "
2203,Jerry,9, I don't think so.
2204,Kramer,9, It's funny.
2205,Elaine,9, It is funny.

2207,George,9," Alright, I gotta make a call. Everybody out, come on."
2208,Jerry,9, Why do we have to leave?
2209,George,9," Because I can't call a woman with other people in the room. 
              Come "
2210,Elaine,9," Oh, see, this is the problem."
2211,Jerry,9, You're kicking me out of my house?

2219,George,9," Got her machine. I'm dead, I'm a dead man. That's it. I'm 
              dead, "
2220,Jerry,9, What did you say?
2221,George,9," I don't know what the hell I said. I gave her an ultimatum 
              and "
2222,now,9," 'Come and listen to the idiot. Hey everybody, the idiot's

              liked the "

2289,Jerry,9," But you know as soon as she gets in the apartment she's 
              going right "
2290,George,9," Or she goes for the bathroom. That's my only chance. Who 
              am I "
2291,Jerry,9," There's nothing to it. You lift the lid, it comes right 
              out."
2292,George,9, You do it for me.
2293,Jerry,9, What?
2294,George,9," Come on, it'll be so much easier."
2295,Jerry,9, How you gonna get me up there?
2296,George,9," I'll tell her I bumped into you, I'm giving you a ride 
              uptown."
2297,Jerry,9, And who makes the switch?
2298,George,9, You do.
2299,Jerry,9, I do.
2300,George,9," I can't do it. I'll, I'll keep her busy."
2301,Jerry,9, I can't get involved in this.
2302,George,9, I think I may be in love with this woman.
2303,Jerry,9, What if she sees me?
2304,George,9," Oh, you are such a wuss."
2305,Jerry,9, A wuss?
2306,George,9, Yeah.
2307,Jerry,9, Did you call me a wuss?
2308,"Outside apartment building, night. George and Jerry are sat on 
              a low wall",9,
2309,George,9, Well there is traffic. It might take her till eight-fifteen.
2310,George,9," A signal, right, erm, OK, er OK, the signal is, I'll call 
              out 'Tippy "
2311,Jerry,9, 'Tippy Toe?' I don't think so.
2312,George,9, You don't like 'Tippy toe?'
2313,Jerry,9, No 'Tippy toe.'
2314,George,9," Alright, er, OK I got it, erm, I'll sing."
2315,Jerry,9, What song?
2316,George,9," Erm, 'How do you solve a problem like Maria?'"
2317,Jerry,9, What is that?
2318,George,9," Oh, it's a lovely song. (Sings) How do you solve a problem 
              like "
2319,Jerry,9, Anything else?
2320,George,9, You pick it.
2321,Jerry,9, 'Lemon Tree'
2322,George,9," Peter, Paul and Mary."
2323,Jerry,9," No, Trini Lopez."
2324,Both,9, (Singing) Lemon tree very pretty and a lemon flower
2325,George,9, You got the tape?
2326,Jerry,9, (Produces tapes) Standard. Micro.
2327,George,9, How do you feel? Confident?
2328,Jerry,9, Feel good.
2329,George,9, You nervous?
2330,Jerry,9, Not at all.
2331,George,9," Get up, get up, it's her. Oh, the hell with this, I'm scared 
              to "
2332,George,9," Hey! What are you doing here? I thought I was supposed 
              to call you "
2333,George,9," I, I couldn't wait. I was too anxious to see you."
2334,Carol,9," Oh, that's so sweet."
2335,George,9," Oh, this is my friend, Jerry Seinfeld. I just bumped into 
              him "
2336,Jerry,9, All the time.
2337,Carol,9, It's nice to meet you.
2338,Jerry,9, Hi.
2339,Carol,9," So, I'm starving. Where are we gonna eat?"
2340,George,9," You know, we could go uptown, and that way we could give 
              Jerry a "
2341,Carol,9," OK. Let's go, I'm ready, where'd you park?"
2342,George,9, Don't you wanna go upstairs first?
2343,Carol,9," No, what for? I'll just give my bag to the doorman."
2344,Jerry,9," You know, I really need to use the bathroom."
2345,Carol,9," Oh well there's a bathroom in the coffee shop just next 
              door."
2346,George,9," Yes, yes, but er, I have to make a call, so..."
2347,Carol,9, Well they have a phone.
2348,George,9," I know Jerry. He has this phobia about public toilets. 
              I think we "
2349,Carol,9," (Aloud) You know, I think I will go upstairs. I can check 
              my "
2350,George,9," Right, right."
2351,"Inside Carol's apartment. Carol, Jerry and George enter",9,
2352,Carol,9, The bathroom's on the hall to the right.
2353,Jerry,9," Er, you know, why don't you go first, you just had a long 
              trip."
2354,Carol,9," No, I'm fine."
2355,Jerry,9," Uhmmm, you know, it's the damnedest thing, it went away."
2356,Carol,9, Oh that's weird.
2357,George,9," No, no that can happen. I've, er, I've read about that 
              in medical "
2358,Carol,9," Well, let me just check my messages, and we'll go."
2359,George,9," Uh, Carol, can I talk to you for a second? Right now."
2360,Carol,9, Sure.
2361,George,9," Please, this is very, very important. (Leads her to other 
              room)"
2362,George,9," (Shouts from other room) Uhh, tippy toe! Tippy toe! Lemon 
              tree!"
2363,Carol,9," (To Jerry) Now I know who you are. You're a comedian. I've 
              seen "
2364,Jerry,9, Right. I am.
2365,George,9," Carol, that's so rude. Please, I'm serious, just for a 
              moment, if "
2366,Jerry,9, (Shouts) Hey you two. I'm ready to go.
2367,Carol,9," That's what you had to tell me? Your father wears sneakers 
              in the "
2368,George,9, (To Jerry) Don't you find that strange?
2369,Jerry,9, Yes.
2370,Carol,9," Well, I'll just check my machine and we'll go. No, nothing 
              here, "
2371,George,9," Oh, uhhh..."
2372,Carol,9," Yours were hilarious, we were both cracking up. I just love 
              jokes "

2377,Stars,10," Jerry Seinfeld, Michael Richards, "
2378,[Setting,10, Night club]
2379,JERRY,10," Well, I painted my apartment again. I've been living in 
              this apartment for years and years, and every time I paint it, it 
              kinda gets me down. I look around,"
2380,[Setting,10, Jerry's apartment]
2381,JERRY,10, What did you do?
2382,KRAMER,10, Mousse. I moussed up.
2383,ELAINE,10, I guess it was just a matter of time.
2384,KRAMER,10," You know, I should've done this years ago. I mean, I feel 
              like I had two lives. My pre-mousse and now, I begin my post-mousse. 
              Hey, tell me the truth,"
2385,JERRY,10," Oh, look, its so subjective."
2386,ELAINE,10," I don't mean to interrupt or anything, but on Sunday, my 
              friend is having a brunch for the New York Marathon."
2387,KRAMER,10," Oh, I keep forgetting to enter that."
2388,ELAINE,10," She lives right above First Avenue, and says she has a 
              perfect view of the race. And she said I can invite some friends."
2389,JERRY,10, Maybe.
2390,HAROLD,10," No, I'm not going up there. (Manny screams out something 
              in Spanish)"
2391,JERRY,10, Harold and Manny.
2392,HAROLD,10," I'm not going. (Manny says something in Spanish, Jerry 
              goes out into the hall)"
2393,JERRY,10," Boys, boys."
2394,HAROLD,10," Oh, Jerry."
2395,JERRY,10," I slid the rent under your door, Harold. Did you get it?"
2396,HAROLD,10," Yeah, yeah.. (Joking) Hey, Jerry, would you like anything 
              from Mrs. Hudwalker's apartment? (Manny starts yelling at Harold 
              in Spanish) I was only"
2397,JERRY,10, She died? ..Mrs. Hudwalker died?
2398,HAROLD,10," Ninety-four years old. I found her yesterday. She didn't 
              have a wig on. It was horrifying."
2399,MANNY,10," Harold, (In Spanish) Come on, hurry up!"
2400,HAROLD,10," (To Manny) What's the matter with you?! I'm talking. So, 
              Jerry, you know anyone who needs an apartment?"
2401,JERRY,10, Are you kidding? You know my friend Elaine?
2402,HAROLD,10," Oh yeah, I like her. She always says ""hello"" 
              to me."
2403,JERRY,10," It's not promised to anybody? 'Cause she would take it in 
              a second."
2404,HAROLD,10," Well, Manny wanted it for his brother, but he got deported. 
              (Manny starts protesting in Spanish) What's the difference? It's 
              true."
2405,JERRY,10," So, it's okay? I could just tell her she can have it?"
2406,HAROLD,10," Sure, sure. She's getting a bargain, too. It's only four 
              hundred dollars a month. (Manny yells in Spanish) Okay.. (Manny 
              keeps talking in Spanish) Okay."
2407,KRAMER,10," (Talking about his hair) Hey, Harold, what do you think?"
2408,HAROLD,10," Manny, look, Kramer put mousse in his hair."
2409,MANNY,10, (In Spanish) It looks worse.
2410,KRAMER,10, (Not knowing what Manny said) Thanks.
2411,ELAINE,10, What was that all about?
2412,JERRY,10," Oh, nothing important."
2413,ELAINE,10, What's going on? What is that look?
2414,JERRY,10, What look? Nothing.
2415,ELAINE,10, Something's going on here.
2416,JERRY,10," I don't know if you should sit for this or not. Sitting 
              is good if you faint, but standing is good for jumping up and down.. 
              I can't decide."
2417,ELAINE,10," Jumping up and down? What are you talking about? C'mon. 
              Cough it up."
2418,JERRY,10," Oh, Elaine. You know the way I am - rarely ever thinking 
              of myself. My only concern is the welfare and happiness of those 
              close to me. Sure, it hurts"
2419,ELAINE,10, Would you please?
2420,JERRY,10, What would you say if I told you that..
2421,ELAINE,10, Told me what?!
2422,JERRY,10, ..I got you an apartment in this building.
2423,ELAINE,10, (Dumbfounded) No.
2424,JERRY,10, Yes.
2425,ELAINE,10, No.
2426,JERRY,10, Yes.
2427,ELAINE,10, You didn't.
2428,JERRY,10, I did.
2429,ELAINE,10, You got me an apartment in the building?!
2430,JERRY,10, I got you an apartment in the building.
2431,ELAINE,10, How did you..
2432,JERRY,10," Remember Mrs. Hudwalker? The ninety-four-year-old woman 
              who lived above me?"
2433,ELAINE,10, No.
2434,JERRY,10, She died.
2435,ELAINE,10, (Thrilled) She died?!
2436,JERRY,10, She died.
2437,ELAINE,10, She died!
2438,JERRY,10, And the rent's only four hundred dollars a month!
2439,ELAINE,10," Get out! (Pushes Jerry, he stumbles back) Four hundred 
              a month? Only four hundred a month?!"
2440,JERRY,10, Four hundred a month.
2441,ELAINE,10, And I'll be right upstairs?
2442,JERRY,10, Right upstairs.
2443,ELAINE,10, Right above you?
2444,JERRY,10, Right above me.
2445,ELAINE,10," Oh, we're neighbors. I'll be here all the time!"
2446,JERRY,10, (Suddenly having second thoughts) All the time..
2447,ELAINE,10," We can exchange keys so we can come in and out. Oh, this 
              is going to be great!"
2448,JERRY,10, ..All the time..
2449,[Setting,10, Night club]
2450,JERRY,10," The problem with talking is that nobody stops you from saying 
              the wrong thing. I think life would be a lot better if it was like 
              you're always making a movie."
2451,[Setting,10, Coffee shop]
2452,GEORGE,10," (Pays his bill) Thanks, see ya later, Donna. (Walks out, 
              he runs into Jerry outside the shop) What happened to you?"
2453,JERRY,10, You can't believe what I just did.
2454,GEORGE,10, What? What did you do?
2455,JERRY,10," I could tell you what I did, but you wouldn't believe it. 
              It's not believable."
2456,GEORGE,10, What did you do?
2457,JERRY,10, How could I have done that?
2458,GEORGE,10, Done what?
2459,JERRY,10," I told Elaine about an apartment opening up in my building. 
              She's going to move in."
2460,GEORGE,10, Elaine's moving into your building?
2461,JERRY,10, Yes. Right above me.
2462,GEORGE,10, Right above you?
2463,JERRY,10, Yes.
2464,GEORGE,10, You're gonna be neighbors.
2465,JERRY,10, I know. Neighbors.
2466,GEORGE,10, She's right above you?
2467,JERRY,10, Right above me.
2468,GEORGE,10, How could you do that?
2469,JERRY,10," 'Cause I'm an idiot! You may think you're an idiot, but 
              with all due respect - I'm a much bigger idiot than you are."
2470,GEORGE,10," Don't insult me, my friend. Remember who you're talking 
              to. No one's a bigger idiot than me."
2471,JERRY,10, Did you ever ask an ex-girlfriend to move into your building?
2472,GEORGE,10, Did you ever go to a singles weekend in the Poconos?
2473,JERRY,10," She's right in my building! Right above me! Every time I 
              come in the building, I'm gonna have to sneak around like a cat 
              burglar."
2474,GEORGE,10," You're doomed. You're gonna have to have all your sex at 
              women's apartments. It'll be like a permanent road trip. Forget 

              about the home bed"
2475,JERRY,10, But I need the home bed advantage!
2476,GEORGE,10," Of course, we all do."
2477,JERRY,10," (Gesturing to the coffee shop) Come in for two minutes and 
              sit with me."
2478,GEORGE,10, I was just in there. It's embarrassing.
2479,JERRY,10," Oh, who's gonna know?"
2480,GEORGE,10, They saw me walk out.
2481,JERRY,10, Two minutes.
2482,JERRY,10," My censoring system broke down. You know that little guy 
              in your head who watches everything you say? Makes sure you don't 
              make a mistake? He went"
2483,GEORGE,10," My censor quit two years ago. He checked into a clinic. 
              Emotionally exhausted."
2484,JERRY,10," ..So, is there any way out of this Elaine thing?"
2485,GEORGE,10, Tough.
2486,JERRY,10," You know, the water pressure's terrible in my building.. 
              and she loves a good shower."
2487,GEORGE,10," I don't think anyone's turned down an apartment because 
              of a weak shower spray."
2488,JERRY,10," If they were fanatic about showers, they might."
2489,GEORGE,10," For that rent, she'd take a bath in the toilet tank if 
              she had to.."
2490,JERRY,10," Look at that woman feeding her baby greasy, disgusting, 
              coffee shop corned beef hash. Isn't that child abuse?"
2491,GEORGE,10," I'd like to have a kid. Of course, you have to have a date 
              first.. remember my friend, Adam, from Detroit?"
2492,JERRY,10," Yeah, the guy with the flat head?"
2493,GEORGE,10," He's a cube.. anyway, he got married six months ago. he 
              told me ever since he's been wearing a wedding band, women have 
              been coming on to him"
2494,JERRY,10," Yeah, I've heard that about wedding bands."
2495,GEORGE,10, (Joking) I wonder if that's really true.
2496,JERRY,10," That would be an interesting sociological experiment. You 
              know, Kramer has his father's band. He'd loan it to you."
2497,[Setting,10, Apartment buliding hallway]
2498,GEORGE,10," Thanks a lot. I""ll give it back to you in a week."
2499,KRAMER,10," You know, I don't even know why you're fooling around with 
              this ring. I've been telling you, get yourself some plugs, or a 
              piece."
2500,GEORGE,10, I'm not doing that.
2501,KRAMER,10," Oh, man. You know, you're crazy. You're a good looking 
              guy. What do you want to walk around like that for?"
2502,GEORGE,10," No, I'll put half a can of mousse in my head like you."
2503,HAROLD,10," I told you I don't like these sponges, they're too small! 
              I want a big sponge! (Manny yells) You can't pick up anything with 
              these! There's no absorption!"
2504,JERRY,10," Boys, boys."
2505,HAROLD,10," Hi, Jerry."
2506,HAROLD,10," Hello, Jerry. (Says something in Spanish to Harold)"
2507,HAROLD,10," Okay.. your friend can't have the apartment, Jerry."
2508,JERRY,10, What?
2509,HAROLD,10," Because somebody offered Manny five thousand dollars for 
              the apartment. I don't want to do it. Manny wants to do it. (Manny 
              yells) Because it's true!"
2510,JERRY,10," Hey, hey. I understand. You're businessmen. (Manny talks 
              in Spanish)"
2511,HAROLD,10," Oh, now, he says that if your friend has five thousand 
              dollars, we'll give it to her."
2512,JERRY,10," Well, that's a lot of money. But, if that's the way it's 
              gotta be, that's the way it's gotta be. (Goes back to his apartment) 
              You know, I used to think that the"
2513,GEORGE,10, What happened to you?
2514,JERRY,10," Religion, my friend, that's what happened to me. Because, 
              I have just been informed that it's going to cost Elaine the sum 
              of five thousand dollars to get the"
2515,GEORGE,10, Five thousand dollars? She doesn't have five thousand dollars!
2516,JERRY,10, Of course she doesn't have five thousand dollars!
2517,GEORGE,10," So, she can't get the apartment."
2518,JERRY,10, Can't get it.
2519,GEORGE,10," So, she doesn't move in."
2520,JERRY,10," No move. So, you see, it's all part of a divine plan."
2521,GEORGE,10, And how does the baldness fit into that plan?
2522,JERRY,10, (Into the intercom) Elaine?
2523,ELAINE,10, Yeah.
2524,JERRY,10," (Unlocks the main door. To George) Alright, this is going 
              to require some great acting now. I have to pretend I'm disappointed. 
              You're going to really see"
2525,GEORGE,10," Are you kidding?! I lie ever second of the day. My whole 
              life is a sham!"
2526,JERRY,10," 'Cause you know, I love Elaine."
2527,GEORGE,10, Of course you do.
2528,JERRY,10," But you know.. not in the building. Really, I feel terrible 
              about this. My intentions were good. What can I do? Tell me.."
2529,(Enter Elaine) ELAINE,10," (To someone in the hallway) No, I'll be 
              seeing you. (Starts to sing) ""Good morning, good morning.."" 
              Have you ever gotten up in the morning"
2530,JERRY,10, (Looks at the checks) Well.. there's a little bit of a problem.
2531,ELAINE,10," Oh, I know. There's a weak shower spray, I know. I've already 
              thought about it, and I'm switching to baths. As Winston Churchill 
              said, ""Why stand when"
2532,JERRY,10," No, someone offered Harold and Manny five thousand for the 
              apartment. I'm sure they'd just as soon give it to you, but you'd 
              have to come up with that"
2533,ELAINE,10, Five thousand dollars? I don't have five thousand dollars.
2534,JERRY,10, I know.
2535,ELAINE,10, How am I going to get five thousand dollars?
2536,JERRY,10, I have no idea.
2537,KRAMER,10," Hey, my new neighbor!"
2538,ELAINE,10, I'm not moving in.
2539,KRAMER,10, What?
2540,ELAINE,10, They want five thousand dollars now.
2541,KRAMER,10," So, okay. What's the problem?"
2542,ELAINE,10, I don't have five thousand dollars.
2543,KRAMER,10," C'mon, you can come up with five thousand dollars.. Jerry, 
              you don't have five thousand dollars you can led her? Come on."
2544,JERRY,10," Yeah, well, I didn't.. Is that something you want to borrow?"
2545,ELAINE,10," No, that's too much money to borrow."
2546,KRAMER,10, Loan her the money. You can afford it.
2547,JERRY,10, She doesn't want to borrow the money.
2548,KRAMER,10," Oh, c'mon. She'll pay you back. What's five grand between 
              friends?"
2549,ELAINE,10, Of course I'd pay you back..
2550,KRAMER,10," Yeah, so what's the problem?"
2551,JERRY,10, Who said there's a problem?
2552,KRAMER,10, He said he'd loan you the money.
2553,ELAINE,10," Well Jerry, it might take a while for me to pay you back. 
              Maybe a few years. How do you feel about that?"
2554,KRAMER,10, That's okay. He doesn't care.
2555,ELAINE,10," You know, money can sometimes come between friends."
2556,KRAMER,10, Get outta here.
2557,ELAINE,10, Let me think about it.
2558,KRAMER,10, What's to think about?
2559,ELAINE,10," I don't know.. I don't know. Five thousand.. let me just 
              take one more look at it. (Leaves)"
2560,JERRY,10," It was all over! Taken care of. Done! Finished. Five thousand.. 
              Where's she gonna get five thousand? She doesn't have five thousand. 
              Clean. Good bye."
2561,KRAMER,10, You didn't want her in the building?
2562,JERRY,10," No, I didn't!"
2563,KRAMER,10," Well, then what did you loan her the five thousand for? 
              Oh, look, maybe she won't take it.. I mean, she did say that she 
              was going to think about it."
2564,JERRY,10," People don't turn down money! It's what separates us from 
              the animals."
2565,KRAMER,10," I still don't understand what the problem is having her 
              in the building."
2566,JERRY,10," Let me explain something to you.. You see, you're not normal. 
              You're a great guy, I love you, but you're a pod. I, on the other 
              hand, am a human being. I"
2567,KRAMER,10, Because I'm a pod?
2568,ELAINE,10, I'll take it!
2569,[Setting,10, Roxanne's apartment]

2571,ELAINE,10," Oh, hi, Roxanne. Nice to be here. These are my friends. 
              This is George, and this is Jerry. (They exchange greetings) Jerry's 
              the one who got me my new"
2572,ROXANNE,10," So, you're Elaine's hero."
2573,JERRY,10," Yeah, it's my life's work."
2574,ROXANNE,10," There are so few true heros left in this world. (Jerry's 
              attracted to Roxanne, Elaine notices)"
2575,GEORGE,10," (Showing off his wedding band) Yeah, my wife couldn't make 
              it today. She's got some thing with her mother.. Who know's what 
              going on with her. Don't"
2576,JERRY,10," Well, better load up on some carbos before the race. (Starts 
              selecting food from the tables)"
2577,ROXANNE,10," Oh, the marathon is great, isn't it?"
2578,JERRY,10," Oh, yes. Particularily if your not in it."
2579,ROXANNE,10, I wish we had a view of the finish line.
2580,JERRY,10," What's to see? A woman from Norway, a guy from Kenya, and 
              twenty thousand losers."
2581,GEORGE,10," ..Yeah, my wife started getting on me about the lawn today. 
              I'm tellin' ya, it's one thing after another."
2582,RITA,10, Is she here?
2583,GEORGE,10," No, she's working."
2584,RITA,10, What does she do?
2585,GEORGE,10," She's an.. entymologist - you know, bees, flies, gnats. 
              What about you?"
2586,RITA,10," I work for the Director of Madison Square Garden. It's great! 
              I can get free tickets to any sporting even in New York. (George 
              is stunned) Anyway, she's a"
2587,GEORGE,10," But.. (She leaves, George is standing there)"
2588,ROXANNE,10, Hi Stan. Joanne.
2589,ELAINE,10," Jerry, this is Joanne, and this is Stan. They're in my 
              short story class with Roxanne and me. Hey, Jerry just got me a 
              great apartment in his building!"
2590,JOANNE,10," Well, Jerry, it'll be nice having a close friend nearby?"
2591,JERRY,10, Fantastic..
2592,STAN,10, She can pop in whenever she wants.
2593,JERRY,10, I know.
2594,JOANNE,10, She doesn't even need to knock!
2595,JERRY,10, It's tremendous.
2596,STAN,10, Anytime of day.
2597,JERRY,10, I'm in heaven.
2598,ELAINE,10," Oh, Rita come here. This is Jerry. He's the one who got 
              me the apartment."
2599,RITA,10," Oh, Hi. (Calling to someone) bob, this is the guy who got 
              Elaine the apartment."
2600,GEORGE,10," I'm sorry, I don't see the big deal about being a matador. 
              The bull charges, you move the cape, wha't so hard? (The both laugh 
              flirtingly)"
2601,SUSIE,10," So, are you really married? Because, I've actually heard 
              of single guys who wear wedding bands to attrack women."
2602,GEORGE,10, You'd have to be a real loser to try something like that.
2603,SUSIE,10," That's too bad, because I really have a thing for bald guys 
              with glasses. (Shrugs, smiles, then leaves George)"
2604,RITA,10, Hey everybody! Here come the runners!
2605,ELAINE,10," So you and Roxanne are hitting it off, huh?"
2606,JERRY,10," Oh, I wouldn't quite say that."
2607,ELAINE,10," Really? From a distance, you seemed to be coming on to 
              her."
2608,JERRY,10, I'm a guy.. it always looks like that.
2609,ELAINE,10," Because, I was thinking.. are you at all concerned that 
              living in the same building will, y'kno.. cramp our styles?"
2610,JERRY,10, Na..
2611,ELAINE,10," Because, I was worried that there might be a situation 
              in which one of us come home with somebody, it could get a little 
              uncomfortable. But - as long as"
2612,JANICE,10," I've never been able to be with just one person. I can, 
              however, carry on strictly physical relationships which can last 
              for years and years. It's a shame"
2613,GEORGE,10," (Frantically tries to take the ring off) I'm not. It's 
              just a sociological experiment!"
2614,JANICE,10, Please.. (Walks away)
2615,JERRY,10," You have no idea what an idiot it. Elaine just gave me a 
              chance to get out and I didn't take it. (Points to himself) This 
              is an idiot."
2616,GEORGE,10," Is that right? (Showing him up) I just threw away a lifetime 
              of guilt-free sex and floor seats for ever sporting event in Madison 
              Square Garden. So please,"
2617,ROXANNE,10, (Yelling out the window) You're all winners!

2620,JERRY,10," (Into the phone) George, I didn't sleep at all last night.. 
              I decided I have to tell her.. I'm just going to be honest. That's 
              all.. Yes, I'm nervous.. Are you"
2621,KRAMER,10," Well, it's all taken care of. Everything's cool."
2622,JERRY,10, What? What's cool?
2623,KRAMER,10, Elaine.
2624,JERRY,10, What are you talking about?
2625,KRAMER,10," I just found a guy who's willing to pay ten thousand dollars 
              for the apartment."
2626,JERRY,10, You what?! Get out! Ten thousand?
2627,KRAMER,10, (Nods) Cash.
2628,JERRY,10, Who would pay that much?
2629,KRAMER,10, He's in the music business.
2630,JERRY,10," Elaine would never borrow that much money! (Hugs Kramer, 
              then grabs him by the cheeks) Kramer, my God, man! This is beautiful! 
              I think I'm in the clear"
2631,KRAMER,10," Well, occasionally, I like to help the humans."
2632,[Setting,10, Jerry's apartment]
2633,ELAINE,10, Wow. You're right. That is loud.
2634,JERRY,10, It's just unbelievable.
2635,ELAINE,10, They rehearse all the time?
2636,JERRY,10," All the time. I've been up there six times. They refuse 
              to stop. I can't live like this. I don't know what I'm gonna do. 
              I'm heading for breakdown! (To Harold)"
2637,HAROLD,10, I'm not going up. It stinks up there.
2638,JERRY,10, Manny..
2639,MANNY,10, (In Spanish) They're allowed to play until eleven o' clock.
2640,HAROLD,10," I'm not the one who said eleven o' clock. He makes up his 
              own rules."
2641,ELAINE,10," Boy, too bad. If I was up there, you'd never hear a peep 
              out of me. I'm as quiet as a mouse."
2642,KRAMER,10," (Talking about the music) Oh, I love the one they do right 
              after this one!"
2643,[Setting,10, Night club]
2644,JERRY,10," I don't know. What do you do when a neighbor is making, 
              like, a lot of noise at three o' clock in the morning? I mean, can 
              you knock on someone's door"
2645,[Setting,11, Night club]
2646,JERRY,11," I have to tell you that I did some very exciting news recently, 
        and I don't know if I should really tell you exactly what it is because 
        it's really not a definite thing yet. Well, I will tell you what I know 
        so far. According to the information that I have in the envelope that 
        I've received, it seems that I may have already won some very valuable 
        prizes. Well, thank you, thank you very much, well thank you. It's very 
        nice to hear that. But, in all honesty, I have to say, I didn't even know 
        I was in this thing. But, according to the readout, it looks like I am 
        among the top people that they are considering. You know, that's what 
        annoys me about the sweepstakes companies, they always tease you with 
        that, ""You may have already won."" I'd like once for a sweepstakes 
        company to have some guts, come out with the truth, just tell people the 
        truth one time. Send out envelopes, ""You have definitely lost!"" 
        You turn it over, giant printing, ""Not even close!"" You open 
        it up, there's this whole letter of explanation, ""Even we cannot 
        believe how badly you've done in this contest."""

        (They get it through)"
2649,GEORGE,11, That took awhile.
2650,JERRY,11, (Sarcastic) Don't get up.
2651,GEORGE,11," I'd like to help, but my neck.."
2652,GEORGE,11, So how long has it been in the basement?
2653,JERRY,11," Since my grandfather died. I was suppose to send it down to my 
        parents in Florida, but they didn't want it. They told me to get rid of 
        it, but I felt funny and then I sort of forgot about it. And it's been 
        sitting down there for three years.. until he saw it. (To Kramer) Alright, 
        so, just take what you want and let's get it out of here."
2654,GEORGE,11, What's in it?
2655,JERRY,11, Grandpa clothes. I can't wear them.
2656,KRAMER,11," (Pulls out some socks) You want these? Knee socks. You don't 
        wear knee socks."
2657,JERRY,11," No, go ahead. (Looks around his apartment) Look at this place. 
        I can't wait to get it cleaned."
2658,GEORGE,11, I know someone who'll do it. She's good. She's honest.
2659,JERRY,11," No, Elaine got this writer friend from Finland, Rava. Her boyfriend 
        goes to Columbia grad school, and he's suppose to do it."
2660,GEORGE,11," Students can't clean. It's anathema. (Jerry's confused) ..They 
        don't like it."
2661,JERRY,11, How long have you been waiting to squeeze that into a conversation?
2662,KRAMER,11," Now this, I like."
2663,GEORGE,11, Wait a second. I can't believe this! Let me see this.
2664,KRAMER,11," (Getting possesive) Wait, wait, wait.."
2665,GEORGE,11, Let me just see it.
2666,KRAMER,11, Come on..
2667,GEORGE,11," Let me just see it for a second. Oh my God, it's exactly the 
        same!"
2668,JERRY,11, What?
2669,GEORGE,11," When I was ten years old, my parents had this very same statue 
        on the mantle of our apartment. Exactly. And, one day, I grabbed it, and 
        I was using it as a microphone. I was singing, ""MacArthur Park"", 
        and I got to the part about, ""I'll never have that recipe again,"" 
        and it slipped out of my hand and it broke. My parents looked at me like 
        I smashed the ten commandments. To this day, they bring it up. It was 
        the single most damaging experience in my life, aside from seeing my father 
        naked."
2670,KRAMER,11," C'mon, George. I saw it first."
2671,GEORGE,11," No, Kramer. I have to have this statue."
2672,KRAMER,11," No, I got dibs!"
2673,GEORGE,11," What? No dibs! I need this statue. C'mon, give it!"
2674,JERRY,11," (Stepping in) Spread out, spread out you numbskulls. Why don't 
        you just settle it like mature adults?"
2675,KRAMER,11, Potato man!
2676,GEORGE,11," No, no, no potato man.. Inka-dink."
2677,KRAMER,11, Okay.. start with me.
2678,GEORGE,11," Yeah, good, good."
2679,JERRY,11," Inka-dink, a bottle of ink. The cork fell out, and you stink. 
        Not because you're dirty, not because you're clean - just because you 
        kissed the girl behind the magazine.. (He lands on Kramer, then completes 
        the rhyme) And you are it! (Lands on George)"
2680,KRAMER,11," What?! Wait a minute. No, no, no. What are you doing? No, no, 
        oh, oh, okay. He's out. I get it."
2681,GEORGE,11," No, no, no, no.. I'm ""it"". I win."
2682,JERRY,11," No, he's it. He wins. ""It"" is good."
2683,KRAMER,11, Do over - start with him.
2684,JERRY,11," No, no, no, come on, Kramer. Now, you got the socks."
2685,KRAMER,11," Alright, you can have it. Okay, I'm gonna take the suit, and 
        the shoes, and the hat."
2686,JERRY,11," Alright, c'mon. Let's go."
2687,KRAMER,11," Hey, I'll look like Joe Friday in Dragnet. (Hums out the theme 
        song)"
2688,GEORGE,11, (In shock) I can't believe I won at Inka-dink.
2689,JERRY,11," Come on, let's go. (They go to the door. George sets the statue 
        down) Aren't you gonna take it?"
2690,GEORGE,11," No, no, no, I don't want to carry it around all night. I'll pick 
        it up later."
2691,GOERGE,11, (To Kramer) What about your stuff?
2692,KRAMER,11," Oh, uh, well - okay. (Balls up the clothes he just got, and throws 
        them into his apartment, and leaves)"
2693,JERRY,11," Alright, let's go. Hey, you know, you owe me one."
2694,GEORGE,11, What?
2695,JERRY,11," The Inka-dink.. you were ""It""."
2696,GEORGE,11," ""It""'s bad?"

2700,ELAINE,11, You told them that?
2701,RAVA,11, Of course.
2702,ELAINE,11, This is so fantastic. I don't know how to thank you.
2703,JERRY,11," (Frantic) So, where's this boyfriend of yours? I can't wait much 
        longer. I've got a flight."
2704,ELAINE,11," Oh, probably caught in traffic."
2705,RAVA,11, (Serious) Or maybe he's dead.
2706,JERRY,11," (Joking) So what do you write, children's books?"
2707,RAVA,11, That's Ray.
2708,RAY,11," Ah, greetings, greetings, and salutations. I beg your forgiveness. 
        My tardiness was unavoidable. Rava, my love. Elaine, my dear friend.. 
        And you must be Jerry. Lord of the manor. Ah, my liege. A pleasure to 
        serve you. (Bows)"

        there's that guilt when you have someone cleaning your house. You know, 
        you're sitting there on your sofa, and they go by with the vacuum, ""I'm 
        really sorry about this. I don't know why I let that stuff over there."" 
        And that's why I could never be a maid, because I'd have an attitude. 
        I'd find them, whereever they are in the house, ""Oh, I suppose you 
        couldn't do this? No, don't get up, let me clean up your filth. No, you 
        couldn't dust. No, this is too tough, isn't it?"""

        cleaned the little one-inch area between the refrigerator and the counter.

2740,ELAINE,11, You have a statue? I never saw a statue.
2741,JERRY,11, My grandfather gave me a statue!
2742,ELAINE,11, Since when?
2743,JERRY,11," What's the difference?! That's the one! He ripped me off! This 
        guy ripped me off!"
2744,RAY,11, Do you take sugar?
2745,JERRY AND ELAINE,11, Uhh.. no.
2746,JERRY,11, I can't believe it! This guy ripped me off!
2747,ELAINE,11, Do you realize what you're saying?
2748,JERRY,11," Yes! This guy ripped me off! He stole that statue right out of 
        my house!"
2749,RAY,11, Lemon?
2750,JERRY AND ELAINE,11," (Causual) Uh.. sure, yeah.."
2751,ELAINE,11, Are you sure?
2752,JERRY,11, Pretty sure! Ninety-nine percent sure.
2753,ELAINE,11, Ninety-nine percent sure?!
2754,RAY,11," Ah, sweet elixir. It's fragrant nectar - a soothing balm for the 
        soul."
2755,RAY,11, The pastries!
2756,ELAINE,11, Maybe it just looks the same. Maybe it's just a coincidence.
2757,JERRY,11," Coincidence? This guy's in my apartment and then, just by coincidence, 
        he has the same exact statue in his apartment."
2758,ELAINE,11, I never saw the statue.
2759,JERRY,11, I had a statue! What should I do?
2760,ELAINE,11, I don't know.
2761,JERRY,11," ..I'll call Kramer. He can check my house. (Grabs the phone, and 
        dials)"
2762,ELAINE,11," Oh Jerry, don't blow this for me."
2763,JERRY,11," Don't worry.. (Whispering into the phone) Kramer! Kramer!.. It's 
        Jerry!.. Jerry! .. from next door!.. Never mind where I am!.. Yes, Jerry 
        Seinfeld!.. (Rava enters with a manuscript. Jerry starts talking casually)"
2764,Jerry,11," Ma, I told ya, just dip the bread in the batter, and put in right 
        in the pan. Okay, bye. (Hangs up) My mother.. She forgot how to make French 
        Toast. You know how mothers are."
2765,RAVA,11," My mother left us when I was six years old. All seven of us. He 
        ever heard from her again. I hope she's rotting in an alley somewhere."
2766,JERRY,11," My mom's down in Florida.. she's go one of those condos.. Hot 
        down there in the summer. You ever been down there?"
2767,RAY,11," I love these pastries. You know, in Scandinavian mythology, the 
        pastries were the food of the gods."
2768,JERRY,11," ..Listen, I just remembered.. I'm ..uh, getting a facial."
2769,ELAINE,11," (Takes the manuscript) Oh, see you tomarrow morning."
2770,RAY,11," Oh, how about dinner?"
2771,JERRY,11," No, I don't eat dinner. Dinner's for suckers. (They leave)"
2772,"(Scene ends)
        [Setting",11, Jerry's apartment]
2773,JERRY,11," (On the phone) Uh huh.. yeah.. Okay, thanks anyway. Bye. (Hangs 
        up) Nope, the cop says it's my word against his. There's nothing they 
        can do."
2774,KRAMER,11, Let's go get him.
2775,JERRY,11," Yeah, right."
2776,GEORGE,11, We can't just let him get away with this.
2777,JERRY,11," Do you realize how crazy he had to be to do something like this? 
        He knew I was gonna know it's missing, and he took it! And of all things 
        to take - I left my watch, tape recorder, stereo. He's crazy."
2778,KRAMER,11, You wanta go get him?
2779,ELAINE,11," Well, then, if he's crazy you should just forget it."
2780,GEORGE,11," Forget it? I already called my parents. I told them to expect 
        the surprise of a lifetime. My mother's making her roasted potatoes!"
2781,ELAINE,11," George, do you realize that Rava's asked me to edit her book?"
2782,GEORGE,11, Who is this Rava?
2783,KRAMER,11, I say we get him.
2784,ELAINE,11, No!
2785,GEORGE,11, Let me just call him.
2786,JERRY,11," I'll call him. (Picks up the cordless phone. Kramer, George, and 
        Elaine all struggle for control of the other - so they can listen in on 
        the conversation. As Jerry's talking, the three others still fight) Hello, 
        Ray? ..Hi, Ray, this is Rava's friend, Elaine's frined, Jerry.. The King 
        of Comedy.. right. Listen, you know that statue on your mantle, the one 
        with the blue lady? (To Kramer and George) Will you shut up?! (To Ray) 
        Yeah, you don't want to talk about it over the phone? You don't want Rava 
        to hear? ..Yeah, I understand.. You know that coffee shop near my house, 
        Monk's? ..Alright, tomarrow. One o' clock. Great, okay, bye. (Hangs up)"
2787,ELAINE,11," (Scrambling) Alright, look, look, look, Let's say he stole it."
2788,GEORGE,11," Oh, he stole it?"
2789,ELAINE,11," C'mon, you can't do anything about it. The cops won't do anything. 
        What, are you going to fight him? Why don't you just.. forget it?"
2790,JERRY AND GEORGE,11, No.
2791,"(Scene ends)
        [Setting",11, Coffee shop]
2792,GEORGE,11," (To Jerry, without looking at him) I thought you said one o' 
        clock."
2793,JERRY,11," Relax, he's late. He's always late. It's part of his ""M.O."""
2794,GEORGE,11," Remember, don't take any crap."
2795,JERRY,11," Yeah, yeah.. don't worry about it."
2796,GEORGE,11, I'll be right here.
2797,JERRY,11," (Sarcastic) That's comforting.. Shh. He's here. (Greeting him) 
        Ray?"
2798,RAY,11," (Stands next to the table) Oh, Jerry. I can't believe you asked 
        me about that statue. Do you know how much trouble you could've got me 
        into?"
2799,JERRY,11," ..Well, I didn't.."
2800,RAY,11," Rava was standing right next to me. I never told her where I got 
        the statue."
2801,GEORGE,11, (Muttering to himself) I wonder why.
2802,JERRY,11," Well, just give it back, and I won't say anything."
2803,RAY,11, Give it back?
2804,JERRY,11, Yeah.
2805,RAY,11, What are you talking about?
2806,JERRY,11, What are you talking about?
2807,GEORGE,11, (Muttering) What is he talking about..
2808,RAY,11, I'm talking about the statue.
2809,JERRY,11," Yeah, me too."
2810,RAY,11, Give it back to whom?
2811,JERRY,11, Me.
2812,GEORGE,11," (To himself) Yeah, him."
2813,RAY,11, You?
2814,JERRY,11, Yeah. Me.
2815,RAY,11, I'm not getting this.
2816,GEORGE,11, (To himself) You already got it.
2817,JERRY,11," Ray, I had a statue in my house. You were in my house - and then 
        I saw it in your house."
2818,RAY,11, What are you saying?
2819,JERRY,11, What am I saying?
2820,GEORGE,11, (To himself) Take a wild guess.
2821,RAY,11, Are you saying I stole your statue?
2822,GEORGE,11, (To himself) What a mind.
2823,JERRY,11," Well, I.."
2824,RAY,11, I can't believe what I'm hearing.
2825,JERRY,11, I can't believe what I'm hearing.
2826,GEORGE,11, (to himself) I can't believe what I'm hearing.
2827,RAY,11," For your information, I got that statue at a pawn shop."
2828,GEORGE,11, (To Himself) A pawn shop?
2829,JERRY,11, A pawn shop?
2830,RAY,11, Yes. In Chinatown with the money I earned cleaning people's apartments.
2831,GEORGE,11, (To himself) And cleaning them out.
2832,JERRY,11," Oh, excuse me.. Look, Ray, you were the only person in my house."
2833,RAY,11," What's behind this? It's Rava, isn't it?"
2834,GEORGE,11, (To himself) Again with the Rava.
2835,RAY,11, You want her.
2836,JERRY,11," (Joking) No, she's a little too cheery for me."
2837,RAY,11," (Losing it) She's from Finland, for crying out loud. Finland! Do 
        you understand?!"
2838,JERRY,11, I know Finland. They're neutral.
2839,RAY,11, Is it me? Do I rub you the wrong way?
2840,JERRY,11," No, I actually find you quite charming.. a bit verbose at times."
2841,GEORGE,11," (Mocking) ""Oh, I find you so charming"" ..You wuss."
2842,JERRY,11, (To George) Did you call me a wuss?
2843,RAY,11, What did you say?
2844,JERRY,11, I said luss.. I'm at a luss..
2845,RAY,11, I would just love to take you down to the shop where I got it.
2846,JERRY,11," That's not necessary. (George slams his menu down on the table 
        in anger) You know, maybe it's not that bad an idea."
2847,RAY,11," And I would love to. Nothing would please me more. But, unfortunately, 
        the guy retired and moved to Singapore."
2848,GEORGE,11, (Muttering to himself) Singapore?! Do you hear this?
2849,RAY,11," If you really want, maybe I can contact the guy in Singapore aand 
        have him make a photostat of the receipt and send it over."
2850,GEORGGE,11," That's it! That's it! I can't take it. I can't take it anymore! 
        (Gets up, turns around, and confronts Ray) You stole the statue! You're 
        a theif! You're a liar!"
2851,JERRY,11, (Pleading) George.
2852,RAY,11, (To Jerry) Who is this?
2853,GEORGE,11," I'm the judge and the jury, pal. And the verdict is.. guilty!"
2854,RAY,11, What's going on here?
2855,GEORGE,11, GUILTY!
2856,RAY,11, Your friend is crazy.
2857,GEORGE,11," Oh, I'm crazy!"
2858,JERRY,11," (Still pleading) George, george.."
2859,RAY,11, I've got to get going. I have a class.
2860,GEORGE,11," Oh ho! Class, huh? At Columbia? Let me tell you something, pal. 
        I called the registrar's office. I checked you out. They have no record 
        of a Ray Thomas at that school! You liar!"
2861,RAY,11," Well, that's because I'm registered under my full legal name, Raymond 
        Thomas Wochinski. Ray Thomas is my professional name."
2862,GEORGE,11, You mean alias.
2863,RAY,11, You are starting to make me angry.
2864,GEORGE,11," Well, that was bound to happen!"
2865,RAY,11," (To Jerry) I hope you think about what you've done here today.. 
        and if you want to call and apologize, you know where to reach me. (Goes 
        to leave)"
2866,JERRY,11," Hey, Ray."
2867,RAY,11, (Stops) Yes?
2868,JERRY,11," How did you get the goop out of the top of the dishwashing liquid? 
        It was like a brand-new nozzle!"
2869,"(Scene ends)
        [Setting",11, Pendant publishing]
2870,ELAINE,11, Nervous?
2871,RAVA,11, Why should I be?
2872,ELAINE,11, Yeah. Right.
2873,RAVA,11, Your notes are very insightful.
2874,ELAINE,11, The book is great. Did you go out last night?
2875,RAVA,11, No. We made love on the floor like two animals. Ray is insatiable.
2876,ELAINE,11, They all are..
2877,RAVA,11, Was Jerry?
2878,ELAINE,11, I can't remember..
2879,RAVA,11," You know, Ray is very upset over these accusations."
2880,ELAINE,11," Oh, well, I'm staying out of this one. This is between them. 
        I am not getting involved."
2881,RAVA,11, (Annoyed) So you think he stole it?!
2882,ELAINE,11," Well, you have to admit.. the circumstantial evidence."
2883,RAVA,11, I admit nothing!
2884,MAN,11," Will you put that cigarette out, please?"
2885,ELAINE,11," Well, I mean, he was in the apartment, and then it's gon and 
        it's in your apartment."
2886,RAVA,11, Maybe you think we're in cahoots.
2887,ELAINE,11," No, no.. but it is quite a coincidence."
2888,RAVA,11," Yes, that's all, a coincidence!"
2889,ELAINE,11, A big coincidence.
2890,RAVA,11, Not a big coincidence. A coincidence!
2891,ELAINE,11," No, that's a big coincidence."
2892,RAVA,11," That's what a coincidence is! There are no small coincidences and 
        big coincidences!"
2893,ELAINE,11," No, there are degrees of coincidences."
2894,RAVA,11," No, there are only coincidences! ..Ask anyone! (Enraged, she asks 
        everone in the elevator) Are there big coincidences and small coincidences, 
        or just coincidences? (Silent) ..Well?! Well?!.."
2895,MAN,11, Will you put that cigarette out?!
2896,RAVA,11," (Pointing the lit end at him) Maybe I put it out on your face! 
        (To Elaine) It's just like Ray said - you and Jerry are jealous of our 
        love. You're trying to destroy us."
2897,ELAINE,11, Shouldn't you be out on a ledge somewhere?
2898,"(Scene ends)
        [Setting",11, Jerry's apartment]
2899,GEORGE,11," (On the phone) Ma, will you stop?.. It's just a statue! How is 
        it my fault?! ..It was stolen. I didn't even touch it this time.. Okay, 
        fine. I don't se why this should affect to potatoes! Okay. Goodbye. (Hangs 
        up) She doesn't react to disappointement very well.. unlike me."
2900,KRAMER,11, I'm not happy about this.
2901,ELAINE,11, Why don't we just throw a Molotov cocktail through their window?
2902,GEORGE,11," There's just no justice. This experience has changed me. It's 
        made me more cynical, more bitter, more jaded."
2903,JERRY,11, Really?
2904,GEORGE,11, (Casually) Sure. Why not?
2905,ELAINE,11," Well, how do you think I feel? Instead of editing the first novel 
        of a major young writing talent, I am proofreading a food allergy cookbook."
2906,JERRY,11, Can't you talk to your boss?
2907,ELAINE,11," I did. He loves Rava.. worse.. he loves Ray, and he doesn't think 
        you're funny at all."
2908,KRAMER,11, I'm not happy about this.
2909,JERRY,11," Well, perhaps we can take comfort in the knowledge that in the 
        next world, Ray will be the recipient of a much larger and more harsh 
        brand of justice.."
2910,GEORGE,11, Yeah.. He'll have my parents!
2911,"(Scene ends)
        [Setting",11, Rava and Ray's apartment]
2912,KRAMER,11, Police! Open up!
2913,RAY,11," Police? (Opens the door a crack - Kramer barges in like a cop. He's 
        wearing Jerry's grandfather's suit and hat. He forces Ray against the 
        wall - face first)"
2914,KRAMER,11," Freeze, mother!"
2915,RAY,11, Hey..
2916,KRAMER,11," Shut up. Spread 'em. I said spread 'em! (Looks around) You're 
        in big trouble son. Burglary, grand larceny, possession of stolen goods.. 
        and uh, uh.. murder."
2917,RAY,11, Murder?!
2918,KRAMER,11," Shut up! Keep 'em spread! Just make love to that wall, pervert!"
2919,RAY,11, I think you have me confused with somebody else.
2920,KRAMER,11, (Afraid he's got the wrong guy) Is your name Ray?
2921,RAY,11, Yeah.
2922,KRAMER,11," (Assured) Yeah, you're the punk I'm looking for. (Grabs the statue 
        from the mantle, and puts it in his bag)"
2923,RAY,11," Hey, hey, are you a cop?"
2924,KRAMER,11," Yeah, I'm a cop. I'm a good cop. I'm a damn good cop! Today's 
        your lucky day, junior, 'cause I'm gonna let you off with a warning. Any 
        more of this criminal activity, and you'll be sorry. You got me?"
2925,RAY,11, Got you? I don't even know what the hell you're talking about.
2926,KRAMER,11, Good. Good. Let's keep it that way. (Exits)

2929,GEORGE,11," Kramer, I can't believe it. Oh, you're my hero!"
2930,KRAMER,11, Yeah.
2931,JERRY,11," Kramer, what did you do?"
2932,GEORGE,11," I feel like a huge weight's been lifted off my shoulders. (Giddily) 
        I.. I.. I feel happy! Kramer, I don't know how to thank you!"
2933,KRAMER,11," Well, I'll think of something.. (Slaps George on the back - sending 
        the statue crashing to the ground)"

2935,JERRY,11," People are going to steal from you. You can't stop them. But, 
        everybody has their own little personal security things - things that 
        they think will foil the crooks, you know? In your own mind, right? ..You 
        go to the beach, go in the water, put your wallet in the sneaker. Who's 
        gonna know? What criminal mind could penetrate this fortress of security? 
        I tied a bow. They can't get through that. I put the wallet down by the 
        toe of the sneaker. They never look there. They check the heel, they move 
        on."
2936,LEVITAN,12," Remind me to tell you what we did in Lake George. [laughing] 
              Get"
2937,GEORGE,12," That's it. This is it. I'm done. Through. It's over. I'm 
              gone."
2938,KRAMER,12, Hey.
2939,JERRY,12, Hey.
2940,KRAMER,12," Boy, I have really had it with Newman. He wakes me up again 
              last"
2941,JERRY,12," Well, what'd you say?"
2942,KRAMER,12," I said "" Jump."" Well, he's been threatening to 
              do this for years. I"
2943,JERRY,12, What's his problem?
2944,KRAMER,12, No job. No women.
2945,JERRY,12, He called the right guy.
2946,KRAMER,12," What am I supposed to tell him? How much there is for him 
              to live"
2947,JERRY,12," All right, I'm leaving. I going to the laundry."
2948,KRAMER,12, Why don't you use the machines down in the basement?
2949,JERRY,12," Fluff and fold. The only way to live. [snapping fingers 
              in tune with"
2950,KRAMER,12, How 'bout if I put a few things --
2951,JERRY,12, Wait a sec. I don't wanna do --
2952,KRAMER,12," Well, you're going over there."
2953,JERRY,12," I don't wanna mix in everything! My guys don't know your 
              guys. You"
2954,KRAMER,12, Have you ever met my guys?
2955,JERRY,12, No. I can't say as I have.
2956,KRAMER,12, Well!
2957,JERRY,12, All right. Put 'em on top.
2958,KRAMER,12, Ah!
2959,JERRY,12," Oh, beautiful. This stuff on top is my friends'. Could I 
              get it done"
2960,VIC,12, I'll have to charge you for another machine.
2961,JERRY,12," Whatever it costs. In fact, I would prefer it if the machines 
              are"
2962,GEORGE,12, Guess what.
2963,JERRY,12, How did you know I was here?
2964,GEORGE,12, Kramer. Guess what.
2965,JERRY,12, I don't know.
2966,GEORGE,12, I quit my job.
2967,JERRY,12, Get outta here.
2968,GEORGE,12, I couldn't take it anymore.
2969,VIC,12, You can have this on Monday.

              and then I"
2972,JERRY,12, You and your toilets.
2973,GEORGE,12, I snapped! It was the last straw. [sighs]
2974,JERRY,12," So, what are you gonna do now? Are you gonna look for something 
              else"
2975,GEORGE,12, Nobody's hiring now. The market's terrible. 
2976,JERRY,12, So what are you gonna do?
2977,GEORGE,12, I like sports. I could do something in sports.
2978,JERRY,12, Uh-huh. Uh-huh. In what capacity?
2979,GEORGE,12," You know, like the general manager of a baseball team or 
              something."
2980,JERRY,12," Yeah. Well, that - that could be tough to get. "
2981,GEORGE,12," Well, it doesn't even have to be the general manager. Maybe 
              I could"
2982,JERRY,12, Yeah. Yeah. You make good comments.
2983,GEORGE,12, What about that?
2984,JERRY,12," Well, they tend to give those jobs to ex-ballplayers and 
              people that"
2985,GEORGE,12," Well, that's really not fair."
2986,JERRY,12," I know. Well, okay. Okay. What else do ya like?"
2987,GEORGE,12, Movies. I like to watch movies. 
2988,JERRY,12, Yeah. Yeah.
2989,GEORGE,12, Do they pay people to watch movies?
2990,JERRY,12, Projectionists.
2991,GEORGE,12, That's true.
2992,JERRY,12, But you gotta know how to work the projector. 
2993,GEORGE,12, Right.
2994,JERRY,12, And it's probably a union thing.
2995,GEORGE,12," [scoffs] Those unions. [sighs] Okay. Sports,...movies. 
              What about a"
2996,JERRY,12, Talk show host. That's good.
2997,GEORGE,12," I think I'd be good at that. I talk to people all the time. 
              Someone"
2998,JERRY,12, Really?
2999,GEORGE,12," Yeah. A couple of people. I don't get that, though. Where 
              do you"
3000,JERRY,12," Well, that's where it gets tricky. "
3001,GEORGE,12," You can't just walk into a building and say "" I wanna 
              be a talk"
3002,JERRY,12, I wouldn't think so. 
3003,GEORGE,12, It's all politics.
3004,JERRY,12," All right. Okay. Sports, movies, talk show host. What else?"
3005,GEORGE,12, This could have been a huge mistake.
3006,JERRY,12," Well, it doesn't sound like you completely thought this 
              through."
3007,GEORGE,12, [sighs] What should I do?
3008,JERRY,12, Maybe you can just go back.
3009,GEORGE,12, Go back?
3010,JERRY,12, Yeah. Pretend like it never happened.
3011,GEORGE,12," You mean just walk into the staff meeting on Monday morning 
              like it"
3012,JERRY,12," Sure. You're an emotional person. People don't take you 
              seriously. "
3013,GEORGE,12, Just..go back. Pretend the whole thing never happened.
3014,JERRY,12, Never happened.
3015,GEORGE,12, I was just blowin' off a little steam. So what?
3016,JERRY,12, So what? You're entitled.
3017,GEORGE,12, I'm emotional.
3018,JERRY,12, That's right. You're emotional.
3019,GEORGE,12, Never happened.
3020,JERRY,12, Never happened.
3021,GEORGE,12, How ya doin'?
3022,GLENDA,12, What are you doing here?
3023,GEORGE,12, What? I work here.
3024,GLENDA,12, I thought you quit.
3025,GEORGE,12, What quit? [laughing] Who quit? 
3026,DAN,12," Bill, how was your weekend?"
3027,BILL,12," Oh, excellent weekend. What about your weekend?"
3028,DAN,12, Fine weekend. 
3029,GEORGE,12, Yeah. Good weekend.
3030,DAN,12," Went up to the Cape. Took the kids sailing. [laughing] Lisa 
              was a"
3031,GEORGE,12," Aw, she's gonna be a fine sailor."
3032,LEVITAN,12," Ava, what happened to you Friday afternoon?"
3033,AVA,12, I got a little tied up.
3034,LEVITAN,12, I'll bet you did.
3035,LEVITAN,12," I wanna remind everyone that the tenth anniversary party 
              for Rick"
3036,GEORGE,12, What? 
3037,LEVITAN,12," Am I crazy, or didn't you quit?"
3038,GEORGE,12, When?
3039,LEVITAN,12, Friday. 
3040,GEORGE,12," Oh, what? What? That? Are you kidding? I didn't quit. What? 
              You"
3041,LEVITAN,12," You mean, laughingstock? All that stuff?"
3042,GEORGE,12, Come on. Will you stop it.
3043,LEVITAN,12, No brains? No ability?
3044,GEORGE,12, Teasing.
3045,LEVITAN,12, Okay. I want you outta here.
3046,GEORGE,12," I don't know where you're getting this from. I....you're 
              serious"
3047,LEVITAN,12," You can't win. You can't beat me. That's why I'm here 
              and you're"
3048,GEORGE,12," "" I'll always be a winner and you'll always be a loser."" 
              This is"
3049,JERRY,12," Well, so that's that."
3050,GEORGE,12, No. That's not that.
3051,JERRY,12, That's not that?
3052,GEORGE,12, No.
3053,JERRY,12," Well, if that's not that, what is that?"
3054,GEORGE,12, I've got some plans. I got plans.
3055,JERRY,12, What kind of plans?
3056,GEORGE,12, What's the difference?
3057,JERRY,12, You don't wanna tell me?
3058,GEORGE,12, I'm gonna slip him a mickey.
3059,JERRY,12," What? In his drink? Are you outta your mind? What? Are you 
              Peter"
3060,GEORGE,12," You don't understand. He's got this big party coming up. 
              He's been"
3061,JERRY,12, What if you destroy him?
3062,GEORGE,12," No. No. No. No. No. Don't worry. It's perfectly safe. I 
              researched"
3063,JERRY,12," Well, wha - what does that do? Big deal."
3064,GEORGE,12," This is what they would do in the movies! It's a beautiful 
              thing!"
3065,JERRY,12, You've really gone mental.
3066,GEORGE,12, Nah.
3067,JERRY,12," Where are you gonna get this mickey? I can't believe I'm 
              saying"
3068,GEORGE,12, I got a sauce.
3069,JERRY,12, You got a mickey sauce?
3070,GEORGE,12, And Elaine is gonna keep him busy.
3071,JERRY,12, Elaine? How did you rope her into this?
3072,GEORGE,12, I told her what a sexist he is. How he cheats on his wife.
3073,JERRY,12, She knew that.
3074,GEORGE,12, But she didn't know he doesn't recycle.
3075,JERRY,12, What is the point of all this?
3076,GEORGE,12, Revenge. 
3077,JERRY,12," Oh, the best revenge is living well. "
3078,GEORGE,12, There's no chance of that.
3079,JERRY,12, Did you get your laundry?
3080,KRAMER,12, Yeah.
3081,JERRY,12, What's with you?
3082,KRAMER,12, He jumped.
3083,JERRY,12, What?
3084,KRAMER,12, Yeah. Newman jumped. 
3085,JERRY,12, Did he call you last night?
3086,KRAMER,12," Oh, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah."
3087,JERRY,12, What did you say?
3088,KRAMER,12," I said "" Wave to me when you pass my window."""
3089,JERRY,12, Whew. Did he wave?
3090,KRAMER,12," No! He jumped from the second floor. Mr. Papanickolous 
              saw him from"
3091,JERRY,12," Oh, my god!"
3092,KRAMER,12, What's the matter?
3093,JERRY,12," Well, on Thursday when I came home I had $1500 on me. For 
              some"
3094,KRAMER,12, Where? Where?
3095,JERRY,12, To the Laundromat. 
3096,VIC,12, I never saw it.
3097,KRAMER,12," Okay. Come on. Give the guy his money. What -- what are 
              you doing?"
3098,VIC,12," Hey, you see that sign right there? "
3099,JERRY,12," Oh, I see. So, you put up a sign so you can do whatever 
              you want?"
3100,VIC,12, I'm not responsible.
3101,JERRY,12," So, anybody leaves anything here, you can just take it? 
              You have a"
3102,VIC,12, You ever hear of a bank?
3103,JERRY,12, Come on. Let's go.
3104,KRAMER,12, No. You can't let him get away with this.
3105,ELAINE,12, Which one is he?
3106,GEORGE,12, That's him over there. The one that looks like a blowfish.
3107,ELAINE,12," Oh, yeah. I see him."
3108,GEORGE,12," Yeah. Hey, thanks for doing this."
3109,ELAINE,12, Why pass up the opportunity to go to prison?
3110,GEORGE,12, This is by far the most exciting thing I've ever done.
3111,ELAINE,12, Yeah. It is kind of cool.
3112,GEORGE,12, First time in my life I've ever gotten back at someone.
3113,ELAINE,12," I can't believe we're doing this. This is the kind of thing 
              they do"
3114,GEORGE,12, That's exactly what I told Jerry!
3115,ELAINE,12, Really?
3116,GEORGE,12, Yes!
3117,GEORGE,12," God, I've never felt so alive! "
3118,JERRY,12, Maybe we should call this off.
3119,KRAMER,12," Come on. What's the big deal? Just gonna put a little concrete 
              in"
3120,JERRY,12, And what's gonna happen?
3121,KRAMER,12," Well, it'll gonna mix up with the water, and then by the 
              end of the"
3122,JERRY,12," If only you could put your mind to something worthwhile. 
              You're like"
3123,KRAMER,12, You keep him busy.
3124,KRAMER,12, Whoa! 
3125,GEORGE,12, You go over there -
3126,ELAINE,12, Yeah.
3127,GEORGE,12," You start flirting with him and I'll come by and, while 
              you're"
3128,ELAINE,12, Wouldn't it be easier just to punch him in the mouth?
3129,LEVITAN,12, Come on! They're terrible. They got no infield.
3130,ELAINE,12, Oops! 'Scuse me.
3131,LEVITAN,12, Yeah.
3132,GREENY(?),12, I'm gonna get some food. You want some?
3133,LEVITAN,12, Nah.
3134,ELAINE,12, Hi.
3135,LEVITAN,12, Hi.
3136,ELAINE,12, [sneezes] 
3137,LEVITAN,12, God bless you.
3138,ELAINE,12," Oh! Thank you. Thank you very much. [blowing nose] Really. 
              I mean"
3139,LEVITAN,12, You're welcome.
3140,ELAINE,12," People don't say "" God bless you "" as much as 
              they used to. Have"
3141,LEVITAN,12, No.
3142,ELAINE,12," So, I'm going to a nudist colony next week."
3143,LEVITAN,12, Nudist colony?
3144,ELAINE,12," Oh, yeah. Yeah. I love nudist colonies. They help me..unwind. 
              Aah!"
3145,LEVITAN,12, [laughing] I'd never been to a nudist colony.
3146,ELAINE,12," Oh, really? Oh, you should go. They're great. They're great. 
              Of"
3147,LEVITAN,12, Seriously?
3148,ELAINE,12," Oh, yeah. I usually work naked a...couple hours a day. 
            "
3149,GEORGE,12," [whispering] Glenda, can I ask you a favor? Can I have 
              this seat?"
3150,GLENDA,12," What do you have to sit here for? There are plenty of other 
              seats."
3151,GEORGE,12," [whispering] I can't explain. It's very important that 
              I sit here."
3152,GLENDA,12, What are you doing here anyway? I thought you were fired.
3153,GEORGE,12, [whispering] Okay. Okay. Fine.
3154,ELAINE,12," I cook naked, I clean....I clean naked, I drive naked. 
              Naked."
3155,LEVITAN,12, Who are you?
3156,ELAINE,12," Oh, you don't wanna know, mistah. I'm trouble. Big trouble."
3157,JERRY,12, What about the gentle cycle? You ever use that? 
3158,JERRY,12," Do you think it's effeminate for a man to put clothes in 
              a gentle"
3159,JERRY,12," What about fine fabrics? How do you deal with that kind 
              of"
3160,JERRY,12," What about stone washing? You ever witness one of those? 
              That must"
3161,KRAMER,12, I didn't realize it was a full box.
3162,GEORGE,12," I'm gonna count to three. If you don't give up the chair, 
              the wig"
3163,GLENDA,12, I don't' wear a wig.
3164,GEORGE,12, One...
3165,ELAINE,12," No. No. No. No. No. I don't really have a phone. In fact, 
              I - I"
3166,ELAINE,12," I just like to have and few drinks and just let the guy 
              do whatever"
3167,GEORGE,12," Hello, Rick."
3168,LEVITAN,12, Heh heh heh hey! Look who's here! 
3169,GEORGE,12," That's right, Ricky Boy, it's me! "
3170,LEVITAN,12," You know something, Costanza? I'm a very lucky man."
3171,GEORGE,12, Oh!
3172,LEVITAN,12," I've always been lucky. Things just seem to fall right 
              in my lap. "
3173,GEORGE,12, Boom!
3174,LEVITAN,12," You wouldn't believe it if I told you. In fact, uh, I'm 
              glad"
3175,GEORGE,12, Oh.
3176,LEVITAN,12," Why should we let petty, personal differences get in the 
              way of"
3177,GEORGE,12, You want me to come back? Uh...
3178,LEVITAN,12," Hey! How about a toast, huh? Everybody, a toast! "
3179,GEORGE,12, Rick.
3180,LEVITAN,12," Everyone, I wanna propose a toast to ten great years at 
              Rick Barr"
3181,GEORGE,12," Uh, Rick.."
3182,LEVITAN,12," And all the people in this room, [clears throat] that 
              made that"
3183,GEORGE,12, Rick.
3184,LEVITAN,12, I'd also like to welcome back into the fold our..our little
3185,GEORGE,12," Drink up. I like history. Civil War. Maybe I could be a 
              professor,"
3186,ELAINE,12," Well, to teach something you really have to know a lot 
              about it. I"
3187,JERRY,12," Yeah. That's true. What? My God, the money! The 1500! Where'd 
              you"
3188,KRAMER,12, It was in my laundry. 
3189,JERRY,12," In your laundry the whole time? I told you not to mix in 
              our guys."
3190,KRAMER,12, It was about 1200 bucks.
3191,NEWMAN,12, Kramer!
3192,KRAMER,12, Oh! That's Newman.
3193,NEWMAN,12, I'm on the roof!
3194,KRAMER,12," Well, what are you waiting for?"
3195,JERRY,12," Elaine, come on, take a walk with me down to the Laundromat. 
              I gotta"
3196,GEORGE,12, I like horses. Maybe I could be a stable boy.
3197,KRAMER,12, You wanna shoot some pool tonight?
3198,NEWMAN,12, I can't. I'm goin' to the movies.
3199,GEORGE,12, Nah. It's probably a union thing.

3261,JERRY,13," Oh, and.. do you think 
              it would be alright if I called Susan Davis?"
3262,GEORGE,13," Susan Davis? (Getting 
              possessive) Hey, wait a second.."
3263,JERRY,13," Well, it's not like we'd 
              be bumping into you."
3264,GEORGE,13," I don't know.. you and 
              Susan Davis?"
3265,JERRY,13," You know, if your future 
              was a little more certain.."
3266,GEORGE,13," Okay, go ahead. Call 
              her, get married, have babies, have a great life.. What do I care? 
              I'm finished. (Really depressed) It's all over for me. In fact, 
              let's"
3267,JERRY,13," Well, ah.. (Takes his 
              pillow) What? Kind of like this? (Violently smothers George with 
              the pillow. George freaks out. He didn't think Jerry would actually"
3268,GEORGE,13," What are ya doing?! Whadya, 
              crazy?!"
3269,ELAINE,13, Jerry!
3270,JERRY,13," (Acts like he was cought 
              red-handed) Elaine, what are you doing here? (Takes the pillow off 
              George, and puts it back on his bed)"
3271,GEORGE,13, (To Jerry) Jerk off.
3272,JERRY,13," (Whispering) There's nothing 
              wrong with him. I saw the doctor. He's fine."
3273,ELAINE,13," Hi, George. How ya feeling? 
              Is anybody getting your apartment?"
3274,GEORGE,13," I'll tell ya, if I ever 
              get out of here, I'm gonna change my life. I'm gonna do a whole 
              Zen thing. Take up yoga, meditate.. I'll eat right. Calm down, lose 
              my"
3275,DOCTOR,13," (To Elaine) Uh, hello. 
              (To George) Uh, Mr. Costanza?"
3276,GEORGE,13," (Panicky) Uh, yeah. You 
              know, Doctor, I gotta tell you, I feel a lot better."
3277,DOCTOR,13," Well, we looked at your 
              EKG's, ran some tests, did a complete work-up."
3278,GEORGE,13," (Getting in a more panicked 
              state) Oh God, Mommy!"
3279,DOCTOR,13," And you simply haven't 
              had a heart attack."
3280,GEORGE,13," (Relieved) I haven't? 
              I'm okay? I'm okay? Oh, thank you, thank you, Doctor! I don't know 
              how to thank you."
3281,JERRY,13," (Sarcastic) Hey, that 
              was really fun, George. Can we go home now?"
3282,DOCTOR,13," No, actually, we'd like 
              to keep him here overnight for observation, just to be safe."
3283,GEORGE,13," Oh, sure. Sure, anything. 
              Can you believe it? There's nothing wrong with me."
3284,DOCTOR,13," Well, I wouldn't go that 
              far."
3285,GEORGE,13," (Starting to panic again) 
              What? Oh my God. What? Is it meningitis? Scoliosis? Lupis?! Is it 
              Lupis?!"
3286,DOCTOR,13," Have you ever had your 
              tonsils taken out?"
3287,GEORGE,13," My tonsils? Yeah, when 
              I was a kid."
3288,DOCTOR,13," Well, they've grown back. 
              Your adenoids are swollen too."
3289,GEORGE,13, Really?
3290,ELAINE,13," (Jokingly hits the doctor) 
              Whose tonsils grow back? (Laughs)"
3291,DOCTOR,13, It happens.
3292,JERRY,13," Yeah, if you've been exposed 
              to gamma rays."
3293,ELAINE,13," I still have my tonsils. 
              Everyone in my family has their tonsils. In fact, we were forbidden 
              to socialize with anyone who didn't have their tonsils."
3294,DOCTOR,13," That's interesting. Because, 
              no one in my family has their tonsils, and we were forbidden to 
              socialize with tonsil people."
3295,JERRY,13," (Sarcastically) Well, 
              it's like the Capulets and the Montagues."
3296,GEORGE,13," (Drawing attention back 
              to him) Excuse me!"
3297,DOCTOR,13," Anyway, I strongly recommend 
              they come out."
3298,GEORGE,13," What? You mean with a 
              knife?"
3299,DOCTOR,13," Yes. With a knife. You 
              know, snip, snip. Anyway, you'd be completely under, you wouldn't 
              feel a thing. And when you wake up, you can have some ice"
3300,GEORGE,13," (Angry) Yeah, that's 
              what they told me the last time."
3301,DOCTOR,13," Think about it. (Turns 
              to leave, but runs into Elaine) Excuse me."
3302,ELAINE,13," (Flustered) Oh, I'm sorry. 
              (Doctor exits) I just.. have to ask that doctor one more question. 
              (Leaves)"
3303,JERRY,13," Women go after doctors 
              like men go after models. They want someone with knowledge of the 
              body.. we just want the body."
3304,KRAMER,13, Hey.
3305,JERRY,13, Hey.
3306,KRAMER,13," Boy, they got a great 
              cafeteria downstairs. Hot food, sandwiches, a salad bar.. It's like 
              a Sizzler's opened up a hospital! (Sits and starts eating) So, how"
3307,JERRY,13," (Trying to shut him up) 
              Kramer."
3308,KRAMER,13," The really bad thing 
              about the heart is the sex thing. See, you gotta be careful about 
              sex now. You get that heart pumping and suddenly, boom! Next"
3309,JERRY,13," Kramer, George didn't 
              have a heart attack."
3310,KRAMER,13, No? That's good.
3311,GEORGE,13," I have to have my tonsils 
              taken out."
3312,KRAMER,13," Oh man.. No.. George, 
              we gotta get you outta here. Get out! Right now! They'll kill ya 
              in here."
3313,JERRY,13," (Trying to calm George 
              down) It's routine surgery."
3314,KRAMER,13," Oh yeah? My friend, Bob 
              Saccomanno, he came in here for a hernia operation.. Oh yeah, routine 
              surgery.. now he's sittin' around in a chair by a"
3315,GEORGE,13," Well, what should I do, 
              Kramer?"
3316,JERRY,13," Well, for one think, don't 
              listen to him."
3317,KRAMER,13," I'll tell you what to 
              do, I'll tell you what to do. You go to Tor Eckman. Tor, Tor, he'll 
              fix you right up. He's a herbalist, a healer, George. He's not just"
3318,JERRY,13," Eckman? I thought he was 
              doing time?"
3319,KRAMER,13," No, no, he's out. He 
              got out. See, the medical establishment, see, they tried to frame 
              him. It's all politics. But he's a rebel."
3320,JERRY,13," A rebel? No. Johnny Yuma 
              was a rebel. Eckman is a nut. George, you want to take care of your 
              tonsils, you do it in a hospital. With a doctor."
3321,KRAMER,13," He's holistic, George. 
              He's holistic."
3322,GEORGE,13," Holistic.. that sounds 
              right."
3323,JERRY,13," George, you need a medical 
              doctor."
3324,GEORGE,13," (To Jerry) Let me ask 
              you something.. How much do you think it would cost to have tonsils 
              and adenoids removed in the hospital?"
3325,JERRY,13," Well, an overnight stay 
              in a hospital? Minor surgery? I dunno, four grand."
3326,GEORGE,13," Uh-huh. And how much 
              does the healer charge?"
3327,KRAMER,13," First visit? Thirty-eight 
              bucks."
3328,GEORGE,13," Oh, yeah? Holistic.. 
              that's what I need. That's the answer."
3329,[Setting,13, Healer's apartment]
3330,GEORGE,13," So, how do you like the 
              way I talked you into comin' down here?"
3331,JERRY,13," Don't flatter yourself, 
              my friend. I'm here strictly for material, and I have a feeling 
              this is a potential gold mine.. I still think you're nuts, though."
3332,GEORGE,13," All I know is I've been 
              going to doctors all my life. What has it gotten me? I'm thirty-three 
              years old. I haven't outgrown the problems of puberty, I'm"
3333,JERRY,13," (Jokingly making fun of 
              George) I've never had a really good pickle."
3334,GEORGE,13," Besides, what's it gonna 
              cost me? Thirty-eight bucks?"
3335,TOR,13," (To Jerry) Would you not 
              put your foot on that please?"
3336,JERRY,13, Sorry.
3337,TOR,13, What month were you born?
3338,GEORGE,13, April.
3339,TOR,13," You should have been born 
              in August. Your parents would have been well-advised to wait."
3340,GEORGE,13, Really?
3341,TOR,13," Do you use hot water in 
              the shower?"
3342,GEORGE,13, Yes.
3343,TOR,13, Stop using it.
3344,GEORGE,13, ..Okay.
3345,KRAMER,13, I'm off hot water.
3346,TOR,13," Kramer tells me that you 
              are interested in an alternative to surgery."
3347,GEORGE,13," Yes, yes I am."
3348,TOR,13," (Blows into George's face) 
              I think we can help you. See, unfortunately, the medical establishment 

              is a business like any other business. And business needs"
3349,GEORGE,13," (Still on the showers) 
              Can I use hot water on my face?"
3350,TOR,13," No. You know, I am not a 
              business man. I'm a holistic healer. It's a calling, it's a gift. 
              You see, it's in the best interest of the medical profession that 
              you remain"
3351,JERRY,13," (He thinks this, the audience 
              can hear his thoughts) And you're not a doctor, but you play one 
              in real life."
3352,GEORGE,13," (Still on the hot water) 
              What about shaving?"
3353,TOR,13," (To Jerry) You're eating 
              too much dairy. (To George) May I? (Reaches over, and touches George's 
              face)"
3354,GEORGE,13, I guess so.
3355,TOR,13," (Feeling George's face) 
              You see, you are in disharmony. The throat is the gateway to the 
              lung. Tonsillitis, adenoiditis, is, in Chinese medical terms, and 
              invasion"
3356,JERRY,13," (Again, we hear his thoughts) 
              There's some hot air blowing in here.."
3357,TOR,13," You know, I lived with the 
              Eskimos many years ago, and they used to plunge their faces into 
              the snow."
3358,GEORGE,13," (Once again, still on 
              the shower) Could it be lukewarm?"
3359,JERRY,13," Too much dairy? You really 
              think I'm eating too much dairy?"
3360,[Setting,13, Doctor's car]
3361,DOCTOR,13," ..The tongue.. yes, the 
              tongue.. or, in medical terms, the glossa. It's a muscular organ.. 
              Consists of two parts.. the body, and the root.. You see, it's"
3362,ELAINE,13, Uh-huh.
3363,[Setting,13, Healer's apartment]
3364,TOR,13," (Pouring tea) Your tea is 
              ready now. This will solve your so-called tonsil problem. It's a 
              special concoction. It contains crampbark."
3365,JERRY,13, I love crampbark.
3366,TOR,13, Cleavers.
3367,JERRY,13," Cleaver, I once had cleaver 
              as a kid. I was able to lift a car."
3368,TOR,13, And some couchgrass.
3369,JERRY,13," Couchgrass and crampbark? 
              You know, I think that's what killed Curly."
3370,KRAMER,13," Go ahead, drink it, George."
3371,JERRY,13," Excuse me, Tor. May I 
              ask you a question? You have intuitive abilities. You're in touch 
              with a lot of this cosmic kind of things.. I have this note I can't 
              read."
3372,TOR,13," (Takes the note, then laughs 
              when he reads it) Oh, yes.. yes.. ""Cleveland 117, San Antonio 
              109.. (Hands note back to Jerry)"
3373,KRAMER,13," Go ahead, drink it, George."
3374,GEORGE,13," (Takes a sip) Hey, it's 
              not too bad.."
3375,[Setting,13, Ambulance]
3376,GEORGE,13," (In a state of hysteria) 
              I'm an eggplant! I'm an eggplant! I'm a minstrel man!"
3377,DRIVER,13," (To Assistant) I didn't 
              take your Chuckle, man!"
3378,ASSISTANT,13," I had five Chuckles. 
              I ate a green one, and the yellow one, and the red one is missing!"
3379,DRIVER,13, I don't even like Chuckles!
3380,JERRY,13," (To Assistant) Maybe he 
              doesn't like them. That's possible."
3381,GEORGE,13," My face! My face! Get 
              me to the hospital!"
3382,ASSISTANT,13," I want that Chuckle! 
              You hear me?!"
3383,JERRY,13," (To Assistant) I'll get 
              you a Chuckle. You want me to get you a Chuckle?"
3384,ASSISTANT,13," (Angry, to Driver) 
              Pull over!"
3385,DRIVER,13," Pull over? Did you say 
              pull over?! You want a piece of me?!"
3386,ASSISTANT,13, Yeah!
3387,JERRY,13, You're gonna fight?
3388,GEORGE,13, Now?! I'm a mutant!
3389,KRAMER,13," (To Driver) Hey, let 
              me drive."
3390,ASSISTANT,13," Come on, man. Pull 
              over!"
3391,DRIVER,13," Alright! I'm gonna mess 
              you up, man!"
3392,JERRY,13," (Pleading) Really, gentlemen, 
              please."
3393,GEORGE,13," My heart! My heart! (To 
              Assistant) Where you going? Are you crazy?!"
3394,ASSISTANT,13," I'm gonna kick his 
              ass."
3395,KRAMER,13," (To Assistant) Hey, you 
              have keys?"
3396,GEORGE,13," You can't leave! This 
              is an ambulance! This is an emergency!"
3397,JERRY,13, All this for a Chuckle.
3398,KRAMER,13, What's a Chuckle?
3399,JERRY,13," It's a jelly candy. it 
              comes in five flavors."
3400,[Setting,13, Doctor's car]
3401,DOCTOR,13," You see, taste buds run 
              on grooves along the surfaces."
3402,ELAINE,13," Can you let go of my 
              tongue now?"
3403,DOCTOR,13, What?
3404,ELAINE,13, Let go of my tongue!
3405,DOCTOR,13," (Lets go) Oh, sorry."
3406,ELAINE,13," Well, I should get going.. 
              (The Doctor leans in for a kiss. Elaine stops him) What are you 
              doing?"
3407,DOCTOR,13," I was going to kiss you 
              good night."
3408,ELAINE,13," A kiss? With the tongue? 
              The glossa with the bumps and the papillae? ..Yech, I don't think 
              so. (Leaves)"
3409,[Setting,13, Ambulance]
3410,JERRY,13," You just can't leave him 
              out there."
3411,DRIVER,13," I told him I was gonna 
              mess him up."
3412,KRAMER,13," Well, can you call him 
              an ambulance?"
3413,DRIVER,13," I told him I didn't take 
              his Chuckle. I don't eat that gooey crap!"
3414,KRAMER,13," hey, watch the road! 
              Watch the road, man!"
3415,DRIVER,13," (Turns back, facing Kramer) 
              Hey, man, you want some of what he got?!"
3416,JERRY AND KRAMER,13, Watch out!
3417,[Setting,13, Hospital room]
3418,JERRY,13," How ya doing? (George 
              nods) Can't talk? (George shakes his head. Jerry gestures to his 
              brace) Hey, how'd you get the plastic one? (George raises his"
3419,ELAINE,13," Oh, poor George. Oh, 
              I'm sorry, but I can't stay long. I don't want to run into Doctor 
              Tongue.. Here, I brought you something. (Takes out a pint of ice"
3420,JERRY,13," Hey, check the TV."
3421,TV VOICE,13," (Germanic) It's just 
              as you prophesied. The planets of our solar system, incinerating. 
              Like flaming globes, Sigmond. Like flaming globes. Ah, ha, ha, ha.."
3422,JERRY,13," (Pulls the note out of 
              his pocket) That's it! That's it! Flaming globes of Sigmond! Flaming 
              Globes of Sigmond! That's my note! tha'ts what I thought was so"

3435,JERRY,15," She's the performance artist, right?"
3436,GEORGE,15," (Sarcastic) Yeah, performance artist. She's a real performer. 
              A real trooper."
3437,JERRY,15," What's her husband's name, again? Chip? Kip? Skip?"
3438,ELAINE,15, Todd.
3439,JERRY,15, Todd. Oh yeah. (To George) He's a Kennedy.
3440,ELAINE,15," No, he's not."
3441,JERRY,15," C'mon. He's a third cousin, or something."
3442,ELAINE,15, By marriage.
3443,JERRY,15," Oh, by marriage. (To George) We went to their wedding. You 
              should have heard him talking about Chappaquiddick - trying to blame 
              the whole thing on"
3444,GEORGE,15, That woman was unequivocally the worst date of my life.
3445,ELAINE,15," Oh, pardon me for trying to set you up with a beautiful, 
              intelligent woman."
3446,GEORGE,15," What, you don't think I can attract beautiful, intelligent 
              women?"
3447,JERRY,15," Thin ice, George. Thin ice.."
3448,GEORGE,15," (Sarcastic) Maybe for her new performance piece she'll 
              give birth on stage."
3449,ELAINE,15, She stopped performing.
3450,GEORGE,15," (Again, sarcastic) Oh, what a huge blow to the culture."
3451,JERRY,15," (Gesturing to George) You believe this guy? He holds a grudge 
              like Khomeini."
3452,GEORGE,15," She dragged me down to that warehouse on the waterfront 
              in Brooklin to see one of her ""performances""."
3453,JERRY,15," Oh, and she cooks dinner onstage for some celebrity?"
3454,GEORGE,15," God! She's cooking dinner for God! She's yelling and screaming, 
              and the next thing I know, she throws a big can of chocolate syrup 
              all over my new red"
3455,ELAINE,15, It was an accident!
3456,GEORGE,15," Oh, yeah, sure, accident, right. She was aiming right at 
              me like she was putting out a fire! Then, for the rest of the show, 
              I'm sitting there with chocolate all"
3457,JERRY,15, (To Elaine) he thought he still had a shot.
3458,GEORGE,15," And then, then, then she leaves with somebody else! Never 
              even, never even said goodbye! Never called me back.. Never apologized. 
              Nothing. Like I"
3459,JERRY,15, What ever happened with the shirt?
3460,GEORGE,15, I still have it. The collar's okay. I wear it under sweaters.
3461,ELAINE,15," I don't know what I'm gonna do. She asked me to give her 
              a baby shower."
3462,JERRY,15, Asked you? You're not going to do that are you?
3463,ELAINE,15," anyone else, never. But, Leslie - I have a problem saying 
              no to. For some reason, I seem to want her approval."
3464,GEORGE,15, Let Maria Shriver give her a baby shower.
3465,JERRY,15," Ask not what I can do for you - ask what you can do for 
              me."
3466,GEORGE,15, (Germanic) Ich bin ein sucker.
3467,ELAINE,15," Oh, would you two stop with the Kennedys? Why does everybody 
              make such a big deal about he Kennedys? What is this fascination?! 
              Who cares?! It's"
3468,GEORGE,15," She doesn't deserve a baby shower. She deserves a baby 
              monsoon. She deserves Rosemary's baby!"
3469,ELAINE,15," (To Jerry) I do have one teeny little problem, though."
3470,GEORGE,15, Never said goodbye. Never apologized. Nothing.
3471,ELAINE,15," See, I was gonna give the shower in my apartment.."
3472,JERRY,15, But?
3473,ELAINE,15, My roommate has Lyme disease.
3474,JERRY,15, Lyme disease? I thought she had Epstein-Barr Syndrome?
3475,ELAINE,15," She has this in addition to Epstein-Barr. It's like Epstein-Barr 
              with a twist of Lyme disease."
3476,JERRY,15, How did she get Lyme disease?
3477,ELAINE,15," I don't know. She did some outdoor version of Hair in Danbury, 
              Connecticut."
3478,JERRY,15, They still do that play?
3479,ELAINE,15, It's a classic.
3480,JERRY,15, With all the nudity?
3481,ELAINE,15, I guess. She must've rolled over on a tick during the love-in.
3482,GEORGE,15, (Still mad a Leslie) Never said goodbye. Goodbye!
3483,JERRY,15, Explain to me how this baby shower thing works.
3484,ELAINE,15, What do you wanna know?
3485,JERRY,15," Well, I mean, does it ever erupt into a drunken orgy of 
              violence?"
3486,ELAINE,15, Rarely.
3487,JERRY,15," There's no hazing of the fetus, or anything, is there?"
3488,ELAINE,15, No.
3489,JERRY,15, When is this suppose to be?
3490,ELAINE,15, Saturday.
3491,JERRY,15," Saturday?.. Well, I have a show in Buffalo on Saturday. 
              They're not gonna bust up my apartment, or anything, are they?"
3492,ELAINE,15, I'll take full responsibility. You won't regret it.
3493,JERRY,15," 'Cause I've seen these pregnant women - and they sometimes 
              misjudge their fetal girth. Just like one wrong turn, and boom! 
              And entire buffet is swept off"
3494,GEORGE,15," Someday, before I die, mark my words - I'm gonna tell that 
              woman exactly what I think of her. I'll never be able to forgive 
              myself until I do."
3495,JERRY,15, And if you do?
3496,GEORGE,15," I still won't be able to forgive myself - but at least 
              it won't be about this."
3497,[Setting,15, Jerry's apartment]
3498,KRAMER,15, What are you doing this for? Look at you..
3499,JERRY,15, Quiet. I'm trying to get a picture.
3500,KRAMER,15," But you don't have to do this! This guy is waiting in my 
              house."
3501,JERRY,15, (Pleading) Leave me alone.
3502,KRAMER,15," It's a one-time fee. A hundred and fifty bucks. Why live 
              like this?!"
3503,JERRY,15, I'm not getting illegal cable!
3504,KRAMER,15," Oh, so what are you gonna do? You gonna wait for the cable 
              companies to resolve their dispute? They're gonna be in court for 
              years."
3505,JERRY,15," No, I read in the paper.."
3506,KRAMER,15," (Sarcastic) Oh, oh, the paper.."
3507,JERRY,15," Well, they might hook us up again."
3508,KRAMER,15," Oh, God, you're so naive! All the cable companies care 
              about is the ""Big Mammoo."" (Jerry wacks the TV) Oh, look 
              at you! You're banging things.."
3509,JERRY,15, Stop shouting! You're ruining the reception.
3510,KRAMER,15," Can you hear yourself? Can, can, do you know what you're 
              saying?!"
3511,JERRY,15, What you're suggesting is illegal.
3512,KRAMER,15, It's not illegal.
3513,JERRY,15, It's against the law.
3514,KRAMER,15," Well, yeah."
3515,JERRY,15," (Gesturing to the rabbit ears) Just, just, hold this. Can 
              you hold that?"
3516,KRAMER,15," (Holding the rabbit ears) Look, will you at least let me 
              bring the guy over? He's an amazing man. He's a Russian immigrant. 
              He escaped the Gulag. He's"
3517,JERRY,15," A real human rights nut, huh?"
3518,KRAMER,15," Yeah. He's intense, man."
3519,JERRY,15, I don't know. What if I get caught?
3520,KRAMER,15," Oh, you're not gonna get caught. Look, let me get him. 
              Man, it's the nineties, it's Hammer time! Come on, just let me get 
              him."
3521,JERRY,15," You know, why don't we wait? Because, I'm going out of town 
              tomarrow."
3522,TABACHNICK,15, Tomarrow okay.
3523,KRAMER,15," No problem. Yeah, you'll have the whole thing installed 
              by the time you get back."
3524,JERRY,15," (Mutters to himself) Every time I turn on the TV, sirens 
              are gonna go off. They're gonna track me down like a dog, I know 
              it.."
3525,KRAMER,15," No, no, now look now, Jerry, Jerry, it's no risk. I swear. 
              The Mets have seventy-five games on cable this year.."
3526,JERRY,15," (Pauses, thinking about what Kramer just said) Put it in."
3527,KRAMER,15," You won't regret it. (Jerry mutters some more, Kramer rubs 
              his hands together in anticipation, then starts dancing around with 
              a reluctant Jerry) Jerry's"

3529,MAN,15, Mr. Steinfeld?
3530,JERRY,15, Seinfeld.
3531,MAN,15, We're with the FBI. You wanna tell us about your cable hook-up?
3532,JERRY,15, My cable hook-up? What about it?
3533,MAN,15," It's been illegally installed, Mr. Steinfeld."
3534,JERRY,15, It has? I've been out of town. How did you know?
3535,KRAMER,15," Jerry, I had to tell them. I had to. I had no choice. They 
              were onto the scam from the very beginning."
3536,MAN,15," You're in serious trouble, Mr. Steinfeld."
3537,JERRY,15," Wait a minute. Wait a minute, hold on! We're just patsies. 
              We're just a couple of users.. We never sold the stuff. What about 
              the Russian guy? The Russian"
3538,TABACHNICK,15," Mr. Seinfeld, Agent Stone. FBI. Undercover."
3539,KRAMER,15," No! Jerry! (The FBI agents open fire. Jerry's gunned down 
              by a hailstorm of bullets. Kramer leans next to a fallen Jerry, 
              cupping Jerry's head in his"
3540,[Setting,15, Airplane]
3541,JERRY,15, Excuse me. Can I get something to drink?
3542,STEWARDESS,15, I'm afraid not.
3543,JERRY,15," What's with this airline? What are you, cutting out the 
              drinks now?"
3544,STEWARDESS,15," No sir. We're flying into a blizzard. Please fasten 
              your seat belt. We're making an emergency landing."
3545,JERRY,15, (Sarcastic) Are they gonna go over the instructions again?
3546,BILL,15, My name is Bill. I might be the last person you ever see.
3547,[Setting,15, Night club]
3548,JERRY,15," I'm not afraid of flying, although many people do have fear 
              of flying and, I have no arguement with that. I think fear of flying 
              is quite rational because, human"
3549,[Setting,15, George's car]
3550,GEORGE,15, Sounds like a rough trip.
3551,JERRY,15," Oh, fire engines, ambulances all along the runway. And then, 
              when we landed safely, they all seemed so disappointed."
3552,GEORGE,15," So, the college cancelled the gig?"
3553,JERRY,15," Well, there was so much snow. The roads were closed. I really 
              appreciate it - you picking me up. Thanks again."
3554,GEORGE,15, (Modestly) Forget it.
3555,JERRY,15," No, really.. an airport run."
3556,GEORGE,15, It's nothing.
3557,JERRY,15," (Joking) You know, if Richie Brandes did this, I'd be suspicious, 
              you know. He's always got some ulterior motive."
3558,GEORGE,15, (Laughs nervously) ..Ulterior motive.
3559,JERRY,15," Oh, wait a minute. Wait a minute. Don't take the bridge.. 
              Get off here. We can't go back to my place, Elaine's having the 
              shower."
3560,GEORGE,15," (Obviously knows that, but pretends he doesn't) What, tonight? 
              Now?"
3561,JERRY,15," Yeah, yeah. I forgot all about it. Alright, it's no big 
            deal. We'll just go back to your place."
3562,GEORGE,15," My place? NO, no, no. I hate my place. I don't wanna go 
              back to my place."
3563,JERRY,15, You want to get a bite?
3564,GEORGE,15," Yeah, I would. It's just, you know, I just ate a whole 
              pot roast."
3565,JERRY,15," Well, so what should we do?"
3566,GEORGE,15, Shouldn't we at least drop off your bag?
3567,JERRY,15, Red shirt! Red shirt! That's the red shirt!
3568,GEORGE,15, (Nervous) What are you talking about?
3569,JERRY,15, You're wearing the chocolate shirt!
3570,GEORGE,15, I am? What a strange coincidence..
3571,JERRY,15," A - Ha! Nice try, my friend, but you gotta get up pretty 
              early in the morning.."
3572,GEORGE,15, (Pleading) You gotta let me go over there.
3573,JERRY,15," What are you gonna do? Badger a pregnant woman at her own 
              baby shower?! What are you, gonna take it off and make her rinse 
              it in club soda?"
3574,GEORGE,15," No, I'm gonna hold it under her nose so she can smell the 
              scent of stale Bosco that I had to live with for three years, and 
              I'm gonna say, ""Remember this"

3576,LESLIE,15," We just bought an apartment on Riverside Drive. Bernard 
              Goetz's mother used to live there."
3577,ELAINE,15," So, where's Todd?"
3578,LESLIE,15, Up in Hyannisport.
3579,ELAINE,15," Oh my God, Hyannisport? With the Kennedys? Who else is 
              up there? Is Rose up there?!"
3580,WOMAN,15," (To Leslie) So, when's your due date?"
3581,LESLIE,15," March twentieth, nine a.m."
3582,WOMAN,15, You know the time!
3583,LESLIE,15," I'm having a planned C-section. My therapist told me if 
              I go through labor, I might get psychotic."
3584,ELAINE,15," Leslie, Leslie, whatever happened to Sargent Shriver? Is 
              he still with them? You don't hear much about him these days. Is 
              he out of the loop?"
3585,LESLIE,15," (Takes a bite of food) Elaine, who catered this, Sears?"
3586,ELAINE,15," (Whispering to Kramer) What is this?! What are you doing 
              here?"
3587,KRAMER,15, We're putting in cable.
3588,ELAINE,15," The cable? No, no, no. I'm having a party here. You can't 
              do this now!"
3589,KRAMER,15," Oh, we have to do this now."
3590,ELAINE,15, Who's this guy?
3591,KRAMER,15, Which one?
3592,ELAINE,15, Both of the them.
3593,KRAMER,15," Oh, they're Soviet Cable guys."
3594,ELAINE,15, Okay.. Does Jerry know about this?
3595,KRAMER,15," Oh yeah.. it's all authorized, yeah."
3596,ELAINE,15, You can't! You can't do this now!
3597,KRAMER,15," Elaine, do you know how booked up this guy is? Now, if 
              I send him away now, it's gonna take Jerry months to get him back.. 
              He won't like that."
3598,ELAINE,15, Alright. Just do it fast and then get out.
3599,KRAMER,15," (Snaps his fingers) Anatoly! (The Russians get to work 
              on command. To Elaine) Look, it's gonna take a few minutes.. Then,

              her?"
3602,GEORGE,15, (Boiling) What am I going to say?!
3603,JERRY,15, Yeah.
3604,GEORGE,15," What did you go out with me for?! Just to dump chocolate 
              on my shirt and then just dump me altogether?! I don't deserve that 
              kind of treatment! What,"
3605,JERRY,15, You'll never say that to her face.

              Look! He's eating all the food!"
3610,KRAMER,15," Yeah, yeah. Well, you know, there are many differences 
              between American and Soviet cultures that you're not aware of. See, 
              in Russian, the cable guy,"
3611,ELAINE,15, Kramer!

              for the weekend."
3614,JERRY,15, The show was cancelled. There was a blizzard.
3615,ELAINE,15," I can't believe you told Kramer it's okay to put the cable 
              in during the shower! Jerry, look,, look! They've eaten everything."

              travelled for a reason."
3618,ELAINE,15," (Speaking confidentially to George) George, don't even 
              think about it! Don't even dream about it!"
3619,GEORGE,15, (Unconvincingly coy) About what?
3620,TABACHNICK,15," (Sticks his head out the door) Kramer, Kramer, Kramer.."
3621,GEORGE,15, Leslie.
3622,LESLIE,15, Yeah?
3623,GEORGE,15, George.. (She doesn't seem to recognize him) George Costanza.
3624,LESLIE,15, Hi.
3625,GEORGE,15," (Laughs) You, I guess, you don't remember me.. but we actually, 
              kind of um.. went out.. a couple of years ago.. once.. remember?"
3626,LESLIE,15, Vaguely.
3627,GEORGE,15, You took me to one of your shows..
3628,LESLIE,15, And?
3629,GEORGE,15," And, um, it was quite good. In fact, you even incorporated 
              me into the show. I'm not actually a performer. Although, my parents 
              felt I had talent.."
3630,MARY,15," Jerry?! (A woman, angry at Jerry, approaches him. Jerry looks 
              confused) Remember me?"

3632,MARY,15," (Livid) Mary Contardi. No? Doesn't ring a bell, Jerry? We 
              had a date, three years ago. You took me to one of your shows."
3633,JERRY,15," (Stammering) Oh, I, I, think I remember.."
3634,MARY,15," Told me you had a great time! Said you'd call me the next

              your"
3639,GEORGE,15," Actually, I never had any formal training. I guess I'd 
              be better suited for improvs, or something.."
3640,LESLIE,15, Thanks a lot!
3641,ELAINE,15, I'm sorry you have to go.
3642,WOMAN,15, Yeah. I really have to be going.
3643,JERRY,15," Alright, listen, I've changed my mind about this whole thing. 
              I don't want cable."
3644,KRAMER,15, Don't be a fool.
3645,TABACHNICK,15, You don't want?
3646,JERRY,15," No, I don't want. So, just tell me what I owe you for your 
              trouble.."
3647,TABACHNICK,15," (Confers with his assistant, then) Four hundred dollars."
3648,JERRY,15, (To Kramer) Four hundred dollars?1 You told me one-fifty!
3649,LESLIE,15, I'm going.. obviously.
3650,ELAINE,15," Oh, Leslie, I am so sorry about everything that went on 
              here tonight. You know, I had no idea.."
3651,LESLIE,15," Elaine, you know, I was watching you tonight, and I realized 
              something. You're just like you were in college."
3652,ELAINE,15," (Not sure if it was an insult or a compliment) Oh, thank 
              you. (Leslie leaves. Then Elaine wonders to herself) ""Like 
              you were in college""?"
3653,LESLIE,15," (Comes back, and yells in the direction of the bedroom) 
              Come on! Let's go!"
3654,GEORGE,15, (Sheepishly to Elaine) I'll be right back. (Leaves)
3655,JERRY,15," (Defiantly) I'm not paying four hundred dollars! I don't 
              even want the thing. What are you going to do?!"
3656,[Setting,15, Jerry's apartment]
3657,GEORGE,15," Every woman on the face of the earth has complete control 
              of my life. And yet, I want them all.. is that irony?"
3658,ELAINE,15," Why can't I meet a Kennedy? ..I saw John Junior once downtown. 
              I was on a bus. I hit the ding, but.. it didn't stop."
3659,JERRY,15," Alright, I said I had a good time and I'd call, but who 
              takes that literally?"
3660,KRAMER,15," (Pops his head into Jerry's apartment) Hey, come on over, 
              Dr. Zhivago's on cable in five minutes.. I'm making popcorn! (Leaves)"
3661,[Setting,15, Night club]
3662,JERRY,15," What do you do at the end of a date when you know you don't 
              want to see this person ever again, for the rest of your life? What 
              do you say? What do you"

3672,Elaine,16, You should run for mayor.
3673,Jerry,16," Ehh, nobody listens."
3674,Elaine,16, Where is someone? I'm starving.
3675,George,16, I think this is him right here.
3676,Elaine,16, Is there a table ready?
3677,Restaurant Manager (Bruce),16, How many?
3678,Elaine (to Jerry),16, How many?
3679,Jerry (to George),16, Is Tatiana coming?

3681,Jerry,16, Really? I thought things were going OK.
3682,George,16," They were, it's kinda complicated."
3683,Jerry,16, Well what is it?
3684,Elaine,16, How many?
3685,Jerry,16," Ah, alright, four. Seinfeld."
3686,Bruce,16," Four. It'll be five, ten minutes."
3687,George,16, What do you wanna do?
3688,Elaine,16," Let's go someplace else, I am too hungry."
3689,Jerry,16," We might as well just stay here, we haven't got that much 
              time if we"
3690,George,16, I gotta call Tatiana. where's the phone?
3691,Jerry (to Elaine),16, Tatiana...
3692,George,16," Excuse me, are you gonna be very long?"
3693,Bruce,16," Lashbrook(sp?), 4!"
3694,Jerry,16, So did I do a terrible thing?
3695,Elaine,16, You mean lying to your uncle?
3696,Jerry,16," I couldn't have dinner with him. 'Plan 9 from Outer Space', 
              one night"
3697,George (to Jerry),16," You know it's a public phone, you're not supposed 
              to just"
3698,Elaine,16," Jerry, get menus so when we sit down we can order right 
              away."
3699,Jerry,16," Can't look at a menu now, I gotta be at the table."
3700,George,16," He knows I'm waiting. He sees me. He just doesn't wanna 
              look."
3701,Elaine,16," Everything's gotta be just so with you, doesn't it?"
3702,Jerry,16," Hey, I offered you those cookies in my house."
3703,Elaine,16," Health cookies. I hate those little dustboard fructose 
              things."
3704,George,16," I just can't believe at the way people are. What is it 
              with humanity? "
3705,Elaine,16, What?
3706,Jerry,16," There's a woman over there that looks really familiar. Dark 
              hair,"
3707,Elaine,16, I've never seen her before.
3708,Jerry,16, I know this woman. This is gonna drive me crazy.
3709,Man,16," Oh, Excuse me."
3710,Elaine,16, I'm sorry.
3711,Elaine,16," Didja see that? Those people, look, they're getting a table."
3712,Jerry,16, Well maybe they were here from before.
3713,Elaine,16," No no no, they weren't here before."
3714,George (to guy),16," Excuse me, are you going to be much longer? I 
              have to make a"
3715,Elaine,16, Find out what's going on!
3716,Jerry,16," Excuse me, didn't those people just come in? I believe we 
              were ahead of"
3717,Elaine,16, Yeah.
3718,Bruce,16, What's your name?
3719,Jerry,16, Seinfeld.
3720,Bruce,16," No, no, they were here before. Keckitch(sp?), 2!"
3721,Elaine,16," Did you ever notice how happy people are when they finally 
              get a table? "
3722,Jerry,16," Boy, you are really hungry."
3723,George (whistles to guy on phone),16, Hey!
3724,George,16," If anything happens here, can I count on you?"
3725,Jerry,16, What?
3726,George,16, If we decide to go at it.
3727,Jerry,16," Yeah, I wanna get into a rumble..."
3728,George,16," I have to get in touch with Tatiana! And look at his little 
              outfit. "
3729,Elaine,16, I'm gonna faint...
3730,Jerry,16," George, who is that woman in the stripes?"
3731,George,16, I don't know her.
3732,Jerry,16, She looks so familiar.
3733,Elaine,16," Ya know, its not fair people are seated First Come First 
              Served, It"
3734,Jerry,16," I'll tell you what, there's 50 bucks in it for you if you 
              do it."
3735,Elaine,16, What do you mean?
3736,Jerry,16," You walk over that table, you pick up an eggroll, you don't 
              say"
3737,George,16, What are they gonna do?
3738,Jerry,16," They won't do anything; in fact, you'll be giving them a 
              story to tell"
3739,Elaine,16," 50 bucks, you'll give me 50 bucks?"
3740,Jerry,16," 50 bucks. That table over there, the three couples."
3741,Elaine,16," OK, I don't wanna go over there and do it, and then come 
              back here and"
3742,Jerry,16," No, no tricks."
3743,Elaine,16," Should I do it, George?"
3744,George,16, For 50 bucks? I'd put my face in the soup and blow.
3745,Elaine,16," Alright, alright. Here, hold this. I'm doin' it."
3746,Elaine (through her teeth),16," I know this sounds crazy, but the two 
              men who are"
3747,Elaine (through teeth),16, I'll give you 25 if you let me do it.
3748,People at table,16," What? What is she talking about? What did she 
              say?"
3749,Jerry,16, What happened?
3750,Elaine,16, Did you see that?
3751,George,16, What were you doing?
3752,Elaine (laughing),16," I offered them 25, they had no idea..."
3753,Jerry,16," George, the phone's free."
3754,George,16, Alleluia.
3755,George,16," Excuse me, I was waiting here."
3756,Woman at phone,16, Where? I didn't see you.
3757,George,16, I've been standing here for the last ten minutes!
3758,Woman,16, Well I won't be long.
3759,George,16, That's not the point. The point is I was here first.
3760,Woman,16," Well if you were here first, you'd be holding the phone."
3761,George (yelling at her),16," You know, we're living in a society! We're 
              supposed"
3762,George,16," Does she care? No. Does anyone ever display the slightest 
              sensitivity"
3763,Guy,16," Hey, sorry I took so long."
3764,George,16," Oh that's OK, really, don't worry about it."
3765,Elaine,16," How do people fast? Did Ghandi get this crazy? I'm gonna 
              walk around,"
3766,Jerry,16," I told my uncle I had a stomach ache tonight. You think 
              he bought that?"
3767,George,16," Yeah, well, he probably bought it."
3768,Jerry,16, So what happened with Tatiana?
3769,George,16, I shouldn't even tell you this.
3770,Jerry,16, Come on...
3771,George,16," Well, after dinner last week, she invites me back to her 
              apartment."
3772,Jerry,16, I'm with you.
3773,George,16," Well, it's this little place with this little bathroom. 
              It's like"
3774,Jerry,16, This could only happen to you.
3775,George,16," So I finally stop and say, ""Tatiana, I hope you don't 
              take this the"
3776,Jerry,16, You said this to her after.
3777,George,16, No. During.
3778,Jerry,16," Oh, boy."
3779,George,16, Yeah.
3780,Jerry,16, Wow! So...?
3781,George,16," So I'm dressing and she's staring up at me, struggling 
              to compute this"
3782,Elaine,16," I hate this place. I don't know why we came here, I'm never 
              coming back"
3783,Jerry (still trying to remember),16, Who is that woman?!
3784,Elaine,16," Remember when you first went out to eat with your parents? 
              Remember,"
3785,George,16, She's off. (goes over to the now available public phone)
3786,Elaine,16," Jerry, talk to that guy again."
3787,Jerry,16, What am I gonna say?
3788,Elaine,16, Tell him we wanna catch a movie and that we're late.
3789,Mr. Cohen,16," Hey, what stinks in here?"
3790,Bruce (laughing),16, Mr. Cohen! Haven't seen you for a couple of weeks.
3791,Mr. Cohen,16," Well, I've been looking for a better place."
3792,Bruce,16, Better place... Want a table?
3793,Mr. Cohen,16," No, just bring me a plate and I'll eat here."
3794,Bruce (laughing),16," Give him a plate and you eat here... Come on, 
              I give you a"
3795,Jerry,16," Excuse me... we've been waiting here. Now, I KNOW we were 
              ahead of that"
3796,Bruce,16," Oh no, Mr. Cohen always here."
3797,Elaine,16, He's always here? What does that mean? What does that mean?
3798,Bruce,16," Oh, Mr. Cohen, very nice man. He live on Park Avenue."
3799,Elaine,16," Where am I? Is this a dream? What in God's name is going 
              on here?!"
3800,George,16," She's not there. She left. She must've waited and left 
              because those"
3801,Jerry,16, Didja leave a message?
3802,George,16," Yeah, I told her to call me here and to tell anyone who 
              answers the"
3803,Elaine,16," Oh, Jerry, here comes that woman..."
3804,Jerry,16, Where do I know her?
3805,Lorraine,16," Hello, Jerry!"
3806,Jerry,16, Heeeeyyyy... How you doin'?
3807,Lorraine,16, How is everything?
3808,Jerry,16," Good, good, good... What's goin' on?"
3809,Lorraine,16," Oh, working hard. And you?"
3810,Jerry,16," Oh, you know, working around, same stuff, doing... whatever."
3811,Lorraine,16, You haven't been around in a while.
3812,Jerry,16," I know, I know... Well, you know."
3813,Lorraine,16, You should come by.
3814,Jerry,16," Definitely. I plan to, I'm not just saying that."
3815,Elaine,16," Hi, I'm Elaine."
3816,Lorraine (shaking her hand),16, Lorraine. Catalano.
3817,Jerry,16," I'm sorry, Lorraine, this is Elaine..."
3818,Lorraine,16," Well it was nice seeing you, Jerry. And nice meeting 
              you. (she"
3819,Elaine (smug),16," Oh, nice to meet you too, Lorraine!"
3820,Jerry,16," Oh my god, Lorraine... that's Lorraine from my uncle's office. 
              I'm in"
3821,Elaine,16, The one you broke the plans with tonight?
3822,Jerry,16," Yeah, she works in his office. Now she's gonna see him tomorrow 
              and"
3823,Jerry,16," ...My uncle to my cousin, my cousin to my sister, my sister 
              to me."
3824,Elaine,16," You should've just had dinner with your uncle tonight and 
              gotten in"
3825,Jerry,16," Just a movie?! You don't understand. This isn't 'Plans 1 
              through 8"
3826,Jerry,16," Hey, I got news for you, if we're making this movie, we 
              gotta get a"
3827,Elaine,16," Alright, OK. Let's stop fooling around. Let's just slip 
              him some"
3828,Jerry,16, In a Chinese restaurant? Do they take money?
3829,Elaine,16," Do they take money? Everyone takes money. I used to go 
              out with a guy"
3830,George,16, 20 bucks? Isn't that excessive?
3831,Elaine,16," Well what do you want to give him, change?"
3832,George,16, It's more than the meal!
3833,Jerry,16," Oh, come on, We'll divide it up three ways."
3834,George,16," Alright. 7,7, (points at himself) 6. I'm not gonna eat 

              that much!"
3835,Jerry,16," I'm counting your shrimps. OK, Who's gonna do it?"
3836,George,16," Oh no, I can't do it. I-I'm not good at these things, I 
              get flustered."
3837,Elaine,16," I guess it's you, Jer."
3838,Jerry,16, Me? What about you?
3839,Elaine,16," Oh, I can't do that, it's a guy thing."
3840,Jerry,16," The woman's movement just can't seem to make any progress 
              in the world"
3841,Elaine,16, Give me the money.
3842,Elaine,16, How's it going'?
3843,Bruce,16, Very busy.
3844,Elaine,16," Boy, we are REALLY anxious to sit down."
3845,Bruce,16, Very good specials tonight.
3846,Elaine,16," If there's anything you can do to get us a table we'd really 
              appreciate"
3847,Bruce,16, What is your name? (he turns the page over the money)
3848,Elaine,16," No no, I want to eat now! (she gets the money from under 
              the page)"
3849,Bruce,16," Yes, we have sea-bass dinner tonight, very fresh."
3850,Elaine (Gives him the money),16," Here, take this. I'm starving. Take 
              it! Take"
3851,Bruce,16," Dennison, 4! (goes over to 4 ladies) Your table is ready."
3852,Elaine,16," No no, no, I want that table. I want that table! Oh, come 
              on, did you"
3853,Jerry,16, You lost the 20.
3854,Elaine,16," Well, how could he do that?"
3855,George,16, You didn't make it clear.
3856,Elaine,16, Make it clear?
3857,Jerry,16," What a sorry exhibition that was. Alright, let me get the 
              money back."
3858,Bruce,16, Your name?
3859,Jerry,16, Seinfeld.
3860,Bruce,16," Yeah, Seinfeld 4!"
3861,Jerry,16," No no no, you see the girl there, with the long hair?"
3862,Bruce,16," Oh yes, yes. Very beautiful girl, very beautiful. Is your 
              girlfriend?"
3863,Jerry,16," Well, actually, we did date for a while, but... it's really 
              not relevant"
3864,Bruce,16, Relationships are difficult. It's very hard to stay together-
3865,Jerry,16," Alright, listen, alright. How much longer is it gonna be?"
3866,Bruce,16," Oh. In about five, ten minutes."
3867,George,16, So?
3868,Jerry,16, There seems to be a bit of a discrepancy.
3869,Elaine,16, So when are we gonna eat?
3870,Jerry,16," Five, ten minutes."
3871,George,16, We should have left earlier. I told you.
3872,Jerry,16, I don't see any way we can eat and make this movie.
3873,Elaine,16," Oh, well I have to eat."
3874,Jerry,16," Well let's just order to go, we'll eat it in the cab."
3875,Elaine,16, Eat it in the cab? Chinese food in a cab?
3876,Jerry,16, We'll eat it in the movie.
3877,Elaine,16," Oh, who do you think you're going? Do you think that they 
              have big"
3878,Jerry,16, Well what do you suggest?
3879,Elaine,16," I say we leave now, we go to 'Skyburger' and we scarf 'em 
              down."
3880,Jerry,16," I'm not going to 'Skyburger'. Besides, it's in the opposite 
              direction,"
3881,Bruce (holding a phone),16, Cartwright?
3882,Elaine,16, I can't have popcorn for dinner!
3883,Bruce,16, Cartwright?
3884,Elaine (tries to snatch food off a waiter's tray),16, I have to eat!
3885,Jerry,16, So they have hotdogs there.
3886,Elaine,16," Oh, movie hotdogs! I rather lick the food off the floor."
3887,George,16," I can't go anywhere, I have to wait here for Tatiana's 
              call. Let me"
3888,George,16," Excuse me, I'm expecting a call. Costanza?"
3889,Bruce,16," Yeah, I just got a call. I yell 'Cartwright! Cartwright!', 
              just like"
3890,George,16," Well, was it for Costanza or..."
3891,Bruce,16," Yes, yes, that's it. Nobody answered."
3892,George,16, Well was it a woman?
3893,Bruce,16," Yeah, yeah. I tell her you not here, she said curse word, 
              I hang up."
3894,George,16, She called. He yelled Cartwright. I missed her.
3895,Jerry,16, Who's Cartwright?
3896,George,16, I'm Cartwright!
3897,Jerry,16, You're not Cartwri-
3898,George,16," Of course I'm not Cartwright! Look, why don't you two just 
              go to the"
3899,Elaine,16," Well me neither, I'm goin' to 'Skyburger'."
3900,Jerry,16, So You're not going?
3901,Elaine,16, You don't need us.
3902,Jerry,16," Well I can't go to a bad movie by myself. Who am I gonna 
              make sarcastic"
3903,George,16, Should we tell him we're leaving?
3904,Elaine,16, What for? Let's just get out of here.
3905,Bruce,16," Seinfeld, 4?"

3921,JERRY,17," (Gesturing to a man) Look at that guy. (Elaine starts to 
              look, but Jerry stops her) I'll bet you he's gettin' hair transplants. 
              Any time you see a guy that age"
3922,ELAINE,17," (Elaine turns to look at the man, trying to make it sound 
              like they aren't talking about him) The thing about that painting.. 
              is with the colors and um.. (Turns"
3923,JERRY,17," (To Elaine) Oh, one more thing about the car. Let it warm 
              up for a minute."
3924,GEORGE,17," That's a tough minute. It's like waiting in the shower 
              for the conditioner to work."
3925,JERRY,17, I don't understand why he couldn't take a cab.
3926,GEORGE,17, Who?
3927,JERRY,17," Elaine is having a ""houseguest."" She's picking 
              him up at the airport tonight."
3928,GEORGE,17, A guy?
3929,ELAINE,17," (Slightly embarrassed) Yes, a guy."
3930,JERRY,17," He's from a.. Yakima, right?"
3931,ELAINE,17, Seattle.
3932,JERRY,17, Everybody's moving to Seattle.
3933,GEORGE,17, It's the pesto of cities. So..?
3934,ELAINE,17, (To Jerry) You tell him.
3935,JERRY,17," Well, from what I can piece together, our friend here met 
              a gentleman."
3936,ELAINE,17, Ed.
3937,JERRY,17," Who was in town on a business venture, and um.."
3938,ELAINE,17," ..We shared an interpersonal experience. (George hits his 
              glass with his fork. To Jerry) Go on."
3939,JERRY,17," So they went out a few times, but apparently, when the fellow 
              returned home, he discovered that the Benes tattoo does not wash 
              off so easily."
3940,ELAINE,17, On some people.
3941,GEORGE,17, Oooh.
3942,JERRY,17," So, he's coming in to stay with her for a week."
3943,ELAINE,17," It was just gonna be a weekend, but then somehow it became 
              a week."
3944,MANAGER,17, What happened?
3945,GEORGE,17," Oh, the busboy left the menu a little close to the candle."
3946,MANAGER,17, Sorry to the disturbance.
3947,ELAINE,17," (Joking, she snobbishly says) I'm never eating here again."
3948,JERRY,17," (Pats George on the back) Nice going. Thank you, that ought 
              to get us a free dessert.. (They can see the manager chewing the 
              busboy out from the dining"
3949,GEORGE,17," Did I get him in trouble? Because of what I said?! I just 
              told him what happened.. he didn't do it on purpose.. (Mangager 
              and busboy are arguing. The"
3950,ELAINE,17," I said I would never eat here again.. But, I, I.. he had 
              to know I was kidding."
3951,JERRY,17," (Casually buttering a roll, like he's the innocent one) 
              I didn't say anything."
3952,GEORGE,17, I can't believe it. He's going! He's fired!
3953,ELAINE,17," Oh, I said it in a kidding way."
3954,GEORGE,17, I didn't know he'd get fired.
3955,JERRY,17," (Jokingly trying to put more pressure on Elaine and George) 
              He'll probably kill his family over this."
3956,GEORGE,17," What if he's waiting for me outside? He pointed at me! 
              Did you see him point?!"
3957,JERRY,17," (Again, joking) A lot of ex-cons become busboys. They seem 
              to gravitate twards 'em."
3958,GEORGE,17, Was it my fault?
3959,ELAINE,17, Was it my fault?
3960,JERRY,17," (Doesn't have a care in the world) ..Maybe I'll try that 
              pesto."
3961,[Setting,17, Jerry's apartment]
3962,JERRY,17," Look, I feel bad for him too, but he'll get another job. 
              I mean, let's face it, it's not a profession where you embellish 
              your resume and undergo a series of"
3963,GEORGE,17," (Eating a sandwich) Oh, like you really know busboys."
3964,JERRY,17," Oh, like you do."
3965,GEORGE,17," Hey, at least I was a camp waiter."
3966,JERRY,17, (Scoffing) Camp.
3967,GEORGE,17, It was a fat camp. Those kids depended on me.
3968,JERRY,17, Elaine?
3969,ELAINE,17, (Through intercom) Yeah.
3970,JERRY,17," Busboys are always changing jobs. That's the business. I 
              know. I work with these guys. I tallk to them in the kitchen at 
              the comedy clubs."
3971,GEORGE,17, Then why don't you try and get him another job?
3972,JERRY,17," I'd love to, but I don't know anything about him. He could 
              be one of those people that walks around the street pricking people 
              with pins."
3973,ELAINE,17," I don't know if you people are aware of this, but I am 
              one clever chickadee."
3974,GEORGE,17, What? Did you get the busboy's number?
3975,ELAINE,17," His phone's been disconnected, but I was able to obtain 
              an address - 1324 Amsterdam Avenue, apartment 4D. (Hands George 
              a card) Now, I did my"
3976,GEORGE,17, How did you get all this?
3977,ELAINE,17," Does the word ""charm"" mean anything to you?"
3978,JERRY,17," No. (George grabs his jacket) So now you're going to his 
              apartment? I really think this is nuts."
3979,GEORGE,17," (Putting his jacket on) I'd like to apologize. I want to 
              tell him I.. I.. didn't mean to get him in trouble."
3980,JERRY,17," You, you're going now?"
3981,GEORGE,17," Yeah, I want to see if there's anything I can do.. maybe 
              get him another job.. maybe I'll hear of something."
3982,JERRY,17, Maybe the fat camp. (To Elaine) You're not going?
3983,ELAINE,17," I would, but I have to pick up Ed at the airport."
3984,JERRY,17," I just don't think you should go alone. Can't you wait till 
              after my set?"
3985,GEORGE,17, It'll take to long.
3986,JERRY,17, Take the K-man. A little support..
3987,GEORGE,17, (Unsure) I don't a..
3988,KRAMER,17, Take me where? Where?
3989,[Setting,17, An apartment building hallway]
3990,GEORGE,17," Look, I really appreciate your coming, but if you wouldn't 
              mind - try not to say too much."
3991,KRAMER,17, What am I gonna say?
3992,GEORGE,17, I don't know.
3993,KRAMER,17," Well, I'm not an idiot."
3994,GEORGE,17, Certainly not.
3995,KRAMER,17, Then we're cool.
3996,GEORGE,17," Yeah.. yeah, we're - we're cool. (Knocks lightly. Kramer 
              takes charge by knocking on the door louder. The busboy answers) 
              Uh, I'm sorry to bother"
3997,KRAMER,17, (Patting George on the shoulder) He's a hell of a guy.
3998,GEORGE,17, This is a guy I know.. Kramer.
3999,KRAMER,17, Habla espanol?
4000,GEORGE,17, (To himself) Oh my God.
4001,ANTONIO,17, Si.
4002,KRAMER,17, Como se dice.. waterbed?
4003,GEORGE,17," (Interrupting) Anyway, I just wanted to let you know I'm 
              really sorry that happened, and if I can help out in any way, I'll 
              certainly be glad to do that."
4004,KRAMER,17, You got anything to drink? Agua?
4005,GEORGE,17," Oy uy uy.. (Antonio points to the sink) We really should 
              get going."
4006,KRAMER,17, Let me get a glass of water. (Heads tward the sink)
4007,GEORGE,17, Hurry up.
4008,ANTONIO,17," (Notices that his cat is missing) Pequita? Pequita? (Starts 
              to panic)"
4009,KRAMER,17, His cat's gone.
4010,ANTONIO,17," (Notes the door was left wide open) La puerta esta abierta. 
              (Starts screaming) La puerta esta abierta! (To Kramer and George) 
              Who left the door"
4011,[Setting,17, Antonio's apartment]
4012,KRAMER,17," ..You know, cats run away all the time. You know, my aunt, 
              she had a cat. Ran away. Showed up three years later.. you never 
              know. They got things in"
4013,GEORGE,17," (Gestures for Kramer to shut up) Once again, Antonio, I 
              can't even begin to say how deeply, deeply sorry I am about everything. 
              The job, the cat.. (A"
4014,KRAMER,17," The wire was sticking out.. (Fits the two broken pieces 
              together) Yeah."
4015,GEORGE,17," (Hands Antonio a card) Here's my card. I'm in real estate, 
              so, if you're ever looking for something bigger, something nicer.. 
              (Antonio is staring at him,"
4016,KRAMER,17," You oughta get that wire fixed. (They go to leave) I got 
              the door. (Shuts the door, the broken lamp falls to the floor)"
4017,[Setting,17, Jerry's apartment]
4018,JERRY,17," (On the phone) George, stop worrying about this guy. It 
              wasn't your fault.. Come on, he's not stalking you."
4019,KRAMER,17, Hey.
4020,JERRY,17," (To Kramer) Hey. (To George) He doesn't even know where 
              you live.. Who told you to give him your business card?.. (Intercom 
              buzzes) That's Elaine."
4021,KRAMER,17, It's been a week. It's up to the cat now.
4022,JERRY,17," (Into phone) Kramer says it's up to the cat now. (To Kramer) 
              It'll be on your conscience."
4023,KRAMER,17, Oh? How do you figure?
4024,JERRY,17," (Into phone) How do you figure? (To Kramer) 'Cause you're 
              the one who left the door open."
4025,KRAMER,17, Why was I in charge of closing the door?
4026,JERRY,17," (Into phone) Why was he in charge of closing the door? (Irritated 
              at the phone message relay, to Kramer) 'Cause you came in after 
              him!"
4027,KRAMER,17, So!
4028,JERRY,17," (Into phone) So! (To Kramer - getting even more angry) So, 
              the last person in should close the door!"
4029,KRAMER,17, Let me talk to him.
4030,JERRY,17," (To Kramer) Talk - call him from your house. (Elaine enters. 
              Kramer leaves. To phone) He's calling you now.. okay. (Hangs up)"
4031,ELAINE,17, Ed's downstairs. CAn I have the car keys?
4032,JERRY,17, No hello?
4033,ELAINE,17," Got any asprin? (Finds some) Hello. Now, lookit, you guarantee 
              this car will get me to the airport tomarrow? No problems?"
4034,JERRY,17," Guarantee? ..Hey, it's a car."
4035,ELAINE,17," Because if there's even the slightest chance of any problem 
              at all, I don't want to take it - because if I don't get this guy 
              on a plane to Seattle and out of my"
4036,JERRY,17," (Jokingly asking) So, did you have a nice week together?"
4037,ELAINE,17," I heard a little ping in the car last time. What was that 
              ping?"
4038,JERRY,17, There's no ping. Why are you so wacky?
4039,ELAINE,17," Jerry, you cannot imagine how much I hate this guy.. and 
              he hasn't even done anything! It's the situation. He's a wonderful 
              guy, but I hate his guts!"
4040,JERRY,17," So, you two been, uh.."
4041,ELAIEN,17," No! I told him I've been having my period for the last 
              five days! I'm sleeping all squished over on the edge of my bed.. 
              But, I've only got fourteen hours to"
4042,JERRY,17, What's your airport route?
4043,ELAINE,17, I've got it all mapped out - I'm taking the tunnel.
4044,JERRY,17, ..What about the Van Wyck?
4045,ELAINE,17," I spoke to a cab driver. For five bucks, he turned me on 
              to the Rockaway Boulevard shortcut."
4046,JERRY,17, Oooh.
4047,JERRY,17, You still using that old alarm clock?
4048,ELAIEN,17," Oh, no, no. I bought a new one today. It's got everything 
              - it's got everything... If you oversleep more than ten minutes, 
              a hand comes out and slaps you in"
4049,[Setting,17, Night club]
4050,JERRY,17," Flying doesn't make me nervous - driving to the airport 
              can make you very nervous because when you're flying, when you're 
              getting on the plane, if you miss"
4051,[Setting,17, Elaine's apartment]
4052,"(Elaine and Ed are in bed. Elaine awakes to find out that it's 
              9",17,15 - they overslept. She gets frantic)
4053,ED,17, (Going back to sleep) We'll never make it. I'll leave tomarrow.
4054,ELAINE,17," Tomarrow?! Are you crazy? No, now, now! Let's go! (Gets 
              his suitcase from the closet, throws it on the bed, and frantically 
              starts packing) You get"
4055,ED,17, Can I shower?
4056,ELAINE,17, Shower?! ARe you out of your mind?!
4057,ED,17, I gotta shower. I'll feel dirty all day.
4058,ELAINE,17," Forget the shower! The shower's out. Move it! Put your 
              clothes on! Put your clothes on! (Pulls out drawers of clothes, 
              turning them over in the suitcase."
4059,ED,17, The kitchen.
4060,ELAINE,17, The kitchen?!
4061,ED,17, I've got a bag of cashews in there.
4062,ELAINE,17, They're not making it! Let's get your pants on!
4063,ED,17," What's the big deal if we don't make it? I'll just go tomarrow 
              or the next day."
4064,ELAINE,17, No! You have your ticket! You have to go now!
4065,ED,17, I'll never make it.
4066,ELAINE,17, Don't say that!
4067,ED,17," But it takes forty-five minutes to get there. That'll only 
              leave me five minutes to get to the plane."
4068,ELAINE,17, Shut up and pack!
4069,ED,17," And what if I don't make the plane? You'll have already left. 
              Then what will I do?"
4070,ELAINE,17, You're talking too much!
4071,ED,17, Where's my sweater?
4072,ELAINE,17, What?!
4073,ED,17, My brown sweater.
4074,ELAINE,17, What? What sweater?
4075,ED,17, My brown sweater.
4076,ELAINE,17, You didn't bring a brown sweater.
4077,ED,17, I brought a brown sweater.
4078,ELAINE,17," Here! Here! You want a brown sweater?! (Recahes into one 
              of her drawers, and grabs a brown sweater, then packs it) You got 
              a brown sweater!"
4079,ED,17, That's not mine. I can't take your sweater.
4080,ELAINE,17," It's brown! (Takes clothes still on the hangers, and dumps 
              them into the suitcase)"
4081,ED,17, What are you doing?!
4082,ELAINE,17," NO time for folding.. (Looks around) I think that's it. 
              (Zips up the suitcase)"
4083,ED,17, My shoes. You packed my shoes.
4084,ELAINE,17," Shoes? Shoes?! Shoes?! Shoes weren't invented till the 
              fourth century! People walked around for thousands of years without 
              them! (Puts her coat on over"
4085,[Setting,17, Jerry's apartment]
4086,JERRY,17, Anywhere in the city?
4087,GEORGE,17, Anywhere in the city - I'll tell you the best public toilet.
4088,JERRY,17, Okay.. Fifty-fourth and Sixth?
4089,GEORGE,17," Sperry Rand Building. 14th floor, Morgan Apparel. Mention 
              my name - she'll give you the key."
4090,JERRY,17, Alright.. Sixty-fifth and Tenth.
4091,GEORGE,17," (Scoffs) ARe you kidding? Lincoln Center. Alice Tully Hall, 
              the Met. Magnificent facilities."
4092,ELAINE,17," (Slow, as if remember a dream) I never new I could drive 
              like that. I was going faster than I've ever gone before, and yet,

4094,GEORGE,17, The busboy's coming?
4095,JERRY,17, You don't mean here?
4096,KRAMER,17, Yeah. I just buzzed him in. He's on his way up..
4097,GEORGE,17," He's coming up?! (Moves to the door) I'll check you out 
              later."
4098,JERRY,17, Where are you going?
4099,GEORGE,17, I'm the one he wants! He's coming to settle the score.
4100,JERRY,17," (Trying to get George and Kramer out) No. You three all 
              know each other. There's no point in me getting involved at this 
              stage of the game."
4101,KRAMER,17," No, he's not going to do anything. I guarantee it."
4102,GEORGE,17," Oh, the hell with it. Let him kill me. I.."
4103,KRAMER,17, Antonio. In here!
4104,GEORGE,17," (Nervous, his voice cracks) Hey, Antonio. How's it going?"
4105,ANTONIO,17," Three nights ago, a gas main beneath the restaurant exploded, 
              killing five people in my section, including the busboy who replaced 
              me. If I am not fired"
4106,GEORGE,17," (Trying to be modest) Ah, come on.."
4107,ELAINE,17, (Into the intercom) Yeah?
4108,ED,17, It's Eddie.
4109,ELAINE,17, He's coming up. (Buzzes him in) He's coming up..
4110,ANTONIO,17," And that very same night of the accident, while looking 
              for Pequita, I found a job in a restaurant where they pay me almost 
              twice what I was making"
4111,ED,17," Hey, watch were you're going. You almost knocked my head off!"
4112,ANTONIO,17," Hey, why don't you watch where you're going, okay? 'Cause 
              you bumped into me!"
4113,ED,17," Who do you think you're talking to, pal?"
4114,ANTONIO,17," Hey, get your hands off me!"
4115,ED,17, Go to hell!
4116,[Setting,17, Coffee shop]
4117,JERRY,17, He'll get another job. He's a busboy!
4118,GEORGE,17," It won't for a while. At least not until after the cast 
              comes off."
4119,JERRY,17, It was that fall down the stairs. That's what did it.
4120,GEORGE,17," That's not how it happened. It's when he fell on him with 
              his knee."
4121,ELAINE,17," Oh, that was awful. Poor Antonio. (Waiter hands Elaine 
              two bags of food to go) ..Thanks."
4122,GEORGE,17," So, much longer?"
4123,ELAINE,17," Till when - till he goes back to Seattle, or till he can 
              feed himself?"
4124,GEORGE,17, (Not wanting to make Elaine mad) I guess it's not important.
4125,ELAINE,17, Take care of yourselves. (Leaves)
4126,GEORGE,17," I should probably get going too. If I don't feed Pequita 
              by seven, she goes all over everything.. take it easy."
4127,JERRY,17," Yeah.. (Takes a bite of his sandwich as the waiter starts 
              cleaning off the table) How ya doing?"
4128,[Setting,17, Night club]
4129,JERRY,17," First of all, I can't believe that people actually do fight. 
              People have fist fights in life. I can't really believe that we 
              have boxing either. It's really kind of an"

              do you favors after you dump "
4230,GEORGE,19," Oh, no. We left on good terms. "

              she was"
4240,ELAINE,19, How would you like it if someone told YOU the truth?
4241,GEORGE,19, Like what? What could they say?
4242,ELAINE,19, There are plenty of things to say. 
4243,GEORGE,19," Like what? I'm bald? What is it specifically? Is, is there 
              an odor I'm not aware of?"

4258,JERRY,19," Yeah, I know champagne, limos, cigars. WHAT happened to 
              the papers? "
4259,GEORGE,19," She put them in her pocketbook. I guess she took them with 
              her."
4260,ELAINE,19, Pocketbook or a handbag? 
4261,JERRY,19, Is that relevant? She TOOK them. Call her office.
4262,GEORGE,19," Give me the phone. <dials> Yea, Hi I would like to 
              speak to Patrice. ..."
4263,JERRY,19, What? What?

              They put those electrodes in "

              depression"
4313,GEORGE,19," Her roommate. I've driven women to lesbianism before but 
              never to a mental institution. "
4314,KRAMER,19," My friend Bob Sacamano had shock treatments. But his synapses 
              were so large, it had no effect. "
4315,JERRY,19," You know I hate to raise a crass financial concern but was 
              there any"

4318,GEORGE,19, I don't know.

4321,JERRY,19, Woodhaven.
4322,GEORGE,19, We could. 
4323,GEORGE,19," I'm very nervous about this. I've never spoken to a mental 
              patient before. "
4324,JERRY,19," My cousin Douglas was in a place like this one time . He 
              came over to"

              you think of the coffee table? "
4342,ELAINE,19, It's invisible.
4343,KRAMER,19," So, is everything cool? or what?"
4344,TINA,19," Yeah, you seem little bit dysfunctional."
4345,ELAINE,19," Well, "
4346,TINA,19, Come on Elaine. just tell us the truth. 
4347,ELAINE,19," The Truth!, You want The Truth? "
4348,PATRICE,19, Who are you?
4349,GEORGE,19," Oh, this is my friend Jerry."
4350,PATRICE,19, Why are you talking like that? And what do YOU want?
4351,JERRY,19," Want, want? What could I possibly want? Uh, I just came 
              because I, I heard so many nice things "
4352,PATRICE,19, George thinks I'm pretentious. 
4353,GEORGE,19," Pretentious? Who isn't pretentious? Ha, ha, if everyone 
              who was"
4354,PATRICE,19," You're just trying to take it all back because you're 
              feeling guilty I'm in here."
4355,GEORGE,19," No, that's not it at all."
4356,PATRICE,19, Don't LIE George.
4357,GEORGE,19,I'M NOT A LIER!
4358,GEORGE,19," Uh, we're cool. Everything's cool (to security attendent)"
4359,JERRY,19, Just chatting. Friendly. 
4360,GEORGE,19," All righty, no reason for us to uh, raise our voices. "
4361,PATRICE,19, I know what you said. You can't change that.
4362,GEORGE,19," What I said? I saw stupid things all the time I can't go 
              two minutes without saying stupid things."
4363,JERRY,19," It's one stupid thing after another. So let me ask you, 
              when you come to one of these places, "
4364,GEORGE,19," You should be the one criticizing me. I, I'm lucky to even 
              know someone like you. "
4365,PATRICE,19, You mean that?
4366,GEORGE,19, Of course I mean that. I am incapable of guile. 
4367,JERRY,19," He's never guiled. You know some women keep a lot of important 
              papers in their, uh, pocket book. "
4368,PATRICE,19," Papers? Oh, Jerry, You're the Jerome with the tax problem. 
              You know after that day with George I "
4369,JERRY,19, there are no copies.
4370,PATRICE,19, So are you saying you want to continue seeing me? 
4371,JERRY,19, Who makes copies? 
4372,ELAINE,19," The truth is ... I think you make ... a very nice couple. 
            "
4373,KRAMER,19," Oh,"
4374,TINA,19," Kramer, "
4375,TINA,19, Here Kramer?
4376,KRAMER,19," No, lets go to the couch..."
4377,JERRY,19," <on phone>Yes, I'm trying to get a copy of a receipt 
              for a computer thatI bought there.... "
4378,JERRY,19," Anybody want to take a walk down to 48th street? I think 
              I may have tracked down another receipt. "
4379,ELAINE,19, I can't. I have to go visit Tina in the hospital.
4380,JERRY,19, George? 
4381,KRAMER,19," Hey, Are you going to the hospital now?"
4382,ELAINE,19," Yeah, I suppose I am. "
4383,KRAMER,19," All right, great, great uh, we'll share a cab."
4384,JERRY,19, You're going by 48th St. You can give me a ride.
4385,GEORGE,19," Hey, I'm getting in on that."
4386,ELAINE,19, You know you're chippin' in.
4387,GEORGE,19, You're going that way anyway!

4403,JERRY,20, We waited 35 minutes in the rent-a-car place.
4404,HELEN,20," I don't know why you had to rent a car. We would have picked you 
        up."
4405,JERRY,20, What's the difference?
4406,HELEN,20, You could have used our car.
4407,JERRY,20, I don't wanna use your car.
4408,HELEN,20, What's wrong with our car?
4409,JERRY,20, Nothing. It's a fine car. What if you wanna use it?
4410,HELEN,20, We don't use it.
4411,MORTY,20, What are you talking? We use it.
4412,HELEN,20," If you were using it, we wouldn't use it."
4413,JERRY,20, So what would you do? You'd hitch?
4414,HELEN,20, How much is a rent-a-car?
4415,JERRY,20, I don't know. 25 bucks a day.
4416,HELEN,20, What? You're crazy.
4417,MORTY,20, Plus the insurance.
4418,JERRY,20," Oh, I didn't get the insurance."
4419,MORTY,20, How could you not get the insurance?
4420,HELEN,20, We'll pay for the car.
4421,JERRY,20, You're not paying for it.
4422,HELEN,20, Morty. (asking him to back her. He doesn't)
4423,JERRY,20, God it's so hot in here. Why don't you put on the air conditioning?
4424,HELEN,20," You don't need the air conditioner. So, you have your speech all 
        ready?"
4425,JERRY,20, It's not a speech. Do I have to make a speech?
4426,HELEN,20," Of course, they're giving a testimonial for your father. You could 
        do your comic routines."
4427,JERRY,20," (ironically) Oh yeah, that will go over real well with that crowd."
4428,ELAINE,20," (looking by the window) Ooh, you have a lake?"
4429,JERRY,20, The lake isn't real.
4430,HELEN,20, The lake is real.
4431,MORTY,20, Are you kidding? They built the lake.
4432,HELEN,20, But it's real. It's water.
4433,HELEN,20, Where are you going with those?
4434,JERRY,20, I'm gonna put Elaine's stuff in here.
4435,HELEN,20, Don't sleep in there. You can you use the bedroom.
4436,ELAINE,20, I can't take your bedroom.
4437,HELEN,20, I'm up at 6 o'clock in the morning.
4438,ELAINE,20, I can't kick you out of your bed.
4439,HELEN,20, We don't even sleep.
4440,JERRY,20, Ma.
4441,HELEN,20," But this is sofa bed, you'll be uncomfortable."
4442,JERRY,20, (to Morty) What about you?
4443,MORTY,20, Why should I be comfortable?
4444,JERRY,20, (to Helen) What about him?
4445,HELEN,20," Don't worry, he's comfortable."
4446,MORTY,20, I'll sleep standing up. I'll be fine.
4447,HELEN,20, Will you stop?
4448,ELAINE,20," Yeah, I'll just stay in here. (goes in the guest room)"
4449,HELEN,20," (asking Jerry to go in the kitchen so Elaine won't hear) Jerry. 
        You don't have to stay on the couch on my account. The two of you could 
        stay in there together."
4450,JERRY,20, No that's not such a good idea.
4451,HELEN,20, Well I tought that...
4452,JERRY,20, Not now. She's right inside.
4453,HELEN,20, (quieter) What happened?
4454,JERRY,20, I don't know. We decided we don't really work as a couple.
4455,HELEN,20, What does that mean?
4456,JERRY,20, Well...
4457,MORTY,20, (comes to the kitchen and with a loud voice) Why are you whispering?
4458,JERRY,20," Shh! Nothing, nothing."
4459,HELEN,20, Elaine...
4460,MORTY,20, (still loud) What about her?
4461,JERRY,20," (tries to explain to Morty but Elaine then comes out of the guest 
        room to get more luggages, so he fakes a conversation) ...but you know, 
        look at the sun-dried tomatoes. Where were they five years ago? It just 
        goes to show you. You never know what... huh (waiting for Elaine to go 
        back in the guest room) you know... huh... What could happen to a vegetable. 
        It could just take right off at any time. (Morty finally gets it. So Jerry 
        goes on quieter) We've tried all kind of arrangments, but we can't seem 
        to be friend when we sleep together."
4462,HELEN,20, He's an idealist.
4463,MORTY,20, What the hell are you looking for?
4464,JERRY,20, I'm looking. That's the point. I like looking.
4465,HELEN,20, He likes looking.
4466,MORTY,20, So look.
4467,HELEN,20, But how long can you look?
4468,JERRY,20, I'm going for the record.
4469,HELEN,20," You know your father wouldn't say so but he's really glad you 
        came."
4470,JERRY,20," Oh, come on."
4471,HELEN,20, This is a big thing for him. Outgoing president of the condo association.
4472,(knock on door,20," this is Jack and Doris, neigboors)"
4473,MORTY,20, Aha!
4474,DORIS,20, So they arrived safely.
4475,MORTY,20, (to Jerry) You remember Jack and Doris?
4476,JERRY,20, Nice to meet you. This is Elaine.
4477,ELAINE,20, Hi. Nice to meet you.
4478,JACK,20," So Jerry, you came all the way down here for this?"
4479,ELAINE,20, And scuba diving.
4480,HELEN,20, Scuba diving? Who's going scuba diving?
4481,JERRY,20, We're going scuba diving. We'll be back in time.
4482,HELEN,20, What do you have to go scuba diving for?
4483,JERRY,20, For fun.
4484,HELEN,20, For fun?
4485,MORTY,20, Jack have some spong cake.
4486,JACK,20," No. thanks, no."
4487,MORTY,20, Jack is emceeing tomorrow. He's in charge of the whole thing.
4488,JACK,20," So Jerry, your mother told me you're gonna do one your little comedy 
        skit tommsorow?"
4489,JERRY,20, I don't think so.
4490,JACK,20," No? Listen Morty you wanna settle up for last night? (Morty nods) 
        All right. I owe you 19.45$ (he gets his checks book and a pen from his 
        pocket)."
4491,MORTY,20, What did you have? You had the minute steak?
4492,JACK,20, Yeah.
4493,MORTY,20, Did you have a coke or what?
4494,JACK,20, I did NOT have a coke.
4495,MORTY,20, Somebody had a coke.
4496,HELEN,20, Oh I had a coke.
4497,DORIS,20, And I had the scampi.
4498,JACK,20, So that's 17.10$ and the tax and the tip.
4499,MORTY,20, All right. Make it 20 bucks.
4500,MORTY,20, 19.45$ ?
4501,JACK,20," See? You know your father. He can't get a write to the penny, but 
        that's why he was such a good president."
4502,JERRY,20, What kind of pen is that?
4503,JACK,20, This pen?
4504,JERRY,20, Yeah.
4505,JACK,20," This is an astronaut pen. It writes upside down. They use this 
        in space."
4506,JERRY,20," Wow! That's the astronaut pen. I heard about that. Where did you 
        get it?"
4507,JACK,20, Oh it was a gift.
4508,JERRY,20," Cause sometimes I write in bed and I have to turn and lean on 

        my elbow to make the pen works."
4509,JACK,20, Take the pen.
4510,JERRY,20, Oh no.
4511,JACK,20, Go ahead.
4512,JERRY,20, I couldn't
4513,JACK,20," Come on, take the pen!"
4514,JERRY,20, I can't take it.
4515,JACK,20, Do me a personal favor!
4516,JERRY,20," No, I'm not..."
4517,JACK,20, Take the pen!
4518,JERRY,20, I cannot take it!
4519,JACK,20, Take the pen!
4520,JERRY,20, Are you sure?
4521,JACK,20, Positive! Take the pen!
4522,JERRY,20," O.K. Thank you very much. Thank you. Gee, boy!"
4523,HELEN,20," Jack, what are you doing?"
4524,JACK,20, Stop it!
4525,DORIS,20," Jack, we should go. (they go to the door) It was nice to meeting 
        you."
4526,ELAINE,20," Mmm, nice to meet you."
4527,JERRY,20, Thanks again.
4528,JACK,20, Come on!
4529,DORIS,20, (to Morty) She's adorable. (they leave)
4530,HELEN,20, (as soon as the door's closed) What did you take his pen for?
4531,JERRY,20, What he gave it to me.
4532,HELEN,20, You didn't have to take it.
4533,MORTY,20, Oh my God! She's gotta make a big deal out of everything.
4534,JERRY,20, He offered it to me.
4535,HELEN,20, Because you made such a big fuss about it.
4536,JERRY,20, I liked it. Should I have said I didn't like it?
4537,HELEN,20," You shouldn't have said anything. What did you expect him to do? 
        (the camera shows Elaine shaking her head at their dispute)"
4538,HELEN,20, He loves that pen.
4539,MORTY,20, Oh come on!
4540,HELEN,20," He talks about it all the time. Every time he takes it out he 
        goes on and on about how it writes upside down, how the astronauts use 
        it."
4541,JERRY,20," If he likes it so much, he never should have offered it."
4542,HELEN,20, He didn't think you'd accpet.
4543,JERRY,20," Well, he was wrong."
4544,HELEN,20," I know his wife. She has some mouth on her. She'll tell everyone 
        in the condo now that you made him give you the pen. They're talking about 
        it right now. (againe we see Elaine smiling at their argument)"
4545,JERRY,20, So you want me to return it?
4546,HELEN,20, Yes.
4547,MORTY,20, He's not gonna return the pen. That's ridiculous.
4548,JERRY,20, Hey I don't even want the pen now!
4549,MORTY,20," Jack can afford to give away a pen with all his money. Believe 
        me. He gives me a check for 19.45. He didn't have a Coke. Ho, ho, ho!"
4550,ELAINE,20," Here, let me see it. (She takes a pad to try the pen) Hey, it 
        wrtites upside down."
4551,[setting,20, condo's guest room]
4552,ELAINE,20, Come in.
4553,JERRY,20, Are you O.K. in here?
4554,ELAINE,20, Why is it so hot in here? How can they sleep like this?
4555,JERRY,20," It's only for three days. Today's over and we have tommorow. We 
        leave on Sunday. It's one day, really."
4556,ELAINE,20," Oh man. What is with this bar? It's right in my back. It's killing 
        me."
4557,JERRY,20," Oh you wanna switch? I'm sleeping on a love seat. I've got my 
        feet up in the air like I'm in a space capsule."
4558,ELAINE,20, I am never gonna fall asleep.
4559,JERRY,20," Oh, don't say that. You'll jinx me."
4560,ELAINE,20, How can they not put the air conditioning on?
4561,JERRY,20, They're nuts with temperature.
4562,ELAINE,20, This bar is right in my back! It's making a dent.
4563,JERRY,20, How about that guy writing a check for 19.45?
4564,ELAINE,20," I'm sweating here. I'm in bed, sweating."
4565,JERRY,20," It's one day. Half a day, really. I mean you substract showers 
        and meals, it's like twenty minutes. It will go by like that. (snapping 
        his fingers)"
4566,[setting,20," condo, morning]"
4567,MORTY,20," Stay on 95 South to Biscayne Boulevard. Then you make a left turn. 
        Put you blinker on immediatly, there's an abutment there. Then you're 
        gonna merge over very quickly, but stay on Biscayne. Don't get off Biscayne. 
        You understand me?"
4568,JERRY,20, Stay on Biscayne.
4569,HELEN,20, You're going underwater?
4570,JERRY,20, Yes. Generally that's where scuba diving is done.
4571,HELEN,20," What do you have to go underwater for? What's down there that's 
        so special?"
4572,JERRY,20, What's so special up here?
4573,ELAINE,20, Oh!
4574,HELEN,20, What's the matter?
4575,ELAINE,20, My back.
4576,HELEN,20, What happened?
4577,ELAINE,20, That... That bed. The bar was right in my back.
4578,HELEN,20, (to Jerry) I told you to let us sleep in there.
4579,JERRY,20, Then YOU would be hunched over.
4580,ELAINE,20, I don't even know if I can go scuba diving.
4581,JERRY,20, You can't go?
4582,HELEN,20, So stay home.
4583,ELAINE,20, You can go.
4584,JERRY,20, Without you? That's the whole reason you came down here.
4585,HELEN,20, Don't go.
4586,JERRY,20, You sure?
4587,MORTY,20, Maybe you should see a doctor.
4588,JERRY,20, We'll stay in a hotel tonight.
4589,ELAINE,20, (whispering to Jerry) Yes!
4590,HELEN,20," No, we'll stay in there."
4591,JERRY,20, Why don't you get a new sofa?
4592,MORTY,20, Nobody uses it.
4593,JERRY,20, I'm buying you a new sofa.
4594,HELEN,20," Oh Jerry, don't talk crazy."
4595,ELAINE,20," Mrs Seinfeld, please. I am begging you. Put the air conditioner 
        on."
4596,HELEN,20, You're hot?
4597,ELAINE,20, I've lost 6 pounds.
4598,HELEN,20, I don't even know how to work it.
4599,MORTY,20, I keep telling her it's like an oven in here.
4600,EVELYN,20, Is everybody up?
4601,JERRY,20, Hi. How are you?
4602,EVELYN,20, Hello Jerry.
4603,JERRY,20," Evelyn, this is Elaine."
4604,ELAINE,20, (with pain) Hi Evelyn.
4605,EVELYN,20, Jerry you got thin.
4606,JERRY,20, Too thin?
4607,HELEN,20, Oh stop worrying so much about how you look.
4608,EVELYN,20, So where's the new pen? (everybody's surprised by this question)
4609,JERRY,20," (Jerry scratches his head and acts like he's not sure what she's 
        talking about) What?"
4610,EVELYN,20, The pen. The one Jack Klompus gave you.
4611,HELEN,20, How did you know that?
4612,EVELYN,20, Blanche told me.
4613,HELEN,20, Blanche?
4614,EVELYN,20, That's some good pen. It writes upside down.
4615,ELAINE,20, The astronauts use them.
4616,HELEN,20, What did Blanche say?
4617,EVELYN,20, I don't know. She said Jerry wanted the pen.
4618,JERRY,20, I never really wanted the pen.
4619,MORTY,20, He gave him the pen.
4620,HELEN,20, Morty.
4621,EVELYN,20, Why you don't like the pen?
4622,JERRY,20," No, no, I..."
4623,EVELYN,20," Cause if you don't like it, give it back to him."
4624,HELEN,20, Is that what she said?
4625,EVELYN,20, Who?
4626,HELEN,20, Blanche.
4627,EVELYN,20, What are you talking about?
4628,HELEN,20," Hello? Oh hello Gussy. What? Jerry wouldn't do that. Jack gave 
        it to him. All he said was he liked it. I mean nobody put a gun to his 
        head. (to Jerry) You're giving him back that pen. (She continues the discussion 
        with Gussy but we don't hear it.)"
4629,ELAINE,20, Somebody please-- THE AIR CONDITIONER!
4630,MORTY,20, (Morty gets up) Oh! I forgot all about it.
4631,JERRY,20," All I said was ""I like the pen""."
4632,MORTY,20, How the hell do you work this thing?
4633,[setting,20," still the condo, later] "
4634,HELEN,20, Maybe you shouldn't go tonight.
4635,ELAINE,20," No no, I wanna go."
4636,HELEN,20, But your back hurts.
4637,MORTY,20, Maybe a couple of muscle relaxers would help.
4638,ELAINE,20," Oh, oh, O.K. (Helen holds her sweater tight against herself) 
        You can turn down the air conditioning if you want."
4639,HELEN,20, No. I'm fine.
4640,ELAINE,20, You're not too cold?
4641,HELEN,20, No.
4642,JERRY,20, Don't be alarmed.
4643,MORTY,20, Oh my God! What the hell happened to you?
4644,JERRY,20, I'm O.K. My capillaries burst.
4645,HELEN,20, Your capillaries? Do you know what you look like?
4646,JERRY,20, (to Elaine on the floor) How are you doing?
4647,ELAINE,20, Having a good time!
4648,JERRY,20, Is it my imagination or is it freezing in here?
4649,HELEN,20, What happened to your eyes?
4650,JERRY,20, Well I started to go under...
4651,HELEN,20, With the instructor?
4652,JERRY,20," Yeah, and I got about ten feet down and I felt this tremendous 
        pressure on my mask. Like my eyeballs were being sucked out of their sockets."
4653,HELEN,20, I told you...
4654,JACK,20," Excuse me. (to Helen) Doris would like to borrow red your pocketbook 
        to go with her shoes. (to Elaine on the floor) The shoes have to match 
        the pocketbook. (to the others) What's she doing? Yoga?"
4655,ELAINE,20, My back hurts.
4656,JACK,20, Morty you gotta hurry up. Get ready.
4657,MORTY,20, We got plenty of time.
4658,JACK,20, (to Jerry) What happened to you?
4659,JERRY,20, I got in a fist fight with one of the ladies at the pool.
4660,HELEN,20, It's from scuba diving.
4661,JACK,20, What's there to see underwater?
4662,(Helen turns to Jerry and makes a face like,20, give him back the pen)
4663,JERRY,20," Listen M. Klompus, it was really a nice gesture of you to give 
        me the pen, but I don't really need it."
4664,JACK,20, You what?
4665,JERRY,20," I mean it's a terrific pen, but I think you should keep it. (he 
        tends the pen to Jack)"
4666,JACK,20, Well I mean...
4667,JERRY,20, Take it.
4668,JACK,20, All right! (he smiles and take it)
4669,MORTY,20," You know Jack, you've got a hell of a nerve taking that kid's 
        pen."
4670,JACK,20, Whose pen?
4671,MORTY,20, His pen.
4672,JACK,20, This happens to be my pen.
4673,MORTY,20, You didn't give it to him.
4674,JACK,20, What are you talking about? He pratically begged me for it.
4675,MORTY,20, Where do you come off with this crap?
4676,JACK,20," Listen, do you think I take everything everybody offers me? You 
        offered me sponge cake yesterday. Did I take it?"
4677,MORTY,20, You said you didn't want it!
4678,JACK,20, Of course I wanted it! I love sponge cake!
4679,MORTY,20," Then who the hell said you couldn't have any? I mean what the 
        hell do I care whether you have sponge cake?"
4680,JACK,20," Because I saw the look on your face last week when I took the scotch 
        tape!"
4681,MORTY,20," Ahh! Ahh! So YOU got the scotch tape! I've been looking all over 
        for it!"
4682,JACK,20, Don't worry about it! I'll give it back!
4683,MORTY,20, I don't want it!
4684,JACK,20, I don't want it!
4685,MORTY,20," You know Jack, do me a favor will you? Take the pen and the scotch 
        tape, and get the hell out of here!"
4686,JACK,20, Listen do you think I give a damn?
4687,MORTY,20," Aah! (Jack leaves) The nerve of that guy! Taking back that pen. 
        Well that'it for them."
4688,JERRY,20," What is going on in this community! Are you people aware of what's 
        happening? What is driving you to this behavior? Is it the humudity? Is 
        it the Muzak? Is it the white shoes?"
4689,HELEN,20," I have no use for either one of them. I don't even want them there 
        tonight. (she still has the pocketbook in her hands)"
4690,JERRY,20, Isn't he supposed to be the emcee?
4691,MORTY,20," yeah, he's supposed to be the emcee."
4692,JERRY,20, Well. This should be a very interesting evening.
4693,ELAINE,20, (still on the floor) Uh... What about those muscle relaxers?
4694,[setting,20," reception room, evening]"
4695,PHOTOGRAPHER,20, Say astronaut.
4696,ELAINE,20, Say what? (laughing) Say what?
4697,JERRY,20, (Jerry brings her back) You took too many of those pills.
4698,MORTY,20, Astronaut?
4699,HELEN,20, Say it.
4700,"JERRY, MORTY AND HELEN",20, Astronaut!
4701,ELAINE,20," (still laughing, she says it just as the picture is taking) Astro...naut!"
4702,MORTY,20," Good. O.K. (the photographer walks away) What about last year 
        when I took him to the hospital every day? Did he ever say thank you?"
4703,JERRY,20," Oh God. (foreseeing an arm's grabbing as he sees Uncle Leo entering 
        with his wife Stella)"
4704,JERRY,20, (to Leo) Uncle Leo.
4705,LEO,20, Hello!
4706,STELLA,20, Morty are you nervous?
4707,MORTY,20, What nervous?
4708,LEO,20," (to Jerry while he's grabbing his arm as usual) What's with the 
        sunglasses? Who are you? Van Johnson?"
4709,JERRY,20, I've got a black eye.
4710,STELLA,20, (to Elaine in a childish voice) Hello.
4711,JERRY,20," Elaine, this is my aunt Stella."
4712,HELEN,20, (shouting as she imitates Marlon Brando) STELLA! STELLA!
4713,JERRY,20, (to Stella) Her back hurts.
4714,STELLA,20," Humm... We saw you on ""The Tonight Show"" last week."
4715,LEO,20, I thought Johnny was very rude to you. He didn't even let you talk.
4716,JERRY,20," No, no."
4717,LEO,20," You need some new material. I've heard you do that dog routine three 
        times already."
4718,ELAINE,20," (still with her imitation, shouting even louder) STELLA! STELLA!"
4719,LEO,20," Listen, you should get your cousin Jeffrey to write some material 
        for you."
4720,MORTY,20, What are you talking? Jeffrey works for the parks department!
4721,LEO,20," You should read the letters he's written. He's funnier than the 
        whole bunch of you! (Jack enters with Doris) Oh, here's Jack. We should 
        sit down."
4722,STELLA,20," (to Helen on a sarcastic tone of voice) This better be good. 
        I'm missing ""Golden Girls"" for this."
4723,HELEN,20," (laughing hypocritically till Stella walks away) I hate her like 
        poison."
4724,MORTY,20, (to Helen) Slept on the job? (she shushed him)
4725,JACK,20," Being president of the condo is not easy. It requires hard work, 
        dedication, and commitment, and unfortunately he possesses none of these 
        qualities. (everyone laugh except Jerry, Helen, and Morty. Even Elaine 
        who's still druggy)"
4726,HELEN,20, (Morty complains again to Helen) He's joking.
4727,MORTY,20," (to Jack, loud) That's what you say."
4728,JACK,20," But we do owe him a debt of gratitude because by not fixing the 
        crack in the sidewalk, he put Mrs Ziven out of commission for a few weeks. 
        (Morty is now the only one not laughing)"
4729,MORTY,20," (loud) Tell them when you took my son's pen back. Tell them about 
        that! (he gets up)"
4730,JERRY,20, Dad!
4731,MORTY,20," (to the crowd) He gave my son a pen, and then he takes it back. 
        Tell them about that!"
4732,JACK,20, He gave it to me!
4733,MORTY,20," Come on. That's enough, sit down!"
4734,JACK,20, I'm not sitting down!
4735,JACK,20," Ow! You broke my dental plate! (Jack is touching his dental plate 
        while Morty reaches in Jack's pocket to get the pen) Doris! He broke my 
        dental plate. You son-of-a-bitch! I'm gonna sue you. (he leaves the table 
        and Morty follows him and continue arguing with him. Jerry now have the 
        microphone in his hands and the crowd begins to think the ceremony is 
        over.)"
4736,HELEN,20," Jerry, do your act."
4737,JERRY,20," (in the microphone, but to Helen) I can't. Nobody's even listening."
4738,HELEN,20, They're all gonna leave.
4739,JERRY,20," (to himself) Oh God! (in the microphone) huh... Hey! How you folks 
        doing tonight? (everybody in the crowd is talking over Jerry)"
4740,MAN IN THE CROWD,20, Who are you?
4741,JERRY,20," (still with his sunglasses) Have you ever noticed how they always 
        give you the peanuts on the planes?"
4742,WOMAN IN THE CROWD,20, (to heckle Jerry) Not my Harry. He flies first class.
4743,JERRY,20," Who ever thought the first thing somebody wants on a plane is 
        a peanut?"
4744,MAN IN THE CROWD,20, I'd rather have a bottle of scotch!
4745,HELEN,20, (to Jerry) Do the dog routine.
4746,JERRY,20, All I said was I liked the pen!
4747,ELAINE,20, (wakes up and yells very loud) STELLA!

4749,CHIROPRACTOR,20," You could aggravated. I wouldn't go anywhere for at least 
        five days."
4750,ELAINE,20, Five days? You want me to stay here for five more days?
4751,JERRY,20, There must be some mistake.
4752,CHIROPRACTOR,20, I'm afraid not.
4753,ELAINE,20, (discouraged) Five days. Here.
4754,HELEN,20," (to Jerry, happily) So we have you for five more days!"
4755,JERRY,20," (to Elaine) Well there's really no point in me staying. I mean 
        you just gonna be..."
4756,ELAINE,20, Excuse me?
4757,JERRY,20, Nothing.
4758,EVELYN,20, Good morning.
4759,JERRY,20, Hi Evelyn.
4760,EVELYN,20, (to Helen) Has Morty decided on a lawyer yet?
4761,HELEN,20, I don't think so.
4762,EVELYN,20," Because my nephew Larry could do it. He's a brilliant lawyer. 
        He says Jack has no case."
4763,HELEN,20, I'll ask him when he gets up.
4764,EVELYN,20," Oh, and I spoke to Arnold. And he says that according to the 
        bylaws of the condo constitution, they need six votes to throw you out 
        for unruly behavior. Not five. Doctor Chernov is the one you'll have to 
        suck up to."
4765,MORTY,20," Aw! Aw! Oh my back! Oh my back! It's that bar. Who the hell could 
        sleep on that thing?"
4766,HELEN,20, I was very comfortable.
4767,EVELYN,20," Morty, Arnold says they need six votes to throw you out."
4768,HELEN,20, It's in the constitution.
4769,MORTY,20, (to the chiro) Who are you?
4770,CHIROPRACTOR,20, I'm a chiropractor.
4771,MORTY,20, What are you kidding me?
4772,ELAINE,20, (to Jerry) Five more days?
4773,JERRY,20," Well today's almost over. And weekdays always go by fast. Friday 
        we're leaving. It's like two days really. It's like a cup of coffee. It 
        will go by like that. (snapping his fingers)"

4779,Gavin,21," Travelling, of course, is the best education. Do you know last year I
              was in over forty, forty-five countries, and I would have gone to more but I had
              just got a puppy, and he was too young to take with me. But now I won't travel
              without him."
4780,Jerry,21, Is he on the plane now?
4781,Gavin,21," Oh yes. Yes, he's in the, he's in the baggage compartment. I don't
              know why they won't let him sit up here with me. He's a lot better behaved than
              most of the dregs you find onboard here. Do you, do you have any pets?"
4782,Jerry,21," Uh, just my next door neighbor."
4783,Gavin,21," You're missing out on a relationship that could enrich your life in ways
              that you never could have thought possible."
4784,Jerry,21," Howbout picking up their, you know. You find that enriching?"
4785,Jerry,21, What's the matter?
4786,Gavin,21," Oh, I'm feeling a bit queasy.
"
4787,Attendant #1,21," Sir, we're gonna make an emergency landing in Chicago and get you
              to a hospital."
4788,Gavin,21, My dog. What about my dog?
4789,Attendant #1,21," Uh, you have a dog?"
4790,Attendant #2,21," Do you know anyone on the plane, Mr. Palone?"
4791,Gavin,21, Jerry?
4792,Jerry,21, Huh? How you feeling?
4793,Gavin,21, Would you take care of Farfel?
4794,Jerry,21, Farfel?
4795,Attendant #2,21," It's his dog. We're landing in Chicago to get him to a hospital,
              could you take his dog to New York?"
4796,Jerry,21, The dog? The dog??
4797,Gavin,21, I'm sure it's only for a day or two.
4798,Jerry,21," But, you know, what if, you know?"
4799,Gavin,21," Give me your address and phone number, I'll call you."
4800,Jerry,21," The dog?
"
4801,Jerry,21," Let go, Farfel! Let go, gimme that! Gimme the sneaker you stupid
              idiot! Shut up! (to Elaine) So what would you do?"
4802,Elaine,21," Well it's only been three days, I'm sure he's gonna call."
4803,Jerry (to Farfel),21," STOP IT! SHUT UUUUUUP!!! (to Elaine) Do you believe this? 
              Do you believe what I'm dealing with here, I've got a wild animal in the house! 
              He's deranged, maybe he's got rabies. I can get lockjaw."
4804,Elaine,21, If only.
4805,Jerry,21," Look at this place. He's going everywhere, I can't go out of the house
              at night. I haven't performed in three days. This'll be my first night out of
              the house since I got back."
4806,Elaine,21," Hey, when you walk him, do ya..."
4807,Jerry,21, Do I what?
4808,Elaine,21, Do you pick it up?
4809,Jerry,21," Yes, I pick it up."
4810,Elaine,21, You pick it up?!?
4811,Jerry,21, Well you have to.
4812,Elaine,21," Oh, boy would I love to see that."
4813,Jerry,21," SHUT UP!! Shut up Farfel, stop it! (to Elaine) I don't know what to
              do. I mean what if I take it to the pound then the guy shows up?"
4814,Elaine,21," Maybe you should call the airline, they might know where he is."
4815,Jerry,21," No, I tried. they don't know anything. (notices Elaine making egg
              creams) You gotta put the syrup in first."
4816,Elaine,21," No, milk."
4817,Jerry,21," I'm telling you the guy's a drunk, he's probably on a bender."
4818,Elaine,21, What is a bender anyhow?
4819,Jerry,21," I don't know, they drink and they bend things at the bar."
4820,Elaine,21, I can't believe he hasn't called.
4821,Jerry,21," Two hundred seats on a plane, I gotta wind up next to Yukon Jack and his
              dog Cujo. Shut up! One more day and you are pound bound!"
4822,Kramer,21," Sorry, I can't watch the dog tonight."
4823,Jerry,21, Why?
4824,Elaine,21," We're going to the movies, we're gonna see Prognosis Negative."
4825,Kramer,21," I can't, I gotta get this Ellen out of my life."
4826,Jerry,21, You're breaking up?
4827,Kramer,21," Oh ho ho ho yeah, the sooner the better. I can't wait to do it. You
              know how there's some people you worry about whether you're going to hurt their
              feelings? With her, I'm looking forward to it. I'd like to get it on video,
              watch it in slow motion and freeze frame it. Oh ho, yeah."
4828,Elaine,21," Kramer, I don't know how you lasted as long as you did."
4829,Kramer,21," Woah, you didn't like her?"
4830,Elaine,21," If you could see her personality it would be like one of the Elephant
              Man exhibits, you know where they pull off the sheet and everyone gasps."
4831,Jerry,21, I can't believe someone hasn't killed her yet.
4832,Kramer,21, How come you never said anything?
4833,Jerry,21," You can't tell someone how you feel about their girlfriend until after
              they stop seeing them."
4834,Kramer,21, I tell you.
4835,Jerry,21, You. I'm talking about people.
4836,Elaine,21, Are we still going to the movies tonight?
4837,Jerry,21," No, I can't I gotta watch Farfel, you and George can go without me."
4838,Elaine,21, Just me and George?
4839,Jerry,21, Sure.
4840,Elaine,21, But we need you.
4841,Jerry,21, What do you need me for?
4842,Elaine,21, Because... Yeah?
4843,George,21, Prognosis Negative!
4844,Elaine,21," Because I relate to George through you, we're like friends-in-law. 
              Besides, you said we were gonna see Prognosis Negative together. Can't you just
              put some newspapers down or something?"
4845,Jerry,21," No, I can't trust him, he gets insane. I won't enjoy myself. That's
              right, Farfel, I'm talking about you!"
4846,Elaine,21, Just me and George alone?
4847,George,21," Let's go, people, let's go! It's Prognosis Negative time, wa ha ha
              ha!!!"
4848,Jerry,21, I can't go.
4849,George,21," Can't go, Why not?"
4850,Jerry,21, Because I have to watch idiot Farfel.
4851,George,21, I thought Kramer was watching.
4852,Jerry,21, He's breaking up with his girlfriend tonight.
4853,George,21," Well so what's the problem, you just put some newspaper down."
4854,Jerry,21," No, I don't want that smell in the house."
4855,George,21, You spritz a little Lysol on it.
4856,Jerry,21," No, it's like BO and cologne, they combine forces into some kind of
              strange mutant funk."
4857,George,21, So we're not going?
4858,Jerry,21, Nah. You two go.
4859,George,21, Oh. You still wanna go?
4860,Elaine,21, Do you?
4861,George,21, If you want.
4862,Elaine,21, It's up to you.
4863,Jerry,21, Go ahead.
4864,Elaine,21," Well, it's, I really wanted to see Prognosis Negative with Jerry, uh,
              you wanna see Ponce de Leon?"
4865,George,21, Ponce de Leon? Okay. (to Jerry) You sure you don't wanna go?
4866,Jerry,21, I want to but I can't.
4867,Elaine,21," Oh! I tell you what. How about if I come back here first and I clean
              everything up and I open up the windows and if you're still not satisfied we can
              switch apartments for the night."
4868,Jerry,21, No.
4869,George,21, What about this--
4870,Jerry,21," Forget it. Go ahead, you'll have a good time."
4871,Elaine,21," I know, it's not that."
4872,George,21, It's just we want you to go.
4873,Jerry,21," Well, thank you very much. I'm telling you, one more day stinkbreath!
"
4874,George,21, So how long did you live there?
4875,Elaine,21, About three years.
4876,George,21, That's pretty long.
4877,Elaine,21, Hmm.
4878,George,21," It's not that long, really."
4879,Elaine,21," Yeah. An uncomfortable silence ensues. They both speak at the same
              time, then stop. Another silence."
4880,George,21, And then you came here.
4881,Elaine,21, Yeah. So I've been here about six years.
4882,George (Counting on his fingers),21," Eighty-six, eighty-seven, eighty-eight,
              eighty-nine, ninety, ninety-one... Yup.
"
4883,Jerry,21," Bad dog! Bad dog! You go outside! Outside!! What do you want from
              me? Tell me! Money, you want money? I'll give you money, how much?!
"
4884,Kramer,21," I must have been out of my mind. Look at you. Why don't you do
              something with your life? Sit around here all day, you contribute nothing to
              society. You're just taking up space. How could I be with someone like you? 
              Couldn't respect myself."
4885,George,21, I like herbal tea.
4886,George,21, Chamomile's good. Lemon Lift. Almond Pleasure.
4887,Elaine,21, Jerry likes Morning Thunder.
4888,George,21, Jerry drinks Morning Thunder?
4889,Elaine,21, Yeah.
4890,George,21," Morning Thunder has caffeine in it, Jerry doesn't drink caffeine."
4891,Elaine,21, Jerry doesn't know Morning Thunder has caffeine in it.
4892,George,21, You don't tell him?
4893,Elaine (laughing),21," No. And you should see him, man, he gets all hyper, he
              doesn't even know why, he loves it! He walks around, going, ""God, I feel
              great!"""
4894,George (laughing),21, You don't tell him?
4895,Elaine,21, No.
4896,George,21, That is so funny!
4897,Elaine,21, I know!
4898,George,21," Wait, have you ever seen him throw up?!"
4899,Kramer,21," Please! Please!! I take it all back, everything! I take it all back,
              every word! I love you! I love *you*! I can't live without you, I'll do
              anything!
"
4900,Jerry,21," That's right, Gavin Palone. What? Are you sure? He was released on
              Monday? *Last* Monday? Did he leave a phone number or address? Unbelievable. 
              Well thank you, thanks, thanks very much. (Hangs up) That's it, Farfel! 
              Party's over! Start packing up your little squeeze toys buddy boy, you're
              checking out!
"
4901,Elaine,21," It was weird because George and I get along so great in so many
              situations but this is the first time we ever really went one-on-one."
4902,Jerry,21," Oh, one-on-one's a whole different game. Can't pass off."
4903,Elaine,21," The only time it wasn't uncomfortable was when we were making fun of
              you."
4904,Jerry,21," Going to the dog pound, everybody! Going to the dog pound, come on
              down. (To Elaine) What?"
4905,Elaine,21, Do you have to?
4906,Jerry,21," What am I supposed to do? I don't want to do it. I like dogs. I'm not
              sure this is a dog."
4907,Elaine,21," You know, the guy might have just lost your number."
4908,Jerry,21, I'm in the book and I have a machine.
4909,Elaine,21," Jerry, do you know what they do to dogs at the pound? They keep them
              there for a week and then if nobody claims them, they kill them."
4910,Jerry,21, Really? How late are they open?
4911,Jerry,21, What?
4912,Elaine,21, What is it?
4913,Kramer,21, I went back with Ellen.
4914,Jerry and Elaine,21," Ohhhhh, that's great."
4915,Elaine,21, Terrific.
4916,Jerry,21," Yeah, I really think you guys are good together."
4917,Elaine,21," Yes, she understands you and she is not demanding."
4918,Kramer,21, Do you think that I forgot what you two said about her?
4919,Jerry,21," I was just trying to be supportive, you know. I knew you were upset."
4920,Kramer,21," From now on when we pass each other in the hall, I don't know you, you
              don't know me."
4921,Elaine,21," Oh, Kramer, we didn't mean it."
4922,Jerry,21, What are you doing?
4923,Kramer,21, I'm getting my pot.
4924,Elaine,21," Kramer, we like her."
4925,Jerry,21, Kramer? What did we say that's so bad?
4926,Elaine,21, I believe I referred to her personality as a potential science exhibit.
4927,Jerry,21," I said, ""How come no one's killed her?"" Probably shouldn't have said
              anything, everyone knows the first break-up never takes. (answers buzzer) 
              Yeah?"
4928,George,21, Prognosis Negative!
4929,Jerry,21," Okay, Farfel, put your shoes on."
4930,Elaine,21," Jerry, can't you just give it one more day, it's not his fault."
4931,Jerry,21," It's not my dog, I don't know where this boozehound is."
4932,Elaine,21," Alright, I tell you what. How about if you and George go to the
              movies, and I stay here and watch the dog tonight."
4933,Jerry,21," I can't let you do that, what about Prognosis Negative?"
4934,Elaine,21, We'll see it Sunday.
4935,George,21," Tonight's the night, right? Prognosis Negative?"
4936,Elaine,21," I'm not going, I'm gonna watch the dog."
4937,George,21, What does this mean?
4938,Jerry,21," Well, we'll go see something else tonight. We'll see, uh, Ponce De
              Leon."
4939,George,21," What is with this dog, I thought we were taking it to the pound."
4940,Jerry,21," She talked me into one more day. Talk amongst yourselves, I'm gonna go
              to the bathroom."
4941,George,21," Uh Jerry, how long will you be in there?"
4942,Jerry,21," I don't know, regular human time?"
4943,George,21, Uh why don't you wait then go in the movies?
4944,Jerry,21, Why shouldn't I go here?
4945,Elaine,21," Well, you know, I mean, sometimes it's good to get there and make sure
              you get your seats and then go to the bathroom."
4946,George,21, And isn't it more fun using the urinal?
4947,Elaine,21, Yeah.
4948,Jerry,21," Oh yeah, urinals are fun. Can I go?!"
4949,George,21," Hey, go."
4950,Elaine,21, Who's stopping you?
4951,George,21," What, are you doing me a favor?"
4952,Elaine,21, Like we care if you go to the bathroom.
4953,George,21, How's it going?
4954,Elaine,21, Good. Good. You?
4955,George,21, Things are good.
4956,Elaine,21," Boy, he takes such a long time."
4957,George,21, I know.
4958,Elaine,21, You know what he does in there? He gargles.
4959,George,21, Jerry gargles? Is that why he takes so long?
4960,Elaine,21," Yeah, he does it like six times a day."
4961,George,21, How come we never hear him?
4962,Elaine,21," Because he does it quiet. He does it quiet. Lookit, Just like this,
              watch."
4963,George,21," Wait, wait, did you ever see him throw up?!"
4964,Elaine,21, We talked about that already.
4965,George,21," Oh.
"
4966,George,21," I have nothing to say to anybody. I'm so uninteresting. I think I'm
              out of conversation."
4967,Jerry,21, So what are calling me six times a day?
4968,George,21," All I know about is sports. That's it. No matter how depressed I get,
              I could always read the sports section."
4969,Jerry,21, I could read the sports section if my hair was on fire.
4970,George,21, Know what? Ponce De Leon is sold out.
4971,Jerry,21," It is? Oh yeah, you're right. What else is playing?"
4972,George,21, Nothing except Prognosis Negative.
4973,Jerry,21," Boy, I know she really wants to see that with me.
"
4974,Elaine,21," Gimme the jacket, furface, this is not Seinfeld you're dealing with! 
              When I get through with you, you'll be begging to go to the pound!"
4975,Elaine,21," Shut up. Shut up! (Answers phone) Hello? No, who's calling? Oh my
              god, the dog guy. Where have *you* been? Yeah, well you better pick up your
              dog tonight or he has humped his last leg."
4976,George,21," I mean, I could understand if there was something else playing, but
              it's this or nothing."
4977,Jerry,21, I don't know what to do.
4978,George,21," What is this 'saving movies' thing? Something's playing, you go."
4979,Jerry,21," I know, I know."
4980,George,21," So, what? We're gonna do nothing now, this is crazy."
4981,Jerry,21, It is kind of silly.
4982,George,21, Of course it is.
4983,Jerry,21," I mean, it's just a movie, for god's sake."
4984,George,21, Exactly.
4985,Jerry,21, It's not like she's *in* the movie.
4986,George,21, Right.
4987,Jerry,21," Am I supposed to ruin the whole night because she wants to see it? I
              mean, if I could have seen it with her, fine. But I can't control all these
              circumstances and schedules and peoples' availabilities at movies."
4988,George,21," And she'll still see it, you're not stopping her from seeing it."
4989,Jerry,21," How does sitting next to a person in a movie theater increase the level
              of enjoyment? You can't talk during a movie. You know, this is stupid, c'mon,
              let's just go."
4990,George,21, Good.
4991,Jerry,21, Saving movies.
4992,George,21, Ridiculous!
4993,Jerry,21, Two for Prognosis Negative. I'm in trouble.
4994,George,21," Oh, you're dead.
"
4995,Gavin,21," Bell's Palsy. The entire side of my, of, of my face was paralyzed. 
              Farfel! I couldn't, I couldn't, I couldn't even feed myself, I was completely
              incapacitated. Quiet Farfel!"
4996,Jerry,21," You know it's interesting, because I called the hospital and they said
              you were released on Monday."
4997,Gavin,21," Yes, yes, that's true, but then I was taken to the Bell's Palsy Center
              in, in, in, in Rockford. Absolutely first rate facility, top notch physicians."
4998,Kramer,21," Hey, c'mon, c'mon, get off me!"
4999,Gavin,21," He won't hurt you, he's just playing."
5000,Kramer,21, Hey you keep that mutt away from me.
5001,Gavin,21, Mutt? I'll wager his parents are more pure than yours.
5002,Ellen,21," Kramer, are you coming?"
5003,Jerry,21," Oh, hi Ellen."
5004,Ellen,21, Get in here.
5005,Jerry,21," Listen, it's really been a pleasure taking care of your dog for a week,
              but if you don't mind..."
5006,Gavin,21," Pre-prediction. You'll be calling me to ask if you can come and visit
              him before the month is out."
5007,Jerry,21, Prediction. I never see you or him again for the rest of my life.
5008,Elaine,21, We made plans.
5009,Jerry,21, Why don't we just rent a movie?
5010,Elaine,21, I thought you wanted to see Prognosis Negative.
5011,Jerry,21," No, it's supposed to be really bad, *really* bad. I mean it's long,
              there's no story, it's so unbelievably boring, I heard."
5012,Elaine,21," Jerry, you promised me we'd go."
5013,Jerry,21," Well, George told me the whole story, line for line, I mean I almost
              feel like I've seen it already and walked out on it."
5014,Elaine,21," Wait, George saw the movie? I saw him yesterday, he didn't mention it."
5015,Jerry,21, You and George got together?
5016,Elaine,21," Yeah, I wanted to talk about how we have nothing to talk about."
5017,Jerry,21, Hello.
5018,Jerry,21, What's up?
5019,Kramer,21," Well, you were right."
5020,Jerry,21, About what?
5021,Kramer,21," Ellen. We, uh, broke up again."
5022,"Jerry and Elaine, together",21, Awwwwww.
5023,Jerry,21, Too bad.
5024,Elaine,21, I thought she was the one.
5025,Kramer,21, I'll bring back the pot.
5026,Elaine,21," Okay, c'mon it's movie time."
5027,Kramer,21," Hey, what are you gonna see?"
5028,Jerry,21, Prognosis Negative.
5029,Kramer,21," Hey, that's supposed to be great."
5030,Jerry,21, It's not.
5031,Kramer,21, How do you know?
5032,Jerry,21," I have an instinct for these things.

5036,JERRY,22," Let me speak with the head librarian. ... Because it's absurd. 
              An overdue book "
5037,KRAMER,22, enters
5038,JERRY,22," Ya' got me I fell for it. Alright, OK I can be down there 
              in like a half hour. "
5039,KRAMER,22, What's the problem?
5040,JERRY,22," This you're not goin' to believe. The NYPL says that I took 
              out Tropic of Cancer "
5041,KRAMER,22," Do you know how much that comes to? That's a nickel a day 
              for 20 years. It's "
5042,JERRY,22, It doesn't work like that.
5043,KRAMER,22," If it's a dime a day it could be $100,000"
5044,JERRY,22," It's not going to be anything. I returned the book. I remember 
              it very vividly "
5045,JERRY,22, That orange dress is burned in my memory 
5046,KRAMER,22," Oh, memory burn."
5047,JERRY,22, I wonder what ever happened to her.
5048,KRAMER,22, How did they ever find you?
5049,JERRY,22," Oh, computers, they're cracking down now on overdue books. 
              The whole thing is "
5050,JERRY,22, It's George. Wait 'til he hears we're going to the library
5051,KRAMER,22, You know I never got a library card.
5052,JERRY,22, <to speaker> Coming down.
5053,KRAMER,22," It's all a bunch of cheapskates in there anyway. People 
              sitting around reading "
5054,JERRY,22, I gotta go to the library. You want to go?
5055,KRAMER,22," Yeah, "
5056,KRAMER,22," The Dewey Decimal System, what a scam that was. Boy that 
              Dewey guy really cleaned "
5057,JERRY,22, Where's George
5058,READER,22, Shhh.
5059,KRAMER,22, Tryin' to save a quarter.
5060,JERRY,22, I kinda like those sticks. I'd like to get them for my house.
5061,JERRY,22, This woman's completely ignoring me.
5062,KRAMER,22," Look at her. This is a lonely woman looking for companionship.. 
              ... Spinster. ... "
5063,JERRY,22, Eventually a little shot of penicillin
5064,LIBRARIAN,22, Yes?
5065,JERRY,22, Yes I called before. I got his notice in the mail.
5066,LIBRARIAN,22," Oh, Tropic of Cancer, Henry Miller, Uh, this case has 
              been turned over to our "
5067,KRAMER,22," Bookman? The library investigator's name is actually, Bookman?"
5068,LIBRARIAN,22, It's true.
5069,KRAMER,22," That's amazing. That's like an ice cream man named, Cone."
5070,LIBRARIAN,22," Lt. Bookman has been working here for 25 years so I 
              think he's heard all the jokes."
5071,JERRY,22, Can I speak with this Bookman?
5072,LIBRARIAN,22, Just a second.
5073,GEORGE,22," Jerry, "
5074,JERRY,22, What?
5075,GEORGE,22, I think I saw him. I think it's him.
5076,JERRY,22, Who?
5077,GEORGE,22," Did you see the homeless guy on the library steps screaming 
              obsenities and doing some "
5078,JERRY,22, Yeah.
5079,KRAMER,22, yeah
5080,GEORGE,22," I think that's Mr. Hayman. ...The gym teacher from our 
              High School."
5081,READER,22, Shhh.
5082,JERRY,22, <whispers> Are you sure?
5083,GEORGE,22," He's older, completely covered in filth, no whistle, but 
              I think it's him."
5084,JERRY,22, George got him fired. He squealed on him.
5085,KRAMER,22, Ooh tattle tale
5086,GEORGE,22, <yells> I didn't tattle 
5087,READER,22, Shh Shh
5088,KRAMER,22, What did this guy do? What happened?
5089,GEORGE,22, There was an incident. I'd rather not discuss it.
5090,KRAMER,22," Oh come on, You can tell me."
5091,GEORGE,22, Some other time.
5092,KRAMER,22, What tonight?
5093,KRAMER,22, Y'know I never figured you for a squealer.
5094,JERRY,22," Oh, he sang like a canary."
5095,LIBRARIAN,22, Mr. Bookman's not here.
5096,JERRY,22, Not here? Why was I told to come down here?
5097,LIBRARIAN,22, He'll be out all afternoon on a case.
5098,KRAMER,22, He's out on a case? He actually goes out on cases?
5099,JERRY,22, Well what am I supposed to do now?
5100,LIBRARIAN,22, I'll have Mr. Bookman get in touch with you.
5101,JERRY,22, All right Thanks. Come on lets go
5102,GEORGE,22, Let's see if it's Hayman?
5103,KRAMER,22," Hey, uh, I'll see you boys later. <TURNS TO LIBRARIAN> 
              So uh, what's a guy got to do "
5104,ELAINE,22, Where's Karen?
5105,SECRETARY,22, She went to pick up lunch. 
5106,ELAINE,22, She didn't ask me what I wanted. 
5107,SECRETARY,22, She must have forgot.
5108,ELAINE,22," How could she forget I've been ordering lunch every day 
              here for 3 and a half years? "
5109,SECRETARY,22, I don't know anything.
5110,ELAINE,22," Ah, you don't know anything. You see, ""I don't know 
              anything"", means there's "
5111,ELAINE,22," Oh, hi Mr. Lippman."
5112,LIPPMAN,22," Elaine, "
5113,ELAINE,22," Um, uh, I was wondering if you got a chance to look at 
              that , um, biography of "
5114,LIPPMAN,22," Yes I did. Yes I did. ... Maureen this water is still 
              too cold."
5115,ELAINE,22, It's freezing. ... Hurts your teeth.
5116,ELAINE,22," I'm tellin' ya' somethin' is goin' on. He never likes anything 
              I recommend. "
5117,JERRY,22, So they forgot to get your lunch. Big deal!
5118,ELAINE,22," What do you know. You've never worked in an office. <TURNS 
              TO GEORGE> See, "
5119,GEORGE,22," I don't understand lunch, I don't know anything about lunch. 
              Listen. Just because "
5120,ELAINE,22, What did he do?
5121,GEORGE,22," He purposely mispronounced my name. Instead of saying, 
              ""Costanza"" He'd say, "
5122,JERRY,22," I remember he made you wear a jock on your head for a whole 
              class. And the straps "
5123,GEORGE,22," OK, OK, I never even had him for gym."
5124,JERRY,22," I had him for Hygene. Remember his teeth. It was like from 
              an exhumed corpse. "
5125,GEORGE,22, Little baked beans
5126,JERRY,22, Echh
5127,ELAINE,22, Come on tell me what happened.
5128,GEORGE,22," Well, OK. As I said the guy had it in for me. He actually 
              failed me in gym. "
5129,GEORGE,22, ... Those spastic shnitzer twins ... 
5130,HEYMAN,22, Can't stand ja ... Can't stand ja
5131,GEORGE,22," Yes, Mr. Hayman"
5132,HEYMAN,22," Your underwear was stick'n out of your shorts during gym 
              class."
5133,GEORGE,22, Well I guess that's because I wear boxer shorts.
5134,HEYMAN,22," Boxer shorts, ha? Well what brand?"
5135,GEORGE,22," I'm not really sure, I..."
5136,HEYMAN,22, Well let's take a look.
5137,<GEORGE,22, gets a wedgie>
5138,GEORGE,22, He gave me a wedgie.
5139,JERRY,22, He got fired the next day.
5140,ELAINE,22, Why do they call it a wedgie?
5141,GEORGE,22," Because the underwear is pulled up from the back and ... 
              it wedges in.."
5142,JERRY,22," They also have an atomic wedgie. Now the goal there is to 
              actually get the "
5143,ELAINE,22, Boys are sick.
5144,JERRY,22, Well what do girls do ?
5145,ELAINE,22, We just tease some one 'til they develop an eating disorder.
5146,KRAMER,22," Hey Babaloo, you better get home. You know this guy Bookman 
              from the library "
5147,JERRY,22," Oh, I'm glad you're here, so we can get this all straightened 
              out. Would"
5148,BOOKMAN,22, You got any coffee?
5149,JERRY,22, Coffee?
5150,BOOKMAN,22, Yeah. Coffee.
5151,JERRY,22," No, I don't drink coffee."
5152,BOOKMAN,22," Yeah, you don't drink coffee? How about instant coffee?"
5153,JERRY,22," No, I don't have--"
5154,BOOKMAN,22, You don't have any instant coffee?
5155,JERRY,22," Well, I don't normally--"
5156,BOOKMAN,22, Who doesn't have instant coffee?
5157,JERRY,22, I don't.
5158,BOOKMAN,22," You buy a jar of Folger's Crystals, you put it in the 
              cupboard, you"
5159,JERRY,22, Really? I'll have to remember that.
5160,BOOKMAN,22, You took this book out in 1971.
5161,JERRY,22," Yes, and I returned it in 1971."
5162,BOOKMAN,22," Yeah, '71. That was my first year on the job. Bad year 
              for libraries."
5163,JERRY,22," Look, Mr. Bookman. I--I returned that book. I remember it 
              very"
5164,BOOKMAN,22," You're a comedian, you make people laugh."
5165,JERRY,22, I try.
5166,BOOKMAN,22," You think this is all a big joke, don't you?"
5167,JERRY,22," No, I don't."
5168,BOOKMAN,22," I saw you on T.V. once; I remembered your name--from my 
              list. I looked"
5169,JERRY,22, Certainly not.
5170,BOOKMAN,22," Well, let me tell you something, funny boy. Y'know that 
              little stamp,"
5171,"Sure, go ahead, laugh if you want to. I've seen your type before",22,
5172,kid's right to read a book without getting his mind warped! Or,22," 
              maybe"
5173,"your good-time buddies. Well I got a flash for ya, joy-boy",22," Party 
              time"
5174,KRAMER,22, What's wrong?
5175,MARION,22, It's Bookman the library cop.
5176,KRAMER,22, So I didn't do anything wrong.
5177,MARION,22," I'm supposed to be atwork. I could get fired. I shouldn't 
              have come here."
5178,KRAMER,22, Why don't ya' leave?
5179,MARION,22, I can't.
5180,JERRY,22," No way I'm payin' that! I returned that book I n 1971. I 
              have a witness "
5181,SH,22," Kevin went to a public school, he's the 14 year old? We were 
              gonna' send Marsha "
5182,JERRY,22," So Sherry, what do you remember about that day at the library? 
            "
5183,SH,22," I remember it like it was yesterday. It was a Friday afternoon. 
              I wore a purple dress. "
5184,JERRY,22, Purple? Ya' sure it wasn't orange? 
5185,SH,22," Positive. And I was chewin' Dentyne. I always chewed dentyne. 
              Remember Jerry? Dentyne? "
5186,JERRY,22, No Black Jack? 
5187,SH,22," Licorice gum? Never! We were reading pasages to each other 
              from that Henry Miller book, "
5188,JERRY,22, Tropic of Cancer.
5189,SH,22," No, Tropic of Capricorn"
5190,JERRY,22, Tropic of Capricorn? 
5191,SH,22," Rememba? What holds the world togetha' ... ""As I have 
              learned from bitter experience "
5192,JERRY,22," Wait a second. Wait a second. You're right. I had both of 
              them. "
5193,JERRY,22," Here's the book. Don't let anybody see it. Don't let anything 
              happen to it. "
5194,GEORGE,22," Jerry, it's me, George, don't worry, I'll return it"
5195,JERRY,22," Ok, I'll see you after school. I.m late for Hayman's hygiene. 
            "
5196,SH,22, Where ya' going? 
5197,JERRY,22," It was nice seeing you again. I just remembered something. 
              I've got to go. "
5198,KRAMER,22, Read another poem.
5199,MARION,22," Pressed chest fleshed out west Might be the saviour or 
              a garden pest."
5200,KRAMER,22," Wow, that is great. You should be published. "

5243,HEYMAN,22," Your underwear was stick'n out of your shorts during gym

5246,GEORGE,22," I'm not really sure, I..."

        don't like nice. "
5286,Jerry,24," This is amazing, I haven't seen one guy going in to that restaurant 
        since it opened. Poor guy. "
5287,George,24," Why is nice bad? What kind of sick society we are living in, 
        when nice is bad? "
5288,Jerry,24, What's that smell? What are you wearing? 
5289,George,24, Little cologne. 
5290,Jerry,24, Manly. 
5291,George,24, Monica wants me to wear it. 
5292,Jerry,24, So why didn't you say no? 
5293,George,24, I'm too nice. 
5294,Jerry,24," Poor guy. His family is probably in Pakistan waiting him to send 
        back money. This is horrible. "
5295,George,24, She wants me to take an IQ test. 
5296,Jerry,24, That's because you're stupid enough to wear the cologne. 
5297,George,24," No, she's taking this course in education for her masters. It's 
        part of her research project, I have to be a guinea pig. "
5298,Jerry,24," I've never been a guinea pig. I've been a sheep, a tody. "
5299,George,24," You know, I can't talk to you anymore. "
5300,Jerry,24," All right, I'm sorry. Go ahead, you're taking the IQ test. "
5301,George,24," Yeah, and she's going to find I'm a moron. You know, people think 
        I'm smart, but I'm not smart. "
5302,Jerry,24, Who thinks you're smart? 
5303,George,24, I'm not going to break a hundred in this thing. 
5304,Jerry,24, What thing? 
5305,George,24, You don't listen when people talk to you anymore! 
5306,Jerry,24," Oh, the IQ thing...yeah. "
5307,George,24," I'm sure I have a low IQ. I've been lying about my SAT scores 
        for 15 years. "
5308,Jerry,24, What did you get? 
5309,George,24, What did I get or what do I say I got? 
5310,Jerry,24, What do you say? 
5311,George,24, I say fourteen o nine (1409). 
5312,Jerry,24," 1409, that's a good score. "
5313,George,24, You're telling me. 
5314,Jerry,24, What did you really get? 
5315,George,24, You are my friend. 
5316,Jerry,24, Of course. 
5317,George,24," I tell you everything, right? "
5318,Jerry,24, I hope so. 
5319,George,24," Well, this I take to the grave. "
5320,Jerry,24," He's serving Mexican ,Italian, Chinese. He's all over the place. 
        That's why no one is going in. "
5321,Elaine,24, Why do you keep watching? 
5322,Jerry,24," I don't know, I'm obsessed with it. It's like a spider in the 
        toilet struggling for a survival. And even if you know it's not going 
        to make it, you kind of root it for awhile. "
5323,Elaine,24, And then you flush. 
5324,Jerry,24," Well, it's a spider. "
5325,Elaine,24," You know, sometimes people won't go in to a place, if they don't 
        see anyone else in there. "
5326,Elaine,24," You have to do that? Jerry, don't do that, that is so annoying.

5333,Elaine,24, Casus belli. 
5334,Jerry,24, What's that? 
5335,Elaine,24," It's Latin. I read it in some book. I don't know, I just wanted 
        to say it out loud. "
5336,Jerry,24," Go in, go in! "
5337,Elaine,24, Have you gone in there? 
5338,Jerry,24," No, I'm afraid if we start talking, I'm gonna wind up going partners 
        with him. "
5339,George,24, Hi. 
5340,Jerry,24," You know, I could probably shoot him from here. I'd be doing us 
        both a favor. "
5341,George,24," I'm wearing some cologne, all right? "
5342,Elaine,24," Sure, fine. "
5343,Jerry,24, Casus belli. 
5344,Elaine,24, Casus belli. 
5345,George,24, What's that? 
5346,Elaine,24, Since when do you wear cologne? 
5347,George,24," Why what I do is so important? Why must I be always the vocal 
        point of attention? Let me just be, let me live. "
5348,Jerry,24," Hey, how did you do on that IQ test? "
5349,George,24, I didn't take it yet. 
5350,Elaine,24, What IQ test? 
5351,George,24, What's casus belli. 
5352,Jerry,24," Oh, it's nothing... "
5353,George,24, Is it about me? 
5354,Jerry,24," Why must you always be the vocal point of attention? Why can't 
        you just be? Why can't you live? "
5355,Elaine,24," It's just a Latin phrase George, it does not mean anything. Now, 
        what is this test? "
5356,Jerry,24," This woman he's dating is making him to take this IQ test for 
        this course. "
5357,Elaine,24," Oh, that sounds like fun. "
5358,George,24," Yeah, fun. IQ tests are totally bogus. They prove nothing. "
5359,Elaine,24," You'll do well, you're smart. "
5360,Jerry,24," No see, he's not smart. People think he's smart, but he's not. 
      "
5361,Elaine,24, What did you get on your SAT's? 
5362,George,24, It varies. 
5363,Jerry,24," You know, I don't even know my IQ. "
5364,Elaine,24, Mine's 145. 
5365,George,24, 145! 
5366,Jerry,24, Get out of here! 
5367,Elaine,24, You get out of here! 
5368,Jerry,24, You get out of here! 
5369,George,24, You should take the test for me. 
5370,Jerry,24," Well, that would be something, cheating on a IQ test. Hey, remember 
        in college when you passed Lettick the test out the window? You became 
        a legend after that. "
5371,George,24," Yeah, yeah I really had some guts back then. Why wouldn't we 
        do that again? "
5372,Elaine,24, What? 
5373,George,24," You could take the IQ test for me. I could pass it to you out 
        the window. We could do it, she lives in the first floor. "
5374,Elaine,24, Are you serious? 
5375,George,24, Why not? 
5376,Elaine,24, Where would I take the test? 
5377,George,24," I don't know, she lives right around the corner. Take it here 
        or go to the coffee shop. "
5378,Elaine,24," No, that would be too noisy. "
5379,Jerry,24," Take it to Dream Cafe, you won't hear a peep. "
5380,Elaine,24," Hey, what do you think? "
5381,Jerry,24," Hey, I love a good caper. "
5382,Elaine,24," Yeah, that's what is is, a caper. "
5383,George,24, You'll do it? 
5384,Elaine,24, What the hey. 
5385,George,24," Yeaah, beautiful...[They try to hit a high five, but George hits 
        Elaine in the forehead.] Sorry... "

5389,Jerry,24," Eh, people, people are talking. "
5390,Babu,24, Smoking or non smoking? We are proud to offer both. 
5391,Jerry,24, Non smoking would be great. 
5392,Babu,24," Very good. My name is Babu Bhatt, I will be your waiter. A steaming 
        hot face cloth for your pleasure. "
5393,Jerry,24, Thank you. [Throws the towel around like a hot potato.] 
5394,Babu,24," Our specials are tacos, moussaka and franks and beans. "
5395,Jerry,24," Well, what do you recommend my good fellow? "
5396,Babu,24," Oh, the turkey. "
5397,Jerry,24," Oh, the turkey it'll be. And may I say you have a splendid establishment 
        here , my friend. I'm sure you flourish in this location for many many 
        years. "
5398,Babu,24," You're a very kind man. Very kind, thank you. Very kind... "
5399,Jerry thinks,24," Very kind. I am a kind man. Who else would do something 
        like this? Nobody. Nobody thinks about people like I do. All right, snap 
        out of it you stupid jerk. You're eating a turkey sandwich. What do want, 
        a nobel price? "
5400,George,24, You go in the living room. I'll take the test in here. 
5401,Monica,24, But why? 
5402,George,24, I can't concentrate in front of you. 
5403,Monica,24," Oh, I think you're making too much of this. IQ tests don't mean 
        anything. "
5404,George,24," Are you kidding me? This is the best tool we have today of measuring 
        a persons intelligence. "
5405,Monica,24," Well, I certainly don't place any importance on it. "
5406,George,24," Well, I think you're wrong about that. And now if you would excuse 
        me, I would like to get started please. "
5407,Monica,24, Good luck. 
5408,George,24, Don't need it. 
5409,Elaine,24," What's been going on in there? I've been standing here for 20 
        minutes. "
5410,George,24," I'm sorry I'm sorry, here's the test. Thanks again for doing 
        this. "
5411,Elaine,24," All right, what time do you want me back here. "
5412,George,24," Eh, twenty to three. "
5413,Elaine,24, Ok. 
5414,George,24, Thanks again. 
5415,Elaine,24, All right. 
5416,George,24," And don't settle for 145, you can do better, you're a genius. 
      "
5417,Jerry,24," Thank you Babu. You have quite a flair. You are quite the restaurateur 
        I must say. "
5418,Babu,24, It is in deed my pleasure. 
5419,Jerry,24," Oh, please... "
5420,Babu,24," Oh, welcome to the Dream Cafe. Our specials today... "
5421,Elaine,24," Oh, no no I'll just have a tea and toast. "

5424,Elaine,24," Um, ok, I'll have the rigatoni. "
5425,Babu,24," Oh, very good choice. Very good. "
5426,Jerry,24," Oh wow, so you got the test. You're cheating. "
5427,Elaine,24, I know. 
5428,Kramer,24, Hey. 
5429,Jerry,24, Hey. 
5430,Kramer,24," Oh boy. Jerry let me ask you something, hi Elaine... "
5431,Elaine,24, Hey. 
5432,Kramer,24," This guy leaves this jacket at my mothers house two years ago. 
        Now, she hasn't spoken to him since and now he says he wants the jacket 
        back. "
5433,Jerry,24, So? 
5434,Kramer,24," Well, I'm not giving it back. "
5435,Jerry,24, Why not? 
5436,Kramer,24," Because I meat a lot of women in this jacket, you know they're 
        attracted to it. Why do you think my mother went out with him? "
5437,Kramer,24," Oh, gees... "
5438,Elaine,24," Yeah, ok...[takes the test and goes to another table.] "
5439,Kramer,24," Anyway, it's been two years. I mean isn't there like statue of 
        limitations on that? "
5440,Jerry,24, Statute. 
5441,Kramer,24, What? 
5442,Jerry,24, Statute of limitations. It's not a statue. 
5443,Kramer,24," No, statue. "
5444,Jerry,24," Fine, it's a sculpture of limitations. "
5445,Kramer,24," Just wait a minute...Elaine, Elaine! Now you're smart, is it 
        statue or statute of limitations? "
5446,Elaine,24, Statute. 
5447,Kramer,24," Oh, I really think you're wrong. "
5448,Elaine,24," Look, Kramer, I have to take this test ok, I don't have a long 
        of time. "
5449,Kramer,24, What test? 
5450,Elaine,24, An IQ test. 
5451,Kramer,24, Why do you take an IQ test? 
5452,Elaine,24, It's for George. 
5453,Kramer,24, George? 
5454,Elaine,24," Yeah, can I...can I explain it to you later? "
5455,Kramer,24, Why are you taking an IQ test for George? 
5456,Elaine,24, Would you please?! 
5457,Kramer,24," What, is it for a job or something? "
5458,Elaine,24, Later! 
5459,Kramer,24, You're positive it's statute? 
5460,Elaine,24," Yes, yes! "
5461,Babu,24," Welcome, welcome. A steaming hot face cloth...[gives Kramer a hot 
        towel and Kramer screams and falls from his chair.] "
5462,Monica,24, George? 
5463,George,24, Yeah? 
5464,Monica,24, The door is locked. 
5465,George,24," Oh, it's locked? "
5466,Monica,24, I need to get something. 
5467,George,24," Monica, I'm really focused here, this stuff's a killer. "
5468,Monica,24, George! 
5469,George,24, Wish I could. 
5470,Babu,24," Ladadeeda, laadadeeda.... "
5471,Elaine,24, Babu! If you don't mind? 
5472,Elaine,24, Oh my God! It's all over the test! 
5473,Babu,24," Oh, I'm terribly sorry. "
5474,Elaine,24, Oh man! Look at this...and I'm late anyway. 
5475,Babu,24," Please, forgive me, please... "
5476,Jerry,24," Go ahead, I'll take care of it. "
5477,Babu,24, I'm very sorry. Tell your friends! 
5478,Jerry,24," It's all right, she was cheating anyway. "
5479,Babu,24, You're a very kind man. 
5480,Jerry,24," Babu, you're Pakistani? "
5481,Babu,24," Yes, Pakistani, yes. "
5482,Jerry,24," Babu, may I say something? "
5483,Babu,24," Of course, you're a very smart man, I'll listen. "
5484,Jerry,24," I'm not a restaurateur by any means, but it occurred to me that 
        perhaps you might serve some dishes from your native Pakistan? As opposed 
        to franks and beans for example. "
5485,Babu,24, But there are no Pakistani people here. 
5486,Jerry,24," Doesn't matter. You would have the only authentic Pakistani restaurant 
        in the whole neighborhood. "
5487,Babu,24," Yes, you see everything, don't you? "
5488,Jerry,24," Well, not everything. I do what I can. "
5489,Babu,24," I'll close down today and when I open again it'll be whole Pakistani 
        restaurant. Thank you, thank you very much, you're very special person, 
        very special. "
5490,Jerry thinking,24," I am such a great guy. Who else would've gone through 
        the trouble of helping this poor immigrant? I am special. My mother was 
        right. Of course I've never had Pakistani food. How bad it could be? "
5491,Elaine,24, It was an accident. 
5492,George,24, What did you go on a picnic? 
5493,Elaine,24, Babu Bhatt did it. 
5494,George,24, Babu Bhatt? How I'm going to explain this? 
5495,Monica,24, Time's up George. 
5496,George,24, Ok. [George opens the door.] Here you go. 
5497,Monica,24, How did you do? 
5498,George,24, Piece of cake. 
5499,Monica,24, What happened to the test? 
5500,George,24, What? I spilled some food on it. 
5501,Monica,24, Food? What food? 
5502,George,24, What are you talking about? 
5503,Monica,24, Where did you get food? 
5504,George,24, From my pocket. 
5505,Monica,24, What? 
5506,George,24," I eh, I had a sandwich in my pocket. "
5507,Monica,24, And coffee? 
5508,George,24," Yeah, had some coffee, yeah. "
5509,Monica,24, Where did you get the coffee? 
5510,George,24," Where did I get the coffee? Where do think I got the coffee, 
        from the grocery store. "
5511,Monica,24, How did you get there? 
5512,George,24, I walked. 
5513,Monica,24," How did you get out of the apartment? I didn't see you leave. 
      "
5514,George,24, I climbed out the window. 
5515,Monica,24, You climbed out the window? 
5516,George,24, Of course. 
5517,Monica,24, Why didn't you go out the door? 
5518,George,24," The door? Why would I go out the door? The window is right here. 
      "
5519,Monica,24," You are a fascinating man, George Costanza. "
5520," 
        [Jerry's apartment, Jerry and Elaine. Jerry is looking Dream cafe with 
        binoculars. There's a sign on the window",24, Closed for renovation.] 
5521,Jerry,24," Most people in a situation like this, they walk right by it. Not 
        me. "
5522,Elaine,24, You're very special. 
5523,Kramer,24," Hey, do me a favor. If some guy comes in looking for me, tell 
        him you don't know where I am. "
5524,Jerry,24," Of course, I always do. "
5525,Kramer,24," No, no it's that guy. He's really been bugging me about the jacket. 
      "
5526,Elaine,24, Just give it back to him. 
5527,Kramer,24," Oh, he'll have to kill me. [leaves.] "
5528,Jerry,24, Hey Georgie! 
5529,George,24, Coming up. 
5530,Jerry,24, How did you do on the IQ test?! 
5531,George,24, 85!

5535,Jerry,24," Well, well, well... "
5536,Elaine,24, He's coming up? 
5537,Jerry,24," Well, I'm no genius, but according to my calculations he should 
        be here in a few seconds. "
5538,Elaine,24," Yeah, but an 85, that's ridiculous. "
5539,Jerry,24," Well, maybe the test was gender bias, you know a lot of questions 
        about hunting and testicles... "
5540,George,24," Oh, hello professor. "
5541,Elaine,24," George, I cannot believe... "
5542,George,24, Please... 
5543,Elaine,24, No there has got be a mistake. 
5544,George,24," You should've seen her face. It was the exact same look my father 
        gave me when I told him I wanted to be a ventriloquist. "
5545,Jerry,24, But an 85? 
5546,Elaine,24," There were too many distractions there. Babu...what ever he's 
        name was and Kramer...I couldn't concentrate. "
5547,Jerry mocking,24, It was a madhouse. 
5548,Elaine,24, Jerry! It was! Let me take it again. 
5549,George,24," Whow, forget it. "
5550,Elaine,24," Oh, come on, come on. I guarantee 140. What do you have to lose? 
      "
5551,George,24, You could do worst! 
5552,Elaine,24," No, no, I guarantee it. "
5553,George,24," All right, I'll ask her. "
5554,Elaine,24," Ok, now where I'm going to take it. "
5555,Jerry,24," Take it here, I'll leave, there'll be no distractions. "
5556,Jerry,24," Well, congratulations my friend. You know, I sorry I missed the 
        grand re-opening. I was out of town for about a week. "
5557,Babu,24," You see how I listened. I worked very hard, borrowed more money. 
      "
5558,Jerry,24, I think it's fantastic. Has a certain indefinable charm. 
5559,Babu,24, You wish to eat? 
5560,Jerry,24," Let me tell you something Babu. You go back there in that kitchen 
        and tell your chef I want the works. "
5561,Babu,24, Very good. 
5562,Jerry thinking,24," Very good? No, not very good, very great. I am very, 
        very great. "
5563,Elaine,24, What are you doing? 
5564,Kramer,24," Quiet. Shh, don't say anything. "
5565,Elaine,24, What's going on? 
5566,Man behind the door,24," Hey, Kramer! I saw you going there! I'm not leaving 
        until I get the jacket. [Bangs on the door] Open up Kramer! "
5567,Elaine,24, Why did you come in here for? 
5568,Kramer,24," I thought I'd throw him off. See, he knows where I live. "
5569,Elaine,24," Well Kramer, I have to return this test. I've got to get out 
        of here. "
5570,Kramer,24, I thought you took the test. 
5571,Elaine,24, I had to take it again. 
5572,Kramer,24, How come? 
5573,Elaine,24, What's the difference?!! 
5574,Kramer,24," Well, you can't leave now. "
5575,Elaine,24, What? 
5576,Man behind the door,24," Come on, Kramer! I want that jacket back! "
5577,Kramer,24, Never! 
5578,Monica,24," George, open up. "
5579,Monica,24, Well? 
5580,George,24, How' you doing? 
5581,Monica,24, Where's the test? 
5582,George,24," You know, it's the damnedest thing. I went out the window again 
        to get a cup of coffee... "
5583,Jerry,24," Babu? Babu...[waves Babu to come to table] Babu...you know, I 
        got to tell you, I never do this, but the shrimp, it's just that it's 
        a little stringy. You have any chicken? "
5584,Babu,24, The shrimp is stringy? 
5585,Jerry,24," Well, maybe your refrigerator... "
5586,Babu,24," Quiet!! You shut up! You make me change restaurant, but nobody 
        comes! You say make Pakistani, Babu Bhatt have only Pakistani restaurant. 
        But where are people? You see people? Show me people. There are no people!

5587,Jerry,24," You know, I think I'll just take the check. "
5588,Babu,24, You bad man! You very very bad man! [leaves] 
5589,Jerry thinking,24, Bad man? Could've my mother been wrong?

        class"
6015,Audrey,26, Uh huh.
6016,George,26," It's really nothing, it's like going to the dentist."
6017,Audrey,26, I hate the dentist.
6018,George,26, It's a cleaning.
6019,Audrey,26, So you really think I should do this?

6032,Elaine,26, I think it's a mistake.
6033,George,26," Me too, really. Unless you'd really like to get one."
6034,George,26," I'm going straight to hell, no two ways about it."
6035,Jerry,26," Well, it might not be hell but you're gonna run into some bad

6041,Jerry,26," Please, please, Isabel? She is the most despicable woman I have 
        ever"
6042,George,26, You're not letting him win. He wins till you're forty.
6043,Jerry,26, Then what?
6044,George,26, He still wins but it's not a blowout.
6045,Jerry,26, She wants to be an actress. She makes me read these moronic acting
6046,Jerry (holding up a piece of paper),26," I don't want to see this woman anymore 
        but"
6047,Kramer (taking the paper and tearing it to pieces),26, I'm proud of you.
6048,Jerry,26," So I'm never gonna see her again, I'm going cold turkey."
6049,George,26, Good for you.
6050,Jerry,26," I'll tell you, the sex... I mean, I was like an animal. I mean 
        it was"
6051,George,26," It's like going to the bathroom in front of a lot of people and 
        not"
6052,Jerry,26, It's not like that at all.
6053,Elaine,26, How do you even know the jacket is there?
6054,Kramer,26," Well I don't, I'm guessing."
6055,George,26," Okay, look, Audrey, before you take the bandage off just remember 
        that"
6056,Audrey,26, George?
6057,George,26, Yeah?
6058,Audrey,26, Enough.
6059,Jerry,26," Alright, are we ready? Come on, let's get this show on the road."
6060,Elaine,26, Are you sure you want us here for this?
6061,Audrey,26, Yes.
6062,Jerry,26, Shouldn't a doctor do it?
6063,Audrey,26," No, he said I could do it. Okay, here goes."
6064,George,26," Very exciting, very exciting, it's like watching a birth."
6065,Elaine,26, It looks good.
6066,Jerry,26, Great job.
6067,Kramer,26, You got butchered.
6068,Jerry,26, Let's put him over here.
6069,Kramer (to a fleeing Audrey),26, Where are you going?
6070,Audrey (with hand covering nose),26, To the doctor!
6071,Kramer,26," Wait, wait, wait, I'll go with you."
6072,Elaine,26, How ya feeling?
6073,George,26, Too much salt in my diet.
6074,Elaine,26, Can I get you anything?
6075,George,26," Nah, I'm good."
6076,Elaine,26, You sure? Anything?
6077,George,26," Mmm, no. Boy, it really didn't come out too well, did it?"
6078,Elaine,26," No, it didn't. No, it didn't."
6079,George,26," It's like, all dented."
6080,Elaine,26, Seems to be.
6081,George,26," Well, I'm sure they'll be able to fix it. You can't stop modern"
6082,Elaine,26," Shut up, George."
6083,George,26, Shut up?
6084,Elaine,26, Yeah.
6085,George,26, Interesting.
6086,Jerry,26," Come on, Kramer, seriously, give me her number!"
6087,Kramer,26," I don't have it, I threw it out."
6088,Jerry,26," You're lying! You got it, I want that number!"
6089,Kramer,26," I told you, I threw it out."
6090,Jerry,26, Give it to me!
6091,Kramer,26," You told me not to give it to you, you made me promise."
6092,Jerry,26," Well, I changed my mind, I want that number."
6093,Kramer,26," You said, no matter what you do or say, I'm not to give you the 
        number."
6094,Jerry,26," I was lying, give it to me!"
6095,Kramer,26," No, you told me not to!"
6096,Jerry,26, I want that number!
6097,Kramer,26," Alright! (flinging pieces of torn paper to the ground) Yeah! 
        Yeah! "
6098,Audrey,26," The doctor said that they need to build the lateral wall of the 
        septum. "
6099,George,26, Yeah.
6100,Audrey,26, You see this perinasal sinus cavity?
6101,George,26," Oh, I got it."
6102,Audrey,26," You see how it's collapsing? That's what's causing this huge 
        dent."
6103,George,26," Yeah, phew."
6104,Audrey,26," So anyway, George, do you know what I was thinking about?"
6105,George,26, What?
6106,Audrey,26, Remember we talked about taking a trip together?
6107,George,26, We did?
6108,Audrey,26," Yeah, we talked about going to Hawaii?"
6109,George,26, Hawaii?
6110,Audrey,26," Anyway, I think it would be great to get away after all this."
6111,Audrey,26, I never heard that.
6112,George,26, Oh yeah. My friend lived there.
6113,Audrey,26, We could go to the Caribbean.
6114,George,26," You know, I have to tell you something. You couldn't get me on 
        a plane"
6115,Audrey,26," George, I don't think this is working."
6116,Isabel,26," Ever since you came back from the Army, you've changed. I swear"
6117,Jerry,26, I'm Nelson!
6118,Isabel,26," That's not the line, Jerry."
6119,Jerry,26," Alright, alright, I'm sorry. (reading) Nothing's changed, Alma, 
        I just"
6120,Isabel,26," I swear, Nelson, sometimes at night, when you're not around, 
        I just go"
6121,Jerry,26," Well, you just need to relax. Maybe a hobby, bowling is fun."
6122,Isabel,26," Yeah, bowling's good if you're really gross and ugly."
6123,Jerry (to himself),26, Uh oh. My organs are playing chess again.
6124,Jerry's Brain,26," Well I'm getting a little tired of this. What do you say 
        we"
6125,Jerry's Penis,26," Oh Brain, what are you doing? You cannot beat me. Do you 
        have"
6126,Jerry's Brain,26, I can't take her anymore. I hate reading her stupid little
6127,Jerry's Penis,26," Oh, so what? So you read from a little play. You can't 
        put up"
6128,Jerry's Brain,26," What about tomorrow morning? Do you have any idea what 
        that's"
6129,Jerry's Penis,26," Oh, go read a book."
6130,Jerry's Brain,26," Enough chatting, let's play."
6131,Elaine,26," You know the only reason I'm doing this is because you took Audrey 
        to"
6132,Kramer (filling a pipe),26," Yeah, yeah, ok, now uh, you're clear, you got"
6133,Elaine,26, Yeah.
6134,Kramer,26," Wait wait wait wait wait. (putting a ring on Elaine's finger) 
        Here."
6135,Elaine,26, What do I need this for?
6136,Kramer,26, Because we're engaged.
6137,Elaine,26, We're engaged?
6138,Kramer,26, Um hm.
6139,Elaine,26," Kramer, this is too big."
6140,Kramer (lighting his pipe),26, It's my mom's.
6141,Landlord,26, Hello?
6142,Elaine,26," Oh, uh, hi. I'm Wanda Pepper, I'm Albert Pepper's daughter. My 
        father"
6143,Landlord,26," Oh, hello Miss Pepper, it's a pleasure to meet you. (To Kramer) 
        And"
6144,Kramer,26," Yes, yes I am."
6145,Landlord,26," I've read your book, Professor, and I was quite intrigued by 
        it."
6146,Kramer,26," Uh, yes. Well, it's, uh, very intriguing."
6147,Landlord,26," Tell me, is it your contention that Shakespeare was an imposter?"
6148,Kramer,26, My contention?
6149,Landlord,26," Yes, your contention."
6150,Kramer,26," Yes, that's my contention."
6151,Elaine,26, I heard him contend that.
6152,Landlord,26, It's too bad about your father.
6153,Elaine,26," Oh, it was a frame-up."
6154,Landlord,26," A fine man, he spoke often of you. He's very proud of the work"
6155,Elaine,26," Oh, well, we're all proud of the work I'm doing."
6156,Kramer,26, She does fine work.
6157,Landlord,26," Your father gave me strict orders not to turn the jacket over 
        to"
6158,Elaine,26, How kind of you.
6159,Landlord,26," You know, your father has a very extensive wardrobe."
6160,Jerry's Brain,26," What's the matter, fella? You look a little tired. Ha 
        ha ha ha"
6161,Isabel,26," Nelson, don't you see? You are a part of me, and I, I am a part 
        of"
6162,Jerry's Penis,26, It's killing me. (Makes a move)
6163,Jerry's Brain,26, That's your move?
6164,Jerry's Penis,26, Yeah.
6165,Jerry's Brain,26," Well that's trouble, my friend. That's big trouble. Checkmate!"
6166,Jerry's Penis (beginning to cough and struggle),26, Getting weak... Losing
6167,Jerry's Brain (before disappearing himself),26, Punk.
6168,Jerry,26," Isabel, uh, I don't think this is working."
6169,Elaine,26, Daddy certainly does have an extensive wardrobe.
6170,Landlord,26," He is a fine dresser and I'm sure I don't have to tell you 
        he's quite"
6171,Elaine,26," My father, really? I had no idea."
6172,Landlord,26," Yes, they're crazy about him. There was one in particular, 
        came"
6173,Kramer,26, You don't say?
6174,Elaine,26, I found it!
6175,Landlord,26," The woman used to walk around here half naked, sucking Colt 
        45 from a"
6176,Kramer,26, So I grabbed the guy by the collar.
6177,Elaine,26," Yeah, and I yelled out, Kramer! Kramer, you're killing him!"""
6178,Jerry,26, So I assume the jig was up.
6179,Elaine,26," Yeah, pretty much."
6180,Audrey,26, Hi.
6181,Elaine,26, Hi!
6182,Jerry,26, Hey.
6183,Audrey (to George),26, Hello.
6184,George (smitten),26," Audrey? My god, you look incredible! I can't believe 
        it!"
6185,Audrey (motioning to Kramer),26," Well, it was his doctor. He was wonderful."
6186,Elaine,26," So, will I see you later tonight?"
6187,Audrey,26, Not sure.
6188,Kramer (rising and putting his arm around Audrey's shoulder),26," Well, I'll 
        check"
6189,Audrey (holding up her hand to show the stamp),26, I didn't wash.
6190,Kramer,26, Neither did I. We're off to the Reggae Lounge.
6191,Elaine (after they leave),26, Isn't she beautiful? Her nose is in such perfect
6192,George (interrupting),26, Elaine. Shut up.

6195,Guest Stars,29, 
6196,Jerry,29," I'm sorry it's gotta be a little bit of a scary place to 
              work. I don't know how you feel about it. You want to be standing 
              there having people comming in all day going ""I need knives. 
              I need more knives. Do you have any bigger knives? I'd like a bigger 
              knife, a big, long, sharp knife, that's what I'm in the market for. 
              I like them really sharp. Do you have one with hooks and gouges 
              like blades and kind of serrated? That's the kind of knife I'm looking 
              for. I need one I can throw. I need another one I can just hack 
              away with. Do you have anything like that? "
6197,Jerry,29," Oh yeah, like you know what you're talking about."
6198,George,29, Like you do.
6199,Jerry,29," Well what do you think? They put the statue on a giant raft 
              and a tugboat pulled it all the way from France?"
6200,George,29," What do you think? The brought it over in pieces and screwed 
              it together like a coffee table?"
6201,Jerry,29," I don't know. It's too early for a Christmas party isn't 
              it?"
6202,George,29, Why did France give that to us anyway?
6203,Jerry,29, It was a gift.
6204,George,29, So countries just exchange gifts like that?
6205,Jerry,29, If they like each other. 
6206,George,29, There's Elaine. 
6207,Jerry,29, See that guy he's talking with? That's her new boyfriend.
6208,George,29, Really? They work here in the office?
6209,Jerry,29," Yeah. They're having a little fling so don't say anything. 
            "
6210,George,29," Who am I going to tell? My mother? Like I've got nothing 
              better to talk about."
6211,Jerry,29, You don't. He's a recovering alcoholic.
6212,George,29, Really?
6213,Jerry,29, Yeah. He's been off the wagon for two years.
6214,George,29," ""Off the wagon""?"
6215,Jerry,29, I think it's off the wagon.
6216,George,29," I think it's ""on the wagon""."
6217,Elaine,29," Jerry, George, what are you doing here?"
6218,Jerry,29, What am I doing here? Ba-boom (holding out a present)
6219,Elaine,29, *gasp* My god! My watch! You found my watch! (pushing Jerry)
6220,Jerry,29," Hey keep your hands to yourself if you know what's good 
              for you."
6221,Elaine,29, Where did you find it?
6222,Jerry,29, Under the sofa cushion.
6223,Elaine,29, And you stopped by just to give it to me?
6224,Jerry,29, It's your Christmas present.
6225,Elaine,29, I though I'd never find it.
6226,George,29, Well today's your lucky day.
6227,Elaine,29, No. Today's *your* lucky day.
6228,George,29, It will be my first one.
6229,Elaine,29, You want to work here?
6230,George,29, Huh?
6231,Elaine,29," Yeah one of the readers left and there's a job opening. 
              Dick, this is Jerry and this is George."
6232,Dick,29, Hi nice to meet you. Is this the guy?
6233,Jerry,29," ""The guy?"""
6234,Elaine,29, (softly to Dick) Dick.
6235,George,29, How can you just get it?
6236,Elaine,29," My boss told me to find someone. I'm in charge of it. All 
              you have to do is meet him. Come on. Come on, come on, here hold 
              my drink. "
6237,Jerry,29, Cranberry juice?
6238,Elaine,29, And vodka.
6239,Dick,29, I got the cranberry juice.
6240,Dick,29, So... you're Jerry.
6241,Jerry,29, So... I'm Jerry. (he puts down the drink)
6242,Boss (What is his name?),29," So have you ever done this kind of work 
              before?"
6243,George,29," Well, you know, book reports. That kind of stuff."
6244,Boss,29, How do you read?
6245,George,29, I like Mike Lubika.
6246,Boss,29, Mike Lubika?
6247,George,29," He's a sports writer for the daily news. I find him very 
              insightful..."
6248,Boss,29," No, no, no. I mean authors."
6249,George,29," Lot of good ones. I don't even want to mention anyone because 
              I'm afraid I'm going to leave somebody out. "
6250,Boss,29, Name a couple.
6251,George,29," Who do I like? I, like, uh, Art, Vandelay."
6252,Boss,29, Art Vandelay?
6253,George,29," He's an obscure writer. Betnik, on the village. "
6254,Boss,29, What has he written?
6255,George,29, Venetian Blinds.
6256,Dick,29," (picking up the drink) I've got new for you. I'm funnier 
              than you are."
6257,Jerry,29," Why don't get we together New Years day and watch some football. 
            "
6258,Elaine,29, Where's my drink?
6259,Jerry,29," There. (turns to George) So, how did it go?"
6260,George,29, I think he was impressed. 
6261,Elaine,29," No, no, no, this is just cranberry juice. "
6262,Jerry,29," Oh, uh, I think maybe Dick picked up yours."
6263,Elaine,29," Dick? He can't drink. He's an alcoholic. I told you to 
              hold it."
6264,Jerry,29," I didn't know you meant *hold* it, I thought you meant hold 
              it."
6265,Elaine,29, One drink like that and he could fall right off the wagon.
6266,George,29, Told you.
6267,Jerry,29," I never feel comfortable in the women's department. I feel 
              like I'm just a *little* too close to trying on a dress."
6268,George,29, Do I really have to buy her something?
6269,Jerry,29," Hey the woman got you a job. The least you could do is buy 
              her a gift. How about this?"
6270,George,29, What is that? Is that cashmere?
6271,Jerry,29, Yeah. She would love cashmere.
6272,George,29," Who doesn't like cashmere? Find me one person in the world 
              that doesn't like cashmere. It's too expensive."
6273,Jerry,29, Look at this. It's 85 dollars marked down from 600.
6274,George,29," Wow. Excuse me, Miss?"
6275,Woman,29, Yes?
6276,George,29, How come this sweater is only 85 dollars?
6277,Woman,29," (showing the dot) Oh, here. This is why."
6278,George,29, What? I don't see anything.
6279,Woman,29, See this red dot?
6280,George,29, Oh yeah.
6281,Jerry,29, Oh it's damaged. (grabbing the sweater)
6282,George,29," (grabbing the sweater back) Well it's not really damaged. 
              85 dollars huh?"
6283,Woman,29, There's no exchanges on this.
6284,George,29, You think she would care about the red dot?
6285,Jerry,29, It's hard to say. 
6286,George,29, I don't even think she'd notice it. Can you see it?
6287,Jerry,29, Well I can see it.
6288,George,29," Yeah, but you know where it is."
6289,Jerry,29, Well what do you want me to do? Not look at it?
6290,George,29, Pretend you didn't know it was there. Can you see it?
6291,Jerry,29, It's hard to pretend because I know where it is.
6292,George,29," Well just take an overview. Can't you just take an overview? 
            "
6293,Jerry,29, You want me to take an overview?
6294,George,29, Please.
6295,Jerry,29," I see a very cheap man holding a sweater trying to get away 
              with something. That's my overview."
6296,Jerry,29, Yeah so?
6297,Elaine,29," He's acting very strangely. I think he started drinking 
              again."
6298,Jerry,29," Oh boy, can you smell it?"
6299,Elaine,29, No. I can't smell it.
6300,Jerry,29, Well if you can't smell it then he hasn't been drinking.
6301,Elaine,29, You don't always smell someone from a drink.
6302,Jerry,29, Yes you do.
6303,Elaine,29, What about one drink? Would you smell it from one drink?
6304,Jerry,29, Yes you would.
6305,Jerry,29, I'll prove it. Would you do me a favor? 
6306,Kramer,29, Okay.
6307,Jerry,29, Would you take a drink and let us smell you?
6308,Kramer,29, You can smell me without the drink.
6309,Elaine,29," I suspect that this guy I'm seeing might be drinking but 
              I can't smell it. "
6310,Kramer,29," Okay, well what am I drinking? What do you got?"
6311,Jerry,29," I got a bottle of scotch my uncle gave me. It's Hennigans. 
              It's been here for two years. I've been using it as a paint thinner."
6312,Kramer,29, All right.
6313,Jerry,29, I don't smell anything.
6314,Elaine,29, Maybe we're too close to the bottle.
6315,Jerry,29, Yeah.
6316,George,29, (over the speaker) It's George.
6317,Jerry,29, Come on up.
6318,Kramer,29," That is *damn* good scotch. I could do a commercial for 
              this stuff. Mmmmm, boy that Hennigans goes down smooth. And afterwords 
              you don't even smell. That's right folks. I just had three shots 
              of Hennigans and I don't smell. Imagine, you can walk around drunk 
              all day. That's Hennigans, the no-smell, no-tell scotch."
6319,George,29, Hello everybody.
6320,Kramer,29," Hey. (snuggling really close to George) I'm going to tell 
              you what I think. I know you don't care what I think, but I'm going 
              to tell you. I think that you are terrific. "
6321,George,29, (uncomfortablly) Thank you.
6322,Elaine,29, Hey what's that?
6323,George,29, It's an early Christmas present.
6324,Elaine,29, Christmas present? For who?
6325,George,29, For you.
6326,Elaine,29, *gasp* (pushing George) Get out of here. 
6327,Kramer,29," Say you got a big job interview, and you're a little nervous. 
              Well throw back a couple shots of Hennigans and you'll be as loose 
              as a goose and ready to roll in no time. And because it's odorless, 
              why, it will be our little secret. (singing) h-e-double n..."
6328,Jerry,29, Kramer. Yeah that'll do.
6329,Elaine,29," (opening the present) Oh George, this is beautiful. Is 
              this cashmere?"
6330,George,29, Of course it's cashmere.
6331,Elaine,29," Oh, I love cashmere. "
6332,George,29, Well who doesn't.
6333,Elaine,29," My, George this must have cost a fortune."
6334,George,29," Ahh, money."
6335,Elaine,29," Jerry, how could you let him spend so much money?"
6336,Jerry,29," I tried to stop him. I couldn't. He just wants to make people 
              happy."
6337,Elaine,29," George, this is one of the nicest things anyone has ever 
              given me."
6338,George,29," Well good, good. Take it off you're going to wear it out 
              already. It's for special occasions this thing."
6339,Kramer,29, What's that red dot on your sweater?
6340,Elaine,29, What?
6341,George,29, Just take it off. I'm getting hot just looking at it.
6342,Elaine,29, Uhh. This. It's like a red dot.
6343,George,29," What red dot? What are you talking about? Jerry come here 
              for a second. Do you see anything here?"
6344,Jerry,29," (uncomfortable) Uh, I don't know. Uh, I don't know."
6345,Elaine,29, What don't you know?
6346,Jerry,29, I don't know.
6347,Elaine,29, Well do you see it or don't you?
6348,Jerry,29, Ahem. Say that again?
6349,Elaine,29, Do you see it or don't you?
6350,Jerry,29, Do I see it... or don't I? That's the question.
6351,Jerry,29, Now what did you ask me again.
6352,Elaine,29, You're still here. You're a dynamo.
6353,George,29, I can't believe I get paid for this.
6354,Elaine,29, I'll see you tomorrow.
6355,George,29, How you doing?
6356,Cleaning lady,29, Hello.
6357,Jerry,29," You had sex with the cleaning woman on your desk? Who are 
              you, how did you do that?"
6358,George,29," Hennigans. I was there sitting in the office and the cleaning 
              woman comes in. I've always been attracted to cleaning women. Cleaning 
              women, chambermaids."
6359,Jerry,29," Yeah chambermaids, I'm attracted to them too."
6360,George,29, Why is that?
6361,Jerry,29, It's a woman in your room. So go ahead.
6362,George,29," So she starts vaccuming, back and forth, back and forth, 
              her hips swivelling, her breasts, uh... (trying to think of a word)"
6363,Jerry,29, Convulsing?
6364,George,29, Convulsing?
6365,Jerry,29," I don't know, I'm trying to help you."
6366,George,29, Then I asked her if she wanted a drink.
6367,Jerry,29, You don't drink.
6368,George,29," I know but I couldn't think of anything else to say to 
              her."
6369,Jerry,29, So you started drinking.
6370,George,29," So we started drinking, and I'll tell you I don't know 
              if it was the alcohol or the ammonia, but the next think I knew 
              she was mopping the floor with me."
6371,Jerry,29, So how was it?
6372,George,29," Well the sex was okay, but I threw up from the Hennigans."
6373,Jerry,29, Good thing the cleaning lady was there.
6374,Elaine,29, Dick was fired.
6375,Jerry,29," You mean to tell me if I had put that drink six inches over 
              to the right, and none of this would have happened."
6376,Elaine,29," You knew he was an alcoholic. Why'd you put the drink down 
              at all?"
6377,Jerry,29, What are you saying?
6378,Elaine,29, I'm not saying anything.
6379,Jerry,29, You're saying something.
6380,Elaine,29, What could I be saying?
6381,Jerry,29, Well you're not saying nothing you must be saying something.
6382,Elaine,29, If I was saying something I would have said it.
6383,Jerry,29, Well why don't you say it?
6384,Elaine,29, I said it.
6385,Jerry,29, What did you say?
6386,Elaine,29, Nothing. It's exhausting being with you.
6387,Jerry,29, Yeah?
6388,George,29, (over the speaker) It's George.
6389,Jerry,29, Come on up.
6390,Elaine,29," Hey, let me ask you something something. Did George buy 
              that sweater knowing the red dot was on it because it was cheaper? 
              (Jerry is unconfortable) Ooookay, you just gave me the answer."
6391,Jerry,29, No I didn't.
6392,Elaine,29," Yes you did, yes you did. I saw your expression."
6393,Jerry,29," I didn't have an expression. I have a deviated septum. I 
              have to open my mouth sometimes to breathe."
6394,Elaine,29, How much did he save?
6395,Jerry,29," Frankly I am shocked that you would ask such a question 
              (Elaine sticking out her tongue like she isn't buying a word of 
              it) of me, that you would think - the only surprise is how you could 
              even think of that. That's what you were seeing."
6396,George,29," I have to talk to Elaine. This cleaing lady is turning 
              the screws on me. She's pushing for this whole relationship thing. 
              She keeps calling me, threatening to go to the boss with this thing, 
              I could lose my job, I gotta do something to keep her quiet."
6397,Jerry,29," Elaine is in the bathroom. She's wise to whole red dot thing. 
              She's asking me all kinds of questions."
6398,George,29, Did you tell her anything?
6399,Jerry,29, No.
6400,George,29, Do you swear?
6401,Jerry,29, I'm not swearing. I don't want to swear.
6402,George,29, Oh you told her didn't you.
6403,Jerry,29, No.
6404,Elaine,29," Hey George, did you buy that sweater knowing that red dot 
              was on it because you could get it at a discount?"
6405,George,29, What? Did I what?
6406,Elaine,29, You did didn't you.
6407,George,29," Elaine, I'm, I'm shocked. I'm shocked. Here I go out in 
              the spirit of the season (Elaine looking like she's not buying a 
              word of it) and spend all my savings to buy you the most beautiful 
              Christmas sweater I have ever seen to show my appreciation to you 
              at Christmas and this is the thanks that I get at Christmas."
6408,Elaine,29, Well Jerry told me that you did.
6409,George,29," You told her? How could you tell her? I told you not to 
              say anything."
6410,Jerry,29, I didn't tell her you stupid idiot. She tricked you.
6411,George,29," Elaine you don't understand. I had 103 temperature when 
              I bought that sweater. I was so dizzy I was seeing red dots everywhere. 
              I thought everything in the store had a red dot on it. I couldn't 
              distinguish one red dot from another. I couldn't afford anything. 
              I have nothing. I haven't worked for a really long time. (Jerry 
              is standing right behind George. Jerry takes out a hankerchief and 
              starts fake-crying in it.) I mean look, I have no clothes, look 
              at what I'm wearing. It's just a little red dot."
6412,George,29, This is for you.
6413,Lady,29," Oh, Georgie, you bought this for me? Oh I knew you cared 
              for me."
6414,George,29," As you care for me. Which is why it is very important that 
              you never breathe a word of this to anyone about the... you know. 
              What, with Clarence Thomas and everything. "
6415,Lady,29," Okay, okay, can I open it now?"
6416,George,29," Yes of course go ahead. My guess is you're going to like 
              this very much."
6417,Lady,29, Oh! Is that cashmere? 
6418,George,29, Of course it's cashemere.
6419,Lady,29, A cashmere sweater. Oh Georgie Porgie!
6420,George,29, Just a little something for Christmas.
6421,Lady,29," When I was a little girl in Panama, a rich American came 
              to our town and he was wearing the softest most beautiful sweater. 
              I said to him, ""what do you call this most beautiful fabric?"", 
              and he said ""they call it cashmere"". I repeated the words 
              ""cashmere, cashmere"". I asked if I could have it, and 
              he said ""No. Get away from me."" Then he started walk away. 
              But I grabbed onto his leg screaming for him to give me the sweater 
              and he dragged me through the street. And then he kicked at me with 
              the other foot and threw some change at me. Oh, but I didn't want 
              the change Georgie. I wanted the cashmere."
6422,George,29," I had a feeling you would like it. No, don't try it on 
              now, try it on later."
6423,Lady,29," Wow, look at this. It feels so beautiful."
6424,George,29, Take it off. You're going to ruin it.
6425,Lady,29, (noticing the dot) What's this?
6426,Jerry,29," I was in the men's room the other day and they had the hand 
              blower, instead of the paper towels, you know this thing. I like 
              the hand blower I have to say. It takes a little bit longer, but 
              I feel when you're in a room with a revolting stench you want to 
              spend as much time as you can."
6427,Dick,29, The only stench is comming from you.
6428,Audience,29, Oooooh.
6429,Jerry,29," Oh, wait a second, I believe we have a heckler ladies and 
              gentlemen. Hey Dick I don't know what your problem is. It's not 
              my fault you're back on the wagon."
6430,Dick,29, It's off the wagon.
6431,Jerry,29," In the old days how do you think they got the alcohol from 
              town to town?"
6432,Dick,29, I don't know.
6433,Jerry,29," On the wagon. Don't you think they broke into a couple of 
              those bottles along the way?"
6434,Dick,29, You can't drink on a wagon it would be too bumpy.
6435,Jerry,29, They had smooth trails. What about the Cumberland Gap?
6436,Dick,29, What the hell do you know about wagons?
6437,Jerry,29, I know enough not to get on them.
6438,Boss,29," I'm going to get right to the point. It has come to my attention 
              that you and the cleaning woman have engaged in sexual intercourse 
              on the desk in your office. Is that correct?"
6439,George,29, Who said that?
6440,Boss,29, She did.
6441,George,29," Was that wrong? Should I have not done that? I tell you 
              I gotta plead ingnorance on this thing because if anyone had said 
              anything to me at all when I first started here that that sort of 
              thing was frouned upon, you know, cause I've worked in a lot of 
              offices and I tell you peope do that all the time."
6442,Boss,29, You're fired.
6443,George,29, Well you didn't have to say it like that.
6444,Boss,29, I want you out of here by the end of the day.
6445,George,29," What about the whole Christmas spirit thing? Any flexability 
              there?"
6446,Boss,29," Nah. Wait, wait, she wanted me to give you this."
6447,Elaine,29, You had sex on your desk with the cleaning woman.
6448,George,29, You never had sex in the office before?
6449,Elaine,29, No. I once made out with someone but that was it.
6450,George,29, Alright so you made out with someone.
6451,Elaine,29, Well that's not sex.
6452,George,29, Kissing is sex.
6453,Elaine,29, Kissing is not sex.
6454,Jerry,29, George?
6455,George,29, Jerry.
6456,Elaine,29," Hey, did Jerry leave that drink next to Dick's on purpose?"
6457,George,29, No.
6458,Jerry,29, George?
6459,George,29, Over here.
6460,Elaine,29, What are you doing here?
6461,Jerry,29, I'm taking the kid out to dinner to chear him up.
6462,Elaine,29, Hey Jerry when do you consider that sex has taken place?
6463,Jerry,29, I would say when the nipple makes its first appearance.
6464,Elaine,29," So, George told me that you left the drink next to Dick's 
              on purpose."
6465,Jerry,29, Nice try. So guess who heckled me at the club last night.
6466,Dick,29, Merry Christmas.
6467,Elaine,29, Oh my god that's Dick. It's Cape Fear.
6468,George,29," Hide, hide under the desk."
6469,Elaine,29," Ow, ow move over."
6470,Jerry,29, Get off of me.
6471,Elaine,29, I've got no room.
6472,Dick,29, Is that cashmere?
6473,George,29, Of course it's cashmere.
6474,Dick,29, (noticing the dot) What's this?
6475,Jerry,29," But in a way, I think I inadvertantly turned this guy into 
              an alcoholic. I hate being around alcoholics because they're either 
              telling you how much they love you or how much they hate you. And 
              those are the two statements that scare me the most. But I think 
              he's okay now because I have no idea how he feels about me. He's 
              finally off the wagon."
6476,Dick,29, You mean on the wagon.
6477,Jerry,29," Don't get smart.

6582,Jerry,30, You oughta' sit here. There is a difference.
6583,Naked man,30, You got something against naked body?
6584,Jerry,30," I got something against yours. How about a couple of deep 
              knee bends,"
6585,Naked man,30, Who's got time for squat thrusts?
6586,Jerry,30," All right, how about skipping breakfast. I'm guessing you're

              years. He"
6715,ELAINE,31, Have you thought about an intervention?
6716,MOLLIKA,31, What's that?
6717,ELAINE,31," You get all his friends in a room, They confront himm to 
              try to get"

              He'd listen to"

6720,George,31," What did you put the Pez dispenser on her leg for in the 
              first "
6721,Jerry,31," I dunno, it was an impulse."
6722,George,31, What kind of a sick impulse does that??
6723,Jerry,31, How could I know she would start to laugh?
6724,ElainElaine,31, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I *am*!
6725,Jerry,31, Can we just go in already?
6726,George,31, What are we gonna tell her?
6727,ElainElaine,31, I'll tell her I was the one who laughed.
6728,George,31," No, don't say a word. If she thinks my friends are jerks, 
              then "
6729,ElainElaine,31," [To Jerry] Oh, remind me to talk to you about something 
              later."
6730,Jerry,31, What about?
6731,George,31," Hey, hey! We're discussing something!"
6732,Jerry,31," I know, but I'm distracted now."
6733,George,31, What are you? A *baby*!? All right. Tell her.
6734,JERRY,31," Really John Mollika, they guy that used to bartend at the 
              Comedy Club. How's he doing?"
6735,ELAINE,31, He's good. 
6736,George,31," Uh, can we cut to the chase?"
6737,Jerry,31," ""Cut to the chase""?"
6738,George,31, Yeah...
6739,Jerry,31," What're you, ""Joe Hollywood""?"
6740,George,31, A lot of people say it.
6741,Jerry,31, I would lose that.
6742,George,31, [Accusingly] What's *that*?
6743,Jerry,31," ""Lose that""? That's not a Hollywood expression!"
6744,George,31, [Realizing full well it isn't] ...Yes it is.
6745,ELAINE,31, Anyway ... So John told me that Richie is in town from
6746,JERRY,31," Really, an intervention ..."
6747,George,31," Y'know people, we got a situation over here!"
6748,ELAINE,31," Yeah, but he want's you to be a part of it."
6749,JERRY,31, Me? Why me?
6750,ELAINE,31," 'Cause Richie really respects you and he would listen to 
              you."
6751,Jerry,31, Y'know these things are *really* hard to load...
6752,GEORGE,31," All right, OK, I'm goin' in."
6753,JERRY,31, We've got to talk about this (to Elaine)
6754,ELAINE,31, All right.
6755,GEORGE,31," Hi, hi, hi, You were wonderful."
6756,NOEL,31, No..
6757,GEORGE,31," Oh, these are my friends, Elaine and Jerry, ... Noel"
6758,Jerry,31, You play a *Hell* of a piano.
6759,Elaine,31," Yeah, I was really moved, *really* moved."
6760,NOEL,31," Well didn't you hear that person laughing? I couldn't play. 
              I was"
6761,Elaine,31," Well, I'm sure it wasn't *at* you."
6762,Noel,31," Well then, what was she laughing at?"
6763,Jerry,31, Pez?
6764,NOEL,31," Uh, no, No thank you. Did you see her? "
6765,GEORGE,31," Me, uh, uh, no, ..."
6766,JERRY,31," Anyone who would laugh at a recital is probably some sort 
              of lunatic anyway. I mean only a sick twisted mind could be that 
              rude and ignorant."
6767,ELAINE,31," Maybe some mental defective put something stupid on her 
              leg."
6768,JERRY,31," Even if this so called mental defective did put something 
              on her leg she's still the one who laughed."
6769,NOEL,31, I'll never forget that laugh for the rest of my life. [exits]
6770,ELAINE,31," I'm sure she would apologize if she could. Probably somebody 
              is holding her back against every fibre in her being."
6771,GEORGE,31," If she want's to continue to have a fibre of her being 
              she'll be very careful (hitting each other)"
6772,GEORGE,31," All right, so are you ready, so we'll go out and get something 
              to eat."
6773,NOEL,31, I don't feel like it tonight.
6774,JERRY,31, We'll be outside
6775,ELAINE,31, Yeah
6776,JERRY,31," It was nice meeting you By the way, How do you warm up your 
              fingers before you play?"
6777,N,31, I just crack my knuckles.
6778,GEORGE,31, We'll have a good time
6779,N,31, I don't feel like it
6780,GEORGE,31," Ah, come on"
6781,N,31, I said I DON'T FEEL LIKE IT!
6782,GEORGE,31," Um, all right, um, uh, I'll call 'ya. I'll call you and 
              we'll talk on the phone. A telephone communiqu. Every thing is 
              fine ok, uh, fine, .. [exits]"
6783,JERRY,31," You know I thing Kramer might have been responsible for 
              getting Richie involved with drugs in the first place."
6784,ELAINE,31, What? How?
6785,JERRY,31," A few years ago the comedy club had a softball team. Kramer 
              was our first baseman You couldn't get anything by him It was unbelievable. 
            "
6786,ELAINE,31, So? What happened? 
6787,JERRY,31," What happened? The guy was like 67 years old, it was freezing 
              out, he caught a cold, got pneumonia, "
6788,ELAINE,31, Shut up! 
6789,JERRY,31," All the comedians were happy. He was one of these club owners 
              nobodu liked anyway. But Richie was never the same."
6790,ELAINE,31, Whar about Kramer?
6791,JERRY,31, He's the same!
6792,JERRY,31," Are you sure you want me John. I have spoken to Richie in 
              two years. I don't have a good apartment for "
6793,KRAMER,31," (looks shocked) Oh sure, the guy I told to pour the Gatorade 
              that killed Marty Benson? "
6794,JERRY,31," Right, we'll John Mollika is organizing some kind of intervention 
              for him. We're having it here. "
6795,KRAMER,31, Can I get in on that?
6796,JERRY,31, What do you think? It's like a poker game?
6797,KRAMER,31, Is Elaine going?
6798,JERRY,31, Yeah
6799,KRAMER,31," Well, I knew him as well as she did."
6800,JERRY,31," Yeah, but John invited her."
6801,KRAMER,31," So what are you saying, you don't want me to intervene?"
6802,JERRY,31," No, intervene, go intervene all you want. I am just afraid 
              you might be interfering while we're intervening. "
6803,GEORGE,31, It's George
6804,JERRY,31, Stop smelling your arm.
6805,KRAMER,31," You know I got a great idea for a cologne. The Beach. You 
              spray it on and you smell like you just "
6806,JERRY,31," Hum, a cologne that smells like the beach. I can't believe 
              I'm saying this, ""That's not a bad idea."""
6807,KRAMER,31, Tell me about it!
6808,JERRY,31," Why don't you call Steve D'Jiff, he works in the marketing 
              department at Calvin Klein. "
6809,GEORGE,31, Well it's over. It's definitely over. 
6810,JERRY,31, She broke up with you?
6811,GEORGE,31," No, but I can tell she's going to. I can sense it. We had 
              this terrible phone conversation. "
6812,JERRY,31, What was on the list?
6813,GEORGE,31," Let's see, How I'm very good at going in reverse in my 
              car, why isn't Postum a more popular drink, "
6814,JERRY,31," Yeah, Postum is under-ratted, "
6815,GEORGE,31," Anyway there was all this tension. I asked her if she wanted 
              to go out to dinner and she said "
6816,JERRY,31, What's wrong with lunch?
6817,GEORGE,31," Lunch is fine at the beginning then you move on to dinner. 
              you don't move back to lunch. It's like being demoted. "
6818,KRAMER,31, I like the Jumble You ever do the Jumble?
6819,GEORGE,31," I have no power Do you understand? I need hand. I have 
              no hand."
6820,KRAMER,31, Break up with her 
6821,GEORGE,31, What?
6822,KRAMER,31, You break up with her. You reverse everything that way.
6823,JERRY,31, A preemptive breakup. 
6824,GEORGE,31," A preemptive breakup. This is an incredible idea. I got 
              nothing to lose. "
6825,GEORGE,31," So, I am have to going to break up with you."
6826,NOEL,31, You're breaking up with me?
6827,GEORGE,31," I, ... am breaking up with, ... you."
6828,NOEL,31, Wow.
6829,GEORGE,31, Shocked?
6830,NOEL,31, I really am. 
6831,GEORGE,31, Never expected this did you?
6832,NOEL,31, I thought everything was fine.
6833,GEORGE,31," Well, live and learn."
6834,NOEL,31," I don't understand. You're breaking up with me. Didn't we 
              have fun doing the crossword puzzles?"
6835,GEORGE,31, Kind of.
6836,NOEL,31, I'm very confused.
6837,GEORGE,31," Well, I didn't mean to hurt you kid."
6838,NOEL,31," I thought,..."
6839,GEORGE,31," Now, stop it ..."
6840,NOEL,31," What do you want, I can make you happy."
6841,GEORGE,31, When you're playing the piano do you think about me?
6842,NOEL,31, I don't know.
6843,GEORGE,31, This is what I'm talking about.
6844,NOEL,31," OK, I'll think about you."
6845,GEORGE,31, All the time.
6846,NOEL,31," All the time? ... OK, All the time."
6847,GEORGE,31, I can't hear you.
6848,NOEL,31, All the time. ALL THE TIME.
6849,GEORGE,31," See, It's not so hard. "
6850,KRAMER,31," Go ahead smell, smell"
6851,STEVE,31," Yeah, so?"
6852,KRAMER,31, Do you recognize it? ... The beach.
6853,STEVE,31, What are you talking about?
6854,KRAMER,31," Oh, I'm talking about the beach."
6855,STEVE,31, What about it?
6856,KRAMER,31," You know the way you smell when you first come home from 
              the beach?"
6857,STEVE,31, That is the dumbest idea I have ever heard.
6858,KRAMER,31," Oh, wait, Did you here what I just said?"
6859,STEVE,31," Do you think people are going to pay $80 a bottle to smell 
              like dead"
6860,KRAMER,31, So you don't think it's a good idea? 
6861,The Intervention [NOTE,31," I may have confused the names of some of 
              the male interveners below]"
6862,GUY,31," The membranes get dried and it just starts bleeding. Since 
              I was a"
6863,ELAINE,31," (very uninterested) Uh, you have to work like that? "
6864,GUY,31, Nobody minds Nobody has ever said anything to me.
6865,OTHER GUY,31, Are there any ice cubes?
6866,JERRY,31, In the freezer.
6867,OTHER GUY,31, I looked. There aren't any ice cubes.
6868,JERRY,31, Well I guess there aren't any ice cubes.
6869,OTHER GUY,31, I can't drink this. It's warm! (walks away)
6870,Guy,31, Shouldn't we rehearse this a little bit before Richie comes?
6871,Steve,31, What's the plan?
6872,JERRY,31, Do I have to talk? I don't feel like talking.
6873,OTHER GUY,31," Well, if he's not going to talk I'm not going to talk 
              either."
6874,GUY,31," No, we all have to talk."
6875,ELAINE,31, What's the order?
6876,GUY,31, We'll go in alphabetical order. First Roberta.
6877,ROBERTA,31, Why am I first? 
6878,ELAINE,31, Albano is your last name.
6879,ROBERTA,31, That's not my name any more. I'm divorced.
6880,Steve,31, I'll go first.
6881,KRAMER,31, Hey.
6882,JERRY,31, Hey.
6883,KRAMER,31, Is this the interference?
6884,JERRY,31, Intervention.
6885,OTHER GUY,31, What are you doing here? 
6886,KRAMER,31," Uh, is it all right if I stay for the intervention?"
6887,Steve,31," Hey, this is for close friends only."
6888,KRAMER,31," I'm a friend. Who do you think told him to pour the Gatorade 
            "
6889,OTHER GUY,31, Let him stay.
6890,KRAMER,31," Hey, you know I got someone to make up that cologne for 
              me, big mouth."
6891,Steve,31, Somebody's going to make that crap?
6892,Old Guy,31, Kramer!
6893,KRAMER,31," Hey, come on, these are some of my polar bear buddies."
6894,OTHER GUY,31, They can't stay.
6895,Old Guy,31, We're having a party here?
6896,JERRY,31," No, we're having an intervention"
6897,Old Guy,31, An intervention? Who's intervening?
6898,JERRY,31," There's a friend of ours on drugs and we're going to confront 
              him."
6899,OLD GUY,31," Sure, we used to do that when one of our polar bears stopped"
6900,GUY,31, It's him.
6901,Roberta,31, What should we do?
6902,ELAINE,31, Hide!
6903,JERRY,31, It's NOT a surprise party! Yeah (to intercom)
6904,GEORGE,31, It's George
6905,JERRY,31," Yeah, come on up. ... It's not him."
6906,GUY,31, If you don't go out with me it's because I'm a bar tender.
6907,ELAINE,31," Look, I don't think this is appropriate right now."
6908,GUY,31, Is it because I have a tissue in my nose?
6909,ELAINE,31, You're getting warm.
6910,GEORGE,31, We just came from Chadway's(?) What's going on.
6911,JERRY,31, We're having the intervention for Richie.
6912,GEORGE,31," Oh, right, right, the intervention. Should we leave?"
6913,JERRY,31," Well, uh.."
6914,NOEL,31," (happily) Elaine, hi."
6915,ELAINE,31," Oh, hi Noel"
6916,JERRY,31," Well, you're looking well."
6917,GEORGE,31," Jerry, let me tell you something, ""A man without hand 
              is not a man."" "
6918,Steve,31," Even if I were dragged through manure I still wouldn't put 
              that stuff on."
6919,GEORGE,31, (to Kramer) This man is a genius. Genius!
6920,Steve,31, You think so?
6921,GEORGE,31," I don't think so I know so, Kramer, come here I got to 
              talk to you"
6922,Old Man,31," The male kangaroo doesn't have a pouch only the female 
              has it. The male has pouch envy."
6923,ELAINE,31, (Chuckles)
6924,ELAINE,31, (laughs)
6925,NOEL,31, That laugh. That's the laugh. That's it. You're the one.
6926,ELAINE,31," No, no. It was an accident. It really wasn't my fault. 
              It was Jerry."
6927,NOEL,31, You put a Pez dispenser on her leg during my recital?.
6928,JERRY,31, I didn't know she would laugh.
6929,NOEL,31," You lied to me George, you lied to me."
6930,GEORGE,31," No, I, uh, um, wa, wa, What did I do? ... Where are you 
              going?"
6931,NOEL,31, I ... am breaking up ... with you! 
6932,GEORGE,31, You can't break up with me. I've got hand.
6933,NOEL,31, And you're going to need it.
6934,JERRY,31, Hey Richie
6935,RICHIE,31, So what's going on?
6936,JERRY,31," It was pretty ugly from the get go. he's not listening, 
              He's hostile, he's"
6937,GEORGE,31, I can't do these puzzles. 
6938,JERRY,31," So he starts to get up He spots the Pez dispenser on the 
              coffee table "
6939,GEORGE,31, Ah ah Pez dispenser.
6940,JERRY,31," He picks it up - he stares at it - It's like he's hypnotized 
              by it. Then he's"
6941,GEORGE,31, Well they're hard to load.
6942,JERRY,31," Tell me something I don't know. So as the father's trying 
              to load it he loses control"
6943,GEORGE,31, Poor kid.
6944,JERRY,31, So as he's telling the story he starts crying. 
6945,GEORGE,31, What did you do?
6946,JERRY,31, What do you think? I gave him my Pez dispenser.
6947,GEORGE,31, Wow
6948,JERRY,31," Two hours later he checks into Smither's clinic. I talked 
              to the doctor yesterday."
6949,GEORGE,31, What's a three letter word for candy?
6950,JERRY,31, I can't do those things.

        think that would have a negative effect on his life?"
6953,ELAINE,32, Na.
6954,JERRY,32, What are you doing? Were going out for dinner in ten minutes.
6955,ELAINE,32," Do you realize this is the last meal I am going to have for three 
        days?"
6956,JERRY,32, Yeah.
6957,GEORGE,32, Its George.
6958,JERRY,32," Come on up. . . . I never heard of this. Youve got to fast 
        for three days to take an ulcer test. How you gonna do that?"
6959,ELAINE,32," I dont know. How could I possibly have ulcers? Who could 
        have given me ulcers?"
6960,JERRY,32, I think Ill take out the garbage.
6961,ELAINE,32," Hey, have you ever fasted?"
6962,GEORGE,32," Yeah, right."
6963,JERRY,32," Come on, its just down the hall."
6964,GEORGE,32, Give me two bucks. Ill do it for two bucks.
6965,JERRY,32, Ill give you 50 cents.
6966,GEORGE,32, Theres no way I touch that bag for less than two dollars.
6967,JERRY,32," Come on. Fifty cents. <??> a piece of Drakes coffee 
        cake"
6968,GEORGE,32," Youre not getting no Drakes Coffee Cake for fifty 
        cents. Yae, Hey, Im all set. I got the ticket. Im going to 
        the Cayman Islands this Friday."
6969,JERRY,32," I dont get you. Who goes on vacation without a job? What 
        do you need a break from getting up at eleven?"
6970,GEORGE,32," Its an incredible deal. I dont know why you dont 
        come with me."
6971,JERRY,32," Nah, I dont go for these non-refundable deals. I cant 
        commit to a woman. Im not going to commit to an airline."
6972,GINA,32, Hi.
6973,JERRY,32, Hi.
6974,GINA,32, How are you?
6975,JERRY,32," Gina, do you know what a Drakes Coffee Cake is?"
6976,GINA,32," Of course, the plane cake with the sweet brown crumbs on the top."
6977,JERRY,32, How much do they cost?
6978,GINA,32, The junior?
6979,GEORGE,32," No, no the full size."
6980,JERRY,32," No, no the junior."
6981,GEORGE,32," You didnt say ""junior""."
6982,GINA,32, I havent had one of those since I was a little girl.
6983,JERRY,32," Really? You should be ashamed of yourself. I want you out of here! 
        [MARTIN enters the hall] How ya doing?"
6984,MARTIN,32, Good enough.
6985,JERRY,32, Boy shes sexy isnt she?
6986,JERRY,32, Do you believe that guy?
6987,ELAINE,32, What guy?
6988,ELAINE,32," Oh, that creepy guy?"
6989,JERRY,32," Yeah, did he think I was flirting with her?"
6990,GEORGE,32, He didnt seem too pleased.
6991,ELAINE,32, Maybe Ill get a steak with french fried onion wings.
6992,GEORGE,32," hey, you know what? I just remembered something. I had a dream 
        about that guy last night. This is amazing. "
6993,JERRY,32, Whats so amazing? Youve seen him before.
6994,GEORGE,32, I havent seen him for months.
6995,JERRY,32, What was the dream?
6996,GEORGE,32," I was doing standup comedy in Kennebunkport Maine. ??? night 
        club. The stage was on a cliff and the audience was throwing all the comics 
        off."
6997,JERRY,32, I think Ive played there.
6998,GEORGE,32, Ive had a lot of other paranormal stuff happen to me.
6999,JERRY,32, Youre a little paranormal 
7000,ELAINE,32," Hey, George, you know my friend goes to a psychic."
7001,GEORGE,32, Really?
7002,ELAINE,32," Uh uh, you should go some time. "
7003,GEORGE,32, Id love to go. Make an appointment.
7004,JERRY,32," Psychics, vacations. How about getting a job? "
7005,GEORGE,32, I just got fired.
7006,JERRY,32," Alright, come on, lets get out of here."
7007,ELAINE,32, I wonder what Ghandi ate before his fast.
7008,JERRY,32, I heard he used to polish off a box of Triscuits. 
7009,ELAINE,32, Really?
7010,JERRY,32," Oh, yeah. Ghandi loved Triscuits. "
7011,JERRY,32, Who is it? Who is it?
7012,GINA,32, Its Gina.
7013,JERRY,32, Who?
7014,GINA,32, Martines girl friend. 
7015,JERRY,32, Martine?
7016,GINA,32, You next door neighbour.
7017,JERRY,32," Oh, Martin!"
7018,GEORGE,32," Its Martine. I think hes dying. He tried to kill 
        himself with pills."
7019,JERRY,32, What? 
7020,GINA,32, Come on.
7021,JERRY,32, In my pajamas? I better get my robe.
7022,GINA,32, We dont have enough time. 
7023,JERRY,32, Itll take two seconds.
7024,GINA,32, There is no time.
7025,JERRY,32, We dont have two seconds?
7026,GINA,32, All right. Go ahead.
7027,JERRY,32," Nah, forget it."
7028,GINA,32," No, go ahead."
7029,JERRY,32, Nah. Ill just wear the pajamas.
7030,GINA,32, Will you just get it.
7031,JERRY,32, Are you sure?
7032,GINA,32, Forget it. Come on.
7033,JERRY,32," Nah, Ill go get the robe. "
7034,JERRY,32," Thats not too bad. Its not like a Sunny von Bulow 
        comma. The doctor said he should snap out of it anytime. "
7035,GINA,32," You know why he did this? Because I told him it was over. I did 
        not want to see him anymore."
7036,JERRY,32, Really? Its over?
7037,GINA,32," I could not stand it another minute. Yesterday he turned over a 
        mans hot dog stand because he thought the man was looking at me. 
        And then after he saw you in the hall. Ach, he was crazy with jealousy. 
      "
7038,JERRY,32," Oh boy, did he say anything about me?"
7039,GINA,32," He does not like you. And all indications are he does not like 
        Drakes Coffee Cake."
7040,JERRY,32, He said that?
7041,GINA,32," He was screaming about it all night. How its too sweet and 
        it falls apart when you eat it. "
7042,JERRY,32," Im sorry if I caused any trouble. I was just being friendly. 
      "
7043,GINA,32, I wasnt.
7044,JERRY,32, You werent?
7045,GINA,32," No, I have thought about you many times. Have you thought about 
        me?"
7046,JERRY,32, Of course.
7047,GINA,32, Tell me everything.
7048,JERRY,32," Are you sure he cant hear anything? . . .MARTIN, MARTIN."
7049,GINA,32," I wish he was not in a coma. I wish he was dead. I wish I could 
        pull the plug out from him. "
7050,JERRY,32," I, would, I would wait on that. I know how you feel but. Juries 
        today, you never know how theyre going to look at a thing like this."
7051,GINA,32, I saw you looking at your watch. You want to leave? Go ahead. 
7052,JERRY,32," No, I just wanted to see what time it was. "
7053,GINA,32, Are you afraid of him? 
7054,JERRY,32, No.
7055,GINA,32, Then kiss me.
7056,JERRY,32, Here?
7057,GINA,32," Yes, right here."
7058,JERRY,32, Is this the proper venue?
7059,GINA,32, You dont want to?
7060,JERRY,32," No, no, I want to. I, I very much want to. I, I desire to. I, 
        I pine to. "
7061,GINA,32, Then kiss me right in front of him.
7062,JERRY,32, I cant. What if he wakes up?
7063,GINA,32," A man is lying here unconscious and youre afraid of him? 
        What kind of a man are you? "
7064,JERRY,32," A man who respects a good comma. If it was one of those in and 
        out comas, maybe. But when a guys got a coma going like this  
        you dont want to mess with it."
7065,KRAMER,32, Hey.
7066,JERRY,32, Hey. 
7067,KRAMER,32, Did you hear about Martin?
7068,JERRY,32," Yeah, I heard."
7069,KRAMER,32, I cant believe hes in a coma.
7070,KRAMER,32," Hes got my vacuum cleaner. You know I loaned it to him. 
        He never returned it. The carpets are filthy. What am I going to do? "
7071,JERRY,32, Who told you about Martin?
7072,KRAMER,32, Newman! Hes good friends with him. 
7073,KRAMER,32," Hes got all of my attachments, you know. "
7074,JERRY,32," Hey, let me ask you something. How long do you have to wait for 
        a guy to come out of a coma before you can ask his ex-girlfriend out?"
7075,KRAMER,32," What, Gina? Why wait? Why not just call Doctor Kavorkian? "
7076,JERRY,32," You know I dont get that whole suicide machine. Theres 
        no tall buildings where these people live? They cant wrap their 
        lips around a revolver like a normal person? "
7077,KRAMER,32, So whats going on between you and Gina?
7078,JERRY,32," Well, I went with her to the hospital last night."
7079,KRAMER,32," Uh, uh."
7080,JERRY,32," So were in the room and shes trying to get me to kiss 
        her right in front of him. "
7081,KRAMER,32," Uh, uh, you see thats the great thing about Mediterranean 
        women. All right, so what did you do?"
7082,JERRY,32, Nothing.
7083,KRAMER,32," Ah, what kind of a man are you? The guy is unconscious in a coma 
        and you dont have the guts to kiss his girlfriend? "
7084,JERRY,32, I didnt know what the coma etiquette was. 
7085,KRAMER,32," There is no coma etiquette. You see thats the beauty of 
        the coma, man. It doesnt matter what you do around it. "
7086,JERRY,32," So youre saying, his girl, his car, his clothes, its 
        all up for grabs. You can just loot the coma victim."
7087,KRAMER,32," Id give him 24 hours to get out of it. They cant 
        get out of it in 24 hours, its a land rush."
7088,JERRY,32," So if the coma victim wakes up in a month, hes thrilled, 
        he got out of the coma. He goes home, theres nothing left?"
7089,KRAMER,32," NOTHING LEFT! Thats why Im trying to get that vacuum 
        cleaner. Because somebodys going to grab it. "
7090,RULA,32, Martins spirit came to you as a warning.
7091,ELAINE,32, Why would he come to George?
7092,RULA,32," Because George has heightened extra sensory perception. FAYGY GET 
        YOUR FINGER OUT OF YOUR NOSE."
7093,GEORGE,32, I knew it. I always felt different. 
7094,RULA,32, You are. Some coffee cake? 
7095,GEORGE,32, Drakes? 
7096,RULA,32, Yes.
7097,GEORGE,32, Did you buy this for me?
7098,RULA,32," No, why?"
7099,GEORGE,32," Ha, because I love Drakes Coffee Cake."
7100,RULA,32, Maybe I did.
7101,ELAINE,32, Take it away.
7102,GEORGE,32, She hasnt eaten in two days.
7103,RULA,32, Whos Pauline?
7104,GEORGE,32," Pauline? . . . Wait a minute. I got it. My brother once impregnated 
        a woman named Pauline."
7105,RULA,32, Do you think about her?
7106,GEORGE,32, When I hear her name mentioned.
7107,RULA,32, Cut these with your left hand.
7108,GEORGE,32," There was a woman, Audrey. She had a very big nose."
7109,RULA,32," I see an Audrey, but with a small nose."
7110,GEORGE,32," Yes, yes, she had a nose job. I loved her very deeply. Will she 
        ever speak to me again?"
7111,RULA,32, Not in this life. 
7112,ELAINE,32, Should you be smoking?
7113,RULA,32, Does it bother you?
7114,ELAINE,32, Youre pregnant.
7115,GEORGE,32, Elaine.
7116,RULA,32, I smoked when I had Faisy. 
7117,RULA,32, Ah oh.
7118,GEORGE,32, Ah oh? What? What Ah oh?
7119,RULA,32, I dont know about this trip George.
7120,GEORGE,32," You can see the Cayman Islands in there? Is something going to 
        happen to me? What?"
7121,ELAINE,32, Its really bad for the fetus. Do you know that.
7122,GEORGE,32," Elaine, shes a psychic. She knows how the kids going 
        to be. "
7123,GEORGE,32, Should I not go on this trip?
7124,RULA,32," George, I am going to tell you something and I want you to really 
        hear me."
7125,ELAINE,32," Now listen. I just dont know how a person, with everything 
        we now know about pre-natal care can put a cigarette in her mouth. "
7126,GEORGE,32," Elaine, what are you doing?"
7127,ELAINE,32, Its disgusting.
7128,RULA,32, I DONT BELIVE IT. I would like you both to leave. 
7129,ELAINE,32," Oh fine, I dont like to be around people who are just so 
        irresponsible."
7130,RULA,32, Get the hell out.
7131,"[Elaine leaving]
        GEORGE",32, A plane crash? A Heart attack? Lupus? Is it Lupus?
7132,RULA,32, Do you want me to call the super? He was an Israeli commando.
7133,GEORGE,32," If you dont say anything I will assume its a plane 
        crash."
7134,RULA,32, Get out.
7135,GEORGE,32, Not a plane crash. [leaving] Is it a plane crash?
7136,GINA,32, I do not like your toothbrush. There are no bristles. 
7137,JERRY,32," You can say what you want about me but Ill be damned if 
        Im going to stand here while you insult my toothbrush. "
7138,GINA,32," It is too small for someone with such a big mouth [kisses Kerry]. 
        Let me ask you. What will you do if Martine wakes up? Run away like a 
        mouse?"
7139,JERRY,32," No, more like the Three Stooges at the end of every movie."
7140,GINA,32, Who are these Stooges you speak of?
7141,JERRY,32, Theyre a comedy team.
7142,GINA,32, Tell me about them. Everything.
7143,JERRY,32," Well, theyre three kind of funny looking guys and they hit 
        each other a lot."
7144,GINA,32, You will show me The Stooges?
7145,JERRY,32, I will show you The Stooges.
7146,GINA,32, When?
7147,JERRY,32," Well, I dont really know where The Stooges are right now 
        but if I locate them you will be the first to know."
7148,GINA,32," Come, you walk me to a cab."
7149,JERRY,32," Well, uh, I uh, I dont want you to get upset or anything 
        but uh, with Martin and all, well maybe its not such a good idea 
        for us to be seen together in the building, because, you know, he had 
        a lot of friends here."
7150,GINA,32, Youre still afraid. You are not a man.
7151,JERRY,32," Well then what are all those ties and sport jackets doing in my 
        closet?"
7152,GINA,32, Are you going to walk me to a cab or not?
7153,JERRY,32," Yeah, all right. All right."
7154,KRAMER,32, You should just eat fruit. 
7155,NEWMAN,32, I cant eat fruit. It makes me incontinent.
7156,KRAMER,32, ???
7157,NEWMAN,32, Hello Gina. Hello Jerry.
7158,JERRY,32, Hello Newman.
7159,JERRY,32," Do you think Newman would tell Martin if he wakes up? What kind 
        of sicko would do that? He could kill me."
7160,GEORGE,32," People smoke, Elaine. My mother smoked. It didnt hurt me."
7161,ELAINE,32, [jumps with fear to Jerry] Did you see that wall move?
7162,JERRY,32," Boy, its a good thing we came."
7163,GEORGE,32," Could there be a native p0roblem in the Caymans? Maybe theres 
        native unrest."
7164,ELAINE,32," Hi, I havent eaten in three days. I was wondering how much 
        longer it would be until I get my X-ray."
7165,Nurse,32, Well call you.
7166,JERRY,32," George, I want you to promise me something. If Im ever in 
        a comma. In the first 24 hours get everything out of my apartment and 
        put it in storage. "
7167,GEORGE,32, How come?
7168,JERRY,32, Looters.
7169,ELAINE,32, How do we know that dog food is any good? Who tastes it? 
7170,JERRY,32, Shes really hungry.
7171,KRAMER,32, Hey.
7172,ELAINE,32, Kramer
7173,KRAMER,32," Well, Newmans upstairs visiting Martin. "
7174,GEORGE,32, Would you buy my Cayman Island ticket?
7175,KRAMER,32, Youre not going?
7176,GEORGE,32, No.
7177,KRAMER,32, Why not?
7178,GEORGE,32, The psychic said something terrible will happen.
7179,KRAMER,32, I dig. 
7180,KRAMER,32," I want my vacuum cleaner! I know you can hear me. Look my mother, 
        shes going to come and visit me. She sees that rug, shes going 
        to kill me."
7181,W,32," He cant hear you, you idiot. Why dont you just buy another 
        one. "
7182,KRAMER,32," Why would I buy another one when I spent a hundred bucks on this 
        one?"
7183,W,32, I have a carpet sweeper you can use.
7184,KRAMER,32," I dont want a carpet sweeper. They dont do anything. 
      "
7185,W,32, It gets my rug clean. 
7186,KRAMER,32," The carpet sweeper is the biggest scam perpetrated on the American 
        public since One Hour Martinizing."
7187,W,32," Well, you should take a look at my rug then."
7188,KRAMER,32, I wouldnt set foot in your house.
7189,JERRY,32, Hello.
7190,NEWMAN,32, Hello Jerry.
7191,JERRY,32, Hows he doing? 
7192,KRAMER,32, He looks happy to me.
7193,NEWMAN,32, I hope he stays this happy when he wakes up.
7194,JERRY,32, Why wouldnt he?
7195,NEWMAN,32, No reason.
7196,JERRY,32," Hell have a lot of catching up to do, I guess. "
7197,NEWMAN,32, Ill bring him up to date.
7198,JERRY,32, How up to date?
7199,NEWMAN,32," Oh, all the way up."
7200,JERRY,32, And nothing could change your mind? 
7201,NEWMAN,32," Well, it would take a hell of a lot. Because a friend is something 
        you earn."
7202,KRAMER,32," Okay, Jerry has a friend who has free tickets to the Cayman Islands 
        for this weekend. Hes not going. "
7203,NEWMAN,32," I dont care much for the beach. I freckle. . . . Is that 
        a,.."
7204,JERRY,32, Drakes Coffee Cake 
7205,NEWMAN,32," Wow, where did you get that?"
7206,JERRY,32, From my house. I got a whole box of them. 
7207,NEWMAN,32," Boy, thats the full size."
7208,JERRY,32, Thats your big boy.
7209,NEWMAN,32, Can I have a bite?
7210,JERRY,32," I dont give out bites. I got another one. But Im saving 
        it for later. "
7211,NEWMAN,32, Just one bite?
7212,JERRY,32," I dont think so. You know they, theyre so fragile. 
      "
7213,NEWMAN,32, All right! All right. I wont say anything. 
7214,JERRY,32, You swear?
7215,NEWMAN,32, I swear.
7216,JERRY,32, On your mothers life?
7217,NEWMAN,32, On my mothers life.
7218,KRAMER,32, oh oh oh oh oh
7219,NEWMAN,32," Oooh, "
7220,ELAINE,32," And there it was, mountains of duck. And not fatty duck either, 
        but juicy tender breasts of duck. "
7221,GEORGE,32," sweetheart, no come here,  sweetheart"
7222,RULA,32," pew, pew, pew, pew (breathing)"
7223,GEORGE,32," how did I know you were here? Something drew me here. This is 
        phenomenal. "
7224,RULA,32," The nurse said she would be right back. Theyre supposed to 
        take me into the delivery room. "
7225,GEORGE,32," Oh, thats great. Thats great. By the way I have to 
        apologize for my friend the other day. Friend? Uh, uh I dont even 
        know that woman. I met her on the bus on the way over. I couldnt 
        get rid of her. Uh, My psychic instincts were a little off .."
7226,RULA,32," Oh, wheres the nurse"
7227,GEORGE,32," I dont know where the nurse is. Sweetheart why dont 
        you get a nurse for mommy?  Anyway I was just curious. Remember 
        the other day you were saying something about my trip. "
7228,RULA,32, Dont take that trip.
7229,GEORGE,32," Yeah, why? Why? "
7230,RULA,32," <screams> EEEY, beegit, beegit beegit."
7231,Dx,32," All right, Rula, its time to go."
7232,GEORGE,32, Because? Because?
7233,ELAINE,32," Assassins! How dare they keep a person waiting like this!  
        Drakes Coffee Cake?  Give me that."
7234,NEWMAN,32," Jerry, you better stop her or Ill tell."
7235,JERRY,32, Elaine! No! No!
7236,MARTIN,32," Ooooh, ahhhh, "
7237,GEORGE,32," Are there terrorists on the plane? A hotel fire. Is that it? 
        Malaria? Yellow fever? Lupus? Is it Lupus?"
7238,NEWMAN,32," He did it right in this bed, Martin. Right in front of you."
7239,KRAMER,32, I want my vacuum cleaner!
7240,JERRY,32, Hey!
7241,NEWMAN,32, It was disgusting.
7242,JERRY,32, What are you doing? Were going out to dinner in ten minutes.
7243,GEORGE,32," I never assisted in a birth before. Its really quite disgusting. 
      "
7244,JERRY,32, What did she name the kid?
7245,GEORGE,32, You wouldnt believe it. Rasputin.
7246,KRAMER,32, Heey!
7247,GEORGE,32, Hey.
7248,JERRY,32, Hey.
7249,GEORGE,32, when did you get back?
7250,KRAMER,32, A couple of hours ago.
7251,GEORGE,32, So how was it?
7252,KRAMER,32," George, I would like to thank you for the greatest four days 
        I ever spent in my life."
7253,JERRY,32, osh.
7254,KRAMER,32," They were shooting the Sports Illustrated swim suit issue right 
        in the hotel pool."
7255,JERRY,32, Woah. [hitting George]
7256,KRAMER,32," Not only that but at the hotel they opened up this area on the 
        beach for nude bathing and all of the Sports Illustrated models went down 
        there."
7257,JERRY,32, Wow! [hitting George]
7258,KRAMER,32, I was on the next blanket from Elle McPherson 
7259,JERRY,32, Oh! [hitting George]
7260,KRAMER,32, We played Backgammon in the nude.
7261,JERRY,32, Oh! [hitting George]
7262,KRAMER,32, Shes a sweet kid.
7263,JERRY,32, Nude backgammon with swimsuit models!
7264,KRAMER,32," Oh, you know what? The second day I was there I stepped on a 
        jellyfish. Now it kind of stung my foot. Thats probably what Rula 
        was trying to warn you about."
7265,GEORGE,32," Yeah, you gotta watch for the jellyfish."
7266,KRAMER,32, Yeah.
7267,KRAMER,32, Whats this?
7268,JERRY,32," Oh, its an invitation to a house warming from Martin and 
        Gina."
7269,KRAMER,32, They moved in together?
7270,JERRY,32," Yeah, its some place down in the village. "
7271,KRAMER,32, Phew.
7272,JERRY,32, Yeah.
7273,ELAINE,32, Its Elaine.
7274,JERRY,32, All right were coming down.
7275,KRAMER,32," Hey, where ya going?"
7276,JERRY,32," Were taking Elaine to dinner. Shes got to start the 
        fast again. Um, you want to go?"
7277,KRAMER,32," Um, Id like to but a bunch of us from the islands, well 
        be getting together."
7278,GEORGE,32, Elle McPherson going to be there?
7279,KRAMER,32, OH! I got to call her back.

7283,George,36," It's all departures. I see nothing but departures. (to the woman
        beside him) Do you know where the arrivals are?"
7284,George,36," Excuse me, sir, do you have the time?"
7285,Man,36, There's a clock over there.
7286,George,36, Where?
7287,Man (pointing),36, There.
7288,George,36, But you have a watch on.
7289,Man,36, It's right by the escalator.
7290,George,36, Why don't you just look at your watch?
7291,Man,36," I told you, it's right over there."
7292,George,36, Let me see the watch.
7293,Man,36," Hey! What are you, some kind of nut?!"
7294,George,36, You know we're living in a society!
7295,Jerry,36, George.
7296,George,36, Jerry. Jerry.
7297,Jerry,36," Sorry, the flight was delayed, how long've you been waiting?"
7298,George,36, I just got here. My car broke down on the Belt Parkway.
7299,George,36," One mile from the exit it starts shaking, really violently shaking,
        like it's having a nervous breakdown. It completely stopped dead."
7300,Jerry,36, So you have no car?
7301,George,36, No.
7302,Jerry,36, So what good are you?
7303,Jerry,36," I'll tell you one thing, this chauffeur's gonna be waiting a while,
        O'Brien's not showing up."
7304,George,36, How do you know?
7305,Jerry,36," He was in Chicago, the flight was overbooked, wouldn't let him 
        on the
        plane. He kept screaming how he had to get to Madison Square Garden."
7306,George,36, We should take his limo.
7307,Jerry,36," Yeah, right."
7308,George,36," Wait a second. Think about it. He's not showing up. Wait till 
        you
        see the line of cabs, its like forty-five minutes long. You said he's 
        in
        Chicago."
7309,NINA,38," (laughing) Kramer, would you hold still? I cant do 
              this if you keep"
7310,KRAMER,38," You sure you dont want me to take my clothes off? 
              (beat) Ill do it!"
7311,NINA,38," No, thats the last thing in the world I want you to 
              do."
7312,KRAMER,38," Well, why dont you take your clothes off?"
7313,NINA,38," I dont know... I dont think Jerry would like 
              that."
7314,KRAMER,38," (debonair smile) Well, itd be our little secret."
7315,(CUT TO,38, Jerrys apartment)
7316,GEORGE,38," (bursting out of the bathroom, fumbling with his fly) Button 
              fly!"
7317,JERRY,38, I like the button fly.
7318,GEORGE,38, (incredulous) What?
7319,JERRY,38, That is one place on my wardrobe I do not need sharp interlocking
7320,GEORGE,38, Nothing.
7321,JERRY,38," I have to go meet Nina. Want to come up to her lot, check 
              out her"
7322,GEORGE,38, I dont get art.
7323,JERRY,38, Theres nothing to get.
7324,GEORGE,38," Well, it always has to be explained to me, and then I have 
              to have"
7325,JERRY,38," She does a lot of abstract stuff. In fact she's painting 
              Kramer"
7326,GEORGE,38, What for?
7327,JERRY,38, She sees something in him.
7328,GEORGE,38," So do I, but I wouldn't hang it on a wall."
7329,(CUT TO,38, Nina's studio again--same scene)
7330,KRAMER,38," Are you getting the eyes? 'Cause they're brown. (beat) 
              Or, really,"
7331,NINA,38, Tell me about Elaine.
7332,KRAMER,38," She and Jerry were a big thing, like Abe Lincoln and Mary 
              Todd."
7333,NINA,38," But, they're still friends."
7334,KRAMER,38," Oh yeah, they're like this (holds up two fingers together)."
7335,NINA,38, Don't you think that's strange?
7336,KRAMER,38," Why, what's the difference?"
7337,NINA,38," Well, are you still friends with any of your ex-girlfriends?"
7338,KRAMER,38," Well, you know... I, uh... have many relationships."
7339,(CUT TO,38, the door outside Nina's studio)
7340,GEORGE,38," You know, I'm a little nervous."
7341,JERRY,38, Why?
7342,GEORGE,38," Well, you know... the friend meeting the new woman. I feel 
              like I'm"
7343,JERRY,38, I don't know how long this is gonna last.
7344,GEORGE,38, Really? I thought you liked her.
7345,JERRY,38," I do... she's got like a jealousy thing. She doesn't like 
              me having"
7346,GEORGE,38," You know, it's a miracle you're not married. (beat) Hey, 
              I'm not"
7347,JERRY,38," Hi, Nina. (smooch) This is my friend George."
7348,NINA,38," How nice to meet you, I've heard a lot about you. (George 
              nods)"
7349,JERRY,38," (walking over to where Kramer is posing) Hey, look at this 
              guy!"
7350,KRAMER,38, Yeah!
7351,JERRY,38, (to Nina) I brought George up to see some of your paintings.
7352,NINA,38," Oh, are you interested?"
7353,GEORGE,38," (looking uncomfortable) Um... yeah! Sure, sure I'm interested."
7354,KRAMER,38," George, you gonna buy a painting?"
7355,GEORGE,38," (gritting teeth) Yeah, sure."
7356,NINA,38, Are you an art-lover?
7357,GEORGE,38, I am an art-adorer! I adore art.
7358,NINA,38," Great! Well, take a look around. Pick out something you like."
7359,JERRY,38," May I? (pantomimes making a big ""X"" across the 
              painting)"
7360,NINA,38," (laughing) Get outta here! (beat) Here, play with this. (hands"
7361,JERRY,38, What's this?
7362,NINA,38, My father gave me four tickets to the Yankee game for Saturday
7363,JERRY,38," (sincerely disappointed) Oh, Saturday... I'm working, I'm 
              going"
7364,NINA,38," Oh, well. I'm not gonna go without you. Do you guys want 
              'em?"
7365,KRAMER,38, (immediately) Yeah.
7366,JERRY,38," They're right behind the dugout, George, first row!"
7367,GEORGE,38," Behind the dugout, are you kidding? How did you get them?"
7368,NINA,38," Oh, my father's the Yankees accountant... it's the owner's 
              box."
7369,GEORGE,38," All my life I've dreamed of sitting front row, behind the 
              dugout!"
7370,NINA,38," (gesturing towards a small, ugly painting George was apparently 
              look-"
7371,(CUT TO,38," Saturday, the game. George, Kramer, and Elaine are being 
              lead"
7372,GEORGE,38," Look at where we are! (referring to the seat usher) He's 
              not"
7373,USHER,38," No, no, these are your seats."
7374,GEORGE,38, She said first row! Right behind the dugout!
7375,ELAINE,38," Well, it's the second row. It's just as good."
7376,GEORGE,38," I was all primed for the first row; I was gonna put my 
              feet up"
7377,ELAINE,38," Would you shut up? These are great! You can't get any better 
              than"
7378,GEORGE,38," Oh, there's better, (pointing at the row in front of them) 
              right"
7379,KRAMER,38," Right. (Elaine giggles) Oh boy... okay, who wants a dog? 
              (Kramer"
7380,ELAINE,38, I could've been at my boss' son's bris right now.
7381,GEORGE,38, (amused) You're supposed to do that?
7382,ELAINE,38," (shrugs) Yeah. (beat) What makes you think anyone would 
              want to"
7383,GEORGE,38, I'd rather go to a hanging.
7384,ELAINE,38," Anyway, I called him back... I told him I had to go visit 
              my father"

7612,Jerry's stand-up,40," So, I fly a lot. I like planes. I was on a plane 
        the other day and I was wondering - are there keys to the plane? Do they 
        need keys to start the plane? Maybe that's what those delays on the ground 
        are sometimes. When you're just sitting there at the gate, maybe the pilot's 
        just up there in the cockpit going <mimics looking for keys> ""Oh, 
        I don't believe this. Oh my god...I did it again."" They tell you 
        it's something mechanical, because they don't want to come on the PA system...""Ladies 
        and gentlemen, we're going to be delayed here on the ground for a little 
        while, I uh...Oh God, this is so embarrassing...I - I left the keys to 
        the plane in my apartment."" You see the technicians all running underneath 
        the plane; you think they're servicing it, but they're actually looking 
        for the magnet ""hide-a-key"" under the wing...""maybe he 
        left it up there somewhere..."""

        comes out of his room. We hear his thoughts."

        require liquid? It's not like I'm running a marathon, I'm just lying there."
7615,JERRY's brain,40, What the hell...? Why is the door open?
7616,JERRY,40," Kramer, what are you doing here!?"
7617,KRAMER,40," Jerry, now calm down, it's okay. I'm sorry. I didn't want to 
        wake you up! Y'know, I was watching ""Thirty Seconds Over Tokyo,"" 
        and I - y'know, I wanted to get some popcorn, and I, uh...I used the spare 
        keys that you gave me to come into your apartment to get your popper."
7618,JERRY,40, You scared me!

7630,KRAMER,40," My drain's all clogged up! <Comes out of the bathroom in a 
        towel, covered in soap suds.>"
7631,JERRY (from inside the bathroom),40, Is that my towel?
7632,GIRLFRIEND,40, I'm really happy the movie was sold out.
7633,JERRY,40," Hey, did you ever pretend there's like, murderers chasing you, 
        and you try and see how fast you can get your keys out and get into your 
        apartment?"
7634,GIRLFRIEND,40," I'm from Witchita, so..."
7635,JERRY,40," Oh. I see. There he is! <Pretends the murderers are coming.> 
      "
7636,GIRLFRIEND,40," Hurry, Jerry! He's coming! Hurry!"
7637,JERRY,40, The murderers! <Jerry unlocks his door and they both run inside.>
7638,GIRLFRIEND,40, That was close!
7639,JERRY,40, Did you see the look on that guy's face?
7640,GIRLFRIEND,40," You were so fast with those keys. <They prepare 
        to kiss, but are interrupted by Kramer and his girlfriend coming out of 
        Jerry's bedroom, laughing and horsing around.>"
7641,JERRY,40, Kramer! What the hell are you doing here?!
7642,KRAMER,40," Hey, Jerry! How are ya? I thought you were going to the movies."
7643,JERRY,40," All right, that's it. Hand 'em over. "
7644,KRAMER,40, What?
7645,JERRY,40," What, you know what, the keys. I want the keys. You've lost your 
        key privileges. "
7646,KRAMER,40," Oh, come on!"
7647,JERRY,40," No, come on!"
7648,KRAMER,40," What, what, I thought you went to the movies!"
7649,JERRY,40, It was sold out!
7650,KRAMER,40, Now how was I supposed to know it was going to be sold out?
7651,JERRY,40, That's the point.
7652,KRAMER,40, What point?
7653,JERRY,40," Just, look, just give the keys."
7654,KRAMER,40, Just give me another chance!
7655,JERRY,40, Don't ask me!
7656,KRAMER,40, I'm asking you!
7657,JERRY,40, I'm telling you.
7658,KRAMER,40, You're joking.
7659,JERRY,40, I'm serious!
7660,KRAMER,40, It's not going to happen again!
7661,JERRY,40," Yes it will, now give me those keys!"
7662,KRAMER (getting up),40," O.K., fine, go ahead, you take the keys! But you're 
        going to regret this. <He angrily storms out. Kramer then re-enters 
        seconds later when he realizes he's left his girlfriend in Jerry's apartment.>"
7663,JERRY,40, So put 'em in a safe place.
7664,ELAINE,40, I will. 
7665,JERRY,40, Where?
7666,ELAINE,40," I don't know. I'll hide 'em. So, is Kramer upset?"
7667,JERRY,40," I think so. I mean, he's acting really weird lately...he's different."
7668,ELAINE,40," Well, maybe you should just give him the keys back."
7669,JERRY,40, I can't.
7670,ELAINE (mouths the words),40, Is that Kramer? <Jerry nods.>
7671,JERRY,40, Who's there?
7672,KRAMER (in hallway),40," Uh, Kramer. <Jerry opens the door, Kramer enters. 
        Elaine waves at Kramer with the keys in her hand.> Oh, hi...uh...you 
        got the..."
7673,ELAINE,40," Oh, I'm not, uh..."
7674,KRAMER,40," No, no, no, it's o.k. I don't care about the keys. It's my fault. 
        I gave the keys away with my stupidity. I broke ""the covenant of 
        the keys."""
7675,ELAINE,40," Jerry, give him the keys back."
7676,JERRY,40, Elaine...
7677,KRAMER,40," I don't want the keys back! No, I'm glad the way things turned 
        out. I was clingin' to those keys, man! Like a branch on the banks of 
        a raging river. And now I have let go. And I'm free...to go with the current. 
        To float. (To Jerry) And I thank you."
7678,JERRY,40, Take the keys.
7679,KRAMER,40," I don't want the keys! <Jerry tries to force the keys on Kramer, 
        but Kramer refuses.> "
7680,JERRY,40, O.K.!
7681,KRAMER,40," Now, one more thing - I would like my keys back."
7682,JERRY,40, Your spare set?
7683,KRAMER,40, That's right.
7684,JERRY,40, You want 'em back?
7685,KRAMER,40," Yeah. Yeah, I think it would be for the best."
7686,GEORGE,40," Gee, Kramer, I uh...I don't know what to say."
7687,KRAMER,40," Say yes! Yes, George. Yes!"
7688,GEORGE,40," Should I give you my keys, is that the transaction, trading keys...? 
        Because Elaine has my keys. "
7689,KRAMER,40," Well, you can get 'em back."
7690,GEORGE,40, I suppose I could.
7691,KRAMER,40," Because you see, George, having the keys to Jerry's apartment? 
        That kept me in a fantasy world. Every time I went over to his house, 
        it was like I was on vacation. Better food, better view, better TV. And 
        cleaner? Oh - much cleaner. That became my reality. I ignored the squalor 
        in my own life because I'm looking at life, you see, through Jerry's eyes. 
        I was living in twilight, George. Living in the shadows. Living in the 
        darkness...like you."
7692,GEORGE,40, Me?
7693,KRAMER,40," Oh, yeah. I can barely see you, George."
7694,GEORGE,40," Alright, stop it Kramer, you're freakin' me out. <The waitress 
        comes over.>"
7695,WAITRESS,40," Hi, are you ready to order? <George tries to order, but 
        Kramer interrupts.>"
7696,KRAMER (moves over and sits next to George),40, Do you ever yearn?
7697,GEORGE,40, Yearn? Do I yearn?
7698,KRAMER,40, I yearn. 
7699,GEORGE,40, You yearn. 
7700,KRAMER,40," Oh, yes. Yes, I yearn. Often, I...I sit...and yearn. Have you 
        yearned?"
7701,GEORGE,40," Well, not recently. I craved. I crave all the time, constant 
        craving...but I haven't yearned."
7702,KRAMER (in disgust),40, Look at you.
7703,GEORGE,40," Aw, Kramer, don't start..."
7704,KRAMER (moving back to the othe side of the booth),40," You're wasting your 
        life."
7705,GEORGE,40," I am not! What you call wasting, I call living! I'm living my 
        life!"
7706,KRAMER,40," O.K., like what? No, tell me! Do you have a job?"
7707,GEORGE,40, No.
7708,KRAMER,40, You got money?
7709,GEORGE,40, No.
7710,KRAMER,40, Do you have a woman?
7711,GEORGE,40, No.
7712,KRAMER,40, Do you have any prospects?
7713,GEORGE,40, No.
7714,KRAMER,40, You got anything on the horizon?
7715,GEORGE,40, Uh...no.
7716,KRAMER,40, Do you have any action at all?
7717,GEORGE,40, No.
7718,KRAMER,40," Do you have any conceivable reason for even getting up in the 
        morning?"
7719,GEORGE,40, I like to get the Daily News!
7720,KRAMER,40," George, it's time for us to grow up - and be men. Not little 
        boys."
7721,GEORGE,40, Why?
7722,KRAMER,40," I'm goin' to California. You know, I got the bug."
7723,GEORGE,40," Yeah, I think I got a touch of something, too."
7724,KRAMER,40," No, the acting bug. Ever since I was in that Woody Allen movie."
7725,GEORGE,40," ""These pretzels are making me thirsty""? That was one 
        line! You got fired!"
7726,KRAMER,40," I know, I know, but man! I never felt so alive! Now, are you 
        coming with me?"
7727,GEORGE,40," Uh, no, I'm not."
7728,KRAMER,40," Alright, suit yourself. But let's keep this between us - we're 
        key brothers now. <Gets up to leave.>"
7729,GEORGE,40," You're not really gonna go to California, are you?"
7730,KRAMER (points to his head),40," Up here, I'm already gone. <Kramer exits.>"
7731,GEORGE,40," Anyway, so he gave me his spare keys, now he wants to have my 
        keys, so I need mine back from you."
7732,ELAINE,40, Just 'cause you have his keys? Why does he need yours?
7733,GEORGE,40," I don't know. He said he wants to be my ""key brother."" 
      "
7734,ELAINE,40, That's ridiculous.
7735,GEORGE (shakes huge keyring),40, That's Kramer.
7736,ELAINE,40, I'll give you back your spare keys - but now I want mine back.
7737,GEORGE,40, What for?
7738,ELAINE,40, 'Cause. I'll give 'em to Jerry.
7739,GEORGE,40, Jerry? Why?
7740,ELAINE,40, 'Cause he gave me his.
7741,GEORGE,40, So what?
7742,ELAINE,40," So, if he has my keys, I should have his. "
7743,GEORGE,40," Well, I don't see why if you have his, he should have yours."
7744,ELAINE,40, I just said the same thing to you.
7745,GEORGE,40, What?
7746,ELAINE,40, What?
7747,GEORGE,40," Alright, listen, I'll give you your spare keys, but I don't have 
        them with me. Can I please have mine to give to back to Kramer?"
7748,ELAINE,40," Yeah, O.K. I'll go get 'em. <George begins to leaf through 
        papers on Elaine's counter.> What are you doing? Would you just put 
        that down? <Takes the papers away from George.> I gotta get some 
        new friends."
7749,JERRY,40, Did you bring the keys? 
7750,GEORGE,40," Yes, but I still don't feel right about letting you into Kramer's 
        apartment without his permission."
7751,JERRY,40, This could be an emergency!
7752,GEORGE,40, You never should have taken away his keys!
7753,JERRY,40," I tried to give 'em back, he wouldn't take 'em. <Jerry and 
        George go out into the hallway to Kramer's apartment.>"
7754,GEORGE,40, How'd the Mets do?
7755,JERRY,40, They lost.
7756,JERRY,40, Kramer? 
7757,NEWMAN (startling them),40," Hello, boys. "
7758,JERRY,40," Hello, Newman."
7759,NEWMAN,40, You lookin' for someone?
7760,JERRY,40," Don't play coy with me, Newman, I'm not in the mood!"
7761,NEWMAN,40, Coy? I'm not being coy.
7762,JERRY (to George),40, Is he being coy?
7763,GEORGE,40," Yeah, coy."
7764,JERRY,40," You're being coy. Now where's Kramer, Newman?"
7765,NEWMAN (coyly),40, Who?
7766,JERRY,40," Listen, Tiny. I wanna know where Kramer is and wanna know now!"
7767,NEWMAN,40," Alright, go ahead and hit me, Seinfeld. I got witnesses."
7768,JERRY,40," Turn around, George."
7769,GEORGE,40, Sure. <Turns around.>
7770,NEWMAN,40, George?
7771,JERRY,40," Now, you better tell me where Kramer is, or are we gonna have 
        to do this the hard way? <Hits wall with his fist.>"
7772,NEWMAN,40, Help! Help!
7773,JERRY,40, Where's Kramer?
7774,NEWMAN,40, HELP! <Elaine enters.>
7775,ELAINE,40, What's going on?
7776,NEWMAN,40, They're gonna beat me up!
7777,GEORGE,40, No we're not.
7778,JERRY,40, We're trying to find out what happened to Kramer.
7779,NEWMAN,40," You wanna know what happened to Kramer? I'll tell you what happened 
        to Kramer. He was ticked off. About the keys. Yeah, that's right - about 
        the keys. Thought he got a bad rap."
7780,JERRY,40, Bad rap?
7781,NEWMAN,40, Yeah. From you.
7782,JERRY,40, Me?
7783,NEWMAN,40," You heard me. So he packed it up and split for the coast. La-La 
        Land. L.A."
7784,JERRY,40, L.A.?
7785,JERRY,40," I never should have taken his keys away. But he drove me to it! 
        I had no choice! He wouldn't take 'em back. Elaine, you saw it, remember? 
        I said, 'Take the keys back.' He wouldn't do anything. You saw it, didn't 
        you see it?"
7786,ELAINE,40," Yeah, yeah, I saw it. <mutters under her breath> I mean, 
        it's complete bullsh*t."
7787,JERRY,40, Huh? 
7788,ELAINE,40, What...?
7789,JERRY,40," No, what'd you say?"
7790,ELAINE,40, Nothing. I didn't say anything.
7791,JERRY,40," Oh, you didn't see it."
7792,ELAINE,40," Yeah, I saw it. I saw it! I did, I saw it. Yep."
7793,JERRY,40," I heard you say something, there."
7794,ELAINE,40, I didn't say anything.
7795,JERRY,40," I'm calling Kramer's mother. <Picks up the phone, dials.> 
        (To Elaine) I don't know what you said. But it was something. I heard 
        something. Hello? Hello, Mrs. Kramer? Mrs. Kramer? Could you turn the 
        music down? Could you turn the music down!"
7796,GEORGE,40, Ask her about Kramer.
7797,JERRY,40, She's drunk out of her mind.
7798,JERRY (leaving a message on Elaine's machine),40," Elaine? Are you there? 
        It's me, I'm locked out of my apartment, I need my spare keys. Where are 
        you? I'm at the coffee shop."
7799,KRAMER (shouting over the cycle's engine),40, Hey! You ever been in an accident?
7800,BIKER,40," About five years ago. I was going down this very road. Same time 
        of day, going about the same speed I'm going now...there was a rock in 
        the road. Couldn't have been more than a pebble. Never really saw it! 
        Lost control of the bike, went flyin' about a hundred feet - came down 
        right on my head. Cracked it wide open! Blood and stuff was just splattered 
        all over the road, there...I broke every bone in my face. Hey, you know, 
        when they found me, my eyes were hanging out of their sockets? Yeah, they 
        pronounced me dead at the scene. I was in a coma for...well, they told 
        me about a year...said I'd be a vegetable for life. Yeah, but I showed 
        'em. Ever since then I always wear a helmet! <The biker goes into a 
        turn.> Lean! <Kramer yells.>"
7801,JERRY (applauding),40," Georgie Boy! Way to come through with the keys! Sit 
        down, I'm buying you dinner."
7802,GEORGE,40," Look, I gotta tell ya...I been thinkin' about it, I just don't 
        feel right about letting you into Elaine's apartment."
7803,JERRY,40, Don't feel right? What are you talking about? 
7804,GEORGE,40," Well, you know, I shouldn't have let you into Kramer's, now you 
        want to go into Elaine's...she entrusted me with her spare keys, how can 
        I just let you in?"
7805,JERRY,40, What is the big deal?
7806,GEORGE,40," Just because you have someone's spare keys, it doesn't entitle 
        you to break into their apartment. That's the reason you took away Kramer's 
        keys."
7807,JERRY,40," First of all, you're not even supposed to have Elaine's keys. 
        You're supposed to give 'em back to her, so she can give 'em back to me, 
        because she has mine. So technically, those are my keys."
7808,GEORGE,40," Yes, well, if you had never taken your keys back from Kramer, 
        he never would have taken his back from you and given 'em to me, in which 
        case I wouldn't have had to take mine back from her."
7809,JERRY,40," Well, I want those keys. <Tries to grab the keys from George.>"
7810,GEORGE,40," Nope, no can do."
7811,JERRY,40," George, give them to me, I want these keys. <They struggle 
        over the keys.> I don't want to get physical!"
7812,GEORGE,40, Do you wanna fight?
7813,JERRY,40, Do you wanna fight?
7814,GEORGE,40, I'll fight ya! Not the face! Not the face! <The struggle continues.>
7815,KRAMER,40," And then, the evil ogre took back the magical keys from the handsome 
        young prince."
7816,HIPPIE #1,40," Oh no. He didn't take back the keys, no way."
7817,KRAMER,40," Yes! And then the handsome young prince was cast out into the 
        cruel, cruel world."
7818,HIPPIE #1,40," Oh man, what a bummer. That ogre dude's pretty cold, huh?"
7819,KRAMER,40," Oh, he's cold."
7820,HIPPIE #1,40," Lemme tell you something, Kramer. If that ogre dude pulled 
        that crap on me <pulls out a knife> - I'D STAB HIM! I'D CUT HIM 

        IN HALF! I'D GUT HIM LIKE A FISH, MAN! That's what I'd do!"
7821,KRAMER,40," Yeah, yeah...that'd be funny. (To driver) Hey, you can drop me 
        here!"
7822,HIPPIE #1,40," Hey, what's the rush, man?"
7823,KRAMER,40," Well, you know, I gotta be goin' now."
7824,HIPPIE #1,40," Hey, Kramer - have you ever killed a man?"
7825,KRAMER,40," What do you think, junior? You think these hands have been soakin' 
        in Ivory liquid? <mimics choking somebody>"
7826,HIPPIE #2,40," Don't leave, Kramer, stay with us. You know so much about 
        the world, we need you, please Kramer! (they all start chanting) Please, 
        Kramer! Please, Kramer! <Scene ends with Kramer trying to escape their 
        clutches.>"
7827,JERRY,40," Don't you see? You're just avoiding the middle man. You were gonna 
        give her her spare keys, so she was gonna give 'em to me. So, all that's 
        happening is that instead of giving them to her, you're giving them to 
        me. It's just unfortunate that when she gave you yours, you didn't give 
        her hers. 'Cause then she would have given 'em to me, because she has 
        mine. So then I would have never had to ask you for hers, so that I could 
        get mine."
7828,GEORGE,40," You're right, how did I miss that? <Begins unlocking the door, 
        mutters under his breath> Maybe because it's a crock of sh*t."
7829,JERRY,40, What's that?
7830,GEORGE,40, Nothing.
7831,JERRY,40, I heard something.
7832,GEORGE,40, Didn't say anything. (They go into Elaine's apartment.)
7833,KRAMER,40," So, how long you been drivin' this thing?"
7834,WOMAN,40, Goin' on four years. 
7835,KRAMER,40," Well, nothin's sexier than a woman behind the wheel of a semi."
7836,WOMAN,40," Nothin'? (They exchange a glance, then laugh.) Listen to you, 
        you're quite the sweet-talker."
7837,KRAMER,40," You know, I always wanted to drive the big rigs. I used to watch 
        those commercials during the reruns of Gomer Pyle. "
7838,WOMAN,40, You want to give it a try?
7839,KRAMER,40, Really?
7840,WOMAN,40, Do you know how to double-clutch?
7841,KRAMER,40, Yeah.
7842,WOMAN,40," Well, come on! <They trade places and Kramer gets behind the 
        wheel. Kramer turns out to be really rusty on the ol' double-clutch.>"
7843,GEORGE,40," They were in here, I saw her put 'em in here!"
7844,JERRY,40," Well, this is great. "
7845,GEORGE,40," Well, what do they look like?"
7846,JERRY,40," They look like keys, George. They look exactly like keys. (In 
        disgust) ""What do they look like."""
7847,GEORGE,40," Well, they're obviously not here."
7848,JERRY,40," Well, they've gotta be here somewhere."
7849,GEORGE,40," Jerry, unless I pull down on this statuette and a hidden wall 
        opens up, we have checked every square inch of this apartment!"
7850,JERRY (looking through some papers on the desk),40," What is this? ""Murphy 
        Brown""? "
7851,GEORGE,40, What?
7852,JERRY,40, By Elaine Benes?
7853,GEORGE,40, What?
7854,JERRY,40," Elaine's writing a ""Murphy Brown""?"
7855,GEORGE,40, Lemme see this. (Tries to grab the papers.)
7856,JERRY,40, Wait a second! (They fight over the paper.)
7857,GEORGE,40, Gimme half!
7858,JERRY,40," All right, here! "
7859,GEORGE,40, Why didn't she tell us?
7860,JERRY (making fun),40," Elaine is writing a sitcom...! <Elaine enters 
        the room behind Jerry and George. Jerry spots her and tosses his half 
        of the script at George. George throws it back and paper goes flying everywhere.>"
7861,ELAINE,40, You weasels!
7862,JERRY,40, What? What?
7863,ELAINE,40, How dare you!
7864,GEORGE,40, We hardly read anything!
7865,JERRY,40, It was funny!
7866,ELAINE,40," Who gave you permission to come into my house and just go through 
        all my things? You thought it was funny?"
7867,JERRY,40, Well... <picks up some of the pages> From what I saw...
7868,ELAINE (grabs the papers from Jerry),40," Well, it's just a first draft!"
7869,JERRY,40," I was locked out of my apartment, I'm just trying to get my keys."
7870,ELAINE (turning on George),40, Why did you let him in?! <Shoves George.>
7871,GEORGE,40, He forced me to!
7872,JERRY,40, I did not!
7873,GEORGE,40, Yes you did!
7874,ELAINE,40, You! Get out! Get out! Get out!
7875,JERRY,40," Elaine, wait! I need my spare keys!"
7876,ELAINE,40," Here! Here's your damn keys, you keep 'em! I don't want 'em anymore!"
7877,JERRY,40, Good!
7878,ELAINE (to George),40, And I want my keys back from you!
7879,GEORGE,40," What, you don't want me to hold your keys?"
7880,ELAINE,40," No, you can't be trusted!"
7881,GEORGE,40," Alright, alright, fine. <Gives the keys to Elaine.>"
7882,JERRY (to Elaine),40, And I don't want you to hold mine!
7883,ELAINE,40, Good! I won't!
7884,JERRY,40, Good! Don't! Are these my keys?
7885,ELAINE,40, These aren't my keys!
7886,GEORGE,40, Whose are these?
7887,ELAINE,40, I don't know!
7888,ELAINE,40, I just thought I could write it.
7889,JERRY,40, Is that something you want to do?
7890,ELAINE,40, I don't know. Those writers make a lot of money.
7891,JERRY,40," Elaine, let me tell you something about show business. It's hard 
        work! You don't just write a ""Murphy Brown."" You gotta watch 
        the show, study it, get a sense of the characters, how they relate to 
        each other."
7892,ELAINE,40," O.K., can I just watch the show? <mutters under her breath> 
        God, what an asshole."
7893,JERRY,40, What did you say?
7894,ELAINE,40, I didn't say anything.
7895,JERRY,40," I heard something. <Looks at the TV> Elaine, Elaine! It's 
        Kramer! Kramer's on ""Murphy Brown""!"
7896,ELAINE (laughing),40," Kramer's on ""Murphy Brown""!"
7897,JERRY,40," Look, there he is, he's sittin' at the desk!"
7898,CANDICE BERGEN,40," Hi, I'm Murphy Brown, you must be my new secretary."
7899,KRAMER,40," Oh, good morning, Miss Brown."
7900,CANDICE BERGEN,40, And you are...?
7901,KRAMER,40," Oh, I'm uh, Steven Snell."
7902,CANDICE BERGEN,40," Snell. Well, hello, Mr. Snell."
7903,KRAMER,40, Steven.
7904,CANDICE BERGEN,40, Steven. Are you familiar with this computer system?
7905,KRAMER,40, Oh - I'm familiar with it.
7906,CANDICE BERGEN,40," Steven Snell? I know people...and I have a very good 
        feeling about you. <exits.>"

7914,Jerry (going through couch cushions),44, Where the hell did I put this?
7915,Kramer,44, What are you looking for?
7916,Jerry,44," The remote, the remote, I can't find the remote. Did I lost, I 
        lost it. Did you take it? Did you put it some place?"
7917,Kramer,44," No, no, no."
7918,Jerry,44," All right, what is this?"
7919,Kramer (clueless),44, what is what?
7920,Jerry,44," All right, very funny. I get it."
7921,Kramer,44, You're in a weird mood.
7922,Jerry,44, Come on. Go back to your apartment and fix it.
7923,Kramer,44, Fix what?
7924,Jerry,44, Your pants!
7925,Kramer,44, what is this? What have I got one pant leg on for?
7926,Jerry,44," Don't you know? Look-look at your face! You only shaved the right 
        side of your face! What is this? A joke?"
7927,Kramer,44," No, t's a joke.. a joke... a joke... you think this is funny?"
7928,Jerry,44, Go look at your face in the mirror.
7929,Kramer,44, Wha-huh-wha-huh...
7930,Jerry (pressing intercom),44, yeah?
7931,George (on intercom),44, It's George.
7932,Jerry,44, Come on up.
7933,Kramer,44, I don't believe this.
7934,Jerry,44," You mean, you didn't know you were doing any of these things?"
7935,Kramer,44," No, I swear."
7936,Jerry,44," I bet this is from that kick from that crazy Joe Davola. You better 
        see a doctor and get some X-rays."
7937,George (to Kramer),44, Ah! You're just the man I'm looking for.
7938,Kramer,44, Me?
7939,George,44," Yeah, here you go."
7940,Kramer,44, What's this?
7941,George,44, A dry-cleaning bill?
7942,Jerry,44, From that woman at NBC?
7943,George,44, Yeah.
7944,Kramer,44, A dry-cleaning bill for what?
7945,George,44, For vomiting on her vest!
7946,Kramer,44," Oh, come on George! I didn't do that on purpose!"
7947,George,44," Well, I shouldn't have to pay for it!"
7948,Kramer,44," Well, neither should I! Jerry's the one who left the milk in 
        the refrigerator."
7949,George (to Jerry),44," Yeah, your milk."
7950,Jerry (pointing Kramer),44, He drank it.
7951,Kramer,44, I didn't know.
7952,Jerry,44," All right, well, we should all chip in I guess."
7953,Kramer,44, Yeah.
7954,Jerry,44, How much was it to clean the vest?
7955,George,44, Eighteen dollars.
7956,Jerry,44, Can you get vomit out of suede?
7957,George,44, I don't know.
7958,Kramer,44, Yo-yo Ma!
7959,Jerry,44, What? Yo-yo Ma?
7960,Kramer,44, What about him?
7961,Jerry,44, You just said 'Yo-yo Ma'.
7962,George,44, What's Yo-yo Ma?
7963,Jerry,44, He's a cellist. (to Kramer) You should see a doctor today.
7964,George,44," All right, come on, come on, let's go. Six dollars."
7965,Jerry,44, I can't believe she sent you that dry-cleaning bill.
7966,George,44, I know!
7967,Jerry,44," That doesn't really bode well for the show, does it?"
7968,George,44," The show! Forget about the show! We should take the idea to a 
        different network"
7969,Jerry,44," Oh, yeah. Right. Like anybody's ever gonna do this! How did you 
        get me to go along with that? A show about nothing!"
7970,George,44," It was a good idea. Susan liked it. Now, if he hadn't vomitted 
        all over her, we'd be writing it right now."
7971,Kramer,44, Jeez!
7972,George,44, Anyway.
7973,Jerry (interrupts),44," What are you doing? What's wrong with you? What're 
        you doing? Give me that phone! Go to your apartment and lie down, I'll 
        make an appointment for a doctor today."
7974,George,44, What?
7975,Jerry,44, NBC! They wanna have another meeting about the idea.
7976,George,44," They wanna have another meeting? They wanna buy it?! They wanna 
        but it?! Oh! I tell you! We're gonna be rich!! What are we gonna get for 
        this? Fifty, sixty thousand?"
7977,Jerry,44, I don't know about sixty.
7978,George,44," Oh, it's gotta be fifty! Hee hee! You know how much Ted Danson 
        makes, huh?"
7979,Jerry,44," Ted Danson! Now, how are you comparing us to Ted Danson?"
7980,George,44, I didn't say 'We're Ted Danson.'
7981,Jerry,44," Yes, you did. You said 'We're Ted Danson'!"
7982,George,44, Oh!
7983,Jerry,44," You know, I think he wears a piece."
7984,George,44," Yeah, don't worry. He can afford it."
7985,Jerry,44," I'm ten minutes slow again! That's it for this piece of junk! 
        I've had it. "
7986,George,44," What, is that the one your parents gave you?"
7987,Jerry,44," Yeah! But it never works. You know we're supposed to be there 
        by two o'clock. We should take a cab."
7988,George,44," All right, we'll be a little late, I,m not taking a cab."
7989,Jerry,44, I'll pay for it.
7990,George,44, It's not the money!
7991,Jerry,44," Well, what is it you object to? The comfort? The Speed? The convenience?"
7992,Leo,44, Jerry!
7993,Jerry,44, Uncle Leo!
7994,Leo,44, Helloooo!
7995,Jerry,44," Hello there, how're you doing?"
7996,Leo,44, Ha ha! How are you?
7997,Jerry,44," Good, good."
7998,Leo,44, How's your mom and dad?
7999,Jerry,44," Good, fine."
8000,Leo,44," What are you getting to be too much of a big shot now to give me 
        a call? I don't hear from you anymore!"
8001,Jerry,44," Oh, no. I've been kinda busy. It's all."
8002,Leo,44, You know where I just came from?
8003,Jerry (not enthousiastic at all),44," Oh, sure. Danny."
8004,Leo,44," He used to be in the pajama business. I used to be able to get pajamas 
        for free. I used to come over and get pajamas all the time!"
8005,Jerry,44," Oh, yeah, yeah. I remember."
8006,Jerry (interrupts),44," I-I'm sorry Uncle Leo, I really gotta get going."
8007,Leo,44," Oh. Well. You gotta get going, so go."
8008,Jerry,44," We, we got a big meeting with the president of NBC."
8009,Leo,44, Nobody got a gun to your head!
8010,Jerry (seems sincere),44," Yeah, I'm really sorry, uh."
8011,Leo,44," Go. Really. I understand. You got an appointment, go to your appointment."
8012,Jerry,44," I'm sorry, really."
8013,Leo,44," You know, I know plenty of people in Hollywood too!"
8014,Jerry,44," Sorry, really."
8015,Kramer (from inside),44, Yeah?
8016,Newman,44," Come on, are you ready? Let's go!"
8017,Kramer,44, For what?
8018,Newman,44," What's the matter with you? I just talked to you fifteen minutes 
        ago."
8019,Kramer,44, what about?
8020,Newman,44," The courthouse. You gotta go with me to the courthouse. I'm contesting 
        a ticket today."
8021,Kramer,44," I can't, I'm going to the doctor's later."
8022,Newman,44," You gotta go with me. I mean, you-you're my alibi. You have to 
        take the stand."
8023,Kramer,44," Well, I can't!"
8024,Newman,44," Well, let me remind you of something. You wouldn't be here if 
        it wasn't for me and my helmet. I saved your life! You would be dead! 
        Dead! You would cease to exist! You would be gone for the rest of eternity! 
        You wouldn't even begin to comprehend what that means!!"
8025,Kramer,44, Shut up! I'll get my coat!
8026,Jerry,44," You see the look on my uncle's face? Did you see how insulted 
        he was? What could I do? Waht are we supposed to do? You can't leave. 
        There's no excuse good enough to justify walking away from a conversation 
        with one of my relatives."
8027,George,44, I didn't shave this morning. I don't feel like myself.
8028,George,44, Look at this.
8029,Jerry,44, Why didn't you shave this morning?
8030,George,44, 'Cause I shaved yesterday in the afternoon.
8031,Jerry,44, Why?
8032,George,44, Because of the day before. It's a long story. 
8033,Jerry,44, Is that Joe Davola?
8034,George,44, It's not him!
8035,Jerry,44, I can't live tlike this. I'm being stalked.
8036,Receptionist,44, Mister Seinfeld? They're ready for you.
8037,Jerry,44, Oh.
8038,George,44, Mister Seinfeld? What about Mister Costanza? I'm not here?
8039,Jerry,44," All right. Look. Now, you promised you're gonna be a little more 
        flexible on the nothing idea, okay? Jsut a little."
8040,George,44, Okay. A little.
8041,Newman,44," Okay, you're all set? You got your story?"
8042,Kramer,44, No.
8043,Newman,44," When the cop stopped me, I told him that I was rushing home because 
        my friend was about to commit suicide."
8044,Kramer,44, Uhm...
8045,Newman,44," Now, you're that firend. Now, all we need is a reason why you 
        were going to commit suicide."
8046,Kramer,44, I never had an air conditioner.
8047,Newman,44, No! That's no reason to kill yourself!
8048,Kramer,44," Why? It gets hot at night, you can't sleep. You ever tried to 
        sleep in a really hot room?"
8049,Newman,44," Every night I sleep in a really hot room, I don't want to kill 
        myself."
8050,Kramer,44," Well, I slept in really hot rooms and I wanted to kill myself."
8051,Newman,44," No, no, no. That's not gonna work. Something else."
8052,Kramer,44, I was never able to become a banker.
8053,Newman,44," Banker! So you're killing yourself because your dreams of becoming 
        a banker have gone unfulfilled. You-you-you-you can't live without being 
        a banker."
8054,Kramer,44," Yeah, yeah. If I can't be banker, I don't wanna live."
8055,Newman,44, You must be banker.
8056,Kramer,44, MUST be banker.
8057,Newman (satisfied),44," Okay, we'll go with the banker story."
8058,George,44," The story is the foundation of all entertainment. You must have 
        a good story otherwise it's just masturbation."
8059,Russel,44, And people really have to care about the characters.
8060,George,44," Care? Forget about care. Love. They have to love the characters. 
        Otherwise, why would they keep tuning in?"
8061,Jerry,44, Wouldn't tune in.
8062,George,44, Would they tune in?
8063,Jerry,44, No tune.
8064,Russel,44," We like to look at the show as if it were in EKG. You have your 
        highs and your lows and it goes up and down."
8065,George,44, The show will be like a heart attack!
8066,Jerry,44, Just a huge massive coronary.
8067,Russel,44," So what you said last week about no story, you're a little flexible 
        on that now."
8068,George,44," Is-is that what I said 'no story'? Because Jerry had to tell 
        me later."
8069,Jerry,44, He couldn't believe it.
8070,Police officer,44," Well, I informed him that he was exceeding the speed 
        limit and uh, that's when he told me that he was racing home because his 
        friend was about to commit suicide."
8071,Judge,44, And then what happened?
8072,Russel,44," Look. I don't know how you two guys feel but we would really 
        like to be in business with you."
8073,George,44," Well, we would like to be in business. Let's do business. We'll 
        have some business. Let's have business."
8074,Jerry,44," We would love to be in business. We'll do business. We're in business. 
        It's... it's business. This is business."
8075,George,44, Yeah!
8076,Stu,44, Would it be possible to get a-a-a copy of 'La Cocina'?
8077,Jerry,44, Your off-Broadway play.
8078,George,44," Oh, oh. Uh, you know. It's the damndest thing. I, uh, I moved 
        recently and my files, pfff, disappeared. Now, I-I don't know if they 
        fell off the truck or if there was some sort of foul play but let me tell 
        you something. I'm not through with that moving company."
8079,Jerry (backs his story),44," Hmm, hmm."
8080,George,44, That's my vow to you.
8081,Russel,44," Well, I got a feeling about you two. And even more than that. 
        I place a great deal of confidence in that lady's judgment. "
8082,George,44, Oh! That's good judgment. That's a pile of judgment there. Sure.
8083,Jerry,44," Oh! Taht's judgment. Yes, yes. Judgment with earrings on. Yeah."
8084,Russel (gets up),44," So, let's make a pilot."
8085,Newman,44," I had gone up to Westchester. I go there every Tuesday. I do 
        charity for the blind in my spare time for the Lighthouse. I was in the 
        middle of a game of Parcheesi with an old blind man and I excused myself 
        to call my friend as he was very depressed lately because he never became 
        a banker."
8086,Judge,44, I don't understand.
8087,Newman,44," You see, it'd been his lifelong dream to be a banker and he uh, 
        just the day before he was turned down by another bank. I believe it was 
        the Manufacturer's Hanover on Lexington and 40th Street. That was the 
        third bank to turn him down so I was-I was a little concerned. I wanted 
        to see how he was doing. Well, Your Honor, he was barely audible. But 
        I distinctly recall him say..."
8088,Kramer (interupts involuntarily),44, Yo-yo Ma!
8089,Newman,44," So I sped home to save my friend's life and I was stopped for 
        speeding. Yes, I admit I was speeding but it was to save a man's life. 
        A close friend. An innocent person who wanted nothing more out of life 
        than to love, to be loved and to be a banker."
8090,Judge,44, So then he didn't kill himself.
8091,Newman,44," No sir. He did not. But only by thge grace of God. He's in the 
        courtroom today"
8092,George,44, See?
8093,Jerry,44, Yeah!
8094,George,44," I told you, I told you! Ha ha ha! Ooh ooh!"
8095,Jerry,44," Now, all we gotta do is write it."
8096,George,44, Yes! How're we gonna do that?
8097,Susan,44, Hey! Congratulations!
8098,Jerry,44, Thanks.
8099,George,44," Oh, thank you."
8100,Jerry,44," Thank you, thanks."
8101,George,44," Thanks. Gee, you know, I thought you were mad at me."
8102,Susan,44, No.
8103,Receptionist,44," Mister Seinfeld, you have a phone call."
8104,Jerry,44, Phone call? Who knows I'm here?
8105,George,44," When you sent me the-the bill for the dry-cleaning. I thought 
        the show didn't have a chance."
8106,Susan,44," Oh, it was only vomit."
8107,George,44," Anyway, I-I would like to-to pay for the cleaning."
8108,George,44," No-no-no, we all chipped in. We have the money."
8109,Susan,44," Well, it was eighteen dollars."
8110,George,44," Okay, uh, eighteen dollars, and there it is. There you go. So 
        maybe we could get together this weekend."
8111,Susan,44, Yeah. Call me.
8112,George,44," All right, great."
8113,Susan,44, Bye.
8114,Jerry,44, Bye thanks.
8115,George (chuckles),44," Bye, thanks. (To Jerry, when Susan is far) I can't 
        believe she took the money."
8116,Jerry,44, Why?
8117,George,44, I offered to pay. She should've said no.
8118,Jerry,44," She did, you insisted."
8119,George,44," Maybe this is what the pilot should be about, vomiting on somebody's 
        vest."
8120,Jerry,44, Nah!
8121,George,44," How much are we gonna get for this? Fifty, sixty thousand?"
8122,Jerry,44," oh, I d-I don't know. I d---"
8123,George,44," Oh, gotta get fifty. Gotta get fifty. All right, I tell you what. 
        We go to the coffee shop, you call your manager. Maybe they made an offer."
8124,Jerry,44, Okay.
8125,"George (excited, pushing Jerry forward)",44," All right, let's go, let's go, 
        let's go, come on."
8126,George,44, Thirteen thousand?
8127,Jerry,44, Thirteen thousand.
8128,George,44, a piece?
8129,Jerry,44," No, for both!"
8130,George,44," That's insulting! Ted Danson makes eight hundred thousand dollars 
        an episode."
8131,Jerry,44," Oh, would you stop with the Ted Danson?"
8132,George,44," Well, he does."
8133,Jerry,44, You're nuts!
8134,George,44," I'm sorry. I can't live knowing Ted Danson makes that much more 
        than me. Who is he?"
8135,Jerry,44, He's somebody.
8136,George,44, What about me?
8137,Jerry,44, You're nobody.
8138,George,44, Why him? Why not me?
8139,Jerry,44," He's good, you're not."
8140,George,44, I'm better than him.
8141,Jerry,44," You're worse, much much worse. (crouches in booth) That's Davola!"
8142,George (crouches too),44, What? Where? Where?
8143,Jerry,44, Outside! I saw him outside!
8144,Elaine,44, what is it?
8145,Boyfriend,44," Oh, it's this patient."
8146,Elaine (sighing),44, Again?
8147,Boyfriend,44," I'm fairly certain. I forgot to leave him an extra prescription 
        for his medication."
8148,Elaine,44," Well, so, he can live without his Valium for a couple of days."
8149,Boyfriend,44," Nah, you don't understand. He could be dangerous."
8150,Jerry,44, Go outside and see if he's still there.
8151,George,44," I can't go out there, he knows we're friends."
8152,Jerry,44," Well, what are we supposed to do? I gotta take Kramer to the doctor."
8153,George,44, Tell the cop.
8154,Jerry,44, Good idea.
8155,Cop,44," Yeah, all right. Just let me get a muffin."
8156,Jerry,44, Thanks.
8157,Jerry (back in booth),44," He's gonna get a muffin and then he'll walk us 
        outside. This is a great way to go through life. "
8158,George,44, I thought you said he was gonna get a muffin.
8159,Jerry (bossy),44, What are you doing?
8160,Cop,44, What?
8161,Jerry,44," What, are you ordering food now?"
8162,Cop,44," Yeah! Yeah, I decided to get a sandwich."
8163,Jerry,44, What happened to the muffin?
8164,Cop,44, I got a little hungry.
8165,Jerry,44, All of a sudden you get hungry?
8166,Cop,44, Yeah! You got a problem with that?
8167,Jerry,44, No! Enjoy your lunch.
8168,(to George),44, He's getting a sandwich now!
8169,George,44, I thought he was just gonna have a muffin.
8170,Jerry,44, All of a sudden he gets hungry.
8171,George,44," You know, a muffin can be very filling."
8172,Jerry,44, I know!
8173,Newman (interrogating Kramer],44," Mister Kramer, you heard the testimony 
        so far. Would you please tell the court in your own words what happened 
        on the afternoon of September 10th?"
8174,Kramer,44, What do you mean 'my own words'? Whose words are they gonna be?
8175,Newman,44, You know what I mean.
8176,Kramer (to Judge),44, I was very upset that day.
8177,Newman,44, And why was that?
8178,Kramer (to Newman),44, Would you let me say it? Let me talk!
8179,Newman,44," All right, all right. Go ahead, go ahead."
8180,Kramer,44, All right.
8181,Newman,44, Okay.
8182,Kramer (to Judge),44," I was very upset that day because I could never become 
        a banker."
8183,Newman,44," And that failure to become a banker was eating at you. Eating-eating-eating 
        at you inside."
8184,Kramer (not convincing),44," Uh, yeah."
8185,Newman,44," It was your family that pushed you into banking , it was their 
        dream for you..."
8186,Judge,44, Mister Newman.
8187,Newman,44," Your Honor, I'm only trying to establish Mister Kramer's fragile 
        emotional state, my entire case depends on it."
8188,Judge,44," Uh, continue."
8189,Newman,44," As you were saying, Mister Kramer..."
8190,Kramer,44, What was the question?
8191,Newman,44, You're telling how your parents pushed you into banking.
8192,Newman,44," But you never became a banker, did you Mister Kramer? Why? Why 
        did you fail?"
8193,Kramer,44, I don't know.
8194,Newman,44," It was because you hated your father and you would do anything 
        to displease him. Isn't THAT true?"
8195,Judge,44," Uh, could you get to the speeding?"
8196,Newman,44," Yuh, yes. I intend to Your Honor. And then, on the afternoon 
        of September 10th, you received a phone call did you not?"
8197,Kramer (puzzled),44, Phone call?
8198,Newman,44," Yes, a phone call!"
8199,Kramer,44, From who?
8200,Newman,44, From me!
8201,Kramer,44, From you?
8202,Newman,44," Yes, from me!! I called you remember?"
8203,Kramer,44, You called me?
8204,Newman,44," Yes, I called you, you idiot! Because you were going to... You 
        were going to... Remember?"
8205,Kramer,44, what?
8206,Newman,44, You were going to...
8207,Judge,44, I'm afraid I'm gonna have to call a---
8208,Newman,44," Yes, the banker!!!"
8209,Kramer,44, What banking?
8210,Newman,44," A banker! A banker! Your Honor, Your Honor, Your Honor..."
8211,Judge,44, That's enough already.
8212,Newman,44," Your Honor, Mister Kramer's obviously very distraught."
8213,Kramer,44, I'm distraught!?! Wooh-wooh-hoo!
8214,Newman (to Kramer),44, You shut up!
8215,(to judge),44," I demand a recess so I can take him outside and help him 
        regain hius composure."
8216,Judge,44, That'll be seventy-five dollars.
8217,Newman (Strangling Kramer),44," What's the matter with you? We had it all 
        worked out!"
8218,*Jerry,44, Do you see him?
8219,George,44, I'm not* sure.
8220,Jerry,44," Well, either you see him or you don't."
8221,George,44, All right. I don't.
8222,Jerry (looking at the cop),44," What is he doing? Is he getting coffee? I 
        think he's getting coffee.!"
8223,George,44, What's with this guy?
8224,Jerry (still bossy),44, Did you just order coffee?
8225,Cop,44, Yeah.
8226,Jerry,44, This is really too much.
8227,Cop,44, What is your problem?
8228,Jerry,44," Well, I'm sitting over there waiting for you to finish your sandwich 
        for twenty minutes. Now you're drinking coffee, that's gonna be another 
        ten minutes."
8229,Cop,44," Well, you're just gonna have to wait."
8230,Kramer,44, Never said anything about the banking.
8231,Newman,44, You're off your rocker.
8232,Jerry,44, Hey you guys!
8233,Kramer,44, Hey!
8234,Jerry,44, What are you doing here?
8235,Kramer,44, What are YOU doing here?
8236,Jerry,44," Hey, is Davola outside?"
8237,Kramer,44, Davola?
8238,Jerry,44, Yeah.
8239,Kramer,44," No, I didn't see him."
8240,Newman,44, Crazy Joe Davola?
8241,George (reading the tabs),44," Jerry, yours is eleven dollars."
8242,Jerry,44, Eleven dollars for what?
8243,George,44," Muffin, sandwich and coffee!"
8244,Jerry (to Kramer),44," Hey, NBC okayed our idea. We're gonna make the pilot."
8245,Kramer,44," You're gonna do the circus freak show, uh?"
8246,Jerry,44, No.
8247,Newman,44," Pilot? So what do you make for something like that? Fifty? Sixty 
        thousand?"
8248,George,44, What's the difference? The money is not important.
8249,Jerry (looking outside),44," Hey Newman, is that your red car?"
8250,Newman,44, Yeah.
8251,Jerry,44, I think you're getting a ticket.
8252,Newman,44, Deh!
8253,Kramer,44," Run, run! Go, go, go!"
8254,Newman,44," Hey! What are you doing? It's after six o'clock! You can't give 
        me a ticket! Hey, you're not gonna get away with this. I'll fight this. 
        I got witnesses."
8255,Kramer,44, I saw the whole thing!
8256,Jerry,44, Maybe this whole thing would be a good idea for the pilot.
8257,George,44," Ah, get outta here. The vomiting is much funnier."
8258,Jerry,44," Oh, like you know what you're talking about!"
8259,George,44," No, YOU do!"
8260,Written by,45, Larry David 
8261,Directed by,45, Tom Cherones 
8262,JERRY,45," George and I went up to NBC and we told them our idea for a series 
        now we're just waiting to sign the contract."
8263,HELEN,45, And they liked your idea?
8264,JERRY,45, Yeah.
8265,MORTY,45, What'ya got leather seats here? 
8266,HELEN,45, Since when is George a writer?
8267,JERRY,45, What writer? It's a sitcom. 
8268,HELEN,45, That's exciting. When are you going to sign the contract?
8269,JERRY,45," Soon, there's a couple of problems."
8270,MORTY,45," Jerry, I wanna tell you that meal was the worst."
8271,JERRY,45, What do you expect? It's airline food. 
8272,MORTY,45, . . . give you fish.
8273,JERRY,45, How could you eat fish on a plane?
8274,MORTY,45," because she puts up such a big stink every time I have a piece 
        of meat."
8275,HELEN,45, What kind of problems?
8276,JERRY,45," Well, George doesn't think $13,000 is enough money."
8277,HELEN,45, What? He's not even working.
8278,MORTY,45," George is right. Those people will try to get away with murder. 
        Believe me. They're all crooks. "
8279,HELEN,45," Jerry, I want you to sign that contract. "
8280,JERRY,45," We're going to sign it. We're going to sign it. In fact George 
        is out with the woman from NBC right now. "
8281,GEORGE,45," So, I'm uh, I'm afraid we're going to have to pass."
8282,SUSAN,45, You're passing?
8283,GEORGE,45," Well, it's . . . much too low. "
8284,SUSAN,45, Are you and Jerry in complete agreement on this?
8285,GEORGE,45," Ah, yeah, . . . I believe I can speak for the both of us on this."
8286,SUSAN,45," Because you know, because this is your first show this is a pretty 
        standard deal."
8287,GEORGE,45, Standard? 
8288,SUSAN,45, Yeah. 
8289,GEORGE,45, Is Ted Danson's deal standard? 
8290,SUSAN,45, Ted Danson?
8291,GEORGE,45," You know, the guy from Cheers."
8292,SUSAN,45," Yeah, I know who he is. (laughs) You're not Ted Danson."
8293,GEORGE,45, I didn't say I was Ted Danson.
8294,SUSAN,45," All right, I'll tell Russell tomorrow."
8295,GEORGE,45, - 
8296,SUSAN,45," Oh, uh, before I forget, . . . cigars. A present from my father. 
      "
8297,GEORGE,45," Oh, uh, do I have to write him a note or something? "
8298,SUSAN,45," Yeah, I am sure he'd appreciated that."
8299,GEORGE,45, But what do I say in the note?
8300,SUSAN,45," Ah, you're a writer. You'll think of something. "
8301,GEORGE,45," Oh, uh, yeah, I'm a writer, (laughs)"
8302,HELEN,45, Were you waiting long at the gate?
8303,JERRY,45, I don't even know?
8304,HELEN,45, Where's that watch we bought you?
8305,JERRY,45, Oh uh 
8306,JERRY,45," That's enough with this piece of junk I've had it. (throws watch 
        in garbage)"
8307,GEORGE,45, That's the one your parents bought you?
8308,JERRY,45," Yeah, but it never worked."
8309,JERRY,45, . . . it's being fixed. 
8310,MORTY,45," I got a guarantee on that watch. Give it to me, I'll take it back 
        to where I got it. "
8311,JERRY,45, It's at the jeweler.
8312,MORTY,45, You send me the bill.
8313,JERRY,45, I'm not sending you the bill. 
8314,HELEN,45, That watch was a gift. You shouldn't have to pay for it.
8315,GSUSAN,45," That's uh, $18.50."
8316,MORTY,45," Here, I got it."
8317,JERRY,45, What are you talking about? It's my car. You can pay for the gas.
8318,MORTY,45," No, no put it away . . . "
8319,JERRY,45, Dad!
8320,MORTY,45, Stop it.
8321,JERRY,45, I have money. I make money.
8322,MORTY,45," Yeah, yeah, you make money."
8323,JERRY,45, You don't think I make money. That's what you think isn't it?
8324,HELEN,45," No, I dont think that."
8325,JERRY,45, Yes you do. That's what you both think. 
8326,MORTY,45, I'll pay.
8327,JERRY,45, I'm paying. 
8328,MORTY,45, Get out of here.
8329,JERRY,45, You're not paying 
8330,MORTY,45," Jerry please,"
8331,JERRY,45, You're not doing this. 
8332,JERRY,45," Boy, you got a lot of stuff here. . . . Dad, what are you doing?"
8333,MORTY,45, Nothing nothing.
8334,JERRY,45, Leave it. What about your back? 
8335,HELEN,45," Morty, what are you doing?"
8336,MORTY,45," All right, all right."
8337,JERRY,45," You come all the way up here to see a back specialist and you're 
        lifting heavy suit cases."
8338,KRAMER,45," Hey, Morty."
8339,MORTY,45," Hey, Mr. Kramer."
8340,KRAMER,45," Hey, Mrs. Seinfeld."
8341,HELEN,45, What guy?
8342,KRAMER,45, Crazy Joe Devola. 
8343,HELEN,45, Why?
8344,KRAMER,45," Well, I was having this party and I didn't invite him and Jerry 
        tipped him off. "
8345,JERRY,45," Why did you tell this crazy guy that Kramer didn't invite him 
        to his party? "
8346,JERRY,45, I didn't know he wasn't invited
8347,MORTY,45," Hey, these are very comfortable pants. You know what I paid for 
        these Jerry?"
8348,HELEN,45, So why did you say anything?
8349,JERRY,45, It was a mistake.
8350,MORTY,45, They're good around the house and they're good for outside.
8351,HELEN,45, Are you okay?
8352,KRAMER,45," Oh, yeah, yeah. I was a little off last week - but the doctor 
        says it was just a slight concussion "
8353,HELEN,45, So what's the matter with this Devola guy?
8354,JERRY,45, He's got like a chemical imbalance. He needs to be on medication.
8355,KRAMER,45," Oh, yeah. He's after Jerry now. "
8356,JERRY,45, Kramer!!
8357,HELEN,45, He's what?!
8358,JERRY,45, He's joking.
8359,HELEN,45, He's after you? 
8360,JERRY,45, Nooo.
8361,HELEN,45, Why is he after you?
8362,JERRY,45, He's not after me. 
8363,HELEN,45," Morty, did you here this? Some crazy guy is after Jerry."
8364,HELEN,45, I'll make a few phone calls.
8365,JERRY,45, Who are you going to call?
8366,MORTY,45, What are you worried about?
8367,HELEN,45, I want to know what you did to this guy that he's after you.
8368,JERRY,45, I didn't do anything.
8369,HELEN,45, Well you must have done something.
8370,JERRY,45," No, he just doesn't like me."
8371,HELEN,45, Doesn't like you? How can anyone not like you? 
8372,JERRY,45," You know, it seems impossible."
8373,HELEN,45, Doesn't like you? How can that be?
8374,JERRY,45," Ma, I know this may be hard for you to understand but I am sure 
        there are many people who do not like me."
8375,HELEN,45," Huh, Jerry, don't say that."
8376,JERRY,45, It's true.
8377,HELEN,45," No, it's not true. You're a wonderful, wonderful boy. Everybody 
        likes you. It's impossible not to like you. Impossible. Morty?"
8378,MORTY,45, Maybe some people don't like him. I could see that.
8379,HELEN,45, Kramer?
8380,KRAMER,45," Yeah, I like him. Hey Jerry, what time you got?"
8381,JERRY,45," Um, huh, I don't have my watch on. It's being fixed."
8382,KRAMER,45, When you getting it back?
8383,JERRY,45," Uh, next week."
8384,KRAMER,45, Next week? How come it's taking so long? 
8385,JERRY,45, Huh?
8386,KRAMER,45, I said how come it's taking so long? 
8387,JERRY,45, I don't know. They're backed up.
8388,KRAMER,45," wait a minute, wait a minute, where did you take it? "
8389,JERRY,45, Where'd I take it?
8390,KRAMER,45, Yeah. 
8391,JERRY,45," Where did I take it? Where Did I Take It? (stabbing with knife) 
        Um, to that place on, uh Columbus and uh, 85th. Okay?"
8392,KRAMER,45, Jimmy Sherman's?
8393,JERRY,45, Yeah.
8394,KRAMER,45," Yeah, I know the guy. I take my stuff in there all the time. 
        Yeah, I bet I can get your watch back by tomorrow morning."
8395,JERRY,45," No, Kramer, I don't want you to say anything to him"
8396,KRAMER,45, I'd be happy to.
8397,JERRY,45, He's a friend of mine.
8398,JERRY,45," I'd like to follow the regular procedures. I don't want any special 
        treatment."
8399,KRAMER,45," Hey, I'm going to get that watch back for you by tomorrow, buddy."
8400,MORTY,45, Give me the receipt.
8401,KRAMER,45, I'll get that too. (exits)
8402,JERRY,45, Be right back. (follows Kramer out)
8403,JERRY,45," . . . I threw it in the garbage can on the street. It didn't keep 
        good time. My parents gave it to me so don't mention it again, okay! "
8404,KRAMER,45, All right.
8405,JERRY,45, All right.
8406,KRAMER,45," Wait, wait , . . . "
8407,HELEN,45, What was that about? 
8408,KRAMER,45," Oh, oh, uh, he's got my Calamine lotion and uh, I told him not 
        to return it. If he needs it he should keep it. He's got uh, he's got 
        a thing on his ankle."
8409,HELEN,45, How can anyone not like him. 
8410,MORTY,45," Hi, Morty Seinfeld. I have a two o'clock appointment."
8411,RECEPTIONIST,45," Yes, Mr. Seinfeld. Would you please fill in this form(?)."
8412,MORTY,45, All this? This whole thing? It's going to take me forty-five minutes.
8413,RECEPTIONIST,45, I know. It's very long.
8414,MORTY,45," Look at this. It's a book. Employer's address. What do they need 
        this? You know I never had a back problem until that night I slept on 
        the convertible sofa. My back was fine."
8415,HELEN,45," Well, it's not the sofa."
8416,MORTY,45, You stick up for that sofa like I'm criticizing a person. 
8417,HELEN,45, We got it at Sullivan's. It's a good store.
8418,MORTY,45," One day somebody's going to sleep on that thing and we'll get 
        sued. I hope this doctor knows what he's doing. "
8419,HELEN,45, Leo says he's the best there is.
8420,MORTY,45," Leo, I'm listening to Leo now!"
8421,HELEN,45," You're lucky he was able to get you this appointment. You know 
        what the waiting list is for this guy? "
8422,MORTY,45," Well, if he fixes my back I'll be happy. . . . (back to the form) 
        Have you ever had a sexually transmitted disease? That's IT! . . . Here, 
        you got my name, you got my address. That's enough."
8423,RECEPTIONIST,45," Julie, you want to take him back?"
8424,JERRY,45, You what? You passed? How could you do that?
8425,GEORGE,45," Jerry, my young friend, you are so nave. You are so so nave. 
        You know about a few things. You know about comedy, a little bit about 
        relationships, some baseball, but you are so far out of your element here, 
        you are embarrassing yourself. Now listen to me. I am negotiating. Negotiation, 
        this is what you do in business. "
8426,JERRY,45," Let me explain to you what you just did. There are literally hundreds 
        of people trying to get pilot deals with them this year. They go with 
        maybe, five. Okay, if we pass, they go to the next show. "
8427,GEORGE,45," Ooooo, I'm scared. . . . Ooooo they're not going to do the show. 
      "
8428,JERRY,45," We're lucky they are even interested in the idea in the first 
        place. We got a show about nothing. With no story. What do you think, 
        they're up there going, maybe we should give those two guys, who have 
        no experience and no idea, more money! "
8429,GEORGE,45, Oooo what are we going to do? I'm shaking! I'm shaking!
8430,JERRY,45," Well, I think you're wrong."
8431,GEORGE,45," Well, we'll just see."
8432,JERRY,45, Yes we will. 
8433,GEORGE,45, Yes we will.
8434,JERRY,45, I just said that.
8435,GEORGE,45, I know you did.
8436,JERRY,45, So good for you.
8437,GEORGE,45, So good for you.
8438,JERRY,45, We'll you're repeating everything I'm saying?
8439,GEORGE,45, We'll you're repeating everything I'm saying?
8440,JERRY,45, Well George is an idiot.
8441,GEORGE,45," Well George,,. . . ."
8442,MORTY,45," All right, all right, Let's go already. They keep you in here 
        a year. They don't give a damn. I could die in here. . . . Excuse me! 
        Excuse me! What's going on? I'm here twenty minutes. Could somebody please 
        help me. "
8443,HELEN,45, (enters) Shhh. Quiet! Everyone can hear you.
8444,MORTY,45, Twenty minutes. I've been waiting twenty minutes. 
8445,HELEN,45, Well the doctor must be busy.
8446,MORTY,45," Well what do they make appointments for if they can't keep them. 
        uh, look if I did that in my business I wouldn't have made a nickel ."
8447,NURSE,45," Hello, Mr. Seinfeld."
8448,MORTY,45, I thought you forgot about me.
8449,NURSE,45, We didn't forget.
8450,MORTY,45," Ah! It's Velcro. I can't stand Velcro. It's that t-e-a-r-I-n-g 
        sound. I used to be in raincoats. I refused to put that in any of my lines. 
      "
8451,NURSE,45," Okay, Mr. Seinfeld, please come this way. We need some X-rays. 
      "
8452,MORTY,45, Leave all my stuff here?
8453,NURSE,45, Leave it.
8454,GEORGE,45," Okay, by the way. Do you want a box of Cuban cigars? I smoked 
        one last night. I got nauseous."
8455,JERRY,45, No I don't want them.
8456,KRAMER,45," I'll take it. No, I'll take it. What is it?"
8457,GEORGE,45, Here you go. 
8458,KRAMER,45, A box of cigars?
8459,GEORGE,45," Yep, "
8460,KRAMER,45," Oh, yeah?"
8461,GEORGE,45, The kind that Castro smokes. You can't buy them anywhere.
8462,KRAMER,45, Castro eh? Pasto costillo homiga (nonsense Spanish) 
8463,JERRY,45, Yes?
8464,Voice,45, Federal Express.
8465,JERRY,45," Federal Express? Come on up. . . . Federal Express. I'm not expecting 
        a package. "
8466,KRAMER,45," Wooo, you know what you just did? You let a burglar into the 
        building. "
8467,JERRY,45, You think so?
8468,KRAMER,45," Federal Express? Of course. It's the oldest trick in the book. 
        You know it might not be a burglar it might be a murderer."
8469,JERRY,45, So you want us to abolish all home package deliveries.
8470,KRAMER,45, Yes. It's dangerous. 
8471,JERRY,45, Who is it?
8472,Voice,45, Federal Express.
8473,KRAMER,45," Okay, . . . "
8474,ALL,45, Hiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii!
8475,ELAINE,45," Kramer, Hi, I thought you went to California."
8476,KRAMER,45, I came back for you.
8477,ELAINE,45," Oh, shut up (pushes Kramer)"
8478,JERRY,45, I missed you.
8479,KRAMER,45, I'm going to be right back. I'm going to get a match.
8480,ELAINE,45, Who's suitcase is this?
8481,JERRY,45," Oh, it's my parents. My father came up to see a back specialist. 
      "
8482,ELAINE,45," Oh, golly, it's probably from sleeping on that sofa."
8483,GEORGE,45," Boy, you look really great."
8484,JERRY,45, Yeah.
8485,ELAINE,45, You lie. 
8486,GEORGE,45," No, no you really look great."
8487,ELAINE,45," Hu hu, ha."
8488,JERRY,45, So tell us about the trip. How's Dr. Reston?
8489,ELAINE,45," Oh, he's fine."
8490,JERRY,45, Things are good?
8491,ELAINE,45," Yeah, you know (scratches cheek)"
8492,JERRY,45, Uh oh. 
8493,ELAINE,45," What, Uh ih?"
8494,JERRY,45, Did you see that?
8495,GEORGE,45," Yeah, I saw it."
8496,ELAINE,45, What?
8497,JERRY,45, It's a tell. You gotta tell.
8498,ELAINE,45, What tell? What's a tell?
8499,JERRY,45," When you ask someone about their relationship and they touch their 
        face you know it's not going too well. Go ahead ask me how it's going 
        with somebody."
8500,ELAINE,45," Um, uh, who's it going with, uh, Alice?"
8501,JERRY,45," Good, going good (scratches chin) And the higher up on the face 
        you go the worse the relationship is getting. You know it is like - pretty 
        good - not bad - I gotta get out."
8502,ELAINE,45, How high did I go?
8503,GEORGE,45, You almost did the nose.
8504,JERRY,45," What are you eating my peanut butter out of the jar with your 
        disgusting index fingers? This is a sickening display."
8505,GEORGE,45, I'm not eating bread now. I'm off bread.
8506,JERRY,45, You're off bread. . . . So what happened is it over?
8507,ELAINE,45, Well not quite. 
8508,JERRY,45, Why not?
8509,ELAINE,45," He was my psychiatrist, you know. He knows all my patterns. In 
        my relationships I always try to find some reason to leave, so as my doctor, 
        he can't allow me to do this, so he's not letting me leave."
8510,GEORGE,45," What do you mean - ""Not letting you?"""
8511,ELAINE,45," He has this power over me, okay. He has this way of manipulating 
        every little word I say. He's like a Svenjolly."
8512,GEORGE,45, Svengali.
8513,ELAINE,45, What did I say?
8514,JERRY,45, Svenjolly.
8515,ELAINE,45, Svenjolly? I did not say Svenjolly.
8516,JERRY,45, George?
8517,GEORGE,45, Svenjolly.
8518,ELAINE,45, I don't see how I could have said Svenjolly.
8519,JERRY,45, So maybe he's got like a cheerful mental hold on you.
8520,KRAMER,45, You know I can't find a match anywhere.
8521,GEORGE,45," You know what you should do? You should tell this guy you're 
        seeing somebody else. That's the easiest way to get out of these things."
8522,ELAINE,45," No, it's not going to work with this guy."
8523,GEORGE,45," Well, you just tell him an old boyfriend has come back into your 
        life."
8524,ELAINE,45, I don't think so.
8525,JERRY,45, Nice try.
8526,GEORGE,45, Took a shot.
8527,KRAMER,45," This is a good cigar (hair is on fire) . . . WOOOOOOOOOOW . . 
        . (runs to bathroom)"
8528,MORTY,45," (checking pants) They stole my wallet. The bum stole my wallet. 
        MY WALLET'S GONE! "
8529,DR. DEMBROW,45,"Mr. Seinfeld, I'm Dr. Devro"
8530,MORTY,45," I'm not interested in the X-Rays. I want my money back. Somebody 
        stole my wallet. I had $225 in there."
8531,DR. DEMBROW,45," Why, I don't see how something like that could have happened."
8532,MORTY,45," Oh, you don't see. You don't see. Well it happened. Believe me."
8533,HELEN,45, (enters) What's going on?
8534,MORTY,45, They stole my wallet.
8535,HELEN,45, What?
8536,MORTY,45, While I was in getting X-Rayed.
8537,DR. DEMBROW,45," All right, Mr. Seinfeld, I am sorry about your wallet but 
        would you like me to look over these X-Rays?"
8538,MORTY,45, What kind of clip joint are you running here? 
8539,DR. DEMBROW,45," All right, fine. (leaves)"
8540,HELEN,45, The least you could have done was hear your diagnosis.
8541,MORTY,45, I am not interested in his diagnosis. He's a bum.
8542,HELEN,45, You came all the way from Florida to see him. 
8543,MORTY,45," I want to know what kind of an office this is where you can't 
        leave your pants in the room. You tell me."
8544,ELAINE,45, I am sorry but there's somebody else.
8545,DR. RESTON ,45," Huh, huh."
8546,ELAINE,45," Well it's nothing I planned on happeniong, you knoe. It just 
        kind of happened. "
8547,DR. RESTON ,45, Tell me about him.
8548,ELAINE,45," Well, there's not really much to tell, you know, he's just a 
        guy. Really."
8549,DR. RESTON ,45," Yes, I assumed he was a guy. And you've known him how long?"
8550,ELAINE,45," . . . Years. Years, um, we've been close friends and then recently 
        something you know just happened. "
8551,DR. RESTON ,45,You mean sexually? 
8552,ELAINE,45," Yeah, yeah. Sexu-ally."
8553,ELAINE,45," Well, I was just telling you about this other guy. "
8554,DR. RESTON ,45," Elaine, do you remember your dream where you have a sexual 
        encounter with a Chinese woman?"
8555,ELAINE,45," Yeah. Yeah, (cough, cough) ha um."
8556,DR. RESTON ,45,"Elaine, I'm concerned about you."
8557,ELAINE,45," Oh, don't concern yourself with me, because I'm good. I'm very 
        good, I mean I'm really very very good. "
8558,DR. RESTON ,45, Elaine. Have you been urinating a lot again?
8559,ELAINE,45, . . . no.
8560,DR. RESTON ,45," And how often have you been seeing, . . .? I'm sorry what 
        is his name?"
8561,ELAINE,45," Um, what's the difference?"
8562,DR. RESTON ,45, Are you afraid to tell me his name? 
8563,ELAINE,45," No, no, I just don't see how that's relevant. "
8564,DR. RESTON ,45, It doesn't matter if you don't see how. I see how.
8565,ELAINE,45," Uh, his name, uh, Idon't even know, all right you want to know 
        his name? I'll tell you his name. His name is . . . Kramer."
8566,DR. RESTON ,45, Kramer. Is that his first name or his last name?
8567,ELAINE,45," Oh, I'm really uncomfortable talking about this. "
8568,DR. RESTON ,45," Elaine, I want you to do me a favor. "
8569,ELAINE,45," What?
"
8570,DR. RESTON ,45,"I want you to tell this young man to give me a call. It is 
        very important that I speak to him. "
8571,ELAINE,45," Oh, no, no no no, I can't do that."
8572,DR. RESTON ,45,You can do it and you will do it.
8573,ELAINE,45," No, I can't. "
8574,DR. RESTON ,45,You can and you will. 
8575,ELAINE,45," Okay, okay. I'll have Kramer give you a call."
8576,JERRY,45, So you didn't even let the doctor treat you?
8577,MORTY,45, I wouldn't give him the satiusfaction. 
8578,HELEN,45, Why did you leave your wallet in your pants?
8579,MORTY,45," What are you talking about? What was I supposed to hide it somewhere? 
      "
8580,HELEN,45, Well. You could have taken it with you.
8581,MORTY,45," Oh, yeah, I'd be lying on the X-Ray table with my wallet in my 
        mouth."
8582,LEO,45," Hello, ,hello."
8583,JERRY,45, Hi Uncle Leo.
8584,LEO,45," I just talked to Dr. Denvro's son. He said they almost had to call 
        the police. "
8585,MORTY,45," What are you talking about? I'm the one who should have called 
        the police. They stole my wallet. "
8586,LEO,45," You know how hard it was for me to get thjat appointment for you? 
        You can't just walk in on this guy. He did me a personal favor. "
8587,MORTY,45," All right, Leo. "
8588,LEO,45, You walked out without paying. 
8589,MORTY,45, How was I supposed to pay? I didn't have my wallet. 
8590,LEO,45," Well, I hope you sent him a check."
8591,MORTY,45," That's the second time you said ""personal favor"". Why 
        do you keep saying that?"
8592,LEO,45, I said it once.
8593,MORTY,45," Twice! And Dembrowdoesn't even know you. His son happens to live 
        on your floor. "
8594,HELEN,45," Leo, where did you get that watch? "
8595,LEO,45," You know where I got this? (flashback) I found it in the garbage 
        can. It kept terrible time. I brought it over to Jimmy Sherman right here 
        on 85th and Columbus. Gave it to me back the next day. Works 
        great. What kind of idiot throws a way a perfectly good watch?"
8596,HELEN,45, Doesn't that watch look like the one we gave Jerry. 
8597,JERRY,45," Hey, where's the waiter. Dad, what say we have some red meat tonight. 
        Let's live a . .  "
8598,JERRY,45, Can we continue this another time.

8602,JERRY,47, Well this is it.
8603,P,47, This is nice. Thanks again for the Chinese food.
8604,JERRY,47," Oh, you're welcome. You know I think I ate too much of that 
              garlic. "
8605,P,47," Yeah, me too,"
8606,JERRY,47," No, I ate the whole plate. I didn't know those little things 
              were garlic."
8607,P,47," Laughs - ha ha ha (obnoxious laugh). Oh, you know what? I think 
              Naked "
8608,JERRY,47," No, I mean, I don't think so."
8609,P,47," I thought you liked to laugh. I thought you uwere happy go lucky. 
            "
8610,JERRY,47," No, nah, I'm not happy and I'm not lucky, and I don't go. 
              If anything"
8611,N,47, ha ha ha ha ha ha ha

              foe the week end. "
8614,JERRY,47, This thing has never worked right. 
8615,N,47, You think I laugh like Elmer Fudd sitting on a juicer? 
8616,JERRY,47," Well, first of all Elmer Fudd is one of the most beloved 
              internationally known cartoon characters of "
8617,JERRY,47, How could you leave a mesage like that on my machine.?
8618,GEORGE,47, Well how could you just play your message in front of anybody?
8619,JERRY,47, Because I didn't think anyone would leave it!
8620,GEORGE,47," Well, I didn't think anyone would play it."
8621,JERRY,47," Well, now she's not going away for this weekend."
8622,GEORGE,47," What do you mean not goin'? We got plans here. Call her 
              up."
8623,JERRY,47," Well, it's better anyway. I mean really. What was going 
              to happen? I'm a comedian. How can I go out with a "
8624,GEORGE,47, Well maybe you should ask Elaine. 
8625,JERRY,47," Yeah but if I ask Elaine, Kramer will feel slighted. "
8626,GEORGE,47," Oh no no, don't say anything to Kramer. Susan can't stand 
              him. He vomited all over her. "
8627,JERRY,47," Yeah, .. wait a minute do you smell smoke? "
8628,JERRY,47," Ah, Kramer."
8629,KRAMER,47," Hello boys, top of the morning to ya. What do you say?

8630,JERRY,47," Will you put that thing out before you start another fire.

8631,KRAMER,47," So, what are you guys doin this weekend?"
8632,KRAMER,47," Because I'm going to e playing golf at the Westchester 
              country club. Hum."

8634,KRAMER,47," Oh, that's right buddy. It's private. It's very private. 
              But I met the pro at the golf shop up on 49th St. "
8635,KRAMER,47," Man, I'm going to be hitting the links all weekend. foooo"

8643,JERRY,47, They sell them by the side of the road.
8644,ELAINE,47, I don't know. 
8645,JERRY,47," Come on. I don't want to tag along with George and Susan. 
              If you're there it will be a better group."
8646,ELAINE,47, What's that? 
8647,JERRY,47," Ah, it's an autographed picture for my dry cleaner. I don't 
              know what to write on these things."
8648,ELAINE,47," ""I'm very imPRESSED""? ... Ah you mean pressed

8662,MEL,47," Yes, a bubble!"
8663,MEL,47, Do you mind? May I?
8664,ELAINE,47," Oh, sure."
8665,MEL,47," Ah, It'd break your heart seein' him in there. It's like a 
              prisoner. No friends - just his mother and me. "
8666,,47, <in tears> 
8667,MEL,47," Excuse me, I "

8671,MEL,47, No. He can see through the bubble. It's plastic. 
8672,JERRY,47," Oh, I thought it was like an igloo."
8673,MEL,47," No, it's clear."
8674,JERRY,47, Ah ha.
8675,ELAINE,47, Who has the remote?
8676,MEL,47, He does. 
8677,ELAINE,47, The remote goes through the bubble? 
8678,MEL,47," Yeah, he's in the bubble with the remote."
8679,JERRY,47, So you have no control over the remote? 
8680,MEL,47," No, it's frustrating. "
8681,ELAINE,47," Yeah, of course, yeah."
8682,MEL,47," So anyway, you're his favourite comedian. he laughed so hard 
              the other night we had to give him an extra shot "
8683,JERRY,47, That's nice! 
8684,MEL,47," Tomorrow is his birthday and it would mean so much to him 
              if you could find it in your heart ta' pay him a visit"
8685,JERRY,47," Hu, well, tomorrow, I, ..."

8696,SUSAN,47," So, what kind of a bubble? Like an igloo?"
8697,JERRY,47," No, that's what I thought but apparently it's just a big 
              piece of plastic dividing the room. "
8698,SUSAN,47," Oh, "
8699,GEORGE,47," What kind of plastic do you think it is? What do you think 
              like that dry cleaning plastic?"
8700,JERRY,47," That's no good. He wouldn't last ten minutes in there. anyway 
              what can I do I promised I'd go visit him tomorrow."

8707,JERRY,47," Oh, great. Ok we'll goin' away. I think I'm excited."
8708,SUSAN,47," I'm excited. Oh, you're going to love this cabin. My grandfather 
              built it in 1947. It's it's incredible. "
8709,GEORGE,47," All right there you go. It's a '47 cabin all right. So, 
              we'll see you tomorrow."
8710,JERRY,47," OK, "
8711,KRAMER,47," Well, "
8712,KRAMER,47," Well, I'm off to the links. "
8713,KRAMER,47," Listen, I want to thank you for the invite up state. I'm 
              sorry I can't make it. "
8714,SUSAN,47, The what? 
8715,GEORGE,47," Nothing, uh lets get going. Come on."
8716,SUSAN,47, Did you..
8717,GEORGE,47," No, no, we'll talk about it later."
8718,SUSAN,47, Is that one of the cigars my father gave you? 
8719,ELAINE,47," hey, what's with George and Susan? Does he actually like 
              her?"
8720,JERRY,47," Ah, I don't know if he likes her as much as he likes it. 
            "
8721,ELAINE,47," Oh, that's nice!"
8722,JERRY,47, What's he doing? What is his hurry?
8723,ELAINE,47," Well you know George. It's not enough to get there. you 
              gotta make good time. "
8724,JERRY,47," I know he once went from West 81st Street to Kennedy Airport 
              in 25 minutes. "
8725,GEORGE,47, Would you stop that please. Would you just stop that? 
8726,SUSAN,47, Why?
8727,GEORGE,47," ... just sit in your seat over there you're distracting 
              me. We're making incredible time here. "
8728,JERRY,47," What's he doing? Is he out of his mind? Do you see him? 
              I don't even think I see him anymore. Where is he? "
8729,ELAINE,47, Isn't that blue car him? 
8730,JERRY,47," No, no that's not him. What happened to him? I can't believe 
              it. I lost him. That stupid idiot."
8731,ELAINE,47," It's no big deal Jerry. We'll just meet him at the bubble 
              boy's house. "
8732,JERRY,47," I don't even know where the bubble boy lives. I don't even 
              remember the name of the town. "
8733,ELAINE,47," Wa',you don't have the directions? "
8734,JERRY,47," No, I was following him."
8735,ELAINE,47, How could you not take the directions? 
8736,JERRY,47," Because, HE'S my directions. "
8737,SUSAN,47, I didn't see them George.
8738,JERRY,47," we make all these plans - he goes a hundred miles an hour 
              - the whole weekend's over - incredible - just like that - "
8739,ELAINE,47," Poor little bubble boy. He's sitting there waiting for 
              you in his bubble, or igloo thing or whatever."
8740,JERRY,47, I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO. I DON'T KNOW WHERE I AM 
8741,ELAINE,47," Just get off at this exit. We'll figure somethin' out. 
            "
8742,SUSAN,47, We lost them. Do you KNOW THAT. WE LOST THEM! 
8743,GEORGE,47," It's not my fault. Seinfeld can't drive. How hard is it 
              to follow somebody? "
8744,SUSAN,47, Well now what are you going to do? 
8745,GEORGE,47," It's fine, we'll just meet him at the bubble boy's house. 
            "
8746,SUSAN,47, Does he have the address? 
8747,JERRY,47," (answering machine) Leave a message. I'll call you back. 
              Thanks."
8748,N,47," (on phone speaker) Hi, Jerry it's Naomi, Listen, if its not 
              too late I've changed my mind, I'd like to go to the cabin"
8749,KRAMER,47," Wait, wai, ... ... Yeah. Hello!, Hi, Aw, this is Kramer. 
              Yeah, I'm the next door neighbour. Aw, well you know, "
8750,KRAMER,47," So then I drive all the way up to the country club and 
              then I find out they got a tournament goin' on. Do you mind"
8751,N,47, No.
8752,KRAMER,47," These are Cubans. <IN FAKE SPANISH> Maria, poquendo 
              los scientos de estes con gleam."
8753,N,47, ha ha ha ha ha ha 
8754,GEORGE,47," I don't know of this is the house. I don't see Jerry's 
              car anywhere. "
8755,GEORGE,47," Stop, would you quit it."
8756,GEORGE,47, Maybe someone is going to see us here.
8757,SUSAN,47, So what? You are SUCH a prude.
8758,GEORGE,47," Hey, I am not a prude sweetheart. I swing with the best 
              of them. "
8759,SUSAN,47, Come on lets go in. 
8760,GEORGE,47, What?
8761,SUSAN,47," Well we should at least tell them what happened. They might 
              be very late if they make it at all. "
8762,GEORGE,47, I can't go in there. I can't face the bubble boy. 
8763,SUSAN,47, What's the matter?
8764,SUSAN,47, We're goin' in. Come on. 
8765,GEORGE,47," Susan, please... <grabs her>"
8766,SUSAN,47, George. Stop.
8767,GEORGE,47," Would you wai,.."
8768,JERRY,47," <ranting> Can't believe how a little thing like George 
              going too fast - how my whole weekend is gone - the plans,"
8769,ELAINE,47, Your whole weekend? What about the bubble boy? 
8770,JERRY,47," Why do you keep bringing up the bubble boy. You don't have 
              to mention the BB? You don't have to mention the BB."
8771,JERRY,47, I'll have a cup of coffee and a turkey club. 
8772,WAITRESS,47, How about you? 
8773,ELAINE,47, I'll just have a glass of water. 
8774,JERRY,47, (whispers) You can't just have water. 
8775,ELAINE,47, Why not? That's all I want.
8776,JERRY,47," Well this is not like a park bench where you just come in 
              and sit down. It's a business. "
8777,WAITRESS,47, Hold it a second. Don't you play on TV? 
8778,JERRY,47," Oh, no."
8779,ELAINE,47, YES! yes. You saw him on TV.

8785,WAITRESS,47," Oh, ha ha"
8786,JERRY,47," Uh, I don't have anymore pictures Elaine. "
8787,ELAINE,47," He's lying. They're in the trunk <takes car keys > 
              Now you get to sign another one. "
8788,JERRY,47, I'm not lying. 
8789,ELAINE,47," Yeah, he is. <as she leaves>"
8790,JERRY,47, She'll have a cup of copy and a broiled chicken. 
8791,Mrs. Sanger,47," You see it's not really a bubble. A lot of people 
              think it's an igloo. But it's really just a plastic"
8792,GEORGE,47," Can you uh, go in the bubble?"
8793,Mrs. SANGER,47," Well, you have to put so many things on because of 
              the germs."
8794,MEL,47," The gloves, the mask, it's a whole production. "
8795,GEORGE,47, So then he makes his own bed?
8796,Mrs. SANGER,47," well, that's one of the things we fight about. "
8797,MEL,47, Would you like to meet him?
8798,GEORGE,47," Uh, well, you know,..."
8799,Mrs. SANGER,47," He loves games. Maybe you could play Trivial Pursuit 
              with him."
8800,DONALD,47," HEY MA WHAT THE HELL DO I GOT TO DO TO GET SOME FOOD AROUND 
              HERE? I'M STARVIN'. AND IF IT'S PEANUT BUTTER,"

8920,JERRY,48, She hasn't told her father yet?
8921,GEORGE,48, No. We're supposed to tell him tonight.
8922,JERRY,48," ""We're""? What do you mean, ""We're""?"
8923,GEORGE,48, Susan wants me to be there.
8924,JERRY,48, You're meetin' the father for the first time?
8925,GEORGE,48, (Reluctantly) Yeah.
8926,JERRY,48," (Chuckles slightly) Well, you'll make quite an impression 
              on him when you tell him how you burned his cabin down."
8927,GEORGE,48, I didn't burn it down - Kramer did!
8928,GEORGE,48," Yeah, I know what happened."
8929,GEORGE,48, (Getting frustrated) I know.
8930,JERRY,48," (Continuing) ..Who, who proceeds to burn the man's cabin 
              down with one of those very same cigars! (Topping off his observation) 
              It's very comical.."
8931,GEORGE,48," Listen, maybe we shouldn't start writing today. I got a 
              lot on my mind."
8932,JERRY,48," (Persisting) No, no, we put this off long enough. Today's 
              the day."
8933,GEORGE,48," (Letting his conscious get the best of him) I wonder how 
              Susan's father's going to react to this. Alright, what- what's the 
              worst he could do? So you burn"
8934,JERRY,48," (Agreeing) C'mon. It's not even a house - it's, like, a 
              cabin."
8935,GEORGE,48, We could build a cabin like (Snaps) that.
8936,JERRY,48," (Blunt) Well, maybe not us, but two men could."
8937,GEORGE,48," (Looking over the writing materials they just bought) Bics? 
              What, d'ja get, bics?"
8938,JERRY,48," What, you got a problem with the pen now?"
8939,GEORGE,48," Well, I like a rolling writer. They're very smooth."

8947,GEORGE,48, Weren't you supposed to call Elaine?
8948,JERRY,48," (Eagerly reaching for the phone) Yes. (George turns the 
              TV on, and begins watching as Jerry dials the number) Hi, is Elaine 
              there? Oh, uh, Hi, Sandra. Uh,"
8949,ELAINE,48," Yeah, I'll come by after work. Hey, I got a rubber pencil

8955,ELAINE,48," Could you do me a favor? Um, when my friends call, could 
              you not talk to them for too long?"
8956,SANDRA,48, Why? Did Jerry say something?
8957,ELAINE,48," No, no."
8958,SANDRA,48, He must have said something.
8959,ELAINE,48," Oh, no, he didn't say anything."
8960,SANDRA,48," (Near tears) I can't work for you! I can't. I'm leaving. 
              (Exits quickly)"
8961,ELAINE,48," (Calling out to Sandra) No, Sandra. I'm sorry, I'm sorry! 
              I really am! Listen, listen, Jerry's under a lot of pressure right 
              now. It's very hard being a"
8962,GEORGE,48," Alright, let's go."
8963,JERRY,48, Here we go.
8964,KRAMER,48, Hey.
8965,GEORGE,48," yeah, Kramer, we're, uh, kind of in the middle of something 
              here. We're trying to do a little work.."
8966,JERRY,48," Yeah, come on. (Kramer gives out a frustrated sigh) What's 
              with you?"
8967,KRAMER,48, (Complaining) No more golf.
8968,JERRY,48, Why?
8969,KRAMER,48," Well, you remember I told you about the pro, you know, 
              at the Westchester Country Club, who's letting me play a round every 
              time I give him a couple"
8970,JERRY,48, Yeah.
8971,KRAMER,48," (Angered) Yeah, well, I lost them all in the fire! (Leaning 
              over the couch, he addresses George) Hey, George, maybe you can 
              ask Susan's father for"
8972,GEORGE,48," What are you, Crazy? I can't ask the guy for more cigars 
              after you burned down his cabin!"
8973,KRAMER,48, Why? What's one thing got to do with another?
8974,GEORGE,48," Kramer, please."
8975,KRAMER,48," Well, I can't go back to the public courses, now. I can't! 
              I won't. I mean, you know what that's like? It's crowded, the grass 
              has big brown patches in it,"
8976,GEORGE,48," Kramer, I can't help you. You're gonna have to get them 
              some place else."
8977,KRAMER,48, (Opening the door) Where? They're Cubans. (Leaves)
8978,GEORGE,48, (Getting up) You know what? Maybe I should take off.
8979,JERRY,48, What?!
8980,GEORGE,48," Well, you know, I gotta go to, uh, Susan's parent's house 
              for dinner.. and, you know, I want to shower first.. and I want 
              to leave myself plenty of time."
8981,JERRY,48," (Looking at his watch) You got four hours! What about the 
              script?"
8982,GEORGE,48, I think we got a bite on it. (Exits)
8983,[Setting,48, The Ross' house]
8984,MRS. ROSS,48," (To Mr. Ross) Doesn't George look like your sister, 
              Sarah?"
8985,MR. ROSS,48, (Gruff) A slight resemblance.
8986,MRS. ROSS,48," (To George) Her son's a podiatrist, you know."
8987,GEORGE,48," Ohh, I have tremendous respect for people who work with 
              feet. I mean, to dedicate yourself to the foot - you're toiling 
              in virtual anonymity. I mean.."
8988,MR. ROSS,48, How are you enjoying those cigars I gave you?
8989,GEORGE,48," Oh, uh, the cigars.. (Chuckles nervously) I'm, uh, suckin' 
              'em down. I'm puffing my brains out, yeah."
8990,MR. ROSS,48, You know those cigars are made special for Castro?
8991,GEORGE,48," (Impersonating Carson) I didn't not know that. Weird. Wild. 
              (Susan and George both laugh)"
8992,MR. ROSS,48, What?
8993,SUSAN,48," (Explaining) He's doing Johnny Carson, daddy."
8994,MR. ROSS,48, I didn't care much for his jokes.
8995,SUSAN,48, (To George) Daddy never laughs.
8996,GEORGE,48," Oh, well, so what? Laughter - what is that? I mean, what 
              is the point of opening your mouth and going ""Ha, ha!""? 
              What is that? ""Ha, ha!""?"
8997,MR. ROSS,48," You know, you can't get those cigars anywhere."
8998,MRS. ROSS,48, You and your cigars..
8999,MR. ROSS,48, (Shooting back at his wife) Wear some more lipstick.
9000,SUSAN,48," Daddy, there's, um, there's something that we have to talk 
              to you about.."
9001,MR. ROSS,48," Oh, I forgot to ask you - how'd you like the cabin?"
9002,GEORGE,48," (Even more nervous than before) Oh, the, uh, the cabin.. 
              well, (Clears throat)"
9003,[Setting,48, Jerry's apartment]
9004,JERRY,48," Right after we get off the phone, then you go and tell her 
              that?! Well, of course she knows it was me who complained! Now I'm 
              responsible for this"
9005,ELAINE,48," (Full of guilt) I know! I screwed up. It's all my fault. 
              Would you call her?"
9006,JERRY,48," (Caving in) Ohh.. dial the number. (Elaine picks up the 
              phone, and starts to dial) How could you do this?"
9007,ELAINE,48," (Handing the phone over to him) I was just trying to help 
              you."
9008,JERRY,48," (Muttering) Oh, just trying to (Rudely grabs the phone from 
              her) help me.. (Into the phone) Hello? Sandra? Hi, uh, this is Jerry 
              Seinfeld. (Elaine now has her"
9009,"hand away. Elaine sits back like a scolded child) There's been 
              a terrible misunderstanding",48," See, I told Elaine that, uh, it was 
              a real treat talking to you on the phone,"
9010,[Setting,48, The Ross' house]
9011,GEORGE,48," The cabin.. (Laughs nervously) Well.. (Pauses as he thinks 
              of a way to break the news, then decides to pass it off) Susan?"
9012,SUSAN,48, Uhh.. about the cabin..
9013,MR. ROSS,48," (Cutting her off) I love that place. My father built 
              that cabin in 1947. My mother was recuperating from Impetigo at 
              the time, and dad thought it would"
9014,GEORGE,48," (Annoyingly butting in) Kinda like Superman's fortress 
              of solitude."
9015,MR. ROSS,48, What?
9016,GEORGE,48," S, uh, Superman - he, uh, built the fortress of solitude 
              up at the North Pole, to, uh, you know, sort of get away from it 
              all.."
9017,MR. ROSS,48," When I go, I'm passing it on to her. (Pointing at Susan)"
9018,MRS. ROSS,48," (Drunk, she laughs out loud) I'll take a hotel any day."
9019,SUSAN,48, Daddy..
9020,MR. ROSS,48, Yes?
9021,SUSAN,48," Daddy, about the cabin.."
9022,MRS. ROSS,48," (Laughing, she points to her shirt) Look, Henry, I spilled 
              wine on me! (Laughs again)"
9023,MR. ROSS,48, (To Susan) What about it?
9024,SUSAN,48," Well, the thing is.."
9025,MR. ROSS,48, What? What is it?
9026,SUSAN,48," Well, the - the cabin, is, kind of, uh.. George?"
9027,GEORGE,48, (Extremely blunt) Burned.
9028,MR. ROSS,48, Burned?
9029,SUSAN,48," There was a fire, and it uh.. "
9030,GEORGE,48, Burned.
9031,MR. ROSS,48," (Still trying to comprehend what has happened) The cabin 
              burned?"
9032,GEORGE,48," (Laughs) yeah, burned. Whoo.."
9033,MRS. ROSS,48, (Laughing out loud) Burned! (George laughs with her)
9034,MR. ROSS,48," Was anything found? Was it all burned to the ground?! 
              Did they find anything?"
9035,SUSAN,48, (Solemn) No. Nothing.
9036,MRS. ROSS,48," (Laughing, she's obviously getting a kick out of her 
              husband's misfortune) Nothing! Ha, ha, ha."
9037,GEORGE,48," Eh, but, you know, Mr. Ross, if - if you look at the whole 
              situating, what with it being your cigars, and everything, it's 
              really rather ironic - one might even"
9038,[Setting,48, Jerry's apartment]
9039,SANDRA,48, (Offended) I can't believe you said that!
9040,JERRY,48, What?!
9041,SANDRA,48," (Buttoning her jacket) How could you say something like 
              that to me?!"
9042,JERRY,48," What? What?! You were the one who was talking dirty. I was 
              just trying to keep up!"
9043,SANDRA,48, That was a weird thing to say.
9044,JERRY,48," Why? It didn't mean anything. I was just trying to join 
              in so you wouldn't feel embarrassed."
9045,SANDRA,48," Ohh, I think you're really sick."
9046,JERRY,48," (Getting slightly offended) I'm not sick. (Pointing at her) 
              You - you said much sicker things than me."
9047,SANDRA,48, I'm leaving. (Moves toward the door. Jerry blocks her path)
9048,JERRY,48, I really think you're making too much of this.
9049,SANDRA,48," (Attempting to get past him) Excuse me. (They both move 
              to the door)"
9050,JERRY,48, Let me walk you to a cab.
9051,SANDRA,48, (Opens the door) That's ok.
9052,JERRY,48," I mean, the main thing is that this is just between us, 
              and that'll be the end of it."
9053,SANDRA,48," Oh, really? (Quickly walks out)"
9054,JERRY,48," (Calling after her) I mean, people - they're not interested 
              in things like this. They don't want to hear about it. They really 
              don't."
9055,[Setting,48, The Coffee shop]
9056,JERRY,48," So, we're.. uhh, drinkin' and talkin', and uhh, so, she 
              starts rubbing my leg."
9057,GEORGE,48, Wo-hoah! What did you do?
9058,JERRY,48," (Sarcastic) Have you ever told a woman to stop touching 
              your leg?"
9059,GEORGE,48," Yeah, right."
9060,JERRY,48," I mean, I know it's the wrong thing to do. She works in 
              Elaine's office. I know it's wrong - but I can't get that hand off 
              my leg. I mean, I'm looking at the"
9061,GEORGE,48," Yeah, woman have no problem getting the hand off. How do 
              they do that?"
9062,JERRY,48," I don't know, they're working on a whole other level.."
9063,GEORGE,48," Alright, so, go ahead."
9064,JERRY,48, So we go back to my apartment..
9065,GEORGE,48, (Expressing shock) Woah. Whoa! Woah!
9066,JERRY,48," So, we're, uh, foolin' around there.. you know, it's getting 
              a little passionate.. (Scoots closer to George, to prevent others 
              from hearing) and, uh, she starts"
9067,GEORGE,48," (Putting his hands up) Alright, alright, hold on! (Jerry 
              has George's full attention) Time out! Woah, woah! (Scooting in, 
              giddy) What did she say?"
9068,JERRY,48," (Modest) Oh, you know, the usual.."
9069,GEORGE,48," No, I don't know. How do I know the usual?"
9070,JERRY,48, Typical things.
9071,GEORGE,48," (Picking up the ketchup) What typical? Gimme typical. Gimme 
              some typical."
9072,JERRY,48," She says, uh.. (Mumbles something inaudible. George, so 
              shocked by what he's just heard, accidentally squeezes the ketchup 
              bottle - ketchup squirts out"
9073,GEORGE,48," (Breathing deeply) That's very dirty. (Jerry nods) That's 
              absolutely filthy."
9074,JERRY,48, ..And then she starts talking about her panties.
9075,GEORGE,48, (Yelling out to a waitress) Gonna need some water here!
9076,JERRY,48, So I said something.
9077,GEORGE,48," Ok, what did you say?"
9078,JERRY,48," (Defensively) Now, bear in mind, I am just trying to keep 
              up."
9079,GEORGE,48, Of course.
9080,JERRY,48," Okay? So, she's taking about her panties, so, uh.. So, I 
              said, ""You mean the panties your mother laid out for you?"""
9081,GEORGE,48," (Takes a few seconds to mull this one over. Shooting Jerry 
              a confused look, he repeats it) ""The panties your mother laid 
              out for you""? (Jerry nods) What"
9082,JERRY,48, (Throwing up his hands) I don't know! It just popped out.
9083,GEORGE,48," Well, how did she react?"
9084,JERRY,48, She flipped out! Just left.
9085,GEORGE,48," Well, that's not offensive. (Reflects) It's abnormal, but 
              it's not offensive."
9086,JERRY,48," Look, the main thing is I don't want Elaine to know about 
              any of this. I mean, especially the panty remark. I mean, it's embarrassing. 
              And she's never let me"
9087,JERRY,48," She will tell her. She's going back to work. I talked her 
              into it - how stupid was that? (Changing subject as they both collect 
              money to pay for the check)"
9088,GEORGE,48," Yeah, yeah. He went into the bedroom and started sobbing."
9089,JERRY,48, I guess he failed to see the humor in it.
9090,GEORGE,48," Huh. (Makes a ""over his head"" gesture with his 
              arm) C'mon, let's go, go. We got a lot of work to do today."
9091,JERRY,48," (Getting up) Alright, big work day."
9092,GEORGE,48, That's right.
9093,[Setting,48, Jerry's apartment]
9094,GEORGE,48, Okay.

9107,JERRY,48, Yeah!
9108,KRAMER,48," Uh, George, did you talk to that guy about getting me some 
              more cigars?"
9109,GEORGE,48," (Scoffs) No, I told you, I'm not gonna do that."
9110,KRAMER,48," (Concluding) Okay.. well, I guess I'm just going to have 
              to take matters into my own hands, huh? (Pause) Alright, I'll see

              for a while.."
9128,JERRY,48," (Agreeing) Yeah, we should."

              work."
9136,JERRY,48," Well, then, you've just got to fire her! Don't even think 
              about it - there's no two ways about it."
9137,ELAINE,48, Why? What happened? Did you talk?
9138,JERRY,48," Talk? Did I talk? It - you're darn right I talk to her! 
              We talked up a storm - and I concluded from the basis of these talks 
              that this isn't anybody you should"
9139,ELAINE,48, Really?
9140,JERRY,48, Yes.
9141,ELAINE,48, Really? You really think I should fire her?

              here working on the script, I'd do it myself."

9179,RAYMOND,48," Ah, yes, the man from the insurance company dropped this 
              off this morning. He said it was the only thing left from the remains 
              of the fire."
9180,SUSAN,48," (Accepts the box) Oh, thank you. (As the doorman leaves, 
              she turns to Jerry and George) Wow, I've never seen this before.. 
              (Opens the charred box)"
9181,GEORGE,48," Oh, sure. (Holds the box out as Susan takes out a few letters)"
9182,SUSAN,48, From.. (Trying to read one) from John Cheever.
9183,JERRY AND GEORGE,48," Oh, wow."
9184,SUSAN,48," (Chuckles as she opens up one of the letters. She reads 
              it) ""Dear Henry, last night with you was bliss. I fear my.. 
              orgasm (She now has everyone's"
9185,GEORGE,48," Well, we.. we, we, ah.."
9186,JERRY,48, (Looking at his watch ) Yeah..
9187,GEORGE,48," We really should be, uh, heading out.."
9188,JERRY,48, Yeah. (Tapping his watch) Look at the time.
9189,GEORGE,48," You know, the time.."
9190,MR. ROSS,48," The box! (Rushes toward George, grabbing the box away 
              from him, then the letters from Susan's hands) My letters! Gimme 
              that! (Now holding them"
9191,MRS. ROSS,48, (Hysterical) Who's John?! Who's John?!
9192,SARA,48, (Yelling out) I knew it!
9193,MRS. ROSS,48, I want to know who John is!
9194,RICKEY,48," John Cheever?! Dad, you and John Cheever?!"
9195,MR. ROSS,48," (Proclaiming) Yes! Yes, he was the most wonderful person 
              I've ever known. And I love him deeply! In a way you could never 
              understand.. (Slowly"
9196,GEORGE,48," Well, we really should be-"
9197,JERRY,48, Yeah.
9198,GEORGE,48," Uh, heading out. Jerry really hates to miss the coming 
              attractions."
9199,JERRY,48," Yeah, and, (Pointing to his watch) because of the.. (Slowly 
              exiting) time."
9200,GEORGE,48," yeah, time is what he's indicating there.."
9201,JERRY,48, (Waving good bye) We'll see ya.
9202,GEORGE,48," Uh, anyway, (Waving bye to everyone) onward and upward."
9203,[Setting,48, Jerry's apartment]
9204,GEORGE,48," Alright, here we go."
9205,JERRY,48," Alright, let's go."
9206,GEORGE,48, Come on now.
9207,JERRY,48, Right now.
9208,GEORGE,48, Here we go.
9209,JERRY,48, You and me.
9210,GEORGE,48, You got it.
9211,JERRY,48, No foolin'
9212,GEORGE,48," Ok, so, what'dya got?"
9213,JERRY,48," (Looking at his notebook) Alright, I got, uh, you come in, 
              you say ""Hi"", and I say ""Hello""."
9214,GEORGE,48," Alright, so, we need something.."
9215,GEORGE,48," ""How's it going?"" - beautiful."
9216,JERRY,48," (Getting up to answer the door) Alright, did you get that 
              line?"
9217,GEORGE,48," (Nodding, writing) ""How's it going?"""
9218,JERRY,48, Did you write it down?
9219,GEORGE,48," I'm writin' it. ""How's it going?"""
9220,JERRY,48, Okay.. (Opens the door to a frantic Elaine)
9221,ELAINE,48, Real good!
9222,JERRY,48, What?!
9223,ELAINE,48, Do you know how much money you cost me today?! 429 dollars!
9224,JERRY,48, What?! How?
9225,ELAINE,48," I got Sandra transferred to another office upstairs, okay?! 
              So, she blabs to Lippman about my long distance calls to Europe!"
9226,JERRY,48, What calls?!
9227,ELAINE,48," Uh! I made a friend when I was in Europe, okay?! And we've 
              been in touch, and Sandra told Lippman!"
9228,JERRY,48," Oh, did - did she say anything else to you?"
9229,ELAINE,48," (Confused) ""Anything else""? What do you mean 
              ""anything else""?"
9230,JERRY,48," So she just left the office - didn't say a word to you about 
              anything?"
9231,ELAINE,48, Yeah!
9232,JERRY,48, (Smiling to himself) Beautiful.
9233,ELAINE,48, Why is that beautiful?
9234,JERRY,48," Oh, no, not beautiful."
9235,ELAINE,48, It's four hundred and twenty nine dollars!
9236,JERRY,48," Hey, look, I'm going to pay for that."
9237,ELAINE,48," No, no."
9238,JERRY,48," (Taking out his checkbook) No, I insist. I was the one who 
              encouraged you to fire her - the whole thing was all my-"
9239,ELAINE,48, (Giving up too easy) Okay.
9240,JERRY,48," (Pauses, noting Elaine's quick accept) fault. (Starts to 
              write a check out, then stops, looking at the door) Do you smell 
              smoke?"
9241,KRAMER,48," Oh, hey! Hey, Jer, I want you to meet my new friends, here. 
              (Introducing each one) This is, uh, Louis, Jorge, and Umberto."
9242,JERRY,48," Oh, how you doing? Nice to meet you."
9243,KRAMER,48," Yeah, we're heading up to Westchester - gonna hit the links."
9244,JERRY,48," Oh. (Notices Louis' jacket) Isn't that, uh, your.."
9245,KRAMER,48," (Trying to avoid the issue) Oh, yeah, yeah, Okay, we're 
              going. (To his three friends) Vamanos, muchachos!"
9246,ELAINE,48," (Turns to George, he is now reading a book) Hey, what are 
              you reading?"
9247,GEORGE,48," Oh, uh, ""The Falconer"" by John Cheever. It's 
              really excellent."
9248,ELAINE,48," (To Jerry) John Cheever, you ever read any of his stuff?"
9249,JERRY,48," Uh, yeah, I'm familiar with some of his writing. (George 
              shoots Jerry a smirk, then returns to his book) Alright, (Hand the 
              check to Elaine) look, we gotta"
9250,ELAINE,48," (Folding up the check) Ok, I'll leave you two alone."
9251,JERRY,48, (Moving back into the living room) Okay.
9252,ELAINE,48," (In the door way) Maybe I'll go visit my mother. She just 
              bought me some new panties (Jerry pauses right before sitting in 
              his chair) and they're - all laid"
9253,Jerry,50, We're dead.
9254,George,50, We're not dead.
9255,Jerry,50, We are dead.
9256,George,50, Come on. We got all day tomorrow to come up with a story.
9257,Jerry,50," All day tomorrow? We had a month and a half to come up with 
              something and we didn't do anything."
9258,George,50, So we'll do it tomorrow.
9259,Jerry,50," Let me ask you something. When's the last time you went 
              skiing?"
9260,George,50, About six years ago.
9261,Jerry,50, I think you can take the lift ticket off your jacket now.
9262,George,50, Women like skiers.
9263,Jerry,50, So what? You can't meet anybody. You're going on with Susan.
9264,George,50, Yeah. Right.
9265,Jerry,50," Hey, see those two women over there? I almost dated the 
              one on the right. She's in the closet business."
9266,George,50, The closet business? What's the closet business?
9267,Jerry,50, What is it your business?
9268,George,50, I'm interested.
9269,Jerry,50," She reorganizes your closet and shows you how to maximize 
              your closet space. She looked into my closet."
9270,George,50," So you thought she was good looking and figured this would 
              be a good way to meet her."
9271,Jerry,50, Yeah.
9272,George,50, Yeah. So what happened?
9273,Jerry,50," So, she mentioned she had a boyfriend and then it hit me. 
              What do I need more closet space for? (Across the room) Hi, Marla."
9274,Marla,50, (Walks over to Jerry and George) Jerry.
9275,Jerry,50," George, Marla."
9276,George,50, Marla.
9277,Marla,50," George. Jerry, Stacey."
9278,Jerry,50, Stacey.
9279,Stacey,50, Jerry.
9280,Jerry,50," George, Stacey."
9281,George,50, Stacey.
9282,Stacey,50, George.
9283,Jerry,50, George.
9284,George,50," Jerry. Marla. (Realizing Jerry's cue) Stacey! (Walks over 
              to Stacey)"
9285,Marla,50," So, how was your trip to Berlin?"
9286,Jerry,50, Trip to Berlin?
9287,Marla,50," Remember? That's why you put off doing the closets. You 
              said you were going to Berlin for a while."
9288,Jerry,50," Oh, right, right."
9289,Marla,50," The wall had just come down, and you told me you wanted 
              to be part of the celebration."
9290,Jerry,50," Yes, yes, I did. But, you know, I was watching it on CNN, 
              and they covered it so well I thought, ""Why knock my brains 
              out?"""
9291,Marla,50," You, know my boyfriend went."
9292,Jerry,50, Really?
9293,Marla,50," Yes, I told him all about you going and he got all excited 
              and decided to go."
9294,Jerry,50," Oh, did he like it?"
9295,Marla,50," I don't know. He never came back. (Over to the other side 
              of the bar)"
9296,George,50," Anyway, we met with NBC about a month ago and they gave 
              us the green light to go ahead and write a pilot. In fact, we got 
              a big meeting with them tomorrow. They gotta approve of the story 
              before we can write."
9297,Stacey,50," Wow, what a great job. A writer."
9298,George,50, Not a bad way to make a buck.
9299,Stacey,50, Sounds great.
9300,George,50," Well, I'll tell you, Stacey. It's a lot of hard work. But, 
              it comes fairly easy to me. Some people write symphonies. This is 
              my gift. (Raises ski lift ticket while Stacey looks away)"
9301,Jerry,50," So, are you gonna go out with her?"
9302,George,50, I might.
9303,Jerry,50, What about Susan?
9304,George,50," What? I'm not married. I'm not allowed to go out with somebody 
              else?"
9305,Jerry,50, Depends.
9306,George,50, Depends on what?
9307,Jerry,50, On many factors.
9308,George,50, Like what?
9309,Jerry,50," Well, how long you've been seeing her. What's your phone 
              call frequency? Are you on a daily?"
9310,George,50, No. Semi-daily. Four or five times a week.
9311,Jerry,50," What about Saturday nights? Do you have to ask her out, 
              or is a date implied?"
9312,George,50, Implied.
9313,Jerry,50, She got anything in your medicine cabinet?
9314,George,50, There might be some moisturizer.
9315,Jerry,50," Ah hah. Let me ask you this. Is there any tampax in your 
              house?"
9316,George,50, (Pause) Yeah.
9317,Jerry,50," Well, I'll tell you what you've got here."
9318,George,50, What?
9319,Jerry,50, You got yourself a girlfriend.
9320,George,50," Ah, no, no. Are you sure? A girlfriend?"
9321,Jerry,50," I'm looking at a guy in a semi-daily with tampax in his 
              house and an implied date on Saturday night. I would like to help 
              you out, but..."
9322,George,50," Would you believe my luck? The first time in my life I 
              have a good answer to the question, ""What do you do?"" 
              and I have a girlfriend. I mean, you don't need a girlfriend when 
              you can answer that question. That's what you say in order to get 
              girlfriends. Once you can get a girlfriend, you don't want a girlfriend, 
              you just want more girlfriends."
9323,Jerry,50, You're going to make a good father someday.
9324,George,50," Well it's not fair, Jerry. It's just not fair. All right, 
              all right. That's it. I'm getting out of this thing."
9325,Jerry,50, Fine. Break up with her. But you know what this means?
9326,George,50," No, what?"
9327,Jerry,50," The script, the pilot, the TV show. That's all over."
9328,George,50, Why? What do you mean?
9329,Jerry,50," Figure it out. She's one of the executives at NBC that's 
              gonna make the decision whether or not they pick up the show. She's 
              one of our biggest fans. You drop her off, you think they're gonna 
              pick us up?"
9330,George,50," Oh, right. Oh no, man."
9331,Jerry,50," you know, it's a very interesting situation. Here you have 
              a job that can get you girls. But, you also have a relationship. 
              But if you try and get rid of the relationship so you can get the 
              girls, you lose the job. You see the irony?"
9332,George,50," Yeah, yeah. I see the irony. All right. What about this? 
              What if I can find some way to break up with her so that she'll 
              still like me and it doesn't affect the deal."
9333,Jerry,50," (sarcastically) Oh, yeah."
9334,George,50," Wait, wait. Here me out. Don't dismiss this. You're very 
              quick to dismiss. Don't dismiss. She's got a big crush on David 
              Letterman, I mean, a big crush. She talks about him all the time. 
              Suppose I go up to David Letterman. He works at NBC; I work at NBC. 
              I explain my situation. He agrees to meet her. They go out, they 
              fall madly in love. And she dumps me for David Letterman."
9335,Jerry,50, This is your plan?
9336,George,50," No, no. I'm just thinking."
9337,Jerry,50, I don't think you are.
9338,Marla,50, Let me tell you what I think.
9339,Jerry,50," Please, and be brutal. I have no closet sensitivity."
9340,Marla,50, Are you very fussy about your pants?
9341,Jerry,50, I don't think I am.
9342,Marla,50, Because I have a very radical idea. Can you handle it?
9343,Jerry,50, Try me.
9344,Marla,50," Here's what I'm proposing. We eliminate all this. The hangers, 
              the bar, the shelves. And in its place install a series of hooks. 
              We'll put everything on hooks."
9345,Jerry,50, Everything?
9346,Marla,50," Everything. The shirts, pants, sport jackets, pajamas. We 
              could get eighty hooks on here."
9347,Jerry,50," You're quite mad, you know. (Kramer enters) Oh, I don't 
              believe this. (Goes into other room) Hey?"
9348,Kramer,50, Hey.
9349,Jerry,50, What are you doing?
9350,Kramer,50, I'm watching The Bold and the Beautiful.
9351,Jerry,50, No.
9352,Kramer,50, What?
9353,Jerry,50, This is not a good time.
9354,Kramer,50, Five minutes. What?
9355,Jerry,50, What did you have to give your TV away to George for?
9356,Kramer,50," Because I've been watching too much. It was an addiction. 
              I couldn't stop. It was, it was destroying my brain cells."
9357,Jerry,50," Yeah, but now you're in here all the time. (Marla enters 
              from other room)"
9358,Kramer,50," Well, wow."
9359,Jerry,50," Marla, Kramer."
9360,Kramer,50, Hey.
9361,Jerry,50, Why don't you go out? It's nice out.
9362,Kramer,50," Oh, no. There's nothing out there for me."
9363,Jerry,50, There's weather.
9364,Kramer,50," Weather? I don't need weather. Weather doesn't do it for 
              me."
9365,Jerry,50, I'm tellin' George to give you your TV back.
9366,Kramer,50," No, no, I don't want it back. (Pause) Are you gonna watch 
              the Knick game tonight?"
9367,Jerry,50, I don't know.
9368,Kramer,50, Will you tape it?
9369,Jerry,50, Kramer... (points to Marla)
9370,Kramer,50, Yeah. (He exits)
9371,Jerry,50, So your boyfriend never came back from Berlin.
9372,Marla,50, Never came back.
9373,Jerry,50," Oh, you must have been devastated being left for a wall."
9374,Marla,50, It was about to end anyway. There was this... problem.
9375,Jerry,50, Ah hah. (Buzzer) Excuse me one second. Yeah?
9376,Elaine,50, It's me.
9377,Jerry,50," Come on up. Oh, it's Elaine, she's just a friend of mine. 
              I don't know what she's doing here now. (Buzzer) I'm sorry. What?"
9378,Elaine,50, I didn't get it.
9379,Jerry,50, Ugh. So you were saying there was this problem.
9380,Marla,50," Well, he wanted me to move in with him."
9381,Jerry,50, Snapple?
9382,Marla,50, No thanks.
9383,Jerry,50, Go on.
9384,Marla,50, Well I wouldn't move in because...
9385,Jerry,50, Yes.
9386,Marla,50, Well because...
9387,Jerry,50, Yeah.
9388,Marla,50, Well because I'm a virgin. (Elaine enters)
9389,Elaine,50, Hello!
9390,Jerry,50," Hi, um. Marla, Elaine."
9391,Elaine,50," I'm sorry, I didn't know you had company. I just wanted 
              to return your tape."
9392,Jerry,50," Oh, thanks a lot, two weeks late. Now that costs me thirty-five 
              dollars to see Havana."
9393,Elaine,50," I'm sorry, I really am. I just kept forgetting."
9394,Marla,50, I should be going.
9395,Elaine,50," No, no, I'm leaving."
9396,Jerry,50, I like that thing in your hair there.
9397,Elaine,50," Oh yeah? This woman was selling them at this crazy party 
              I was at last night. You'll appreciate this. Snapple? "
9398,Marla,50, No thanks. 
9399,Elaine,50," I was talking to this guy, you know, and I just happened 
              to throw my purse on the sofa. And my diaphragm goes flying out. 
              So I just froze, you know, ahh! Staring at my diaphragm. You know, 
              it's just lying there. So then, this woman, the one who sold me 
              this hair thing, she grabbed it before the guy noticed, so. I mean, 
              big deal, right? So I carry around my diaphragm, who doesn't? Yeah, 
              like it's a big, big secret that women carry around their diaphragms. 
              You never know when you're gonna need it, right? (Sips the Snapple) 
              Ahh. "
9400,Marla,50, I should be going.
9401,Jerry,50, So we'll talk about the hooks then?
9402,Marla,50, Yes. (She exits)
9403,Elaine,50, What? Was it something I said?
9404,Jerry,50," She's a virgin, she just told me."
9405,Elaine,50, Well I didn't know.
9406,Jerry,50, Well it's not like spotting a toupee.
9407,Elaine,50," Well you think I should say something? Should I say something? 
              Should I apologize? Was I being anti-virgin?"
9408,Jerry,50," No, no, I mean..."
9409,Elaine,50, 'Cause I'm not anti-virgin. I'll be right back. (She leaves)
9410,Jerry,50," Elaine, Elaine... (Buzzer) Yeah?"
9411,George,50, It's George.
9412,George,50, She's a virgin?
9413,Jerry,50, A virgin.
9414,George,50, Wow. So what're you gonna do?
9415,Jerry,50," I don't know. I'm very attracted to her. That accent, it's 
              so sexy."
9416,George,50," I don't think I could do it. You know, they always remember 
              the first time. I don't want to be remembered. I wanna be forgotten."
9417,Jerry,50," You need a little pioneer spirit. You know, you don't have 
              any of that Lewis and Clark in you."
9418,George,50," You know, sometimes those guys don't make it back. (Looks 
              in fridge) I'm really hungry."
9419,Jerry,50," Yeah, me too."
9420,George,50," We gotta get something. I don't want to go to that meeting 
              on an empty stomach. Let's get some Chinese. You wanna order it?"
9421,Jerry,50," All right, but then we gotta get some work done. Let me 
              just call Kramer, see if want anything. (Calls) Hey, we ordering 
              Chinese food. If you want anything-- (Kramer enters quickly) let 
              me know what it is and I'll order for you."
9422,Kramer,50, I'm in. Let's go for it.
9423,George,50, What do you want?
9424,Kramer,50," I don't care, whatever."
9425,George,50," I'll tell you what. Why don't we just get a couple of dishes 
              and we'll just share 'em."
9426,Kramer,50, Okay. What are you getting?
9427,George,50, I'm gonna get a Chow Fung.
9428,Kramer,50, What's a Chow Fung?
9429,George,50, It's a broad noodle.
9430,Kramer,50," What do you mean, a broad noodle?"
9431,George,50, It's a big flat noodle.
9432,Kramer,50, Well I don't want a big flat noodle.
9433,George,50, What kind of noodle do you want?
9434,Kramer,50, Who says I want a noodle?
9435,George,50," All right, look. I'm getting the Chow Fung. You don't have 
              to have any."
9436,Kramer,50," All right. I'll get pea pods and you can't have any of 
              my pea pods."
9437,George,50, Fine.
9438,Kramer,50, Get extra MSG.
9439,Elaine,50," Look, Marla. This whole sex thing is totally overrated. 
              Now, here's the one thing you've gotta be ready for is how the man 
              changes into a completely different person five seconds after it's 
              over. I mean, something happens to their personality it's really 
              quite astounding. It's like they committed a crime and they want 
              to flee the scene before the police get there."
9440,Marla,50, So they just leave?
9441,Elaine,50," Yeah, pretty much, yeah. Well, the smart ones start working 
              on their getaway stories during dinner. How, you know, they gotta 
              get up early tomorrow. What is about being up early? They all turn 
              into farmers suddenly."
9442,Marla,50, Wow. It must be pretty good to put up with all that.
9443,Elaine,50, Eh.
9444,Jerry,50," All right, let's go. We don't have much time before the 
              meeting. "
9445,George,50, Where's the food? What happened to Ping?
9446,Jerry,50," Don't worry, he'll be here. Look, we only got about two 
              hours. We just need to come up with one good story so we can get 
              through this meeting. (Buzzer) There's your food."
9447,George,50," Hey, what about this? I'm in a car accident. The motorist 
              is uninsured, you with me?"
9448,Jerry,50, Yeah.
9449,George,50," My car's totaled. It's all his fault and now, he has absolutely 
              no money. There is no way that he can pay me. So the judge decrees 
              that he becomes my butler."
9450,Jerry,50, Your butler?
9451,George,50," Right. He cooks my food, he cleans my house, he does all 
              my shopping for me. And there you go, that's your program."
9452,Jerry,50, What about me?
9453,George,50," Don't worry, we'll find something for you. (Knock of Jerry's 
              door)"
9454,Jerry,50," (Getting the door) That's the stupidest idea I ever heard. 
              Sentenced to be a butler. (Elaine, Marla, and an injured Ping are 
              at the door) Ping, what happened?"
9455,Elaine,50, There was a bit of an accident.
9456,Ping,50, Head hurts. Head really hurts.
9457,Jerry,50, What happened?
9458,Elaine,50," Marla and I went out for coffee and afterwards I was crossing 
              the street and he was biking right towards me. So I got out of the 
              way just in time, but then he ran into a parked car. He hit his 
              head and everything went flying."
9459,George,50, Something happened to the food?
9460,Ping,50, I only saved one bag.
9461,Jerry,50, Should I call an ambulance? Do you wanna see a doctor?
9462,Marla,50, I'll get some ice.
9463,George,50," (After looking in the bag) The pea pods? All you saved 
              was the pea pods? (Kramer enters)"
9464,Kramer,50," Hey, you got the food?"
9465,Jerry,50," Yeah, here."
9466,Kramer,50," What took you so long? Hey, Ping!"
9467,Ping,50, Kramer. (Kramer and George sit on the couch)
9468,Kramer,50, Yeah. Where's yours?
9469,George,50, He dropped it.
9470,Kramer,50," Oh, that's too bad."
9471,Elaine,50," You should slow down, you know that? It's dangerous to 
              go that fast."
9472,Ping,50," No, no. I have green light. You jaywalked."
9473,Kramer,50," (To Jerry) Hey, you watchin' Oprah?"
9474,Elaine,50, (To Ping) I did not jaywalk.
9475,Jerry,50, (To George) You're givin' him back that TV.
9476,Ping,50," (To Elaine) Yes, you jaywalked."
9477,Kramer,50," (To Jerry) No, I don't want it back."
9478,Ping,50, (To Elaine) Jaywalker. I could slap suit on you.
9479,George,50, (To Jerry) We got work to do. What about the meeting?
9480,Kramer,50," (To himself) Hey, look. An hour with Patrick Swayze."
9481,Jerry,50," A month and a half we had. We did nothing. I can't believe 
              we put it off until today and then we couldn't do anything because 
              Elaine runs out to apologize to a virgin, crosses against a light, 
              and knocks over a Chinese delivery boy. Now we're gonna make fools 
              of ourselves, we got nothing. You're not even in show business. 
              I gotta reputation. You drag me into the sewer with you. I've been 
              on TV buddy boy. You know how fast word spreads in show business? 
              It's like that (Snaps in George's face) , like that! One bad impression, 
              you're outta the business!"
9482,George,50," All right, let's postpone it. Let's get out of here."
9483,Jerry,50, What do you mean? They know we're here.
9484,George,50," I'll fake an illness. (Acts it out) My back! My back! I 
              can't believe, my back."
9485,Jerry,50," No, no, would you get up?"
9486,George,50," I can do this, Jerry."
9487,Jerry,50, No.
9488,George,50," All right, I'll tell them my sister died. (Starts fake 
              crying) My poor sister died. She was standing and then she was laughing 
              and then they SHOT her! That's the kind of sick city that we're 
              livin' in. They shoot you for laughing. I must go and comfort my 
              poor family. Jerry, take me home so I can comfort my... my poor 
              family."
9489,Jerry,50, What?
9490,George,50," That's David Letterman. I just saw David Letterman walk 
              by. I'll be right back. (He exits)"
9491,Woman,50," Mr. Seinfeld, they're ready for you. (She exits)"
9492,Jerry,50," Yes, I was very wise to hitch my wagon to his star. (Jerry 
              enters meeting)"
9493,Man #1,50," Hey, Jerry."
9494,Jerry,50," Hi, how are you doing? Nice to see you all here. Hello."
9495,Rita,50," Hello, Jerry. I'm Rita Kearson."
9496,Jerry,50," Oh, uh, nice to meet you. Where's Russell?"
9497,Rita,50," He, uh, had to go to LA. There's a problem on the set of 
              Blossom."
9498,Jerry,50," Oh, poor Blossom. (He sits)"
9499,Rita,50," Anyway, he asked me to sit in for him."
9500,Man #2,50, Where's George?
9501,Jerry,50," Oh, he ran to say something to David Letterman."
9502,Susan,50, David Letterman's on the floor?
9503,Jerry,50," Yeah, he just walked by. "
9504,Rita,50," Well, I think we should get started anyway."
9505,Jerry,50," Yeah, good idea."
9506,Rita,50, So how are you guys comin' along?
9507,Jerry,50," Good, good, we've got a lot of ideas."
9508,Rita,50, Good. (Pause)
9509,Jerry,50," Have you ever been to a Chinese restaurant and they tell 
              you it'll be, like, five minutes for a table and you wind up waitin' 
              there for, like, thirty minutes? Well, we thought it would be very 
              funny to do an entire show where all you're doin' is waitin' for 
              the table. (They don't seem to like it) Because we've all been in 
              that situation. You know, you're waiting... and you're hungry... 
              and you bump into somebody you know... When is Russell coming back?"
9510,Rita,50, So that's the idea?
9511,Jerry,50," Well no, that's one. We have many others. We have an idea 
              where, uh, I get into an accident with a guy who has no insurance 
              and the judge sentences him to be my butler. (Everyone laughs) You 
              know he cooks for me, he has to cook for me... He cleans my house, 
              he's doin' my shopping, you know? I'm walkin' around with one of 
              those big neck collars."
9512,Man #2,50, Those collars are funny!
9513,Man #1,50," Once you see someone in those collars you start laughing 
              immediately. (George enters)"
9514,George,50," You tellin' 'em about the butler story? Is that beautiful 
              or what? Hey, sorry I'm late. (Looks at Rita) Russell?"
9515,Rita,50, I'm Rita Kearson.
9516,George,50," Oh, Rita. Hey, Mr. Shermack, how're you doing, good to 
              see you. Jay, always a pleasure. (To Susan) Sweetie. (Kisses her 
              and then sits down next to Jerry) Yeah, yeah, that butler idea, 
              that's beautiful. Isn't that killer? (Aside to Jerry) I thought 
              I was getting the butler."
9517,Jerry,50," Don't worry, uh, we'll find something for you."
9518,Jerry,50," So Letterman didn't spark to your idea, huh?"
9519,George,50," No, he said there was nothing he could do, and next time 
              I should probably break the Prozacs in half."
9520,Kramer,50," You, you guys wanna hold it down? I'm watchin' Jeopardy."
9521,Jerry,50, Would you give him the TV back?
9522,Kramer,50," Oh, by the way, George. Susan called for you a minute ago."
9523,George,50," I bet they're probably doing summersaults about us over 
              there. You think they get butler stories like that everyday? (He 
              calls Susan)"
9524,Kramer,50, (To the TV) Who is Joseph Cotton? Giddee up!
9525,Susan,50, Hello?
9526,George,50," Hi, it's me. It's Georgie Boy. What's going on?"
9527,Susan,50," What's going on? What's going on? I'll tell you what's going 
              on. I'm fired!"
9528,George,50, Fired? Why?
9529,Susan,50," Because you kissed me. You kissed me, you stupid idiot! 
              Rita called Russell and he fired me over the phone."
9530,Kramer,50, (To the TV) What is pi? Ooh! Giddee up again.
9531,George,50, But I had no... I didn't realize.
9532,Susan,50," You didn't realize? How could you not realize? You're stupid! 
              You're a stupid, stupid man!"
9533,George,50, I just feel terrible This is just terrible.
9534,Kramer,50," (To the TV once again) What is the cha-cha? Ooh, yes indeed."
9535,Susan,50, I'll speak to you later.
9536,George,50," (Hangs up phone and pauses) this is great! He fired her! 
              This is incredible, he fired her. I'm out, baby! I'm out!"
9537,Jerry,50, Why did he fire her?
9538,George,50," Because I kissed her in the meeting. Russell found out, 
              he fired her over the phone. Finally, my stupidity pays off!"
9539,Kramer,50," What is here comes the judge, here comes the judge!"
9540,Jerry,50," You can't break up with her now. Her life is shattered. 
              You got her fired. You gotta be there for her."
9541,George,50, What?
9542,Jerry,50, You gotta at least wait until she gets another job.
9543,George,50, Another job?
9544,Jerry,50, Couple of interviews.
9545,George,50," Oh, this is unbelievable. I'm stuck. Every time I think 
              I'm out, they pull me back in. "
9546,Marla,50," Are you gonna leave after its over? You know, if we have 
              sex."
9547,Jerry,50, What? Leave? Where? Why?
9548,Marla,50," You know, the apartment."
9549,Jerry,50, Why would I leave? This is my apartment.
9550,Marla,50, Well what if it was my apartment?
9551,Jerry,50, Who gave you this idea I would wanna leave?
9552,Marla,50, Well Elaine said men like to leave after it's over.
9553,Jerry,50," Listen, I wouldn't put too much stock into what Elaine has 
              to say about relationships. She comes from a broken home, and I 
              mean that literally. A tree fell on her roof and cracked the whole 
              structure. Her parents got along beautifully, but her house was 
              in bad shape."
9554,Marla,50, Maybe I should get going.
9555,Jerry,50, What else did you say to her?
9556,Elaine,50, Nothin'. I was just givin' her the straight dope.
9557,Jerry,50," More like a dope was giving it to her straight. Another 
              cup of coffee with you, she'll wind up in a convent."
9558,Elaine,50," Listen, there was a lot more I could've told her, believe 
              me."
9559,Jerry,50," What is that about leaving after sex? Did I ever leave with 
              you?"
9560,Elaine,50," You might've if I'd stayed. So you know what? I got served 
              with papers today. Ping is suing me. I need your virgin as a witness. 
              You better be nice to her."
9561,Jerry,50, I was trying to be.
9562,Elaine,50," Look at George. (On the other side of the restaurant) He 
              lucked out, huh?"
9563,Jerry,50," Oh, you're not kiddin'. Who'd 've figured Susan would break 
              up with him? They had a good thing going."
9564,Elaine,50," Yeah, since she met him she's been vomited on, her family 
              cabin's been burned down, she learned her father's a homosexual, 
              and she got fired from a high paying network job. Yeah, they had 
              a real good thing going."
9565,George,50," What do I do? Well actually, I'm a writer. In fact, I'm 
              writing a comedy pilot for NBC right now."
9566,Woman,50," A sitcom? How can you write that crap? Carol, this guy's 
              writing a sitcom."
9567,Carol,50," A sitcom? Come on, let's go. (They leave)"
9568,Woman,50," A sitcom. Can you imagine? And he actually tried to use 
              it to hit on me!"
9569,"

9573,[Setting,51, Monk's Coffee shop]
9574,JERRY,51, (To Elaine) Let me ask you a question.
9575,ELAINE,51, Mm-hm.
9576,JERRY,51," You're a hostage, captured by terrorists-"
9577,ELAINE,51," (Smiling, chewing) Who, me?"
9578,JERRY,51," You, anybody - whatever. You're in the little room, you're 
              chained to the floor, you're there for a long time.. do you think 
              they would ever consider doing"
9579,ELAINE,51," (Matter-of-factly) They have to, it's in the Geneva Convention."
9580,KRAMER,51," (Imitating a Turkish terrorist) You! Take off your socks, 
              your pants, your underwear. We're doing the wash. C'mon! Take it 
              off, take it off!"
9581,KRAMER,51," Hey, Georgie."
9582,JERRY AND ELAINE,51, Hi.
9583,JERRY,51, (To George) What's the matter?
9584,GEORGE,51, (Slowly shakes his head) My mother caught me.
9585,JERRY,51," ""Caught"" you? Doing what?"
9586,GEORGE,51, You know. (All three give him blank stares) I was alone..
9587,ELAINE,51, (Making a face of surprise) You mean..?!
9588,GEORGE,51, (Nods) Uh-huh.
9589,KRAMER,51, (Laughing) She caught you?
9590,JERRY,51, Where?
9591,GEORGE,51," (Not really wanting to embellish) ..I stopped by the house 
              to drop the car off, and I went inside for a few minutes.. Nobody 
              was there - they're supposed"
9592,JERRY,51," ""Glamour""?"
9593,GEORGE,51," ..So, one thing lead to another.."
9594,JERRY,51," So, what did she do?"
9595,GEORGE,51," First she screams, ""George, what are you doing?! My 
              God!"" And it looked like she was gonna faint - she started 
              clutching the wall, trying to hang onto it."
9596,KRMAER,51, (Reflecting on the story so far) Man..
9597,GEORGE,51," I didn't know whether to try and keep her from falling, 
              or zip up."
9598,JERRY,51, What did you do?
9599,GEORGE,51, I zipped up!
9600,ELAINE,51," (Wide-eyed) So, she fell?"
9601,GEORGE,51," Yeah. (Noticing this makes him out to be the bad kid, he 
              gets defensive) Well, I couldn't run over there the way I was!"
9602,ELAINE,51," No, I guess you couldn't have.."
9603,JERRY,51," (In the middle of Elaine's sentence, smiling) No, I wouldn't 
              think so."
9604,ELAINE,51, (Finishing it off) ..done that.
9605,GEORGE,51," So, she fell, and then she started screaming, ""My 
              back! My back!"" So, I picked her up and took her to the hospital."
9606,ELAINE,51, (Between chuckles) How is she?
9607,GEORGE,51, (Somewhat angered) She's in traction.
9608,ELAINE,51," (Still laughing) Ok, I'm sorry."
9609,GEORGE,51," It's not funny, Elaine."
9610,ELAINE,51, (Stifling her laughter) I know. I'm sorry. I'm serious.
9611,GEORGE,51," Her back went out. She's gotta be there for a couple of 
              days. All she said on the way over in the car was, ""Why, George, 
              why?!"".. I said, ""Because it's"
9612,JERRY,51," ""Glamour""?"
9613,GEORGE,51," (Vowing) Well, I'll tell you this, though - I am never 
              doing.. that , again."
9614,ELAINE,51," What, you mean, in your mother's house, or all together?"
9615,GEORGE,51, (Definite) All together.
9616,ELAINE,51," Oh, gimme a break.."
9617,JERRY,51, (Skeptical) Ohhh yeah.. right.
9618,KRAMER,51," Oh, like you're gonna stop?"
9619,JERRY AND ELAINE,51, C'mon..
9620,GEORGE,51, You don't think I can?
9621,JERRY,51, No chance.
9622,GEORGE,51, (Daring) You think you could?
9623,JERRY,51," Well, I know I could hold out longer than you."
9624,GEORGE,51, Care to make it interesting?
9625,JERRY,51," Sure, how much?"
9626,GEORGE,51, A hundred dollars.
9627,JERRY,51, (Pointing) You're on.
9628,KRAMER,51," (Butting in) Wait a second, wait a second. Count me in 
              on this. (Clicks his tongue)"
9629,JERRY,51, You?
9630,KRAMER,51, Yeah.
9631,JERRY,51, You'll be out before we get the check.
9632,ELAINE,51," (Smiling) I want to be in on this, too."
9633,GEORGE AND JERRY,51," (Rejecting) Ohh, no. No, no, no.."
9634,ELAINE,51, Why?
9635,JERRY,51, (Showing difference) It's apples and oranges..
9636,ELAINE,51," What? Why? (More 'no, no, no's from Jerry and George. Persistent) 
              Why?"
9637,JERRY,51, Because you're a woman!
9638,ELAINE,51, So what?
9639,JERRY,51, It's easier for a woman not to do it than a man.
9640,ELAINE,51, (Sarcastic) Oh.
9641,JERRY,51," We have to do it. It's part of our lifestyle. It's like, 
              uh.. shaving."
9642,ELAINE,51," Oh, that is such bologna. I shave my legs."
9643,KRAMER,51, (Making a point) Not everyday.
9644,GEORGE,51," Alright, look, you want to be in?"
9645,ELAINE,51, Yeah!
9646,GEORGE,51," You gotta give us odds. At least two to one - you gotta 
              put up two-hundred dollars."
9647,KRAMER,51," No, a thousand!"
9648,ELAINE,51," No, I'll - I'll put up one-fifty."
9649,GEORGE,51," Alright, you're in for one-fifty."
9650,JERRY,51," (Nodding) Okay, one-fifty."
9651,GEORGE,51," Alright, now, how are we gonna monitor this thing?"
9652,JERRY,51," Well, obviously, we all know each other very well, (Elaine 
              slightly laughs) I'm sure that we'll all feel comfortable within 
              the confines of the honor system."
9653,KRAMER,51, Alright. (Holds out his pinkie at the center of the table)
9654,[Setting,51, Jerry's apartment]
9655,GEORGE,51," (Stern) No, ma, I'm not gonna see a psychiatrist. N- I 
              don't care if you do pay for it! No! Discussion over. Yeah, alright, 
              I'll see you later. Yes, of course"
9656,JERRY,51, (Waits for the rest of the sentence) ..Yeah?
9657,GEORGE,51, (Defensively) Whatever.
9658,JERRY,51, How is she?
9659,GEORGE,51," (Shrugging it off) She'll be fine. I gotta go to the hospital 
              to see her tonight."
9660,JERRY,51, (Answering to the intercom) Yeah?
9661,ELAINE,51, It's me.
9662,JERRY,51, Come on up. (Lets her in by unlocking the front door)
9663,GEORGE,51," Hey, what are you doing tonight?"
9664,JERRY,51, (Opens his door slightly for Elaine) Dating Marla.
9665,GEORGE,51," Oh, the virgin?"
9666,JERRY,51, Yeah.
9667,GEORGE,51," Any, uh.. progress, there? What's the latest?"
9668,JERRY,51," Well, I got my troops amassed along the border - I'm just 
              waiting for someone to give me the go-ahead."
9669,KRAMER,51," Hey, look at this, c'mere. There's a naked woman across 
              the street."
9670,JERRY,51, Where?
9671,KRAMER,51," Second floor from the top. (Pointing) See the window on 
              the left?"
9672,GEORGE,51, (In awe) Wow!
9673,JERRY,51, (Also amazed) Who walks around the house like that?!
9674,GEORGE,51," (Suggesting) Maybe she's a nudist. You know, those nudist 
              colony people.."
9675,KRAMER,51," ..Yeah.. (Pause) yeah.. (Slowly stands up, and walks out 
              Jerry's apartment - leaving Jerry and George with the view, he shuts 
              the door behind him)"
9676,JERRY,51," Hey, let me ask you a question. In these nudist colonies, 
              do they eat naked in the dining room?"
9677,GEORGE,51, I would imagine it's all naked.
9678,JERRY,51," What about the chamber maids? Are they naked, too?"
9679,GEORGE,51," (Still focused on the nudist) They're naked, the gardeners 
              naked.. the bellhops. (Jerry makes a noise of astonishment) One 
              big nude-a-rama."
9680,ELAINE,51, Hey.
9681,JERRY AND GEORGE,51, (Only turning back for a second) Hey.
9682,ELAINE,51," Well, (Smiling) where's my money? Who caved?"
9683,JERRY,51, (Over his shoulder) Not me.
9684,GEORGE,51," (Also, over his shoulder) Not me."
9685,ELAINE,51, What're you looking at?
9686,JERRY,51, There's a naked woman across the street.
9687,ELAINE,51," (Smiling, chuckling) This is gonna be the easiest money 
              I've ever made in my life. (Moving on to a new topic) So, my fried, 
              Joyce, is teaching an aerobics"
9688,JERRY,51," (Commenting) Yeah.. the - the waitress should've taken it 
              back."
9689,ELAINE,51," (Realizes Jerry and George aren't paying attention) So 
              then, I got a call this morning. You know, I was, uh, chosen to 
              go on the space shuttle. We're goin'"
9690,JERRY,51, (Still staring at the woman) Uh-huh.
9691,GEORGE,51, Have a good time.
9692,KRAMER,51, (Declaring) I'm out!
9693,ELAINE,51, What?!
9694,KRAMER,51," Yeah, I'm out - I'm out of the contest."
9695,GEORGE,51, You're out?!
9696,KRAMER,51," Yeah, yeah.. (Notes their reactions) what?"
9697,ELAINE,51," Well, that was fast!"
9698,JERRY,51," Well, it was that woman across the street. (To Jerry) You 
              know, you better be careful, buddy. She's gonna get you next. (Walks 
              out, shutting the door"
9699,ELAINE,51, ..And then there were three.
9700,[Setting,51, Hospital room]
9701,ELAINE,51," I don't understand you. I really don't. You have nothing 
              better to do at three o' clock in the afternoon? I go out for a 
              quart of milk, I come home, and find"
9702,GEORGE,51," (Stern, trying to shut her up) Ma."
9703,ESTELLE,51," Don't give me ""Ma"". It's a good thing I didn't 
              hit the table. I could of cracked my head open."
9704,GEORGE,51," Ma, people can hear you."
9705,ESTELLE,51," (Heavy in sarcasm) Too bad you can't do that for a living. 
              You'd be very successful at it. You could sell out Madison Square 
              Garden. Thousands of"
9706,GEORGE,51," (Getting up) Alright, Ma, that's enough!"
9707,ESTELLE,51, I want you to go see a psychiatrist.
9708,GEORGE,51, No! I am not going to see a psychiatrist!
9709,ESTELLE,51, Why? Why not?! Why won't you go?
9710,GEORGE,51, (Like a kid) Because I don't want to.
9711,ESTELLE,51, I want you to go see somebody.
9712,GEORGE,51," Well, I am not going."
9713,ESTELLE,51, It's a good thing your father's in Chicago.
9714,SHELLY,51," Hello, Aunt Estelle. Look at you - how did this happen?"
9715,GEORGE,51," (Snapping) Is that important, really? What is this, a police 
              investigation? The woman's been through enough. She has to relive 
              the experience now?!"
9716,NURSE,51," Hi, Denise. Six-thirty, time for your sponge bath."
9717,DENISE,51, Mmm.. is it six-thirty already? I fell asleep.
9718,SHELLY,51," (Seems not to notice what's going on beyond the divider) 
              So, George, what are you doing now? I hear you got some kinda television, 
              writing - thing?"
9719,GEORGE,51," (Slowly backing away, he's not at all committed to the 
              conversation) Yeah.. television."
9720,NURSE,51," Let me help you out with that. Here, just slip it over your 
              head.."
9721,DENISE,51, Oh.. thank you.
9722,SHELLY,51," (Nodding) Well, it's about time. We thought you were gonna 
              wind up on the street. (As the bath is going on, George is now completely 
              mesmerized)"
9723,ESTELLE,51," George, you're cousin, Shelly, is talking to you!"
9724,[Setting,51, New York Health Club]
9725,JOYCE,51," So, when was the last time you took a class?"
9726,ELAINE,51," Oh, it's been a while."
9727,JOYCE,51, (Overly excited) Are you psyched?
9728,ELAINE,51," (Fake excitement) Yeah. yeah, I'm really.. psyched."
9729,JOYCE,51," Well, you're gonna thank me for getting you in here."
9730,ELAINE,51, Why is that?
9731,JOYCE,51," (Pointing, she directs Elaine's attention off-camera) See 
              the guy with the dark hair and the red shorts?"
9732,ELAINE,51," (Between breaths) Oh, my God. (Joyce nods) John F. Kennedy 
              Junior's here!"
9733,JOYCE,51, He's gonna be in your class today.
9734,ELAINE,51," (Still unable to speak right) In my class? John Kennedy's 
              gonna be in my class?!"
9735,JOYCE,51," I can get you a spot right behind him. He has got a great 
              butt."
9736,ELAINE,51, Yeah. Butt. Butt. Great butt. John-John's butt.
9737,[Setting,51, Jerry's car]
9738,MARLA,51, Let's slow it down a little.
9739,JERRY,51," ""Slow it down""?"
9740,MARLA,51," Well, (Reminding him of her virginity) You know.."
9741,JERRY,51," Ah, yeah.. I know."
9742,MARLA,51," You're okay with that, right?"
9743,JERRY,51," Yeah, yeah.. of course. What, do you think I care about 
              the sex? What kind of person do you think I am? That doesn't mean 
              anything to me. (Faint) I don't"
9744,MARLA,51," So, I'll see you Saturday night, then?"
9745,JERRY,51," (Smiling, nodding) Sure, Saturday night."
9746,MARLA,51," Alright, then. Good night."
9747,JERRY,51," Goodnight. (She gets out. Jerry leans forward, adding) Not 
              just a good night - a great night. (She shuts the door, he waves)"
9748,[Setting,51, Jerry's bedroom]
9749,[Setting,51, Jerry's apartment]
9750,KRAMER,51, (Singing) Goood Moorrrnninng!
9751,JERRY,51," (Out of it) Yeah, good morning."
9752,KRAMER,51," Ha, ha! Nothing like some good solid sack time. (Turns 
              toward Jerry's window)"
9753,JERRY,51, She's not there. She's doin' her wash.
9754,KRAMER,51," (Turning back to Jerry) Oh. So, did you make it through 
              the night?"
9755,JERRY,51," (Over the top) Yes, I'm proud to say I did!"
9756,KRAMER,51," So, you're still master of your domain."
9757,KRAMER,51," Woah, woah, woah. What-what did you just say?"
9758,JERRY,51," I can't take it anymore! She's driving me crazy! I can't 
              sleep, I can't leave the house, and I' here, I'm climbin' the walls. 
              Meanwhile, I'm dating a virgin, I'm in"
9759,KRAMER,51," Do you hear what you're saying?! Can you hear it?! (Jerry 
              puts on his coat) This is a beautiful woman walking around naked, 
              and you want to tell her to"
9760,JERRY,51," (Persistent) Well, I'm doin' it, get out of my way."

              is something that comes about once in a lifetime! When we were boys,

9766,KRAMER,51," (Frantic) No, no, no. Don't do it. Don't do it! For my 
              sake! God knows I don't ask you for much! (Pleading) Now, come on. 
              Please, Jerry. Please! I'm"
9767,JERRY,51, Alright.. (Takes his coat off)
9768,KRAMER,51, Yes!
9769,JERRY,51, ..Alright.
9770,KRAMER,51," (Moving to the window) Thank you, thank you, thank you. 
              (Sits in Jerry's chair, looking out the window)"
9771,JERRY,51, She's not there!
9772,KRAMER,51," Oh, I can wait.."
9773,[Setting,51, Monk's Coffee shop]
9774,JERRY,51, So the nurse was giving her a sponge bath?
9775,GEORGE,51," Every night at six-thirty. The nurse was gorgeous.. then 
              I got a look at the patient.. (Laughs, then snorts) I was going 
              nuts."
9776,JERRY,51," Oh, man. Well, I guess you'll be going back to that hospital."
9777,GEORGE,51," (Fake sympathy) Well, my mother, Jerry.."
9778,JERRY,51, (Pointing) But are you still master of your domain?
9779,GEORGE,51, (Arms out) I am king of the county. You?
9780,JERRY,51, Lord of the manor.
9781,ELAINE,51, John F. Kennedy Jun-ya!
9782,JERRY,51, What?
9783,ELAINE,51, (Smiling) He was in my aerobics class.
9784,JERRY,51, Really? Did you talk to him?
9785,ELAINE,51," No, you don't understand - he was working out right in 
              front of me. So, listen, after the class was over, I timed my walk 
              to the door so we'd get there at"
9786,GEORGE,51," ""Quite a workout""? What did you say?"
9787,ELAINE,51," (Smiling, proud) I said, ""yeah."""
9788,JERRY,51," (Adding, fake praise) Good one."
9789,ELAINE,51," So then, listen, listen. So then, I showered and I dressed, 
              and I saw him again, on the way out. (Giddy and nearly out of breath) 
              So we're walkin' and"
9790,"talkin', and he asked me my name - and I think I said Elaine - 
              but, I mean, who the hell knows.. And so then, he says to me",51," ""Do 
              you wanna split a cab uptown?"""
9791,JERRY,51," But the question is, are you still master of your domain?"

              piece of food into her mouth)"
9793,[Setting,51, Estelle's hospital room]
9794,ESTELLE,51, You're back.
9795,GEORGE,51," Of course I'm back. Why wouldn't I be back? My mother's 
              in the hospital, I'm going to pay her a visit."
9796,ESTELLE,51," I know, but two days in a row? You didn't have to do this."
9797,GEORGE,51, You're my mother! What wouldn't I do for you?
9798,ESTELLE,51," You know what you could do? I haven't eaten lunch or dinner. 
              I can't eat this hospital food. Maybe you could run down to the 
              deli and get me a"
9799,GEORGE,51," (Smiling) You got it, Ma. (She smiles back, nodding) A 
              little later. (George sits back in a nearby chair, looking at the 
              divider in anticipation)"

              I'm weak."
9801,GEORGE,51," Well, wait a little while, Ma. What's the difference?"
9802,ESTELLE,51, I don't understand why you can't do this for me!
9803,GEORGE,51," (Standing up) I just got here, Ma! I'd like to spend a 
              little time with you."
9804,ESTELLE,51," But if you wait, they won't let you back in! Visiting 
              hours are almost over!"
9805,GEORGE,51," Ten minutes! Here, here, (Fishes a box of Tic-Tacs out 
              of his coat pocket and tosses them to her) Have some Tic-Tacs."

              impression? What impression?"

              away)"

9819,JOYCE,51, (Uneasy) He asked about you.

              me?! (Hangs off the side of the counter, both feet in the air) What 
              did he say?"
9821,JOYCE,51, He wanted to know your situation.
9822,ELAINE,51, (Quick) What situation? I have a situation?
9823,JOYCE,51, I-I told him you were single.

9844,JERRY,51," (Sarcastic) Oh, yeah, that's right, well, you fell asleep 
              one day on the sofa and I took them off your stinkin' feet. They 
              looked so good to me, I just had to"
9845,GEORGE,51," Yeah, well, they're my socks!"
9846,JERRY,51, They're my socks!
9847,GEORGE,51, Oh boy..
9848,JERRY,51, What are we doing here..
9849,GEORGE,51, ..Oh boy.
9850,JERRY,51, This is ridiculous.
9851,GEORGE,51, Do you believe this? We're fighting. We're fighting.
9852,JERRY,51, I haven't been myself lately. I've been snapping at everybody.
9853,GEORGE,51, Me too. I've been yelling at strangers on the street.
9854,ELAINE,51," Hello.. (Pulls a wad of bills out of her purse, and starts 
              to count it up)"
9855,GEORGE,51, (Shocked) You caved?!
9856,JERRY,51, It's over?
9857,GEORGE,51, You're out?
9858,JERRY,51, Ohh-my-God. The Queen is dead.
9859,GEORGE,51, I figured you'd cruise. At least through the Spring.
9860,JERRY,51, What happened?
9861,ELAINE,51, It was..uh.. John-John.
9862,JERRY AND GEORGE,51, Ohhhhh.. John-John.
9863,JERRY,51, But you made it through the day before.
9864,ELAINE,51," Yeah, but yesterday, he told Joyce, the aerobics teacher, 
              that he wants to meet me outside here at nine o' clock tonight."
9865,JERRY,51, Why outside here?
9866,ELAINE,51," Because he think I live here. Remember when we shared a 
              cab, and he dropped me off out in front? He's picking me up."
9867,JERRY,51," Alright, Costanza - it's just you and me."
9868,GEORGE,51," And then, (Smacks the money) there were two."

9871,MARLA,51, Let's go in the bedroom.
9872,JERRY,51, Really?
9873,MARLA,51, Yes.
9874,JERRY,51, You sure?
9875,MARLA,51, Yes.
9876,JERRY,51, You really want to?
9877,MARLA,51, I do. I'm ready.
9878,JERRY,51, Okay..
9879,MARLA,51, I know how difficult this must have been for you.
9880,JERRY,51, (Chuckles) You don't know the half of it.
9881,MARLA,51, What do you mean?
9882,JERRY,51," Well, it's kinda silly, but.."
9883,MARLA,51, Contest?! A contest! This is what you do with your friends?
9884,JERRY,51," No, it was just a bet. I mean, it actually started with 
              George and his mother-"
9885,MARLA,51," I don't want to hear another word. And to think how close 
              I came to you being the one! I must have been out of my mind."
9886,ELAINE,51," Marla? Hi, oh, I'm glad I ran into you-"
9887,MARLA,51," I don't want to have anything to do with you or your perverted 
              friends. (Confused, Elaine moves closer) Ooohh, get away from me! 
              You're horrible."
9888,[Setting,51, Jerry's apartment]
9889,ELAINE,51, What happened?
9890,JERRY,51, I told her about the contest.
9891,ELAINE,51," Ohh. Boy, she's a whack-o."
9892,GEORGE,51," (To Elaine) Hey, what happened?"
9893,ELAINE,51, What?
9894,GEORGE,51, I thought you were meeting Kennedy.
9895,ELAINE,51, (Let down) He didn't show.
9896,GEORGE,51," Yeah, he did."
9897,ELAINE,51," What? He's - He's out there? Oh, my God. I-I gotta go, 
              I gotta go.."
9898,GEORGE,51," No, no, no. He just left."
9899,ELAINE,51, What?
9900,GEORGE,51," Yeah, he was talking to Marla."
9901,JERRY,51, Marla?
9902,GEORGE,51," Yeah, I think, you know, she was, like, crying, and he 
              was consoling her, and then, she, uh, just got into his car, and 
              they just drove away."
9903,ELAINE,51," (Angered) He left with Marla, the virgin?"
9904,GEORGE,51, Yeah.
9905,ELAINE,51, They drove away?
9906,GEORGE,51," Yeah, drove away.. You know, I said 'Hello' to him. You 
              know, he's - he's-"
9907,JERRY,51," (Moving to the window, shocked) Oh my God in heaven!"
9908,ELAINE,51, (Makes a sound of surprise) Is that..?
9909,GEORGE,51, Kramer?!
9910,ELAINE,51, He's waving..

9930,Jerry,52, George is pickin' us up at the airport.
9931,Elaine,52, Get out of here! Why?
9932,Jerry,52, You know that awning outside my building?
9933,Elaine,52, Yeah...
9934,Jerry,52," He's always bragging about his vertical leap,

9943,Jerry,52," Uh, JFK. [To Elaine] I need some small bills 
              for a tip. You "
9944,Elaine,52," Yeah, you want five? "
9945,Jerry,52, Gimme ten.
9946,Elaine,52, You're giving him *ten* dollars?
9947,Jerry,52," Well, we got three bags."
9948,Elaine,52, That's a pretty big tip...
9949,Jerry,52, That's what they get!
9950,Elaine,52, They don't get that much.
9951,Jerry,52, Let's ask him.
9952,Elaine,52, We can't ask him...
9953,Jerry,52, Let's see what he says.
9954,Elaine,52," Jerry, we don't have time for this..."
9955,Jerry,52," Two seconds. [To Skycap] Excuse me, my friend 
              and I here, we were having a discussion and we were wondering what you 
              usually get for a tip."
9956,Skycap,52," Depends on the person, depends on the bag."
9957,Jerry,52," Uh, how about a couple of people like us."
9958,Skycap,52," People like you? I wouldn't expect much, you 
              don't even look like "
9959,Jerry,52," C'mon, seriously..."

              dollars a bag."
9961,Elaine,52, What!?
9962,Skycap,52, That's right.
9963,Elaine,52, *Five* dollars a bag? I don't think so.

9981,Elaine,52, There's no time.
9982,Jerry,52, No time? [To ticket lady] Is there time?
9983,TLady,52, There's no time.
9984,Jerry,52," There's no time. All right, we'll call him 
              from the plane."

              missing. I've"
9994,Elaine,52, You flew here coach.
9995,Jerry,52," Yeah, that's a point..."

              crashes, everybody in first class is going to die, anyway."

10010,George,52, I confused it with another awning.
10011,Kramer,52, So how we doin' on time?
10012,George,52," We're perfect. I timed this out so we would 
              pull up at the terminal *exactly* 17 minutes after their flight is 
              supposed to land. That gives them just enough time to get off 
              the plane, pick  up their bags and be walking *out* of the terminal 
              as we roll up. "

              Island Expressway? "

              There's supposed to ba blurb about Jerry in it and I think 
              he mentioned my name!"

10080,George,52," Hey Kramer, c'mon-- it was 240 bucks twenty 
              years ago..."
10081,Kramer,52," No, I'm gonna turn around... I'm gonna get 
              that guy..."
10082,George,52," No-no-no, Kramer. Kramer! Kramer! You *cannot* 
              abandon people in the middle of an airport pickup! It's a binding social 
              contract. "
10083,"Meanwhile, 32 000 feet above them, Elaine is still 
            waiting to get into the bathroom-- there's someone in there. *Finally*, 
            a ZZ Top reject comes out of the bathroom and, to paraphrase Jerry in ""The 
            Smelly Car""",52," ``I open the door, like a *punch* in the *face*, the stench hits 
            me--''. Elaine takes in a lungful of air and goes in. Brave little soldier."
10084,Jerry comes back from the *first class* washroom,52,
10085,Jerry,52," Tia, did you see all the flowers in that bathroom? 
              It's like an English garden in there."
10086,Attendant,52," They're gardenias, mostly."
10087,Jerry,52, I thought I smelled lilac.
10088,Attendant,52," Yes, there are a few of those, too..."
10089,Tia,52, It's almost overwhelming...
10090,The captain interrupts our little irony,52,
10091,Captain,52," Ladies and gentlemen, this is your captain 
              speaking. Due to equipment problems at the runway at Laguardia, we've 
              been "
10092,"Elaine exits the bathroom, exasperated and curious",52,
10093,Elaine,52," [To anyone who'll listen] What'd he say? What'd 
            he say?"
10094,George,52," Well, You're not gonna believe it..."
10095,Kramer,52, What?
10096,George,52," The plane's been re-routed *back* to Kennedy. 
            We've got 45 minutes."
10097,Kramer,52," Let's go. Listen to the bell, Grossbard-- 
            it tolls for thee."
10098,"In first class, Jerry and Tia get the lowdown on 
            the grub",52,
10099,Attendant,52," We have some *delicious* Chateau Briande, 
            my personal favourite."
10100,Jerry,52," Oh, saffron! That sounds good."
10101,Attendant,52," And today we're featuring wines from the 
            *Tuscany* region..."
10102,Jerry+Tia,52, Tuscany!
10103,Elaine,52, Hi. Can I get to my seat?
10104,Attendant,52, You're just gonna have to wait...
10105,Elaine,52," But you just passed it. I'm sitting right 
              there next to that guy..."
10106,Attendant,52," You're not supposed to get up during the 
              food service."
10107,Elaine,52," Well, nobody *told* me that!"
10108,Attendant,52," Look. This plane is *full*. I got a lot 
              of people to serve. "
10109,George,52, There it is. Gate 46... We got plenty of time.
10110,Kramer,52," Grossbard's plane leaves in ten minutes. I 
              *still* got time to "
10111,George,52," How you gonna catch him? He's probably boarded 
              the plane already."
10112,Kramer,52, Gimme your credit card.
10113,George,52, My credit card?
10114,Kramer,52," Just gimme the card, don't ask me any questions."
10115,George,52," I'm not gonna give you my card unless you 
              tell me what it's for!"
10116,Kramer,52," I'm gonna buy a ticket-- I'm gonna get on 
              that flight."
10117,George,52," What, are you, nuts? You're gonna spend more 
              on the ticket than you're gonna get back from Grossbard."
10118,Kramer,52," No, I'm not gonna use the ticket! I'm gonna 
              get my money, I'll get "
10119,George,52," This is a *great* idea! Here... use this one. 
              I get frequent flyer "
10120,Elaine,52," Excuse me. I'm sorry to make you do this, 
                but I got stuck in the aisle and the flight attendant wouldn't let me 
              get through. "
10121,Passenger 1,52," You're not supposed to get up during 
              the food service."
10122,Elaine,52," I'll try and remember that. [Pause] Where's 
              my meal?"
10123,Passenger 1,52," He asked me where you were, and you were 
              gone so long I thought you, uh, switched seats."
10124,Elaine,52," Excuse me? Excuse me, but I didn't get a meal."
10125,Attendant,52, Are you sure?
10126,Elaine,52," Yes, I'm sure! I would know if a tray of food 
              had been served to me."
10127,Attendant,52, Would you?
10128,Attendant,52," Well, the only meal left is a kosher meal."
10129,Elaine,52," Kosher meal? I don't want a kosher meal. I 
              don't even know what a kosher meal is."
10130,Passenger 1,52," I think it means when a Rabbi has inspected 
              it, or something."
10131,Passenger 2,52," No, no. It all has to do with the way 
              they kill the pig."
10132,Passenger 1,52, They don't eat pigs!
10133,Passenger 2,52," They do if it's killed right-- under 
            a Rabbi's supervision."
10134,Passenger 3,52," Oh, You know what? *I* ordered the kosher 
            meal."
10135,Elaine,52, Then why didn't you take it?
10136,Passenger 3,52," I ordered it six weeks ago, I forgot."
10137,Elaine,52, You're eating my food!
10138,Attendant,52," Look, I got earplugs to collect. Do you 
            want it, or not."
10139,J+T,52, Mmmmmmmm!
10140,Tia,52, This is the best sundae I've ever had.
10141,Jerry,52," Oh, man. You know what... they got the fudge 
            on the bottom-- y'see? "
10142,Tia,52, I've never met a man who knew so much about nothing.
10143,Jerry,52, Thank you...
10144,J+T,52, Mmmmmm!
10145,"with a decidedly unimpressed look. Back in first 
              class",52,
10146,Attendant,52, More anything?
10147,Jerry,52, More everything!
10148,Kramer,52," Look, I got Super Savers! C'mon."
10149,George,52, Super Savers? Are they refundable!?
10150,George,52," You bought non-refundable tickets, you idiot!"
10151,Kramer,52," She talked me in to it-- she said it was the 
              best deal."
10152,George,52," Do you know how much this is going to cost 
              me?"
10153,Kramer,52," Look, I'll tell you what-- I'll split it with 
              you"
10154,George,52," Look, I'm gonna go to the bathroom..."
10155,"Meanwhile, somewhere above New York, Elaine sneaks 
            into first class (she's so cute when she shows her rebellious side). 
            She just gets settled into a comfy seat complete with pillow (they 
            probably get rocks in, ugh, *coach*), when all of a sudden",52,
10156,Attendant,52, Excuse me... Excuuuse me...
10157,Elaine,52," What? Oh, no... nothing for me thanks."
10158,Attendant,52, What is your name?
10159,Elaine,52, Elaine Benes?
10160,Attendant,52," [Checks her list] You're going to have 
            to go back to coach."
10161,Elaine,52," No, but there was nobody sitting here..."
10162,Attendant,52," Yes, but you're still not allowed. These 
              seats are very expensive."
10163,Elaine,52," Oh, no, please, don't send me back there. 
              Please, I'll do anything. It's so nice up here. It's so comfortable 
              up here. I don't want to go back there. Please don't send me 
              back there... [She notices another attendant offering goods]              "
10164,Attendant,52," You're going to have to go back to your 
              seat!"
10165,Elaine,52," Ok, fine. I'll go back... You know, our goal 
              should be a society *without* *classes*! [She goes through the 
              curtain to,ick, *coach*] Do you realise that the people up here 
              are getting *cookies*!"
10166,Jerry,52," What is all the racket back there? You know, 
              you're trying to relax on the plane and this is what you have to put 
              up with. "
10167,Attendant,52," Sir, this woman tried to *sneak* into first 
              class."
10168,Jerry,52," Oh, you see, that's terrible. The problem is, 
              that curtain is no security-- there really should be a locking door."
10169,"Back on terra firma, Kramer is being escorted through 
              the airport by a security guy. He tries to talk his way out",52,
10170,Kramer,52, Hey! That guy owes me 240 bucks!
10171,Jerry,52, Couldn't be...
10172,(question,52," how would they know Kramer was there, 
              too? They didn't get a hold of George on the phone, or he would've went 
              to Laguardia in the first"
10173,Jerry,52, Where are they already? I don't see them anywhere...
10174,Jerry,52," I got my bags, I'm ready to go."
10175,Elaine,52," Yeah, *you* got *your* bags..."
10176,Elaine,52," The worst flight I have been on in my entire 
              life."
10177,Jerry,52," Yeah, me too..."
10178,Tia,52, I'll call you.
10179,Jerry,52," Okay... [To a bamboozled Elaine] It's a business 
              thing..."
10180,Kramer,52, You guys ready?
10181,Jerry,52, Yeah. Where's George?
10182,"Hmmm... We go to a shot outside the plane looking 
              in on a rather roughed up George Costanza. He screams",52,
10183,George,52,
10184,Jerry,52," But I have to admit, I like flying. I like 
              those little bathrooms that they have on the plane. It's kind of like a small 
              apartment of your own on the plane. You go in, you close the door, 
              the light comes on. It's like a small surprise party every time 
              you go in  there. The worst way of flying, I think is ""standby"", 
              you ever fly standby? It never works, you know, that's why they 
              call it standby-- "

10187,GEORGE,53," I loved her Jerry, I loved her. "
10188,JERRY,53," No, you didn't."
10189,GEORGE,53," And she loved me. Hoo, ho, she really did."
10190,JERRY,53, No she didn't.
10191,GEORGE,53," What am I going to do now? I can't live without Susan. 
            I gotta get her back. How? How, am I gonna get her back?"
10192,ELAINE,53," [OC] Not only didn't you love her, you didn't even like 
            her."
10193,GEORGE,53, Who says? 
10194,ELAINE,53, You did.
10195,GEORGE,53," Ah, ...A beautiful successful intelligent woman's in love 
              with me and I throw it all away. uh oh boy. Now I'll spend the rest 
              of my life living alone. I'll sit in my disgusting little apartment 
              watching basketball games, eating Chinese take out. Walking around 
            with no underwear. Because I'm too lazy to do a laundry."
10196,JERRY,53, You walk around with no underwear?
10197,GEORGE,53," Yeah, what do you do when you run out of laundry?"
10198,JERRY,53, I do a wash.
10199,GEORGE,53," Who am I going to meet who is better than her? No one, 
            Jerry. No one's better than her."
10200,JERRY,53, When you were with her you said you couldn't stand her.
10201,GEORGE,53, I loved her! 
10202,JERRY,53," You said goin up the steps of her apartment was like being 
            taken to a cell."
10203,GEORGE,53, I would give anything to be going up those stairs again.            
10204,GEORGE,53, I gotta call her. Should I call her?
10205,JERRY,53," George, I don't know if that is such a good idea?"
10206,GEORGE,53, Whyie?
10207,JERRY,53," You need some professional advice. Why don't you go see 
            Elaine's friend? She's a therapist. "
10208,GEORGE,53," I'm not going to see that nut doctor she went to Europe 
            with."
10209,JERRY,53," No, no no [Elaine enters, flossing teeth] Elaine what's 
              the name of that friend of yours ... that's a therapist ... the 
            woman."
10210,ELAINE,53, Dana Folley.
10211,JERRY,53," Right, Dana Folley."
10212,GEORGE,53, She any good?
10213,ELAINE,53," Yeah, she's terrific. Why? You thinking of going?"
10214,GEORGE,53," Wa, uh, ..."
10215,ELAINE,53, Tia? Who's that? 
10216,JERRY,53, She's the model I met on the plane.
10217,ELAINE,53, She sent you a Christmas card? 
10218,JERRY,53, Um uh. And we're going out Saturday night.
10219,GEORGE,53, My Darling Susan! My DARLING!!! 
10220,JERRY,53, What are you doing?
10221,ELAINE,53, ... date with Fred.
10222,JERRY,53, The religious guy?
10223,ELAINE,53, He's not THAT religious.
10224,JERRY,53, Let us pray.
10225,KRAMER,53," Hey, you got any Double Crunch?"
10226,JERRY,53, Yeah.
10227,JERRY,53," Kramer, should I call Susan?"
10228,KRAMER,53," Now what does the little man inside you say? See you gotta 
            listen to the little man."
10229,GEORGE,53, My little man doesn't know.
10230,KRAMER,53, The little man knows all. 
10231,GEORGE,53, My little man's an idiot.
10232,ELAINE,53," See, she was clever. You know she put her picture on a 
            card. I should do that. I never do anything like that. "
10233,KRAMER,53," You want a picture like that on a Christmas card? I can 
            do that for you. ..."
10234,GEORGE,53, She kept such a nice clean apartment. She was so sanitary.            
10235,ELAINE,53," No, no, I was just thinking out loud I don't want my picture 
            on a card."
10236,KRAMER,53," No, no, I'll take your picture. I'll take care of everything."
10237,GEORGE,53," She made a big breakfast every Sunday. I don't know what 
            she put in those eggs. "
10238,KRAMER,53," All right, ... now, you come on over. I'll have my cereal 
            and I'll take your picture."
10239,ELAINE,53, Really? Can you really take a picture?
10240,JERRY,53," Yeah, he's good. He takes good pictures. He's got equipment 
            over there."
10241,ELAINE,53," All right, ha ha "
10242,KRAMER,53, I don't know about that outfit though. 
10243,ELAINE,53, Why? What's wrong with it?
10244,KRAMER,53," Well, we'll have to improvise."
10245,GEORGE,53," (singing) Oh hey, if you happen to see the most beautiful 
              girl who walked out on me. Tell her I'm sorry. Tell her I need my 
            baby ... oh won't you tell her ... I love her. Oh hey, ..."
10246,JERRY,53, George I'm afraid I'm going to have to ask you to leave.            
10247,JERRY,53," So, I'm thinking of putting in na tropical fish tank right 
            here."
10248,TIA,53, Are you sure you're ready for that kind of comitment?
10249,JERRY,53," Well, I figure if it doesn't work out I can always flush 
            them down the toilet."
10250,TIA,53, That's horrible!
10251,JERRY,53, What's that perfume you're wearing?
10252,TIA,53," oh I completely forgot I want you to see this. The CALVIN 
            KLEIN ad I was telling you about came out today. "
10253,JERRY,53, What is that smell?
10254,TIA,53, It's here somewhere.
10255,JERRY,53, It smells like the beach.
10256,TIA,53, Exactly. 
10257,JERRY,53, Oh my God is that the new perfume? 
10258,TIA,53, Yeah.
10259,JERRY,53," I can't believe this. My next door neighbour had the idea 
              for this exact perfume last year. He even met with an executive 
            at CALVIN KLEIN. I can't believe they stole his idea."
10260,TIA,53, Are you sure?
10261,JERRY,53, And you're the model for this perfume?
10262,JERRY,53," Uh, that's him. He just came home. ... Uh, the door [Jerry 
            pushes his door against Kramer's entrance]"
10263,KRAMER,53, Hey
10264,JERRY,53, Hey.
10265,KRAMER,53," Hey, how ya' doing? [Trying to enter]"
10266,JERRY,53," Yeah, uh, I'll see you later. "
10267,KRAMER,53, I just wanted to borrow your Dust Buster.
10268,JERRY,53," All right come on in. ... Just wait over HERE! Just wait 
            here and I'll get it for you. ... Kramer this is Tia."
10269,KRAMER,53, Hello.
10270,KRAMER,53, How tall are you?
10271,TIA,53, Five ten.
10272,KRAMER,53, Come on lets see - Back to Back.
10273,JERRY,53, NO! Kramer!
10274,KRAMER,53," What's the matter with you? I just wanted to see how tall 
            she was."
10275,JERRY,53," Oh, you're tall - she's tall I'm tall. What's the difference 
            who's tall. We're all tall."
10276,KRAMER,53, What's that? 
10277,JERRY,53, What?
10278,KRAMER,53, That smell. What's that smell?
10279,JERRY,53, [starting the Dust Buster] What smell?
10280,KRAMER,53," It's very familiar. I can't put my finger on it. It's very 
            familiar."
10281,JERRY,53," Oh, they're all the same. Here. [gives him Dust Buster] 
            Now if you'll excuse us, .."
10282,KRAMER,53," Yeah, okay, So I'll see you tomorrow uh?"
10283,JERRY,53, Okay.
10284,KRAMER,53, Yeah. Nice meeting you.
10285,TIA,53, Nice meeting you too.
10286,JERRY,53, I'll see you later.
10287,JERRY,53," Ooow, that was close."
10288,KRAMER,53, [OC] THE BEACH!!!
10289,KRAMER,53," You smell like the beach. What's the name of that perfume? 
            you're wearing."
10290,TIA,53, It's Ocean by CALVIN KLEIN.
10291,KRAMER,53," CALVIN KLEIN? No, no. That's my idea. They, they stole 
              my idea. Y' see I had the idea of a cologne that makes you smell 
            like you just came from the beach."
10292,JERRY,53, I know look at this [shows ad]
10293,KRAMER,53," Whooo, ... That's you! What is going on here? The gyp(?) 
              he laughs at me then he steals my idea. I could have been a millionaire. 
              I could have been a fragrance millionaire, Jerry. ... They're not 
            going to get away with this."
10294,DANA,53," Hello. George, come in. Come in I've heard an awful lot about 
            you. Please sit down."
10295,GEORGE,53," Well hello. Um, ah, specifically the reason that I'm here, 
              uh, I don't know uh what Elaine told you but uh I broke up with 
              my girlfriend a couple of weeks ago. Actually she broke up with 
              me [struggling with his coat zipper] and uh, well, I was the cause 
              of it and uh, I just wanted to find out from you ... What's with 
            this thing?"
10296,DANA,53," So uh, she broke up with you? ... "
10297,GEORGE,53," Yeah, and, ... Why won't this go down? "
10298,DANA,53," It's all right don't worry about it. So, why did she break 
            up with you?"
10299,GEORGE,53, What is with this damn zipper?
10300,DANA,53," It doesn't matter. You'll fix it later. Tell me about your 
            girlfriend."
10301,GEORGE,53," It's stuck on a piece of cloth here. I can't get the cloth 
            out."
10302,DANA,53," It doesn't matter, so ..."
10303,GEORGE,53," This is a brand new jacket. Boy this really burns me up, 
            ..."
10304,DANA,53," George, George, look at me. Okay, forget about the zipper. 
            ... What's your girlfriend's name?"
10305,GEORGE,53, ... Susan.
10306,DANA,53," Okay, we're getting somewhere."
10307,GEORGE,53," UH, ha ha, ... It's just SO frustrating. It's a brand new 
            jacket."
10308,ELAINE,53," Anyway so Fred and I are going to do some volunteer work 
            for that Church on Amsterdam."
10309,JERRY,53," Oh, volunteer work!. See that's what I like about the holiday 
              season. That's the true spirit of Christmas. People being helped 
              by people other than me. That makes me feel good inside. Look at 
              what we have here. [mail]. A Christmas card from Laine. You didn't 
            have to go to all that trouble."
10310,ELAINE,53, It was no trouble. My assistant did the whole thing.
10311,JERRY,53, I didn't even see the picture. How did it come out?
10312,ELAINE,53," Well, you know. It's a picture?"
10313,JERRY,53, Oh yeah. Look at that. Looks good. Kramer did a good job.
10314,ELAINE,53," Yeah, well. How hard is it to take a picture?"
10315,JERRY,53, ... um ...
10316,ELAINE,53, What?
10317,JERRY,53, Did you look at look at this picture carefully?
10318,ELAINE,53, Carefully?
10319,JERRY,53," Because I'm not sure and and and correct me if I'm wrong 
            but I think I see ... a nipple."
10320,ELAINE,53, What?
10321,JERRY,53," Here. Take a look. What, what is that?"
10322,ELAINE,53, (gasps) Oh my God! That's my nipple. 
10323,JERRY,53, That's what I thought.
10324,ELAINE,53," That's my nipple. My nipple's exposed. I sent this card 
            to hundreds of people! My parents. My boss. Uh, Nana and Papa. "
10325,JERRY,53, DIDN'T YOU LOOK AT THE PICTURE?
10326,ELAINE,53," Oh God I didn't notice. Oh, what am I going to do? You 
              know your whole life you go through painstaking efforts to hide 
              your nipple and then BOOM, suddenly hundreds of people get their 
            own personal shot of it. "
10327,KRAMER,53, Hey!
10328,ELAINE,53, Have you seen the card? 
10329,KRAMER,53, What card?
10330,ELAINE,53, This car.
10331,KRAMER,53," Yeah, yeah. Of course. I took it."
10332,ELAINE,53, Well did you notice anything unusual about it?
10333,KRAMER,53, No.
10334,ELAINE,53, Well come here and take a look. 
10335,KRAMER,53," Yeah, so?"
10336,ELAINE,53," So, what's that?"
10337,KRAMER,53, That's a nipple.
10338,ELAINE,53, Right!!
10339,KRAMER,53, Ooo!
10340,ELAINE,53," Aw, great!? Didn't you see that? "
10341,KRAMER,53," Aw, no, no I didn't notice it. no, uh, "
10342,ELAINE,53, It's because you made me wear that stupid shirt. 
10343,JERRY,53," Well, maybe no one noticed it. You didn't notice it. Let 
            me go get Newman. We'll see if he sees it."
10344,ELAINE,53, No. I don't want him looking.
10345,JERRY,53, Oh what's the difference. Everybody else you know has it.            
10346,ELAINE,53," Oh my God. I sent one to the super in my building. My mailman. 
              My ten year old little nephew. Sister Mary Catherine. Father Chelios. 
            Oh my God Fred! I sent one to Fred."
10347,NX,53, Okay. What is it?
10348,JERRY,53," Take a look at this card. Tell me if you notice anything 
            unusual about it."
10349,NX,53, Your nipple's showing.
10350,JERRY,53, Okay. Thanks.
10351,NX,53, Anything else? 
10352,JERRY,53, No. 
10353,NX,53, All right. See you later.
10354,JERRY,53," What? So what? It's a nipple. A little round circular protuberance. 
            What's the big deal? See everybody's got them. See I got them. "
10355,KRAMER,53, I got them too. 
10356,JERRY,53, Everybody's got them. 
10357,DANA,53," You see it's kind of got a little piece of cloth that's slipped 
            underneath and it's ..."
10358,GEORGE,53, Pull it up a little bit.
10359,DANA,53," Uhg. Well you hold it. Wait, uh, Damn It! I can't move it. 
              God, I've never seen a zipper so stubborn. DAMN IT! I almost had 
            it. "
10360,GEORGE,53," Yeah, okey, wait wait. That will separate. "
10361,DANA,53, No. Let me try...
10362,GEORGE,53, Take it right off the chest...
10363,DANA,53," Ugh, .."
10364,GEORGE,53, You're gonna rip it. You're gonna rip it.
10365,DANA,53," YEAH!! UGH!!! ARG!!! ... I am afraid we're going to have 
            to stop."
10366,GEORGE,53," Okay. Uh, my mother is is going to pay for the sessions. 
            ... Oh,Elaine?"
10367,DANA,53, Yeah.
10368,GEORGE,53, [stares at card]
10369,JERRY,53," No, No, No, No, Oh, No."
10370,JERRY,53," Well every day for the past four days she hasn't returned 
            one call. "
10371,GEORGE,53, Was it a scratch or a pick? 
10372,JERRY,53, It was a scratch. 
10373,GEORGE,53, Hey. It's me.
10374,JERRY,53," Don't you think I know the difference between a pick and 
            a scratch? "
10375,JERRY,53, Yeah?
10376,ELAINE,53, (OC) It's me. 
10377,JERRY,53, Come on up. 
10378,GEORGE,53, Was there any nostril penetration?
10379,JERRY,53," There may have been some incidental penetration. But from 
            her angle she was in no position to make the call. "
10380,GEORGE,53," So let's say in her mind she witnessed a pick. Okay, so 
            then what?"
10381,JERRY,53," Is that so unforgivable? Is that like breaking a commandment? 
            Did God say to Moses thou shalt not pick? "
10382,GEORGE,53," I guarantee you that Moses was a picker. You wander throughh 
              the desert for forty years with that dry air. ... You telling me 
            you're not going to have occasion to clean house a little bit. "
10383,JERRY,53," Let me ask you something. If you were going out with somebody 
              and if she did that what would, would you do? Would you continue 
            going out with her?"
10384,GEORGE,53, No. That's disgusting! 
10385,ELAINE,53," You cannot believe what I'm going through. That card is 
              plastered all over the office. Everybody is calling me, Nip! ... 
              Yeah. That's my new nickname at the office. Nip! These guys keep 
              asking me out for drinks. Not only that, Fred, you know the guy 
              I told you about? He hasn't called me in three days. ... [sees card] 
            Oh please!"
10386,GEORGE,53," Hey. How come I didn't get a Christmas card? Everybody 
              else got one. Jerry got one, Kramer got one. I thought we were good 
            friends. I don't get a Christmas card. I don't get it. "
10387,ELAINE,53," You want a Christmas card? You want a Christmas card? All 
              right here. [rubs George's head on her breasts] Here's your Christmas 
            card. "
10388,KRAMER,53, Got any Double Crunch?
10389,JERRY,53, yeah. I think I do. 
10390,KRAMER,53, What's that perfume?
10391,ELAINE,53," What, Ocean."
10392,KRAMER,53," That's mine. That's my smell. Jerry you've got to get that 
            model to get me an appointment with CALVIN KLEIN."
10393,JERRY,53," I can't She won't return my calls because she caught me 
            in a pick at a light."
10394,KRAMER,53, I thought you said it was a scratch. 
10395,JERRY,53, But that's not what she thinks. 
10396,GEORGE,53," Why don't you call her agency. Maybe she's been out of 
            town and she didn't get the calls. "
10397,JERRY,53," All right. I'll call the agency. [Elaine grabs card from 
              George] Hello. Yes, I'm trying to get in touch with Tia Van Camp. 
              Do you know if she's been in town? She's been in town. Oh really. 
              well thank you very much. [hangs up] She has been in town. She's 
            at CALVIN KLEIN's right now."
10398,KRAMER,53, Let's go. 
10399,GEORGE,53, It'll be different this time. 
10400,SUSAN,53, I need someone a little more stable.
10401,GEORGE,53," I'm not stable? I'm like a rock. I take these glasses off, 
              you can't tell the difference between me and a rock. I put these 
              glasses on a rock. You know what jumps into most people's minds? 
            Costanza! "
10402,SUSAN,53, People don't change.
10403,GEORGE,53," I change I change. Two weeks ago I tried a soft boiled 
              egg. Never liked it before. Now I'm dunkin a piece of toast in there 
            and I'm loving it. "
10404,SUSAN,53, I'm not a soft boiled egg. 
10405,GEORGE,53, And I am not a piece of toast. 
10406,SUSAN,53, I just don't think we have anything in common. 
10407,GEORGE,53," That's okay. That's good. You think Louie Pasteur and his 
              wife had anything in common? He was in the fields all day with the 
              cows, you know with the milk, examining the milk, delving into milk, 
              consummed with milk. Pasteurization, Homogenization, She was in 
            the kitchen killing cockroaches with a boot on each hand. "
10408,SUSAN,53, Why were there so many cockroaches? 
10409,GEORGE,53," Because. There was a lot of cake lying around the house. 
              Just sitting there going with all the excess milk from all the experiments 
            [grins] "
10410,SUSAN,53, And they got along?
10411,GEORGE,53," Yes! Yes. You know. She didn't know about Pasteurization. 
            He didn't know anout Fumigation. But they made it work!"
10412,KRAMER,53, I want to talk to Calvin.
10413,SECRETARY,53, You can't go in there.
10414,KRAMER,53, Let me talk to Calvin.
10415,TIA,53, Kramer?
10416,KRAMER,53," Yeah, uh."
10417,CALVIN KLEIN,53, Who are you?
10418,KRAMER,53, I'm here to talk about the ocean. 
10419,CALVIN KLEIN,53," Oh, yes kramer. I uh, think I know something about 
            this. Will you excuse us Tia? [Tia leaves]"
10420,KRAMER,53, Now I don't want any trouble Calvin. 
10421,CALVIN KLEIN,53, Neither do I.
10422,JERRY,53, Hello there you are.
10423,TIA,53, What are you doing here?
10424,JERRY,53," Well, I had to talk to you - I noticed you haven't been 
            returning my calls."
10425,TIA,53," Well, I've been busy."
10426,JERRY,53," Because I - I thought we had a good time the other night, 
              an' the only explanation I can come up with is that you think that 
            you caught me (flustered, he"
10427,TIA,53, (Waving him off) I'd rather not talk about this..
10428,JERRY,53, But I was clearly on the outer edge of the nostril.
10429,TIA,53, I know what I saw. (Turns toward the elevators)
10430,JERRY,53," But there - but there was no pick! I - I did not pick! There 
            ws no piick!"
10431,TIA,53, I gotta go. (Quickly walks away from Jerry)
10432,JERRY,53, No! No pick!
10433,[Setting,53, Calvin Klein's office]
10434,KRAMER,53," All right, now here's the scoop, Jockey. I, uh, I came 
            in here last January to talk to one of your ffflunkies.."
10435,KLEIN,53, (Reflecting on Kramer) Interesting face..
10436,KRAMER,53," Yeah.. And, um, when I told him my idea about the beach 
            cologne, you know, he - he laughed at me."
10437,KLEIN,53," You're very lithe, aren't you? Very graceful."
10438,KRAMER,53," Well, yeah."
10439,KLEIN,53," Sit down, eh? (Kramer, misjudging one side of the couch, 
            sits down uncomfortably) You're very lean, but muscular.."
10440,KRAMER,53," You know, I try to take care of myself. I - I watch what 
            I eat. Ah, just recently I cut out fructose."
10441,KLEIN,53, You're spectacular.
10442,KRAMER,53, (Flattered) Oh?
10443,[Setting,53, Elaine's office]
10444,ELAINE,53," I told you, Fred - my friend's next door neighbor took 
            it."
10445,FRED,53, (Incredulous) Soo - what happened?!
10446,ELAINE,53," Well, I-I-I must a missed a button. I forgot to button 
            it."
10447,FRED,53, I really don't see how you could miss a button like that.
10448,ELAINE,53," Oh, you've never missed a button?! (Phone rings, she puts 
            it on speakerphone) Yeah?.."
10449,RECEPTIONIST,53," Your sister, Gail."
10450,ELAINE,53," Oh, God - my nephew. (Picks up the phone and hits the button) 
            Hi, Gail!.. Yu.. yu... Yes, Gail, I know how old he is."
10451,CO-WORKER,53," (Pokes his head into the doorway) Hey, Nip, ya need 
            that manuscript or can I take it home?"
10452,ELAINE,53," Yeah, take it! Take it!.. An' stop calling me ""Nip""! (Co-worker 
              takes it and quickly leaves. Elaine goes back to the phone) It was 
            an accident! Well.."
10453,[Setting,53, Susan's apartment building]
10454,[Setting,53, Calvin Klein's office]
10455,WOMAN,53," About the focus group? I had nothing to do with the focus 
              group. What's your point? (She sees Kramer emerge from another room. 
            He's wearing only"
10456,KLEIN,53, His buttocks are sublime!
10457,MAN,53," Of course, his pectorals could use a little work - I suppose 
            we could get him into the weight room."
10458,WOMAN,53," (Mesmerized with Kramer's body) No, let's get him in the 
            studio today. We can send these out immediately."
10459,MAN,53," You've done it again, C.K.!"
10460,[Setting,53, Calvin Klein office building]
10461,JERRY,53," An' what if I did do it? Even though I admit to nothing, 
              and never will. What does that make me? And I'm not here just defending 
            myself but all those"
10462,[Setting,53, Elaine's office]
10463,ELAINE,53," I did not bare myself deliberately, but I tell you, I wish 
              now that I had! (Fred, shocked by her speech, flees. She calls after 
              him, still standing at the hallway) Because it is not me that has 
            been exposed, but you! For I have seen the nipple on your soul!"
10464,GX,53," So the minute I started up the steps to her apartment I knew 
              I made a terrible mistake. Going back with her. So we're in her 
              apartment she goes into the bathroom. I'm cursing myself; now how 
              do I get out of this? Then it hits me like a bolt of lightening. 
            The pick. "
10465,JERRY,53, The pick?
10466,ELAINE,53, The pick?
10467,GEORGE,53," She comes out of the bathroom, I'm in up to my wrist. You 
            should have seen the look on her face. "
10468,JERRY,53, I think I've seen that look. 
10469,KRAMER,53, I've got the magazine. The underwear ad came out.
10470,JERRY,53," Boy, they really worked on your pectorals. "
10471,GEORGE,53, Your buttocks are spectacular.

11884,STU,63, Yeah. Right.
11885,CASTING DIRECTOR,63," 
          This is Mark Matts. He'll be auditioning for the role of George. (the 
          guy looks very cool and casual, and has a lot of hair)"
11886,MARK,63," Hey how 
          you doing?"
11887,JERRY,63," (thinking) 
          They've gotta be kidding."
11888,GEORGE,63," (thinking) 
          This guy's perfect."
11889,CASTING DIRECTOR,63," 
          O.K. Let's read this. I'll be reading Jerry's part."
11890,MARK,63," Anyone call 
          for Vandelay Industries? (George is the only one in the room to find 
          Mark funny)"
11891,CASTING DIRECTOR,63," 
          No. Why?"
11892,CASTING DIRECTOR,63," 
          I'm Vandelay Industries?"
11893,MARK,63, Right.
11894,CASTING DIRECTOR,63," 
          What is that?"
11895,MARK,63," You're in 
          latex."
11896,CASTING DIRECTOR,63," 
          What do I do with latex?"
11897,MARK,63," I don't 
          know, you manufacture it."
11898,CASTING DIRECTOR,63," 
          This is Michael Barth. Another George. (he's in sweat pants, bald, with 
          glasses)"
11899,ALL,63," Hi Michael. 
          How you doing?"
11900,JERRY,63," Everything 
          all right?"
11901,MICHAEL,63," I just 
          came from the podiatrist. I have a mole on my foot. I've got a little 
          gangrene, they're probably gonna have to amputate. (everyone laugh except 
          George)"
11902,CASTING DIRECTOR,63," 
          Any questions?"
11903,MICHAEL,63," Yeah. 
          What are we looking at here? Is this guy like a real loser?"
11904,GEORGE,63," No, not 
          a loser!"
11905,CASTING DIRECTOR,63," 
          Let's start with the second scene. You have it here?"
11906,MICHAEL,63," A man 
          gave me a, you know, massage. (everyone laugh except George)"
11907,CASTING DIRECTOR,63," 
          So?"
11908,MICHAEL,63," Well, 
          he-- he had his hands, you know, and uh, he was, huh, ..."
11909,CASTING DIRECTOR,63," 
          He was what?"
11910,MICHAEL,63," He was 
          you know... he was touching and rubbing. (loud laughter)"
11911,CASTING DIRECTOR,63," 
          That's a massage."
11912,MICHAEL,63," I think 
          it moved."
11913,CASTING DIRECTOR,63," 
          This is Melissa Shannon."
11914,MELISSA,63, Hi.
11915,ALL,63," Hi. How you 
          doing."
11916,CASTING DIRECTOR,63," 
          Melissa is reading for Elaine."
11917,MELISSA,63," It's 
          like a bald convention out there! (she saw George) Sorry. I, uh, made 
          a faux pas."
11918,JERRY,63," No you 
          didn't. He knows he's bald."
11919,MELISSA,63," So how 
          about that guy wearing sweat pants? I mean did he do that for the part 
          or does he walk around like that? (Jerry approves with a nod, George 
          drops his notepad on the coffee table)"
11920,CASTING DIRECTOR,63," 
          O.K. Shall we start? (Melissa and the casting director sit down)"
11921,JERRY,63," (getting 
          up) Uh, you know what? I'll read with her."
11922,MELISSA,63," Oh, great."
11923,JERRY,63," Alright, 
          want to start?"
11924,MELISSA,63, Yeah.
11925,JERRY,63, O.K.
11926,MELISSA,63," Ahem. 
          What was that look?"
11927,JERRY,63, What look?
11928,MELISSA,63," That 
          look you just gave me?"
11929,JERRY,63," I gave 
          a look?"
11930,MELISSA,63, Yes.
11931,GEORGE,63," Thank 
          you! Thank you very much. (Jerry and Melissa stop and look at George)"
11932,CASTING DIRECTOR,63," 
          Let's see some more Kramers."
11933,ALL,63," Hi. How you 
          doing?"
11934,TOM,63," (to Jerry 
          and very seriously) How you doing?"
11935,JERRY,63," (smiling 
          and surprised at the way Tom is talking) Good."
11936,CASTING DIRECTOR,63," 
          What is this about?"
11937,TOM,63," (standing) 
          Levels."
11938,CASTING DIRECTOR,63," 
          Levels?"
11939,TOM,63," Yeah. I'm 
          getting rid of all, all my furniture. All of it! I'm building... levels... 
          with steps... completely carpeted... (making the gesture of carpeting 
          steps) with pillows. (everyone laugh. He sits down) Like Ancient Egypt."
11940,CASTING DIRECTOR,63," 
          I don't know how you're gonna be comfortable like that?"
11941,TOM,63," Oh! I'll 
          be comfortable. (laughter, applause. He gets up, goes to the coffee 
          table)"
11942,GEORGE,63, Very nice
11943,JERRY,63, Very good
11944,GEORGE,63," Very nice 
          Tom, that was terrific."
11945,TOM,63," May I? (pointing 
          the box of raisins)"
11946,GEORGE,63," Sure. 
          Thank you for coming in. (Tom eats some raisins)"
11947,JERRY,63," (to George) 
          It was a wonderful reading."
11948,GEORGE,63," Yeah. 
          Really."
11949,TOM,63," Well, bye."
11950,GEORGE,63," Take care. 
          Take it easy. (Tom leaves with the casting director)"
11951,STU,63," Now, I thought 
          he was really good, very funny."
11952,JERRY,63," Yeah, I 
          liked him."
11953,GEORGE,63," What happened 
          to the raisins?"
11954,JAY,63," Yeah, there 
          was a box of raisins there!"
11955,GEORGE,63," Did he 
          just steal the raisins?"
11956,STU,63," You think 
          he stole them?"
11957,CASTING DIRECTOR,63," 
          (enters with the real Kramer) This is Martin Van Nostrand."
11958,JERRY,63," (to Kramer) 
          What are you doing here?"
11959,CASTING DIRECTOR,63," 
          You two know each other?"
11960,STU,63," Wait a minute, 
          I know you. You're the guy from the Calvin Klein underwear ads."
11961,KRAMER,63," That's 
          true."
11962,KRAMER,63," (acting 
          very bad) I saw Joe DiMaggio in Dinky Doughnuts again, but this time, 
          I went in. (pause, stops acting) Oh! Uh, where's the bathroom?"
11963,STU,63," I think if 
          you go down the hall, it's on the right at the very end."
11964,KRAMER,63," Yeah. 
          Be right back. (Kramer leaves)"
11965,[setting,63, Monk's]
11966,ELAINE,63," So who's 
          playing Elaine?"
11967,JERRY,63," Oh, don't 
          worry about it. Very talented, very takented young actress."
11968,ELAINE,63, Really?
11969,JERRY,63, Yes.
11970,ELAINE,63," Who is 
          it?"
11971,JERRY,63," She's an 
          eskimo, actually."
11972,ELAINE,63," Oh, my 
          God (not in the mood to be kidding)"
11973,JERRY,63," She came 
          down from Juno by sleigh, she was in the Iditarod. Got to the finish 
          line, just kept going. She's got the dogs with her in the hotel room."
11974,ELAINE,63," Listen, 
          was Russell at the casting?"
11975,JERRY,63," No, he 
          didn't show up."
11976,ELAINE,63," You know, 
          I'm a little bit worried about him. I don't understand. We had one date 
          two months ago. Am I that charming and beautiful?"
11977,JERRY,63," No. No 
          you're not."
11978,ELAINE,63," Why do 
          I keep setting you up?"
11979,JERRY,63," I don't 
          know."
11980,ELAINE,63," (to the 
          waitress) Could we get a little more? (she doesn't listen and walks 
          away) Aghh... You know ever since this new owner took over, the service 
          here is *really* slow."
11981,JERRY,63," Yeah. Have 
          you noticed anything else that's different since the new management?"
11982,ELAINE,63," Mmm. They're 
          putting a little lemon in the tuna. I love that."
11983,JERRY,63," Beside 
          that. Look at the waitresses."
11984,ELAINE,63," Yeah? 
          (we see that all the waitresses have big breasts)"
11985,JERRY,63," What physical 
          characteristic would you say is common to all of them?"
11986,ELAINE,63, Ah...
11987,JERRY,63," I mean 
          look at this. Every waitress working here has the same proportions. 
          Wouldn't you say?"
11988,ELAINE,63," Yes, I 
          would say."
11989,JERRY,63," What's 
          going on here. How is that possible?"
11990,ELAINE,63," Do you 
          think it's a coincidence?"
11991,JERRY,63," No. I haven't 
          seen four women like this together outside of a Russ Meyer film."
11992,ELAINE,63," (to the 
          waitress) Hi. Excuse me. Who does all the hiring waitresses here?"
11993,WAITRESS,63," He does. 
          (pointing to the manager, Mr. Visaki) In fact we're looking for another 
          girl if you know anyone. (she walks away)"
11994,ELAINE,63," You know 
          what? That's discriminatory. That is unfair. Why should these women 
          have all the advantages? It's not enough they get all the attention 
          from men, they have to get all the waitress jobs, too?"
11995,JERRY,63," Hey that's 
          life. Good-looking men have the same advantages. You don't see any handsome 
          homeless."
11996,[setting,63," doctor's

11997,GEORGE,63," You see, 
          It's right here. It's all white..."
11998,DOCTOR,63," Oh yeah. 
          Yeah. I've never seen this before."
11999,GEORGE,63," You've 
          never seen this before?"
12000,DOCTOR,63," I'm gonna 
          have to take a biopsy on that. (George grabs the doctor's arm)"
12001,GEORGE,63," (dramatically) 
          A what?"
12002,DOCTOR,63, A biopsy.
12003,GEORGE,63, A biopsy?
12004,DOCTOR,63, Yeah.
12005,GEORGE,63," Cancer? 
          Is it cancer? Do I have cancer?"
12006,DOCTOR,63," Well I 
          don't know what it is."
12007,[setting,63, Jerry's]
12008,GEORGE,63, A biopsy!
12009,JERRY,63," What did 
          he say?"
12010,GEORGE,63," He said 
          he didn't know what it was."
12011,JERRY,63," Alright. 
          So?"
12012,JERRY,63," Well, maybe 
          he doesn't have a ""get outta here"" kind of personality."
12013,JERRY,63," Can't you 
          at least die with a little dignity?"
12014,GEORGE,63," No I can't. 
          I can't die with dignity. I have no dignity. I want to be the one person 
          who doesn't die with dignity. I live my whole life in shame. Why should 
          I die with dignity?"
12015,JERRY,63," Hey. What 
          happened to you yesterday?"
12016,KRAMER,63," I got 
          mugged."
12017,GEORGE,63," You got 
          mugged?"
12018,JERRY,63, Mugged?
12019,KRAMER,63," Well, 
          I wouldn't have minded it so much but I was running home to go to the 
          bathroom."
12020,JERRY,63," Why didn't 
          you use the bathroom in the building?"
12021,KRAMER,63," It was 
          full. I tried a few other places, you know, but that didn't work. I 
          mean it was an emergency Jerrry. I was really percolating... So I decided 
          to run home through the park and then these two guys they stopped me 
          and... "
12022,JERRY,63, Yeah?
12023,ELAINE,63, It's me.
12024,JERRY,63," Come on 
          up."
12025,KRAMER,63," But now 
          I have a big problem, buddy."
12026,JERRY,63," What is 
          it?"
12027,KRAMER,63," Well, 
          I waited so long I-- I missed my chance."
12028,JERRY,63," You didn't 
          go?"
12029,KRAMER,63," No. And 
          now I can't get it back."
12030,JERRY,63," The % thing 
          to do is just not think about it."
12031,KRAMER,63," How could 
          you not think about it?"
12032,ELAINE,63, Hey.
12033,KRAMER,63," (mumbles 
          and leaves)"
12034,ELAINE,63," What's 
          the matter with him?"
12035,JERRY,63," He's a 
          little backed up."
12036,ELAINE,63, Oh...
12037,GEORGE,63, Elaine.
12038,ELAINE,63," So I spoke 
          to some of my sisters about that coffee shop."
12039,JERRY,63," Oh, the 
          sisters (he sits at the table)"
12040,GEORGE,63," (to Jerry) 
          Have you seen the waitresses in there lately? I never had so much coffee 
          in my life."
12041,ELAINE,63," So we 
          decided I should go over there and apply for a job myself."
12042,GEORGE,63," Apply 
          for a job? What for?"
12043,ELAINE,63," Because, 
          it's discriminatory (she comes back wearing one of Jerry's shirt, untucked)"
12044,GEORGE,63," It's a 
          coincidence."
12045,JERRY,63," This is 
          what you gonna wear?"
12046,ELAINE,63, Yeah.
12047,JERRY,63," You're 
          not gonna get the job."
12048,ELAINE,63, Exactly.
12049,JERRY,63," (to the 
          phone) Hello. Oh, hi. Yeah I guess we could do that. At what time? All 
          right. I'll see you there. O.K., bye. (hangs up)"

          Elaine character is based on someone you know."
12057,JERRY,63, Yes.
12058,SANDI,63," And she's 
          really your ex-girlfriend?"
12059,JERRY,63," Uh, Huh, 
          yeah."
12060,SANDI,63," I want 
          to get to know her from the inside. What is she like? Tell me about 
          her."
12061,JERRY,63," Well, she's 
          fascinated with Greenland. She enjoys teasing animals, banlon, and seeing 
          people running for their lives. She loves throwing garbage out the window, 
          yet she's extremely dainty."

          she eat a hamburger?"

          she cuts her pasta with a knife."

          good. What's her favorite movie?"

          to get me a picture. What about sex?"
12073,JERRY,63," She likes 
          talking during sex."
12074,SANDI,63," Oh... dirty 
          talking?"
12075,JERRY,63," No. Just

          accent) What can I do for you? Would you like a table."
12095,ELAINE,63," No, I'd 
          like to apply for a waitress job."
12096,Mr. VISAKI,63," (looks 
          Elaine up and down) Have you ever waited on tables before."
12097,ELAINE,63," Oh yeah. 
          I've been a professional waitress for the last 10 years. I've worked 
          all over the city. These, uh, are my references. I'm sure you'll find 
          that I'm more than qualified."
12098,Mr. VISAKI,63," I 
          don't think I need anyone else right now."
12099,ELAINE,63," You're 
          in big trouble mister. And I mean trouble with a capital 'T'. (she leaves)"
12100,Mr. VISAKI,63," What? 
          What did I do?"
12101,[setting,63," The 
          Equal Employment Opportunity Commission Office]"
12102,ELAINE,63," Anyway 
          there's at least four of them, and they're all huge. And one is bigger 
          than the next. It's like a Russ Meyer movie."
12103,FRED,63," Who's Russ 
          Meyer?"
12104,ELAINE,63," Oh, he's 
          this guy who made these terrible movies in the 70's with these kinds 
          of women. He's obsessed. He's obsessed with breasts. That's hard to 
          say."
12105,FRED,63," Anyway, 
          go on."
12106,ELAINE,63," Um... 
          Well, there's not really much more to tell. He was looking for waitresses, 
          and I went in to apply for the job. And, he looked me up and down and 
          he rejected me."
12107,FRED,63," (to a guy 
          in the hall at the water cooler machine) Paul. Come in for a second. 
          I want you to listen to this."
12108,PAUL,63," (to Elaine) 
          Hi."
12109,ELAINE,63, Hi.
12110,FRED,63," Paul, woman 
          here claims there's a restaurant on the West side that's only hiring 
          large-breasted women."
12111,PAUL,63," (to Elaine)

            how to say the lines."

            to Jerry) So you think this guy playing Kramer took the raisins?"

            he steal a box of raisins?"
12133,GEORGE,64," Yeah,

            some of the raisins. And then you left, and the raisins were gone. 
            And I was just wondering if, you know (chuckles), maybe you took them 
            with you."

            Why would I steal a box of raisins!?"
12159,GEORGE,64," No you 
            wouldn't. Nobody would. It's just that... they were missing, and... 
            well I'm just inquiring. (chuckles nervously)"
12160,TOM,64," Let me 
            give you a word of advice. O.K.? I want you to stay away from me. 
            I don't wanna talk to you, and I don't wanna hear anymore of your 
            stupid little notes and suggestions. I don't like you. So if you got 
            any other problems whether it's raisins, prunes, figs, or any other 
            dried fruit, just keep it to yourself and stay out of my way, O.K.?"
12161,GEORGE,64," Mm-hmm.

            Will you call me? Would you call me? Well, why? All right. May I call

            the raisins."

            my friend, (Jerry puts his hand on Kramer's shoulder) it may be time 
            to consider the dreaded apparatus."

            Hold it right there. If you're suggesting what I think you're suggesting, 
            you're wasting your time. I am not Jerry, under any circumstances,

            pull together as a team. Life's too short. I say, let's let bygones 
            be bygones. If you took the raisins, if you didn't take the raisins-- 
            They weren't even my raisins. I was just curious because it seems 
            like a strange to do to walk into a room, audition, and to walk out 
            with a box of raisins. Anyway, whatever. If you ever want to tell 
            me about it, the door to my office is always opened. In the event 
            that I get an office. You'll come in, we'll talk about the raisins.

            Listen. When he's finished, send him over to my house."

            sending him to your house."
12299,TOM,64, Why not?
12300,JERRY,64," Because 
            the judge decreed he'd become my butler, not my friend's butler."
12301,TOM,64," Jerry, 
            he is your butler. You can give him any order you want. That's what 
            butlers do."
12302,JERRY,64," But I 
            don't want to."

12313,SANDI,64," We had 
            a date."
12314,JERRY,64," You had 
            a date? You went out with my butler? Who said you could go out with 
            my butler?"
12315,SANDI,64," Why do 
            I need your permission?"
12316,JERRY,64," Because 
            he's my butler!"

            his style. He has a sort of casual elegance."

            picks his nose."

            notice a lot of butlers are named Jeeves?"
12326,JERRY,64," You know 
            I think when you name a baby Jeeves, you've pretty much mapped out 
            his future, wouldn't you say? Not much chance is gonna be a hitman

            honest with you. Nobody really knows. He seems to have disappeared."

            event, I've been made the new president of NBC. As you may or may 
            not know, Russell and I did not see eye to eye on many, many projects. 
            And as my first order of business, I'm, uh, passing on your show."

12390,JERRY,65, A female orgasm is kinda like the bat cave. A very few people know where it is and if you're lucky enough to see it you probably don't know how you got there and you can't find you way back after you left.
12391,You know there are two types of female orgasm,65," the real and the fake. And I'll tell you right now, as a man, we don't know. We do not know, because to man sex is like a car accident and determining the female orgasm is like being asked 'What did you see after the car went out of control?'. 'I heard a lot of screeching sounds. I remember I was facing the wrong way at one point. And in the end my body was thrown clear."

12398,GEORGE,65, I think so.
12399,JERRY,65, You don't know?
12400,GEORGE,65, I can't tell anymore. 
12401,JERRY,65, Well do you feel anything?
12402,GEORGE,65, Feel? What's that?
12403,GEORGE,65, Yeah.
12404,JERRY,65, You're just straightening up or you're cleaning?
12405,GEORGE,65, Cleaning
12406,JERRY,65, You do the tub?
12407,GEORGE,65, Yeah.

12410,JERRY,65," Okay, I think you're in love!"
12411,GEORGE,65, Tub is love?
12412,JERRY,65, Tub is love. So there you are. You've got a nice girl and a clean apartment.
12413,GEORGE,65, Yep. There's one little problem. 
12414,JERRY,65, Sexual?
12415,GEORGE,65, Yeeeaaah. Well..... I've never really feld confident in..... one particular aspect. 
12416,JERRY,65, Below the equator?
12417,GEORGE,65, Yeah. 
12418,JERRY,65," Nobody does. You know, nobody knows what to do. You just close your eyes and you hope for the best. I really think they're happy if you just make an effort. "

12422,JERRY,65, The tap is tough.
12423,GEORGE,65, It's like the manager coming out and asking you for the ball.
12424,JERRY,65, Well maybe she just wanted to move on to other business.
12425,GEORGE,65," No, no, this wasn't moving on. I got the hook. I wish I could get a lesson in that. "
12426,JERRY,65, It's a very complicated area.
12427,GEORGE,65, You can go crazy trying to figure that place out.
12428,JERRY,65, It's a haaazy mystery.
12429,GEORGE,65," Anyway, I think everything else is okay. Unless of course she's faking. "
12430,ELAINE,65, Who's faking?
12431,GEORGE,65, Nothing.

12436,ELAINE,65, How do you know?
12437,GEORGE,65," I know. I can tell. It's one of my powers. Why, did you ever fake?"
12438,ELAINE,65, Of course.
12439,JERRY,65, Really?
12440,GEORGE,65, You faked?
12441,ELAINE,65, On occasion.
12442,JERRY,65, And the guy never knows?
12443,ELAINE,65, No.
12444,JERRY,65, How can he not know that?
12445,ELAINE,65, Because I was gooood.
12446,JERRY,65, I guess after that many beers he's probably a little groggy anyway.
12447,ELAINE,65, You didn't know.
12448,JERRY,65, What?
12449,ELAINE,65, You didn't know.
12450,JERRY,65, Are you saying...
12451,GEORGE,65, I think I'll have a piece of cake.
12452,JERRY,65, With me? 
12453,ELAINE,65, Well...
12454,JERRY,65, You faked with me? 
12455,ELAINE,65, Yeah.
12456,JERRY,65, You faked with me?

12460,JERRY,65, You faked it?
12461,ELAINE,65, I faked it.

12469,GEORGE,65, We got a chocolate malt in here!

12471,GEORGE,65, I'm sure you are.
12472,ELAINE,65," Jerry, listen, it wasn't you. I just didn't have 'em back then. "
12473,JERRY,65, She faked.
12474,JERRY,65, Maybe they've all been faking.
12475,ELAINE,65, I'm sure they're not.
12476,GEORGE,65, Maybe Karin is faking.
12477,[location,65, Jerry's apartment]
12478,KRAMER,65, She was probably joking.

12481,JERRY,65, No. None.

12483,JERRY,65, Faked 'em all.
12484,KRAMER,65," Well so she faked 'em, so what?"
12485,JERRY,65, The woman had an orgasm under false pretences. That's sexual perjury. 
12486,KRAMER,65, You know I heard her screaming from my apartment? She woke me up a few times.
12487,JERRY,65," How did she do it? She's like Meryl Streep this woman. And I had to work the equipment. I'm not unskilled, I'm in the union. If she'd at least told me, maybe I could have done something about it. "
12488,KRAMER,65, Yeah I could have helped you out.
12489,JERRY,65, What could you have done?
12490,KRAMER,65, I could have given you some pointers. I know how to press those buttons body.
12491,JERRY,65, I'm feeling very inadequate about the whole thing.
12492,KRAMER,65, Aaaaah.
12493,JERRY,65, Don't aaaaah! I'm supposed to do something with her later? I don't even think I wanna see her. 
12494,KRAMER,65, Giddy-up.
12495,JERRY,65, Hello... Oh hello Elaine.
12496,ELAINE,65, So we're having dinner tonight?
12497,JERRY,65," I don't know, I'm not really in the mood."
12498,ELAINE,65, Why? What's wrong? You're not still thinking about this afternoon are you? 
12499,JERRY,65," What, the grilled cheese? Naaah, they always burn the toast."
12500,ELAINE,65," Nooo, the other thing."
12501,JERRY,65, Oooh that. Well...
12502,ELAINE,65," Oh come on, Jerry. Making to much of a big deal about it. "
12503,JERRY,65, Yeah I guess. So you wanna meet at that place at seven thirty?
12504,ELAINE,65, Okay. 
12505,JERRY,65, All right.
12506,ELAINE,65," All right, see you later."
12507,JERRY,65, Bye.
12508,ELAINE,65, Bye.
12509,[location,65, Elaine's office]
12510,RENE,65," Yeah, sometimes. "
12511,ELAINE,65," Really, like when?"
12512,RENE,65," Like if we went to a Broadway show, if we had really good seats."
12513,ELAINE,65," Yeah, well..."
12514,RENE,65," Well you know, if it's enough all ready and I just wanna get some sleep."
12515,[location,65, Jerry's apartment]
12516,JERRY,65, I really don't feel like seeing her.
12517,KRAMER,65," You know, I faked it."
12518,JERRY,65, What?!
12519,KRAMER,65, Yeah.
12520,JERRY,65, You faked it? Why would you do that?
12521,KRAMER,65," Well you know, if it's enough already and I just wanna get some sleep."
12522,JERRY,65," Yeah, but why would you... "
12523,JERRY,65, Bad peach?
12524,KRAMER,65, It's terrible! 
12525,JERRY,65, Did you get that at Joe's?
12526,KRAMER,65," Yeah, of course I got it at Joe's."
12527,JERRY,65," That's surprising, his fruit is usually the best."
12528,KRAMER,65, You know what I'm gonna do? I'm gonna return this.
12529,JERRY,65, You're returning used fruit?
12530,KRAMER,65, Jerry this peach is sub par.
12531,[location,65, Joe's]
12532,JOE,65, So what do you want me to do?
12533,KRAMER,65, I want restitution.
12534,JOE,65, Restitution? You want restitution? Why should I give you restitution?
12535,KRAMER,65, Because it's no good.
12536,JOE,65," When you put that fruit out, that's where it ends for me."
12537,KRAMER,65," It's still your fruit, you gotta stand behind your fruit."
12538,JOE,65, I stand behind my fruit.
12539,KRAMER,65, So...
12540,JOE,65," Hey, you got a bad peach? That's an act of God. He makes the peaches. I don't make the peaches, I sell the peaches. You have a problem? You talk to him."
12541,KRAMER,65," You know this whole place is going vrrrrrrrrrrrrt, downhill. I could have come in here last week with a bad plum but I let it go."
12542,KRAMER,65, Oh now you don't want my business.
12543,JOE,65," No, I don't want your business and from this moment you're banned from the store, you're banned!"
12544,KRAMER,65, But what am I gonna do for fruit?
12545,[location,65, restaurant]
12546,GEORGE,65," You seem like you really enjoyed your Risotto. You have a very contented air over there. You look very contented, very satisfied. Are you satisfied?"
12547,KARIN,65, I'm very satisfied.
12548,GEORGE,65, I'm sure if you weren't satisfied you would probably say something wouldn't you?
12549,KARIN,65, I probably would. But then again I'm an enigma. 
12550,GEORGE,65, Hey listen... instead of the movie... maybe we'll go back and... you know...
12551,KARIN,65, Maybe.
12552,GEORGE,65, So... you feel okay about that whole thing... what we do in there... generally okay with everything in there?
12553,KARIN,65, Generally.
12554,GEORGE,65, Do you feel the way you feel after the Risotto?
12555,KARIN,65," No, I feel full after the Risotto."
12556,GEORGE,65, Yeah... full.
12557,[location,65, (another) restaurant]
12558,JERRY,65, Satisfied?
12559,ELAINE,65," Hey, you know what? You wanna go see that new Meryl Streep movie?"
12560,JERRY,65, Meryl Streep?
12561,ELAINE,65, You don't like her?
12562,JERRY,65," Ah, she's okay."
12563,ELAINE,65," I love her Jerry, she's so authentic. I really believe everything is actually happening to her. There's no acting there."
12564,JERRY,65, Yeah. You don't want coffee or anything do you?
12565,ELAINE,65," I really admire actors, you know. It's just such an incredible skill. "
12566,JERRY,65," Yeah, yeah, can we get off of this? "
12567,ELAINE,65, What's the matter?
12568,JERRY,65, Nothing.
12569,ELAINE,65, You're not still thinking about that are you?
12570,JERRY,65, Nooo.
12571,ELAINE,65, Oh good.
12572,JERRY,65, Give me another shot!
12573,ELAINE,65, What?
12574,JERRY,65," Another shot, I want another shot."
12575,ELAINE,65, You mean...?
12576,JERRY,65, Yes! 
12577,ELAINE,65," Oooh no, I don't think so."
12578,JERRY,65," Come on! One shot, I can do it, I know I can do it!"
12579,ELAINE,65," Jerry, we're friends! We can't do that, it would ruin our friendship."
12580,JERRY,65," Oh friendship... friendship, shmanship ."
12581,ELAINE,65," Jerry no, that's important to me."
12582,JERRY,65, We won't ruin the friendship. 
12583,ELAINE,65, Yes we will!
12584,JERRY,65, Elaine...
12585,ELAINE,65," No Jerry, it is out of the question. You know what sex does to a friendship, it kills it. "
12586,JERRY,65," A half hour, give me a half our."
12587,ELAINE,65, No!
12588,JERRY,65," Okay, fifteen minutes. I guarantee you fifteen minutes, I can make it happen!"
12589,ELAINE,65, No!
12590,JERRY,65, You're worried I'll be able to do it aren't you? 
12591,ELAINE,65," What, no, it doesn't matter. Jerry, I don't care."
12592,JERRY,65," That's it, that's it. You like having this over me, you don't want me to do it."
12593,ELAINE,65, That is so ridiculous.
12594,JERRY,65," Come on, Elaine!"
12595,ELAINE,65, No.
12596,JERRY,65, Elaine?!
12597,ELAINE,65, No!
12598,[location,65, Karin's bedroom]
12599,GEORGE,65, It's Jerry's fault.
12600,KARIN,65, Jerry?
12601,GEORGE,65, Jerry and Elaine. They made me nuts.
12602,KARIN,65," Oh I don't care, George, really it's all right. "
12603,GEORGE,65, So you feel okay?
12604,KARIN,65," Well, it's not like after the Risotto."
12605,[location,65, Jerry's car]
12606,JERRY,65, Well good night.
12607,ELAINE,65, I still don't understand why we had to walk out on that movie.
12608,JERRY,65," Oh that Meryl Streep, she's such a phony baloney."
12609,ELAINE,65, Goodnight. Thanks for a really fabulous evening (sarcastic).
12610,JERRY,65," Oh what, you're upset?"
12611,ELAINE,65," Yes I'm upset, can't you tell?"
12612,JERRY,65," No I can't, maybe you're faking."
12613,ELAINE,65," I'm really, really sorry I told you that. "
12614,JERRY,65, I'm sorry too.
12615,ELAINE,65, Well stop being such a baby.
12616,JERRY,65, You're a baby!
12617,ELAINE,65, You're a baby!
12618,[location,65, Jerry's apartment]
12619,JERRY,65, They're mysterious little fellows aren't they? 
12620,GEORGE,65, I hate 'em!
12621,JERRY,65, You know it happens to everybody. It happened to Houdini. And he could get out of a trunk under water with his hands in chains! But he had a problem with that. The miracle is that it ever happens. 
12622,GEORGE,65, It's like a magic trick. Sometimes I think it would be easier to bend a spoon mentally than to make that transformation.
12623,KRAMER,65," Hey listen, if I give you money would you go out and get me some fruit?"
12624,JERRY,65, Why can't you get it?
12625,KRAMER,65, Well I got banned from the store I can't go back in there now.
12626,JERRY,65, What happened?
12627,KRAMER,65," Well you know, we had a fight over the peach and... well Joe doesn't want my business."
12628,GEORGE,65," Hey, was that a joke about Houdini?"
12629,KRAMER,65," Jerry, what am I gonna do for fruit?"
12630,JERRY,65, Well you'll have to go to the supermarket.
12631,KRAMER,65," The supermarket? That's impossible! They don't have a decent piece of fruit at the supermarket. The apples are mealy, the oranges are dry. I don't know what's going on with the Papayas! Jerry you gotta go to Joe's, you gotta get me some fruit! "
12632,JERRY,65, Oh so what I'm going to buy all your fruit now? 
12633,GEORGE,65," Well if Houdini couldn't do it, what chance do I have?"
12634,JERRY,65, Patty Lawrence had 'em!
12635,KRAMER,65," Okay, I'm gonna make you a fruit list, all right?"
12636,JERRY,65, Yeah.
12637,JERRY,65, Hello Elaine? Patty Lorens had orgasms what do you think about that? And I got calls in to six other women and I bet you they confirm an orgasm too. So what do you have to say now Elaine?... Hello?
12638,[location,65, outside Joe's]
12639,JERRY,65, Why do I feel like I'm doing something wrong?
12640,KRAMER,65, All right now here's the list.
12641,JERRY,65, All this? It's too much. What do you need five mangos for?
12642,KRAMER,65, I like mangos.
12643,JERRY,65, Avocado? I don't know how to pick out an avocado.
12644,KRAMER,65, Well they gotta be soft.
12645,JERRY,65, How soft?
12646,KRAMER,65, Not too soft. Better too hard than too soft.
12647,JERRY,65," I'm not going through this every week, I tell you that right now. And what are these? Plums? What is that?"
12648,KRAMER,65, Yeah now get the ones that are red on the inside.
12649,JERRY,65, Well how do I know what they look like on the inside? What do they look like on the outside?
12650,KRAMER,65, Oh! And get some plantains.
12651,JERRY,65, Plantains? 
12652,KRAMER,65, Yeah.
12653,JERRY,65, What the hell is a plantain.
12654,KRAMER,65, It's part of the banana family. It's a delicacy.
12655,JERRY,65, You're not getting any plantains.
12656,JERRY,65, Hey Joe.
12657,JOE,65, How is it going?
12658,JERRY,65," Good, just getting some fruit for myself. Gotta have fruit in the house. I like it as a snack. Wholesome, natural, chock-full of vitamins. I don't know let's see... mangos... four plums with red on the inside... avocado... ooo, just right... and three plantains ought to do it."
12659,JOE,65," All right, all right, just hold it right there."
12660,JERRY,65, What?
12661,JOE,65, This fruit isn't for you. 
12662,JERRY,65," What, what are you talking about?"
12663,JOE,65," You think I don't know? Mangos, plantains, plums with the red on the inside, that's Kramer!"
12664,JERRY,65, I can't buy mangos and plantains?
12665,JOE,65," All right, get out!"
12666,JERRY,65," You're making a big mistake, Joe!"
12667,JERRY,65, You're saying you're banning me from the store?
12668,JOE,65, That's exactly what I'm saying.
12669,JERRY,65, I'm banned?!
12670,JOE,65, You're banned.
12671,[location,65, Jerry's apartment]
12672,GEORGE,65," All right, where do you want it?"
12673,JERRY,65, Put it over there. 
12674,KRAMER,65," Yes! Oh look at this, these mangos are beautiful! Oh these are beautiful, you did good George."
12675,GEORGE,65, All right I gotta get going.
12676,JERRY,65, What are you doing?
12677,GEORGE,65, I got a date with Karin. I don't know what I'm gonna do. Nothing happening down there. 
12678,JERRY,65, You're thinking about it too much. You're putting too much emphasis on it.
12679,GEORGE,65, I knew this was gonna happen some day. It was inevitable. I've known it ever since I was a little kid. I've been waiting for it.
12680,KRAMER,65, This mango is delicious!
12681,GEORGE,65," That reminds me, I'm not getting you guys any more fruit. That guy was eyeballing me the whole time. He gave me the creeps. All right, you owe me twenty-eight sixty. "
12682,JERRY,65," Sorry, I don't have any cash. "
12683,KRAMER,65, I only got hundreds.
12684,GEORGE,65, All right I knew it.
12685,KRAMER,65," Come on, come on, we're gonna pay you! Here have some mango."
12686,GEORGE,65, I don't want any mango.
12687,KRAMER,65," Come on, take some. It's good."
12688,GEORGE,65, Very good. Juicy. Ripe. This Joe's got some terrific fruit. 
12689,JERRY,65, What?
12690,GEORGE,65, I feel like I got a B12 shot. This is like a taste explosion!
12691,KRAMER,65, I told you.
12692,JERRY,65, What is it?
12693,GEORGE,65," I think it moved. Oh my god, I think it moved. Yeah, give me the big piece. I'll see you later."
12694,ELAINE,65, Hi George.
12695,GEORGE,65," I'm back, baby, I'm back!"
12696,KRAMER,65, Want some mango?
12697,ELAINE,65," No, thanks."
12698,JERRY,65," Well well, if it isn't the first lady of the American Theatre. What brings you here?"
12699,ELAINE,65, Just gonna return some of your things that were in my house. 
12700,JERRY,65, Oh and I've got some things of yours here.
12701,ELAINE,65, I know.
12702,JERRY,65, Well I'll get them.
12703,ELAINE,65, I'm waiting.
12704,JERRY,65, All right. You got my fins?
12705,ELAINE,65, Yeah I got your fins. You got my poker chips?
12706,JERRY,65, I got your poker chips. You got my goggles?
12707,ELAINE,65, They're next to the fins. You got my cards?
12708,JERRY,65, They're next to the poker chips.
12709,ELAINE,65, All right and that just about... does it.
12710,JERRY,65, I guess.
12711,ELAINE,65," Okay, well... see you around."
12712,JERRY,65," Yeah, see you."
12713,ELAINE,65," All right, let's go, I give you half an hour."
12714,JERRY,65, What?
12715,ELAINE,65, Come on!
12716,JERRY,65, Are you serious?
12717,ELAINE,65," Look, Jerry, we have to have sex to save the friendship."
12718,JERRY,65," Sex... to save the friendship. Well, if we have to..."
12719,[location,65, Karin's bedroom]
12720,KARIN,65," Oh George, oooh."
12721,GEORGE,65," Please, it's not necessary."
12722,KARIN,65, What do you mean it's not necessary?
12723,GEORGE,65," The little extra moan you threw in there. Laying it on a bit thick, don't you think?"
12724,KARIN,65, What are you talking about?
12725,GEORGE,65, What am I talking about? Come on. You don't think I bought all that?
12726,KARIN,65," What, what?"
12727,GEORGE,65, You're very good. Very good with the moanings and the gyrations. You really had me going there for a minute.
12728,KARIN,65, You think I was faking?
12729,KARIN,65, I'd like you to leave.
12730,GEORGE,65, What?
12731,KARIN,65," I said, I would like you to leave. Come on, just get your clothes on and get out."
12732,GEORGE,65, But why?
12733,KARIN,65, Because I said so.
12734,GEORGE,65, I can't find my glasses.
12735,KARIN,65, Well hurry up.
12736,GEORGE,65, I need to look for my glasses.
12737,KARIN,65, Get out! Get out!! Get out!!!
12738,[location,65, Jerry's bedroom]
12739,ELAINE,65, You know I'm a little hungry. You wouldn't happen to have any of that mango left?

12744,[Setting,66, Jerry's apartment]
12745,GEORGE,66, I can't believe this!
12746,JERRY,66," Oh, it won't be for that long."
12747,GEORGE,66," How can I do this?! How can I move back in with those people? 
              Please, tell me! They're insane! You know that."
12748,JERRY,66," Hey, my parents are just as crazy as your parents."
12749,GEORGE,66, How can you compare you parents to my parents?!
12750,JERRY,66, My father has never thrown anything out. Ever!
12751,GEORGE,66, My father wears his sneakers in the pool! Sneakers!
12752,JERRY,66, My mother has never set foot in a natural body of water.
12753,GEORGE,66," (Showing Jerry up) Listen carefully. My mother has never 
              laughed. Ever. Not a giggle, not a chuckle, not a tee-hee.. never 
              went 'Ha!'"
12754,JERRY,66, A smirk?
12755,GEORGE,66, Maybe!.. And I'm moving back in there!
12756,JERRY,66, I told you I'd lend you the money for the rent.
12757,GEORGE,66," No, no, no, no. Borrowing money from a friend is like having 
              sex. It just completely changes the relationship."
12758,KRAMER,66," Alright. I'm ready. (To George) You know, I still don't 
              understand - why do you want to move back in with your parents?"
12759,GEORGE,66," I don't want to! I'm outta money! I got 714 dollars left 
              in the bank."
12760,KRAMER,66," Well, move in here."
12761,JERRY,66, (Stopping the notion) What's that?
12762,KRAMER,66, Why doesn't he just move in here?
12763,GEORGE,66," (Sarcastic) Yeah, yeah. I'm gonna move in with him. He 
              doesn't even let you use the toilet!"
12764,KRAMER,66," You can move in with me, if you want."
12765,GEORGE,66," (Sincerely) Thank you.. I, uh.. that might not work out."

12770,KRAMER,66," Well, I gotta bring in more stuff. (Heads for the door)"
12771,ESTELLE,66, More stuff?!
12772,KRAMER,66, Yeah. (Exits)
12773,ESTELLE,66, (To George) How much is there?!
12774,GEORGE,66, (Annoyed) There's more.
12775,ESTELLE,66," So, how are ya, Jerry?"
12776,JERRY,66," Fine, Mrs. Costanza. (Attempts to get Estelle to laugh) 
              Hey, I got a terrific joke for you.."
12777,ESTELLE,66," (Sits down on the couch) Nah, not interested."
12778,JERRY,66," No, no. It's really funny. There's these two guys-"
12779,ESTELLE,66," (Interrupting) Tell it to the audience. (George gives 
              Jerry an 'I told you so' look) Here, (Picks up a plate full of sandwiches) 
              I made some bologna"
12780,GEORGE,66, Bologna?! No one eats bologna anymore!
12781,ESTELLE,66, What are you talking about?! Have a sandwich.
12782,JERRY,66, No thanks.
12783,ESTELLE,66," Oh, stop it! You don't want one, Kramer?"
12784,KRAMER,66, Uhh.. no thanks. (Goes back out the door)
12785,ESTELLE,66," I think you're all a little touched in the head. (Puts 
              the plate down) You're so worried about your health.. You're young 
              men."
12786,JERRY,66, I really don't eat it.
12787,ESTELLE,66," What am I gonna do with all these sandwiches?! Will you 
              take them home? Give them to someone in your building?"
12788,JERRY,66," I don't know if I'd feel comfortable handing out bologna 
              sandwiches in the building.."
12789,KRAMER,66," (Enters with a box) Alright, that's it. Anything else?"
12790,GEORGE,66," (Muttering) No, that's it."
12791,KRAMER,66," Oh, I gotta go move the car. (Leaves)"
12792,JERRY,66," Well, I guess we'll be going.. (Heads for the door)"
12793,GEORGE,66," (Runs over to him, not wanting him to leave) What? You're 
              going?"
12794,JERRY,66, Yeah.
12795,GEORGE,66, Wha - what are you doing later?
12796,JERRY,66," Oh, Elaine and I are going out to dinner with Kramer and 
              his new girlfriend."
12797,GEORGE,66, Really?
12798,JERRY,66," Yeah, You can't believe this woman. She's one of those low-talkers. 
              You can't hear a word she's saying! You're always going 'excuse 
              me?', 'what was"
12799,GEORGE,66, Yeah.. may - maybe I'll meet ya?
12800,ESTELLE,66," No, George. We're going out to eat tonight with your father."
12801,GEORGE,66, (Mutters) Oh.. okay.. talk to you later.
12802,JERRY,66," Yeah, take it easy. (Leaves)"

              make your own pie! (Laughs)"
12806,JERRY,66, Right.
12807,ELIANE,66, You remember that?
12808,KRAMER,66," Yeah, well, that was a good one."
12809,JERRY,66, Well..
12810,ELAINE,66, What's that?
12811,JERRY,66, Excuse me?
12812,JERRY,66, Yeah.. yeah.
12813,ELAINE,66, Yep. Yeah..
12814,KRAMER,66," You know that, uh, Leslie (Points to her) is in the clothing 
              business? She's a designer."
12815,ELAINE,66, (Interested) Oh?
12816,KRAMER,66," In fact, she's come up with a new one that is going to 
              be the big new look in mens fashions.. It's a, a puffy shirt. (Leslie 
              mumbles to Kramer) Well, yeah,"
12817,ELAINE,66," Oh, a puffy shirt."
12818,JERRY,66, Puffy.
12819,KRAMER,66," Yeah, see, I think people want to look like pirates. You 
              know, it's the right time for it.. to be all puffy, and devil-may-care.."
12820,KRAMER,66," (Still laughing) That's true.. (Gets up) I'll be right 
              back. (Walks off laughing. Jerry and Elaine are left with the low-talker.

              going to be on the ""Today"" show on Friday."

              know, they, uh, they clothe the poor, and the homeless.."
12824,JERRY,66, (Points at Elaine) And the indigent.
12825,ELAINE,66," And the indigent, yeah.. I, I do volunteer work for them. 
              I set the whole thing up, and I got Jerry to do it."
12826,JERRY,66, Sure.

12833,ESTELLE,66, Maybe you should take a civil service test.
12834,GEORGE,66," (Studying the salt shaker) I'm not taking a civil service 
              test."
12835,FRANK,66," Look at this, George. (Takes a coin out of his pocket) You 
              ever seen a silver dollar?"
12836,GEORGE,66," Yes, I've seen a silver dollar."
12837,ELAINE,66, Why don't you want to take a civil service test?
12838,GEORGE,66," To do what?! Work in a post office? Is that what you want 
              me to do?"
12839,FRANK,66," Would you believe when I was 18, I had a silver dollar collection?"
12840,ESTELLE,66," I don't understand. You get job security - you get a pay 
              check every week.."
12841,GEORGE,66, I'm a college graduate. You want me to be a mailman?
12842,FRANK,66," (Still looking at his coin) You know, I couldn't bring myself 
              to spend one of these. I got some kind of a-a-a-a-a phobia."
12843,ESTELLE,66, So what are you gonna do?!
12844,GEORGE,66," I don't know. I do know that I have some kind of a talent 
              - something to offer. I just don't know what it is yet!"
12845,FRANK,66, I bet that collection would be worth a lot of money today.
12846,GEORGE,66, (Looks fed up with his parents) Oh my God..
12847,FRANK,66," I don't like this waiter. (Holds up his hand to get the 
              waiters attention - starts snapping) Look at him.. He sees us.. 
              he doesn't want to come over."
12848,GEORGE,66," (Needing to get away from his parents, he gets up) I need 
              some air.."
12849,ESTELLE,66," George, where are you going?!"
12850,GEORGE,66, (Walks off) I got a lot of thinking to do.
12851,GEORGE,66," Oh, I'm sorry. I'm terribly sorry.. (Bends down, and starts 
              picking up her things)"
12852,WOMAN,66, Look at what you've done! You spilled my bag!
12853,GEORGE,66," (Stuttering) I, I, I, .. here, let me - let me help you.."
12854,WOMAN,66," No, no ,no. It's all right. (Begins helping him pick her 
              things up)"
12855,GEORGE,66," It - it's just that I'm here with my parents, and my mother 
              wants me to take a civil service test - and to tell you the truth, 
              I don't even think I'd pass it.. So.."
12856,WOMAN,66, Hmm..
12857,GEORGE,66, What?
12858,WOMAN,66, (Looking at both his hands intensely) Your hands.
12859,GEORGE,66, What about them?
12860,WOMAN,66, They're quite exquisite!
12861,GEORGE,66, They are?
12862,WOMAN,66," (Mesmerized) Extraordinary! Have you ever done any hand 
              modeling?"
12863,GEORGE,66, Hand modeling? (Shakes his head 'No')
12864,WOMAN,66," (Fishes a card out of her purse, then hands it to George) 
              Here's my card. Why don't you, uh, give me a call? (Walks off)"
12865,[Setting,66, Jerry's apartment]
12866,JERRY,66, (Shrugs) I - I don't get it.
12867,GEORGE,66, Me neither!
12868,JERRY,66, What is it?
12869,GEORGE,66, I don't know.
12870,JERRY,66, They're hands!
12871,GEORGE,66, This woman just set me up for a job!
12872,JERRY,66," (Gets up, and displays his own hands) Well, what about my 
              hands? I don't see how your hands are any better than my hands."
12873,GEORGE,66," What, are you kidding? (Points at the flaws of Jerry's 
              hands) The knuckles are all out of proportion. you got hair over 
              there - where do you get off"
12874,JERRY,66," Well, that's what comes from avoiding manual labor your 
              whole life."
12875,GEORGE,66," This is it! It happened to me, Jerry! I was sitting in 
              the restaurant, the two nut jobs were talking - I couldn't take 
              it any more. I got up, and (Makes a"

              coat hooks)"
12877,JERRY,66, Hey.
12878,KRAMER,66," Hey, George! (Holds out his hand. George shakes it - a 
              hand buzzer goes off. George starts freaking out. Kramer laughs)"
12879,GEORGE,66," What are you, crazy?! What are you, crazy?!"
12880,KRAMER,66, What?!
12881,GEORGE,66, You coulda damaged my hand!

12883,JERRY,66, (Explaining) George has become a hand model.
12884,KRAMER,66, A hand model?
12885,JERRY,66, Yes.
12886,KRAMER,66, (To George) Really? Let me look at them..
12887,GEORGE,66," (Defensively) You can look at them, but do NOT touch them. 
              (Holds them out. Kramer studies them)"
12888,KRAMER,66," Let's see.. oh, those are nice. You know, I've never noticed 
              this before? They're smooth.. creamy.. delicate, yet (Turns to Jerry) 
              masculine."
12889,GEORGE,66," (Takes two oven mitts from his back pack) Alright, (puts 
              them on) I gotta get going."
12890,JERRY,66, Oven mitts?
12891,GEORGE,66," (Embarrassed) That's all I could find. (A moment passes) 
              Would you mind getting the door?"
12892,KRAMER,66, Yeah..
12893,JERRY,66, Alright. (Jerry opens the door for George)
12894,GEORGE,66, Thank you very much. (Walks out)

              show, she's been getting"
12896,JERRY,66," Uh-huh.. (Finally realizes what Kramer said, he looks up)

12897,KRAMER,66," Agreed to wear the puffy shirt. (Starts unzipping the suit 
              cover)"
12898,JERRY,66, What are you talking about?
12899,KRAMER,66," When you said that you'd agree to wear the puffy shirt 
              on the Today show. (Takes the ridiculous puffy shirt out of the 
              cover)"
12900,JERRY,66, (Goes up to it) This?
12901,KRAMER,66, Yes!
12902,JERRY,66, I agreed to wear this?!
12903,KRAMER,66," Yeah, yeah."
12904,JERRY,66," But, when did I do that?"
12905,KRAMER,66, When we went to dinner the other night.
12906,JERRY,66," What are you, crazy?!"
12907,KRAMER,66, What were you talking about when I went to the bathroom?
12908,JERRY,66," I don't know! I couldn't understand a word she was saying! 
              I was just nodding!"
12909,KRAMER,66, There you go.
12910,JERRY,66," Where I go? You mean she was asking me to wear this ridiculous 
              shirt on national TV, and I said 'Yes'?!"
12911,KRAMER,66," Yes, yes! You said it!"
12912,JERRY,66," But, I - I didn't know what she was talking about. I couldn't 
              hear her!"
12913,KRAMER,66," (Takes it off the hook, and starts walking toward Jerry 
              with it. He backs defensively backs away from it) Well, she asked 
              you."
12914,JERRY,66," I - I can't wear this puffy shirt on TV! I mean, look at 
              it! It looks ridiculous!"
12915,KRAMER,66," Well, you gotta wear it now! All those stores are stocking

              hands. I used to tell people. Frank, didn't I use to talk about 
              his hands?"

              his hands to?"

              milky white.."

              it cool or what?"

                oh that's Morning Guy's problem. That's not my problem, I'm Night Guy. I stay 
                up as late as I want. So you get up in the morning, you're ..... (?), you're 
                exhausted, groggy, oooh I hate that Night Guy! See, Night Guy always screws 
                Morning Guy. There's nothing Morning Guy can do. The only Morning Guy can do 
                is try and oversleep often enough so that Day Guy looses his job and Night Guy 
                has no money to go out anymore."

12990,ELAINE,67, Do you ever spit on anybody from here?
12991,JERRY,67, No. You?
12992,ELAINE,67, No. Do you ever think about it?
12993,JERRY,67, Yeah.
12994,ELAINE,67, Me too.
12995,KRAMER,67, Hey.
12996,JERRY,67, Hey.
12997,KRAMER,67, Well I got it!
12998,JERRY,67, You got me the air conditioner?
12999,KRAMER,67, What do you think?
13000,JERRY,67, Beautiful!
13001,ELAINE,67, What air conditioner?
13002,KRAMER,67, My buddy works in an appliance store and he got us thirty percent off.
13003,JERRY,67, Is it a good one?
13004,KRAMER,67, Good one? It's the Commando 8.
13005,JERRY,67, Commando 8?
13006,KRAMER,67, 12.000 BTU's.
13007,ELAINE,67, I thought you hated air conditioning. You've never had an air conditioner.
13008,KRAMER,67," Yeah, but Amy likes air conditioning."
13009,JERRY,67, All right.
13010,KRAMER,67," Okay, so, I'm gonna measure the window up, okay buddy?"
13011,JERRY,67, Yeah.
13012,KRAMER,67, Yeah.
13013,KRAMER,67," Yeah, rock on!"
13014,GEORGE,67, I gotta get out of this city.
13015,JERRY,67, So you're tunneling to the center of the Earth?
13016,GEORGE,67," I'm at the health club and while I'm in the pool, some guy walks off 
                with my glasses. Who steals prescription glasses?"
13017,ELAINE,67, You don't have an old pair?
13018,GEORGE,67, I broke 'em playing basketball.
13019,JERRY,67, He was running from a bee.
13020,GEORGE,67, Now if I wanna see anything I gotta wear these.
13021,ELAINE,67," George, those are prescription goggles? What is there to see in a health 
                club pool?"
13022,JERRY,67, There's a lot of change down there.
13023,JERRY,67," We're behind you, Aquaboy. Godspeed!"
13024,GEORGE,67," What kind of a sick, demented person wants another person's glasses?"
13025,ELAINE,67," Yeah, especially those frames."
13026,KRAMER,67," You know you ought to do? Go see my friend Dwayne at J & T Optical 
                and Columbus Avenue. He'll give you thirty percent off."
13027,GEORGE,67," Yeah, come on."
13028,JERRY,67," Hey, he just got me thirty percent off on an air conditioner."
13029,GEORGE,67, Really?
13030,KRAMER,67, Retail is for suckers.
13031,GEORGE,67, Wow. What do I have to do?
13032,KRAMER,67, You just gotta mention my name.
13033,GEORGE,67, That's it?
13034,KRAMER,67, That's it.
13035,[location,67, J & T Optical]
13036,GEORGE,67, What about these?
13037,ELAINE,67," They look good. I liked the other one too. I've liked about five of 
                them."
13038,GEORGE,67," It's a tough decision. I have to wear these every day. I'm deciding 
                on a new face."
13039,JERRY,67," Come on, George. Pick a face and go with it!"
13040,ELAINE,67," Now those look good, they're very bold. "
13041,GEORGE,67," Yes, they are bold. Jerry, what do you think?"
13042,DOG OWNER,67, It's okay with me.
13043,ELAINE,67, Hey little doggy.
13044,ELAINE,67, Aaah!
13045,DWAYNE,67," Hey, you can't have that dog in here."
13046,JERRY,67, Are you okay? Did he bite you?
13047,GEORGE,67, Can you believe that guy?
13048,ELAINE,67," I'm okay, it's just a nick."
13049,GEORGE,67," He just walked away! And once again I'm standing here like a little 
                man. Well not this time!"
13050,GEORGE,67, You! Dog man!
13051,ELAINE,67, My leg looks pretty bad.
13052,JERRY,67, Oh I'm gonna take you over to the emergency room.
13053,ELAINE,67, Okay.
13054,GEORGE,67," Uuh, no. "
13055,JERRY,67," All right, I'm gonna take Elaine over to the hospital."
13056,JERRY,67, What's the matter?
13057,GEORGE,67," Oh, no, nothing. "
13058,JERRY,67, What is it?
13059,GEORGE,67, I can't tell you.
13060,ELAINE,67," Jerry, can we go?"
13061,GEORGE,67," I can't tell you, don't ask."
13062,JERRY,67, I'm asking!
13063,ELAINE,67," Jerry, my leg."
13064,JERRY,67," Yeah, yeah, take care."
13065,JERRY,67," Come on, George, what is it?"
13066,GEORGE,67, I saw Amy making out with your cousin Jeffrey. 
13067,JERRY,67, What?
13068,GEORGE,67, They were right outside!
13069,JERRY,67, Amy and Jeffrey?
13070,GEORGE,67, Yes!
13071,JERRY,67, Are you sure?
13072,GEORGE,67," Yes, positive."
13073,JERRY,67," But you can't see, there's no lenses in those frames."
13074,GEORGE,67, I know! I was squinting.
13075,ELAINE,67," Listen, Jerry, you just catch up with me okay? You can just follow 
                the trail of blood."
13076,JERRY,67, We're gonna have to talk about this later.
13077,JERRY,67, Thank you. Taxi!
13078,DWAYNE,67," Oh, we just got those in. It's a very exciting new frame."
13079,GEORGE,67," Yes, it is exciting! All right, this is gonna be my new face."
13080,DWAYNE,67," All right, you have a prescription?"
13081,GEORGE,67, Yeah.
13082,GEORGE,67, Kramer...
13083,DWAYNE,67, What?
13084,GEORGE,67, Kramer...
13085,DWAYNE,67, What about him?
13086,GEORGE,67, You do know Kramer?
13087,DWAYNE,67, Yes...
13088,GEORGE,67," Well, I'm mentioning his name."
13089,DWAYNE,67, Why?
13090,GEORGE,67, Because... you know... 
13091,DWAYNE,67," No, I don't know. Look, I'm gonna need a deposit on these."
13092,[location,67, hospital]
13093,ELAINE,67," Oh, come on. Cousin Jeffrey? It's not possible!"
13094,JERRY,67," Why not? They could have met. She loves the park, he works for the Parks 
                Department. "
13095,ELAINE,67," Jerry, that is so ridiculous. But, George didn't even have his glasses 
                on!"
13096,JERRY,67, But he was squinting.
13097,ELAINE,67, So what? Squinting doesn't make that much of a difference.
13098,JERRY,67," Are you kidding? I've seen 'em squint. He can squint his way down to 
                like twenty, thirty vision. Once we were driving down from the Catskills and 
                he lost his glasses. He squinted his way from Wortsborough down to the Tappan 
                Zee Bridge! He was spotting raccoons, on the road! "
13099,DOCTER,67, Okay.
13100,ELAINE,67, Okay? That's it? I don't need a shot?
13101,DOCTER,67," Not shot, dog bite."
13102,ELAINE,67," No, no, no. I know I wasn't shot. Do I need a shot?"
13103,DOCTER,67," Not shot, dog bite. Woof woof, not bang bang."
13104,[location,67, Jerry's apartment]
13105,JERRY,67," Now, look at this. Cable's out."
13106,AMY,67," Oh that's okay, we don't have to watch tv."
13107,JERRY,67," No, no, no. No trouble at all, it's a principal the thing. "
13108,JERRY,67," I like them to know that I know what's going on. That they're not... 
                getting away with anything. Oh, I'm on hold. So, what did you do yesterday?"
13109,AMY,67, Yesterday?
13110,JERRY,67," Yeah, you remember yesterday? Beautiful day... good day to be... out."
13111,AMY,67, I didn't do anything.
13112,JERRY,67, Oh you must have done something.
13113,AMY,67," No, nothing really."
13114,JERRY,67, Didn't go out of the house? Didn't take a walk... on Columbus Avenue?
13115,AMY,67," Well, I did go out for a little while."
13116,JERRY,67," Well, your day's getting more interesting already."
13117,JERRY,67," Ah, see, told me they'd be back in a minute and THEY lied."
13118,AMY,67, You can't thrust anyone.
13119,JERRY,67," No you can't. Now let's cut the ball, sister! You think I don't know 
                about you swapping spit with somebody yesterday on Columbus Avenue?"
13120,AMY,67, What are you talking about?
13121,JERRY,67," Look, my friend saw you."
13122,AMY,67, Saw me? With who?
13123,JERRY,67, You tell me.
13124,AMY,67, There's nothing to tell. 
13125,JERRY,67, There isn't?
13126,AMY,67, No.
13127,JERRY,67, Oh... all right... wanna get some pizza?
13128,AMY,67, I had a feeling this was to good to be true. 
13129,JERRY,67, Why?
13130,AMY,67, I knew there had to be another side to you.
13131,JERRY,67," No, no, there's no side!"
13132,AMY,67," There is a side, an ugly side."
13133,JERRY,67," No, no, no ugly side."
13134,AMY,67," Look, I think I'm gonna go."
13135,JERRY,67, Why?
13136,AMY,67, It's really hot in here.
13137,JERRY,67," Uuh, so we can still go out on Friday though?"
13138,AMY,67, Yeah. When are you getting an air conditioner?
13139,JERRY,67," It's coming! It's a Commando 8! 12.000 BTU's! It's gonna be like a meat 
                locker in here."
13140,[location,67, Jerry's apartment]
13141,JERRY,67, I was an idiot for listening to you!
13142,GEORGE,67," Hey, I saw what I saw."
13143,JERRY,67," Ooh, everything was going so well. She hadn't seen any flaws in me. 
                Now she sees a side. "
13144,GEORGE,67, What side?
13145,JERRY,67," A bad side, an ugly side. "
13146,GEORGE,67," Ooh, so what?"
13147,JERRY,67," So what? I wasn't planning on showing that side for another six months. 
                Now you make me throw off the whole learning curve."
13148,GEORGE,67, Why don't you just ask Jeffrey?
13149,JERRY,67," Ah, he'd just deny it."
13150,GEORGE,67, There must be some way to find out.
13151,JERRY,67, Amy said nothing happened.
13152,GEORGE,67," What, you're gonna take her word over mine? I'm your best friend!"
13153,JERRY,67," Yeah, but you're blind as a bat!"
13154,GEORGE,67," I was squinting! Remember that drive from Wortsborough? I was spotting 
                those raccoons. "
13155,JERRY,67," They were mailboxes, you idiot. I didn't have the heart to tell you."
13156,GEORGE,67," Hey look, a dime. "
13157,GEORGE,67, Mercury head. You mind?
13158,JERRY,67, Hey what happened to you? You buzzed five minutes ago.
13159,ELAINE,67," There was a dog in front of the building and it spooked me. I couldn't 
                come in until he left. "
13160,JERRY,67, A little white dog? 
13161,ELAINE,67, Yeah.
13162,JERRY,67, Snowball? You were afraid of Snowball?
13163,ELAINE,67, I'm afraid of dogs now.
13164,JERRY,67, He's like a squirrel.
13165,ELAINE,67, Well he frightened me.
13166,GEORGE,67, Did you get the shot?
13167,ELAINE,67, No. He said I didn't need a shot.
13168,GEORGE,67, You got bit by a strange dog and you didn't get a rabies shot?
13169,ELAINE,67," What, you think I should have?"
13170,JERRY,67," You know, you should just go back to the optical store and ask Dwayne 
                if he knows the name of the owner of the dog."
13171,ELAINE,67," All right, that's a good idea. I'm gonna do that."
13172,KRAMER,67, The AC is on his way.
13173,GEORGE,67," Pardon me, I went to see your friend Dwayne... there was no discount. "
13174,KRAMER,67, What?
13175,GEORGE,67," That's right, no discount!"
13176,KRAMER,67, Well did you mention my name?
13177,GEORGE,67," Yes, I mentioned your name."
13178,KRAMER,67, And?
13179,GEORGE,67, Bubkis!
13180,KRAMER,67," Now I don't believe this. That guy owes me big time. I got him off 
                sugar! Look, I'm gonna go down there with you right now."
13181,GEORGE,67," All right, let me just... I'm gonna grap an apple."
13182,JERRY,67," Hey, Kramer, Elaine's afraid of Snowball!"
13183,KRAMER,67, Little Snowball? He runs on batteries!
13184,ELAINE,67," You know, George, that's an union."
13185,GEORGE,67, Yes it is.
13186,ELAINE,67, He couldn't tell an apple from an union and he's your eye witness?
13187,GEORGE,67," I saw them making out, you can believe it."
13188,JERRY,67," I don't know what to believe! You're eating unions, you're spotting 
                dimes, I don't know what the hell is going on."
13189,KRAMER,67," Look, all you gotta to is get Amy and Jeffrey together somewhere, that's 
                it. "
13190,JERRY,67," Hey wait a second, wait a second. I'm going over to Jeffrey's apartment 
                tomorrow night to pick up these Paul Simon tickets. I'm gonna surprise Amy. 
                All I gotta do is bring her with me. And then when Jeffrey opens the door, it's 
                Howdy Doody time."
13191,KRAMER,67," Right this way, mister Doody!"
13192,GEORGE,67, You'll see I'm right.

13195,DWAYNE,67, Oh hello Kramer.
13196,KRAMER,67, What is going on here?
13197,DWAYNE,67, What are you talking about?
13198,KRAMER,67, I'm talking about the thirty percent discount.
13199,ELAINE,67, Uhm excuse me... uh... a man came in here...
13200,GEORGE,67," Elaine, don't interrupt, they're discounting something."
13201,DWAYNE,67, Who said anything about a discount.
13202,KRAMER,67," Ooh, how quickly we forget. You owe me buddy."
13203,DWAYNE,67, For what?
13204,KRAMER,67, Remember this?
13205,DWAYNE,67, What are you doing?
13206,KRAMER,67," Six months ago you were eating four of those for breakfast and chasing 
                it with a ring ding. And two butter fingers on the train. Sounds familiar?"
13207,DWAYNE,67, Put that away!
13208,KRAMER,67," Remember that night I found you at Dinky Donuts? You were all hopped 
                up on cinnamon swirls! They wouldn't serve you anymore! You wouldn't even have 
                any teeth if it wasn't for me taking you over to Joe's fruit stand and stuff 
                a cantaloupe down your throat! So much for gratitude... yeah, yeah, yeah!"
13209,DWAYNE,67," All right, all right, all right! I'll give him the discount, just put 
                that thing away! This squares us."
13210,ELAINE,67, Can I just have the name...
13211,DWAYNE,67, Out!
13212,KRAMER,67, We'll see you Dwayne.

                neck so you can wear 'em while you're playing Canasta."
13217,GEORGE,67, Well Elaine was supposed to help me.
13218,ELAINE,67," Hey! I got bit by a dog! I had to go to the hospital! I was bleeding 
                to death! I can't solve every little problem you have!"

13226,JERRY,67, Just in time for Amy.
13227,GEORGE,67," Oh yeah, when are you gonna execute that plead?"
13228,ELAINE,67," I've got such a headache. Oh, that's another symptom!"
13229,KRAMER,67, Of what?
13230,JERRY,67, Rabies.
13231,KRAMER,67," Oh that's fatal, you don't want that!"
13232,ELAINE,67," I know I don't want it! I don't need you to tell me what I don't want, 
                you stupid hipster dufus!"
13233,JERRY,67," Hey, hey, what is this? What's going on here?"
13234,ELAINE,67," I'm sorry, Kramer, I'm sorry."
13235,KRAMER,67," No, no, it's all right. I had a friend who had rabies once. "
13236,KRAMER,67," May I have one of those, madam?"
13237,GEORGE,67, Madame? What are you calling me madam for?

                swallow. "

13248,JERRY,67," Oh he'll be home, it's Friday night. That's the big night on the Nature 
                Channel."
13249,JERRY,67, He does look like a horse.

13270,BLIND MAN,67, What's that about ladies' frames?
13271,DOG OWNER,67," I'm trying to track down that lady that was in here the other day, 
                the one that was messing with my dog."
13272,GEORGE,67," Yeah, well, she's trying to track you down."
13273,DOG OWNER,67," Well I would love to talk with her. She lives on 81st Street, right?"
13274,GEORGE,67," No, that's Jerry."
13275,DOG OWNER,67," Really? You wouldn't happen to know what apartment he's in, would 
                you?"
13276,GEORGE,67," Yeah, 5A!"
13277,DOG OWNER,67, Thanks a lot!

13279,AMY,67, So what are we doing here?
13280,JERRY,67," Oh, you'll find out."
13281,AMY,67," I don't know, you're acting very mysteriously."
13282,JERRY,67," Well, I'm very mysterious by nature."
13283,JERRY,67, A lot of women find that attractive.
13284,AMY,67, I find it annoying.
13285,JERRY,67, Really?
13286,UNCLE LEO,67, Helloooo!
13287,JERRY,67, Uncle Leo!
13288,UNCLE LEO,67, Come on in.
13289,JERRY,67, This is Amy.
13290,UNCLE LEO,67, Hello Amy.
13291,JERRY,67," Unlce Leo, what are you doing here?"
13292,UNCLE LEO,67, Jeffrey went out tonight.
13293,JERRY,67, Ooh! Very convenient.
13294,UNCLE LEO,67," I'm supposed to tape this nature show for him, he loves nature. 
                Botany, zoology. You know his botany teacher from college stays in close touch 
                with him? They became friends!"
13295,JERRY,67, Oh really?
13296,UNCLE LEO,67," That's pretty rare! I mean, actual friends! Like equals! They have 
                dinner together, they have discussings..."
13297,JERRY,67, Uncle Leo! Did he leave any tickets here for me?
13298,UNCLE LEO,67," Oh yeah yeah, I'll get 'em."
13299,JERRY,67, Thank you.
13300,AMY,67, What tickets?
13301,JERRY,67, To the Paul Simon concert in the park!
13302,AMY,67, We're going to the Paul Simon concert?
13303,JERRY,67," That's right, lady!"
13304,AMY,67, Oh what a great surprise!
13305,JERRY,67, I thought you'd like that.
13306,AMY,67," Oooh, that's why you've been acting so mysteriously."
13307,JERRY,67," Now you know. That, and that alone, is the reason."
13308,AMY,67, Why is that?
13309,UNCLE LEO,67," He likes the spots. Oh uh, here's the tickets."
13310,JERRY,67, Thank you.
13311,UNCLE LEO,67," Oh uh, he asked me to give you a message. He said that he's very 
                sorry and he hopes you'll forgive 'em. "
13312,AMY,67," What are you talking about, I don't know Jeffrey. Oh so this is why you 
                brought me up here?"
13313,JERRY,67," Oh very convincing, but it's not gonna work this time."
13314,UNCLE LEO,67," What are you talking about? All he meant was that he was sorry that 
                the seats aren't very good."
13315,JERRY,67, Oh... oh... wanna get some pizza?

13328,Elaine,68, What do you think? 
13329,Jerry,68, You like him? 
13330,Elaine,68," Yeah, yeah like him, definitely like him. I like him a 
              lot. "
13331,George,68, What's wrong with him? 
13332,Elaine,68," Nothing, and I've looked. "
13333,George,68," Well, I'm sure you'll find something. "
13334,Jerry,68," So, how did you meet him? "
13335,Elaine,68, In the office. 
13336,Jerry,68," So, he's a writer. "
13337,Elaine,68, Yeah. 
13338,Jerry,68," Yeah, big surprise. "
13339,Elaine,68," So, I was sitting at the reception desk, I was looking 
              pretty hot. I was wearing my sling back pumps. "
13340,George,68, What are those? 
13341,Elaine,68," Ask your mother, you live with her now, don't you? Anyway, 
              so then this guy comes up to me and starts feeling my jacket through 
              his thumb and his forefinger"
13342,Jerry,68," So, what did you do? "
13343,George,68," Wow, just felt your material? "
13344,Elaine,68, Yeah...Jake Jarmel. 
13345,George,68, Sounds like a cool guy. 
13346,Jerry,68," Sounds like a jerk. Felt your material, come on. "
13347,George,68," Jerry, where did you get that sweater? "
13348,Jerry,68," What do you think? I found it at the back of my closet. 
            "
13349,George,68, I think that's what the back of closets are for. 
13350,Elaine,68," Hey, that's Barry. Look it's Barry. "
13351,Jerry,68, Hey... 
13352,Elaine,68, Hi. 
13353,George,68, Who's that? 
13354,Jerry,68," That's Barry Prophet, he's our accountant. "
13355,George,68," I don't know how you can let this guy handle all your money. 
            "
13356,Elaine,68," Oh, he doesn't handle my money, he handles Jerry's money. 
              He just does my taxes. "
13357,Jerry,68," Hey Barry, how you doing? This is my friend George. "
13358,Barry,68, Hi George. 
13359,Elaine,68," Hi, what are you doing on this neighborhood? "
13360,Barry,68," Nothing really. *sniffs* You, eh, you eat here? "
13361,Jerry,68," Yeah, so how's my money? "
13362,Barry,68, Still green. *sniffs* 
13363,Jerry,68," What, you got a cold? "
13364,Barry,68," No, no. "
13365,Elaine,68," Wow, look at that ring. "
13366,Barry,68," Oh, you like that? *sniffs* Say, where's the bathroom? "
13367,Jerry,68," Bathroom, bathroom is right over there. "
13368,Jerry,68, Did you see that? 
13369,Elaine,68, See what? 
13370,George,68," Yes, I saw that. "
13371,Jerry,68, What was all that sniffing? 
13372,Elaine,68, I don't know. 
13373,Jerry,68, You don't think...? 
13374,Elaine,68," Oh, no! Come on Jerry. "
13375,George,68, He was definitely sniffing. 
13376,Jerry,68," I mean what if, what if, this this guy has got all my money. 
              Plus he has got some Kramer's money with him. This guy can write 
              checks to himself right out of my account. "
13377,Elaine,68," I have known this guy since college. He doesn't do drugs. 
            "
13378,Jerry,68," Then, what was all that sniffing? "
13379,Elaine,68, Maybe it's the cold weather. 
13380,Jerry,68, Today is not cold. 
13381,George,68," All right, I've got to get going. My parents are expecting 
              me. "
13382,Elaine,68, Don't forget to wash your hands before supper. 
13383,Frank,68, Why do you need all that ketchup for? 
13384,George,68," This is my ketchup. I bought this ketchup just so I could 
              have as much as I want. "
13385,Frank,68," So, I talked to Phil Casacof today. "
13386,Estelle,68, Phil Casacof? 
13387,Frank,68," Yeah, you know my friend, the bra salesman. He says they 
              are looking maybe to put somebody on so I got you an interview next 
              Friday with his boss. "
13388,George,68," Next Friday, what time? "
13389,Frank,68, 2 o'clock. 
13390,George,68," That's my whole afternoon! I was going to look for sneakers. 
            "
13391,Frank,68, You can look for sneakers the next day! 
13392,Estelle,68, He doesn't know anything about bras. 
13393,George,68," I know a little. Besides, what do you have to know? "
13394,Frank,68," Well, it wouldn't hurt to go in the and be able to discuss 
              it intelligently. Maybe you should take a look at a few bras? Where 
              is you bra? Give him a bra to look. "
13395,Estelle,68, I am not giving him a bra. 
13396,Frank,68, Why not? 
13397,Estelle,68, Because I don't need him looking at my bra. 
13398,Frank,68," Why, so he'll go to the interview and he wouldn't know what 
              he's talking about!?! "
13399,George,68, Do we have to...? 
13400,Frank,68, You don't even know what they're made from. 
13401,George,68, They are made from lycra-spandex. 
13402,Frank,68, Get out of here! Lycra-spandex? 
13403,Estelle,68, I think they are made from lycra-spandex. 
13404,Frank,68, Wanna bet? How much you wanna bet? 
13405,Estelle,68, I'm not betting! 
13406,Frank,68, Take a look. 
13407,Estelle,68," All right, I'll get a bra. "
13408,Frank,68, I don't know what the big problem is getting a bra?! 
13409,George,68, She doesn't want to get a bra. 
13410,Frank,68," I'm not saying go to the library and read the whole history, 
              but it wouldn't kill you to know a little bit about it. "
13411,George,68," All right, it wouldn't kill me. "
13412,Frank,68," How long it takes to find a bra? What's going on in there? 
              You ask me to get a pair of underwear, I'm back in two seconds...you 
              know about the cup sizes and all? They have different cups. "
13413,George,68, I-I know about the cups. 
13414,Frank,68," You got the A, B, C the D. That's the biggest. "
13415,George,68," I know the D is the biggest. I've based my whole life on 
              knowing that the D is the biggest. "
13416,Estelle,68," Here, here's the bra. "
13417,Frank,68, Let me see it. 
13418,Estelle,68, 100% lycra-spandex. 
13419,Frank,68, Let me see it. 
13420,Estelle,68," I told you. Here, think you know everything? "
13421,Frank,68," Hmm, that's surprising. All right, what else? You got the 
              cups in the front, two loops in the back. All right, a guess that's 
              about it. "
13422,George,68," I got it. Cups in the front, loops in the back. "
13423,Estelle,68, You got ketchup on it! 
13424,Kramer,68," Sniffing, what do you mean sniffing? "
13425,Jerry,68," Sniffing, with his nose. "
13426,Kramer,68," Jerry, he probably had a cold. "
13427,Jerry,68," No, I asked him. "
13428,Kramer,68," So, what are you saying? "
13429,Jerry,68," I don't know, you know, what if...? "
13430,Kramer,68, Drugs? You think he's on drugs? 
13431,Jerry,68, I don't know. All I know he was sniffing. 
13432,Kramer,68," Jerry, listen, we went in on a CD together. "
13433,Jerry,68, I know. 
13434,Kramer,68," And Newman gave you money too. I didn't even meet this 
              guy. We trusted you. "
13435,Jerry,68," Look, it doesn't necessarily mean anything yet, it just 
              means he was sniffing. "
13436,Kramer,68," Well, what else? Was he nervous? Did he use a lot of slang? 
              Did he use the word 'man'? "
13437,Jerry,68," No, he didn't use 'man'. "
13438,Kramer,68, I mean when he was leaving did he say I'm splittin' ? 
13439,Jerry,68," No, but in one point he did use the bathroom. "
13440,Kramer,68, Whoh! 
13441,Jerry,68, Do you think that's a bad sign? 
13442,Kramer,68," Yes!! Yes, that's what they do! They live in the bathroom! 
              All right, what are we going to do? We are going to get our money 
              back, right? "
13443,Jerry,68," I don't know. This sweater really itches me. You want it? 
            "
13444,Kramer,68, Yeah. 
13445,Elaine,68," Hello.... hello, oh... "
13446,Jake,68," Well, you notice anything? "
13447,Elaine,68," You have cleaned out the whole apartment and you're making 
              dinner. Oh, you are a perfect, you are a perfect man. "
13448,Jake,68, Ooh... 
13449,Elaine,68, Did anyone call? 
13450,Jake,68," I got a few messages, I wrote them down. "
13451,Elaine,68, Where are they? 
13452,Jake,68," Lets see, they are...here they are. "
13453,Elaine,68," Thank you. Heh, I'll call you back.Ooh, Myra had the baby! 
              Oh, my God that's wonderful! Who called? "
13454,Jake,68, She did. 
13455,Elaine,68," She did? Oh, that's so great! "
13456,Jake,68, Where do you keep the corkscrew? 
13457,Elaine,68, In the drawer on the right. Hmm... 
13458,Jake,68, What? 
13459,Elaine,68, Oh it's nothing. 
13460,Jake,68, What is it? 
13461,Elaine,68, It's nothing. 
13462,Jake,68, Tell me. 
13463,Elaine,68," Well, I was just curious why you didn't use an exclamation 
              point? "
13464,Jake,68, What are you talking about? 
13465,Elaine,68," See, right here you wrote ""Myra had the baby"", 
              but you didn't use an exclamation point. "
13466,Jake,68, So? 
13467,Elaine,68," So, it's nothing. Forget it, forget it, I just find it 
              curious. "
13468,Jake,68, What's so curious about it? 
13469,Elaine,68," Well, I mean if one of your close friends had a baby and 
              I left you a message about it, I would use an exclamation point. 
            "
13470,Jake,68," Well, maybe I don't use my exclamation points as haphazardly 
              as you do. "
13471,Elaine,68," You don't think that someone having a baby warrants an 
              exclamation point. "
13472,Jake,68," Hey, I just chalked down the message. I didn't know I was 
              required to capture the mood of each caller. "
13473,Elaine,68," I just thought you would be a little more excited about 
              a friend of mine having a baby. "
13474,Jake,68," Ok, I'm excited. I just don't happen to like exclamation 
              points. "
13475,Elaine,68," Well, you know Jake, you should learn to use them. Like 
              the way I'm talking right now, I would put an exclamation points 
              at the end of all these sentences! On this one! And on that one! 
            "
13476,Jerry,68, You're out of your mind you know that. 
13477,Elaine,68, What? 
13478,Jerry,68," It's an exclamation point! It's a line with a dot under 
              it. "
13479,Elaine,68," Well, I felt a call for one. "
13480,Jerry,68," A call for one, you know I thought I've heard everything. 
              I've never heard a relationship being affected by a punctuation. 
            "
13481,Elaine,68, I found it very troubling that he didn't use one. 
13482,Jerry,68, George was right. Didn't take you long. 
13483,Kramer,68, Anything new on that guy on drugs? 
13484,Elaine,68, He's not on drugs. 
13485,Kramer,68," Then why the sniffing? Who walks around *sniff, sniff* 
              sniffing? "
13486,Elaine,68," All right, here, you call him right now. See if he's sniffing 
              right now. "
13487,Jerry,68, Good idea. 
13488,Voice on the phone,68, Prophet and Goldstein. 
13489,Jerry,68," Yes, I'd like to speak to Barry Prophet, please. "
13490,voice,68, I'm sorry he's out of town. 
13491,Jerry,68, Out of town? 
13492,voice,68," Yes, he went to South America. "
13493,Jerry,68, South America? 
13494,Kramer,68, South America? 
13495,Jerry,68," I'll call back, thank you. He went to South America! "
13496,Kramer,68, Yyyeeaaah!! 
13497,Elaine,68, So what? 
13498,Jerry,68, Who goes to South America? 
13499,Elaine,68, People go to South America. 
13500,Jerry,68," Yeah, and they come back with things taped to they're large 
              intestine. "
13501,Elaine,68," So, because of a few bad apples you're gonna impugn an 
              entire continent? "
13502,Jerry,68," Yes, I'm impugning a continent. "
13503,Kramer,68," Well, I say we're going to take our money right now! "
13504,Newman,68," Hey, hey... "
13505,Jerry,68, Hello Newman. 
13506,Newman,68," Hello Jerry. So, any news? "
13507,Kramer,68," Yeah, he skipped out and *ptruut* went to South America! 
            "
13508,Newman,68," South America?! What kind of snow blower did you get us 
              mixed up with? "
13509,Elaine,68," Ok, gentlemen. The fact remains you still have no proof. 
              This is all speculation and hearsay. "
13510,Kramer,68," Wait, there is one way to find out. We set up a sting. 
              You know like Abscam. Like Abscam Jerry. "
13511,Elaine,68," What are you gonna do? You gonna put on a phony beard and 
              dress-up like Arab sheiks and sit around in some hotel room. I mean 
              come on... "
13512,Jerry,68," Wait a second. Maybe there is someway we can tempt him and 
              find out... "
13513,Newman,68," If we put our three heads together we should come up with 
              something. "
13514,Kramer,68, What's today? 
13515,Newman,68, It's Thursday. 
13516,Kramer,68, Really? Feels like Tuesday. 
13517,Newman,68," Tuesday has no feel. Monday has a feel, Friday has a feel, 
              Sunday has a feel.... "
13518,Kramer,68, I feel Tuesday and Wednesday... 
13519,Jerry,68," All right, shut up the both of you! You're making me nervous. 
              Where is he already? He should've been out of work by now. "
13520,Newman,68," Hey, you know this is kind of fun. "
13521,Kramer,68," Yeah, maybe we oughta become private detectives... "
13522,Jerry,68, Yeah maybe you should. 
13523,Kramer,68, Maybe I will. 
13524,Newman,68," Yeah, me too. "
13525,Jerry,68," All right, what are you gonna say to him? "
13526,Kramer,68, Just gonna find out if he's interested. 
13527,Newman,68," Hey, hey maybe I should go with him? "
13528,Jerry,68," No, you stay in the car. "
13529,Newman,68, Who made you the leader? 
13530,Jerry,68," All right Newman, one more peep out of you and you're out 
              of the whole operation! There he is. He's going to that bar. "
13531,Kramer,68," All right, I'm going in. "
13532,Jerry,68, Be careful Kramer. 
13533,Newman,68, I've should've gone in with him. 
13534,Jerry,68," No, you stay here in the car. I may need you. "
13535,Newman,68, What you need me in the car for? 
13536,Jerry,68, I might need you to get me a soda. 
13537,Kramer,68," I'll have a brewsky , Charlie. "
13538,Bartender,68, Name's Mitch. 
13539,Kramer,68," Oh, there's nothing like a cold one after a long day, eh? 
            "
13540,Barry,68, Yeah. 
13541,Kramer,68," Oh yeah, I've been known to drink a beer or two. But then 
              again, I've been known to do a lot of things. "
13542,Kramer,68, Cigarette? 
13543,Barry,68," No, I never touch them. "
13544,Kramer,68," I suck'em down like Coca-Cola. Well here's to feeling good 
              all the time. "
13545,Kramer,68," Looks like you've got yourself a little cold there, eh? 
            "
13546,Barry,68, I don't think so. 
13547,Kramer,68, Me neither. 
13548,Jerry,68," You should try this new dental floss Glide, it's fantastic. 
            "
13549,Newman,68, I use dental tape. 
13550,Jerry,68, You should try this. 
13551,Newman,68, I don't wanna. 
13552,Jerry,68, Not even once? 
13553,Newman,68, No. 
13554,Jerry,68, You're an idiot. 
13555,Newman,68," Why, because I use dental tape? "
13556,Jerry,68," Right, anyone who uses dental tape is an idiot. "
13557,Kramer,68, South America? 
13558,Barry,68," Yeah, yeah. "
13559,Kramer,68, That's importuning(?) continent. 
13560,Barry,68, They are expanding their economic base. 
13561,Kramer,68, Tell me about it. 
13562,Barry,68," Excuse me, I have to go to the bathroom. "
13563,Kramer,68, I'm hip. 
13564,Barry,68, Hip to the what? 
13565,Kramer,68, To the whole scene. *sniff* 
13566,Barry,68, What scene? 
13567,Kramer,68," The bathroom scene. *sniff, sniff* "
13568,Barry,68," Listen, don't take this personally, but when I'm coming 
              back I'm sitting over there. "
13569,Newman,68," No, no I don't like it. "
13570,Jerry,68," What do you mean you don't like it? How could you not like 
              it? "
13571,Newman,68, I like the thick tape. 
13572,Barry,68, Heeyy!! What kind of a nut are you? 
13573,Farkus,68," So, basically the job here is quite simple. Selling bras. 
            "
13574,George,68," Well, that interests me very much Mr. Farkus.Very much 
              indeed, sir. "
13575,Farkus,68, Have you ever sold a woman's line before? 
13576,George,68," No, but I have very good repute with women, very good, 
              top form. And the first time I laid my I on brassieres I was enthralled. 
            "
13577,Farkus,68, Hum. tell me about it. 
13578,Farkus,68," That's incredible story. You have a remarkable passion 
              for brassieres. "
13579,George,68," They are more than an underwear to me Mr.Farkus. Two cups 
              in the front, two loops in the back. How do they do it? "
13580,Farkus,68," Well, I think I can say, barring some unforeseen incident, 
              that you'll have a very bright future here at ED Granmont. "
13581,George,68," Thank you Mr.Farkus, thank you very much indeed. "
13582,Farkus,68, See you monday 9 o'clock. 
13583,George,68," If you don't mind, sir. I'll be here at 8. "
13584,Farkus,68, Excellent. 
13585,George,68," So long, Mr. Farkus. "
13586,Ms. De Granmont,68, What you're think you're doing? 
13587,George,68," Oh, nothing... "
13588,Ms. De Granmont,68," Farkus, get out here! "
13589,Farkus,68," Yes, Ms. De Granmont? "
13590,Ms. De Granmont,68, Who is this pervert little weasel? 
13591,Farkus,68," This is Costanza, he's our new bra salesman. He's supposed 
              to start on monday. "
13592,Ms. De Granmont,68," If he's here on monday, you're not. Take a pick. 
            "
13593,Farkus to George,68, Get out! 
13594,Farkus to Ms. De Granmont,68," I'm terribly sorry Ms. De Granmont... 
            "
13595,Elaine,68," You wanted to see me, Mr. Lippman? "
13596,Lippman,68," I was just going over the Jake Jarmel book and I understand 
              you worked with him very closely. "
13597,Elaine,68," Yes, krhm, yes I did. "
13598,Lippman,68," And, anyway I was just reading your final edit, um, there 
              seems to be an inordinate number of exclamation points. "
13599,Elaine,68," Well, I felt that the writing lacked certain emotion and 
              intensity. "
13600,Lippman,68," Oh, ""It was damp and chilly afternoon, so I decided 
              to put on my sweatshirt!"" "
13601,Elaine,68," Right, well... "
13602,Lippman,68, You put exclamation point after sweatshirt? 
13603,Elaine,68," That's that's correct, I-I felt that the character doesn't 
              like to be ch-ch-chilly... "
13604,Lippman,68," I see, ""I pulled the lever on the machine, but the 
              Clark bar didn't come out!"" Exclamation point? "
13605,Elaine,68," Well, yeah, you know how frustrating that can be when you 
              keep putting quarters and quarters in to machine and then *prrt* 
              nothing comes out... "
13606,Lippman,68, Get rid of the exclamation points... 
13607,Elaine,68," Ok, ok ok ... "
13608,Lippman,68, I hate exclamation points... 
13609,Elaine,68, ...ok I'll just.... 
13610,Jerry,68," 'Dear Barry. Consider this letter to be official termination 
              of our relationship effective immediately.' "
13611,Kramer,68, Exclamation point. 
13612,Elaine,68, You still have no proof. 
13613,Kramer,68," Elaine, he was sniffing like crazy around me. "
13614,Jerry,68," 'I will expect all funds in form of cashier checks no later 
              than the 18th'. "
13615,Kramer,68, Double exclamation point! 
13616,Newman,68, Will that take care of ours too? 
13617,Jerry,68," Yeah, I'll give you yours as soon as I get my money back. 
            "
13618,Newman,68," Hey, you want me to mail it? I'm on my way out anyway. 
            "
13619,Jerry,68," Yeah, thanks. "
13620,Newman,68, It'll be my pleasure. 
13621,Newman,68, See'ya later. 
13622,Jerry,68, You know this... 
13623,Kramer,68," Hey, Ralph. "
13624,Jerry,68, Hi Ralph. 
13625,Ralph,68," What's up fellows? That'll be 14,30. "
13626,Jerry,68, All right. 
13627,Kramer,68," Mushrooms, you got mushrooms Jerry? "
13628,Jerry,68, Yeah. 
13629,Kramer,68, What's the matter? You've got a cold? 
13630,Ralph,68," No Kramer, what is this? "
13631,Kramer,68, It's a sweater. 
13632,Ralph,68, What's it made out of? 
13633,Kramer,68," I don't know, Jerry gave it to me. "
13634,Jerry,68," Mohair, I think. "
13635,Ralph,68," Mohair, that figures, I'm allergic to mohair. "
13636,Jerry,68, You mean you just started sniffing? 
13637,Ralph,68," Yeah, mohair does it to me every time. "
13638,Jerry,68," I was wearing that sweater in the coffee shop when Barry 
              came in. "
13639,Kramer,68," Jerry, I was wearing it in the bar. "
13640,Elaine,68," The sweater! The sweater made him sniff! I told you he 
              wasn't a drug addict. "
13641,Jerry,68," Oh no! The letter, Newman, it's got exclamation points all 
              over it! "
13642,Kramer,68, Not to mention the picture of him on the toilet. 
13643,Jerry,68, The what?? 
13644,Newman,68, After you. 
13645,Woman,68, Thank you. 
13646,Woman,68, Get your hands off of me! Johnny!!! Johnny! 
13647,Frank,68," What do you mean you felt the material? What, with your 
              fingers like this? "
13648,George,68," So what, what is so bad about that? "
13649,Estelle,68," Who goes around feeling people's material? What can be 
              gained feeling a person's material? It's insanity! "
13650,Frank,68," What ever happened to ""Why, that's a lovely dress you 
              have on. May I have this dance?""!! "
13651,Elaine,68, You are really lucky Newman never mailed that letter. 
13652,Jerry,68," Sorry I'm late, I just came from a meeting with my lawyer. 
            "
13653,Elaine,68, What is this? 
13654,Jerry,68, It's a letter from your friend Barry Prophet's lawyer. 
13655,Elaine,68," He is filing a chapter eleven. Why, what's going on, why 
              is he filing a chapter eleven? "
13656,Jerry,68," Bankruptcy, bankruptcy...as in I've taken your money and 
              spent it on drugs! "
13657,Elaine,68," What do you mean, I thought it was the sweater. "
13658,Kramer,68," All right, What about the money? "
13659,Jerry,68," What about the money? Apparently if I had dissolved my relationship 
              with him prior to his filing chapter eleven, I've could've got the 
              money back. Which I"
13660,Newman,68," Pair of bear claws, please. "
13661,Woman,68, Nice. 
13662,Jerry,68, Think so? 
13663,Woman,68," Yeah, what is it? "
13664,Jerry,68," Half silk, half cotton, half linen. How can you go wrong?

13689,Jerry,70," Professional tennis. To me I don't understand all the shushing. 
              Why are they always shushing. Shh, shh. Don't the players know that 
              we're there? Should we duck down behind the seats so they don't 
              see us watching them? Tennis is basically just ping-pong and the 
              players are standing on the table. That's all it is. And that goofy 
              scoring, you win one point and all the sudden you're up by 15. Two 
              points, 30-love. 30-love. Sounds like an English call girl. ""That'll 
              be 30, love... And could you be a little quieter next time, please, 
              shh."""
13690,Jerry,70, Are these seats unbelievable or what?
13691,George,70, Where's the sunblock?
13692,Jerry,70, Here.
13693,George,70, 25? You don't have anything higher?
13694,Jerry,70," What, are you on Mercury?"
13695,George,70," I need higher. This has paba in it, I need paba-free."
13696,Jerry,70, You got a problem with paba?
13697,George,70," Yes, I have a problem with paba."
13698,Jerry,70, You don't even know what paba is.
13699,George,70, I know enough to stay away from it.
13700,George,70, So are you going to Todd's party this weekend?
13701,Jerry,70, I'll go if someone else drives. You going?
13702,George,70, Gwen really wants to go.
13703,Jerry,70, You're bringing a date to a party?
13704,George,70, No good?
13705,Jerry,70," A party is a bad date situation. It doesn't matter who you're 
              with. You could be with J. Edgar Hoover. You don't want to sit and 
              talk with Hoover all night. You want to circulate. (Makes hand motions) 
              Ho, ho, ho."
13706,George,70," Why'd you pick Hoover? Was he that interesting to talk 
              to?"
13707,Jerry,70," Well I would think, with the law enforcement and the cross 
              dressing. Seems like an interesting guy."
13708,George,70," Yeah I guess. What can I do? I gotta take her with me. 
              Todd introduced us, I'm obligated."
13709,Jerry,70, That woman is absolutely stunning.
13710,George,70, The Croat? [the tennis player]
13711,Jerry,70," Not the Croat, the lineswoman. That is the most beautiful 
              lineswoman I've ever seen."
13712,George,70," Yeah, she's a B.L."
13713,Jerry,70, B.L.?
13714,George,70," Beautiful lineswoman. I'm going to go to the concession 
              stand and get some real sunblock. You want anyting? Jerry? (Jerry 
              is staring at the lineswoman) Jerry?"
13715,Coworker,70," You know, I just heard the Lexington line is out."
13716,Elaine,70, You are kidding me. How am I supposed to get to this meeting?
13717,Coworker,70, Take a car service. We have an account.
13718,Elaine,70," Oh forget it, I hate those. Everytime I take one, the driver 
              will *not* stop talking to me. No matter how disinterested I seem 
              he just keeps yakking away. Blah, blah, blah, blah. Why does everything 
              always have to have a social componant? Now a stage coach, that 
              would have been a good situation for me. Cause I'm in the coach, 
              and the driver is way up there on the stage. "
13719,Coworker,70," Well you're not going to get a cab now. Four thirty in 
              the afternoon? Read a magazine, keep your head down."
13720,Elaine,70, I guess that could work.
13721,Announcer,70," And that is it. The match to Ms. Natalia Valdoni. Comming 
              up next, mens single, but for now let's stop a minute and take a 
              look at our beautiful tennis center backdrop."
13722,Kramer,70," Hey, hey, it's George."
13723,Announcer,70," Holy cow it's a scorcher. Boy I bet you that guy can 
              cover a lot of court. Hey buddy, they got a new invention. It's 
              called a napkin. We'll take a station break and continue with more..."
13724,Driver,70," Dag Gavershole Plaza (sp?) huh? (Elaine ignores him) Pendant 
              Publishing, that's books right? (Elaine is annoyed and still ignoring 
              him) Miss?"
13725,Elaine,70, Pardon me?
13726,Driver,70," Books, that's what you do?"
13727,Elaine,70, Yeah.
13728,Driver,70," Yeah, I don't read much myself, (Elaine is annoyed) well 
              you know besides the paper. Yeah a lot of people read to relax, 
              but not me. You know what I do? "
13729,Elaine,70," You know I'm having a lot of trouble, um, hearing you back 
              here. So..."
13730,Driver,70," (Yelling) I said you know what I do (Elaine is very annoyed) 
              when I want to relax? The Jumble. Hey do you make a book of Jumbles?"
13731,Elaine,70, I'm going to have to be honest with you. I'm going deaf.
13732,Driver,70, Going deaf?
13733,Elaine,70, What?
13734,Driver,70, Oh I'm sorry.
13735,Elaine,70, It can be very frustrating.
13736,Driver,70, Hey what about a hearing aid?
13737,Elaine,70," An I fearing AIDS? Oh, yeah sure, who isn't. But you know 
              you gotta live your life."
13738,Driver,70," No, no I said. Ehhh, forget it. (Elaine looks pleased)"
13739,Jerry,70," I can't take my eyes off that lineswoman. That lineswoman 
              is absolutely mesmerizing."
13740,George,70, Boy you are really smitten.
13741,Jerry,70, I gotta talk to her. What do you think?
13742,George,70," Cold? How are you going to do that? You're not one of those 
              guys."
13743,Jerry,70," I'm going to psyche myself into it like those people that 
              just walk across the hot coals."
13744,George,70," They're not mocked and humiliated when they get to the 
              other side."
13745,Jerry,70, I have to. I won't be able to live with myself.
13746,George,70," Wait a minute Jerry, there's a bigger issue here. If you 
              go through that wall and become one of those guys I'll be left here 
              on this side. Take me with you."
13747,Jerry,70, I can't.
13748,George,70, What are you going to say?
13749,Jerry,70," I don't know, ""Hi""."
13750,George,70," You think you're going to the other side with ""Hi""? 
              You're not going to make it."
13751,Radio,70, Base to 92 come in
13752,Driver,70, Yes this is 92

13755,Elaine,70," Tom Hanks? After me you're picking up Tom Hanks? I love 
              him."
13756,Driver,70, So I guess your hearing goes in and out huh?
13757,Elaine,70, Yeah. Yes it does...
13758,Driver,70," Yeah. You know what I think? I think you made that whole 
              thing up. "
13759,Elaine,70," No no, no no."
13760,Driver,70," Yeah yeah, I know your type. You're too good to make conversation 
              with someone like me. Oh god forbid you could discuss the Jumbles. 
              But to go so far as to pretend you're almost deaf, I mean that is 
              truly disgusting. And Mr. Tom Hanks, may I say he too would be disgusted 
              by your behavior."
13761,Jerry,70," Excuse me. (Woman ignores him) Excuse me? (Still ignores 
              him) Oh that's nice. That's right ignore me. That's real polite. 
              Nobody's even talking to you. All you big lineswoman. Oh you've 
              got some kind of a cool job. I know your type thinking your too 
              good for everyone, but it's women like you (woman turns around and 
              notices him) oh well, what are you deaf?"
13762,Laura,70, Bingo.
13763,Kramer,70, And you're saying she's deaf.
13764,Jerry,70," I'm not *saying* she's deaf, she's deaf."
13765,Kramer,70, Can't hear a thing.
13766,Jerry,70, Can't hear a thing.
13767,Kramer,70, And you're going to go out with her.
13768,Jerry,70," Yeah, isn't that something?"
13769,Elaine,70, Hey.
13770,Jerry and Kramer,70, Hey.
13771,Kramer,70, Hey I know how to sign. 
13772,Jerry,70, Really?
13773,Kramer,70," Yeah when I was 8, I had a deaf cousin who lived with us 
              for about a year. (signing as he speaks) So I haven't been able 
              to do it in a while."
13774,Elaine,70, What is this about?
13775,Jerry,70, I met this deaf lineswoman at the tennis match.
13776,Elaine,70," You are kidding. That is amazing. (She pushes Jerry, Jerry 
              falls back into Kramer.) I just took a car service from work and 
              to get the driver to not talk to me, I pretended I was going deaf."
13777,Jerry,70, Wow good plan.
13778,Elaine,70," Oh didn't work. He caught me hearing. I know it's terrible, 
              but I'm not a terrible person."
13779,Jerry and Kramer,70, No.
13780,Elaine,70," No. When I shoo squirrels away, I always say ""get 
              out of here"". I never ever throw things at them and try to 
              injure them like other people. "
13781,Jerry,70, That's nice.
13782,Elaine,70," Yeah, and when I see freaks in the street I never, ever 
              stare at them. Yet, I'm careful not to look away, you know, because 
              I want to make the freaks feel comfortable."
13783,Jerry,70, That's nice for the freaks.
13784,Elaine,70," Yeah, and I don't poof up my hair when I got to a movie 
              so people behind me can see. I've got to make it up to this guy 
              or I won't be able to live with myself. What can I do?"
13785,Jerry,70," Why don't you get him some tickets or something, how about 
              that friend of yours that works at the ticket area."
13786,Kramer,70," Yeah yeah Pete, he can get you great tickets to something. 
              Like a rock concert. Whatever you like."
13787,Elaine,70," Oh, thanks Kramer."
13788,Kramer,70," You got it. Hey Jerry, do me a favor. The next time you 
              see that lineswoman ask her how those ball boys get those jobs. 
              I would love to be able to do that."
13789,Jerry,70," Kramer, I think perhaps you've overlooked one of the key 
              aspects of this activity. It's ball *boys*, not ball men. There 
              are no ball men."
13790,Elaine,70, Yeah I think he's right. I've never seen a ball man.
13791,Kramer,70, Well there ought to be ball men.
13792,Jerry,70," All right I'll talk to her. If you want to be a ball man 
              go ahead, break the ball barrier."
13793,Elaine,70," Hey you know a friend of mine from work said that she saw 
              George at the tennis match on TV yesterday."
13794,Kramer,70," Yeah, yeah me too. Yeah he was at the snack bar eating 
              a hot fudge sundae. He had it all over his face. He was wearing 
              that chocolate on his face like a beard and they got in there real 
              nice and tight. And he's... (Imitates scooping up ice cream.)"
13795,Gwen,70, I'm sorry George.
13796,George,70," I don't understand things were going so great. What happened? 
              Something must have happened."
13797,Gwen,70," It's not you, it's me."
13798,George,70," You're giving me the ""it's not you, it's me"" 
              routine? I invented ""it's not you, it's me"". Nobody tells 
              me it's them not me, if it's anybody it's me."
13799,Gwen,70," All right, George, it's you."
13800,George,70, You're *damn* right it's me.
13801,Gwen,70, I was just trying to...
13802,George,70," I know what you were trying to do. Nobody does it better 
              than me."
13803,Gwen,70, I'm sure you do it very well.
13804,George,70," Yes well unfortunately you'll never get the chance to find 
              out."
13805,Jerry,70, But I thought things were going great.
13806,George,70, Yeah so did I.
13807,Jerry,70, Did she say why?
13808,George,70," No. She tried to give me the ""it's not you, it's me"" 
              routine."
13809,Jerry,70, But that's your routine.
13810,George,70, Yeah. Well aparently word's out.
13811,Kramer,70," Hey, George, I saw you on TV yesterday."
13812,George,70, Really? At the tennis match?
13813,Kramer,70, Yeah you were at the snack bar eating a hot fudge sundae.
13814,George,70, Get out of here. I didn't see any cameras there.
13815,Kramer,70," Oh, the cameras was, vrooom, there. The announcers, they 
              made a couple of cracks about you."
13816,George,70, Cracks? What were they saying?
13817,Kramer,70," That you had ice cream all over your face. They were talking 
              about how funny you looked."
13818,George,70, Maybe Gwen saw it. Maybe that's what did it.
13819,Kramer,70, Well I'll tell you it wasn't a pretty sight.
13820,George,70, She must have seen me eating it on TV.
13821,Jerry,70," So she sees you with hot fudge on your face and she ends 
              it? You really think she would be that superficial?"
13822,George,70, Why not. I would be.
13823,Jerry,70," Hello... Oh hi dad... You saw him?... Really with the ice 
              cream?... All right I'll talk to you later, bye. "
13824,George,70, You're parents saw me on TV?
13825,Jerry,70, Yeah.
13826,George,70, This is nighmare. Kramer how long was I on?
13827,Kramer,70, It felt like 8 seconds.
13828,George,70," One-one-thousand, two-one-thousand, three-one-thousand."
13829,Elaine,70," I heard you *really* inhaled that thing. Did anyone tape 
              it?"
13830,George,70, Can we move on?
13831,Jerry,70," He thinks Gwen broke up with him because she saw him eating 
              the ice cream on TV."
13832,Elaine,70, Oh come on. If she's that superficial you don't want her.
13833,George,70, Yes I do.
13834,Elaine,70, So I guess you're not going to Todd's party on Friday.
13835,George,70," Well I can't now, Gwen's going to be there."
13836,Kramer,70, Well she should be the one that shouldn't go.
13837,Jerry,70," Well if a couple breaks up and have plans to go to a neutral 
              place, who withdraws? What's the ettiquite? "
13838,Kramer,70, Excellent question.
13839,Jerry,70," I think she should withdraw. She's the breaker, he's the 
              breakee. He needs to get on with his life."
13840,Elaine,70, I beg to differ.
13841,Jerry,70, Really.
13842,Elaine,70," He's the *loser*. She's the victor. To the victor belong 
              the spoils."
13843,Jerry,70," Well I don't care, I don't want to go anyway. I don't want 
              to fight that traffic on Friday night."
13844,Elaine,70, Well we can take the car service from my office.
13845,Jerry,70, Really?
13846,Elaine,70," Yeah, they don't know."
13847,Kramer,70," All right, I'll see you later."
13848,Jerry,70, Okay.
13849,George,70," ""To the victor goes the spoils."" What are you 
              going to do tonight?"
13850,Jerry,70, Oh I got a date with Laura the lineswoman.
13851,George,70, Oh. (he stands there)
13852,Jerry,70," Why? (George fiddles with the lock on the door.) Well what 
              are you doing?"
13853,George,70," Well I was just going to wander the streets. Wouldn't want 
              to tag along with you or anything."
13854,Jerry,70," Oh, uh, do you want to come with us?"
13855,George,70," Jerry please, that's very nice, but, uh, (closes the door) 
              where would we be going?"
13856,George,70," So, I've got ice cream all over my face. There were no 
              napkins there. Whoever it was that's responsible for stocking that 
              concession stand cost me a relationship."
13857,Laura,70, They never have napkins there.
13858,Jerry,70," Let's get the check. (Waves in the air) Is this considered 
              signing? Do you do this when you want the check? Really. I know 
              a sign, that's my first sign."
13859,Laura,70," Uh, oh. That couple is breaking up."
13860,George,70, They're breaking up? How do you know?
13861,Jerry,70, She reads lips.
13862,George,70, What are they saying now?
13863,Laura,70," ""It's not you, it's me."""
13864,George,70," (Holding his drink up to his mouth) Oh my gosh, I just 
              had a great idea. She could come to the party tomorrow and read 
              Gwen's lips for me."
13865,Jerry,70, (Puts his hand over his mouth) What?
13866,George,70," (Puts nuts into his mouth, and in the process covers his 
              mouth) We bring her to the party, and she can tell me what Gwen 
              is saying about me."
13867,Jerry,70," (Holds his drink up to his mouth) She's not a novelty act, 
              George. Where you hire her out for weddings and bar mitzvas."
13868,George,70," (Puts his hands on his face, rubbing his eyes) Look. It's 
              a skill, just like juggling. She probably enjoys showing it off."
13869,Jerry,70," (Puts his napkin over his mouth) I don't know George. I'm 
              not sure about this."
13870,George,70," (Puts his arms in the air, stretching, and covers his mouth 
              with an arm) Could you ask her, just ask her. If she says no, case 
              closed."
13871,Jerry,70, (Puts his hand on his chin over his mouth) All right.
13872,Jerry,70," Uh Laura, George was wondering if..."
13873,Laura,70, Sure. I'll do it.
13874,Jerry,70, So I really had a good time.
13875,Laura,70," Yeah, me too."
13876,Jerry,70, So you want to go to the party on Friday night?
13877,Laura,70, Yeah.
13878,Jerry,70," All right, we're taking a car service. So we'll swing by 
              and pick you up. How about six? (Laura looks offended). Six is good. 
              (Laura looks offended and angry). You got a problem with six? (Laura 
              opens the door and gets out). What? What? "
13879,Man,70," Okay listen up people. There are plenty of you here, but we've 
              only got two spots to fill. Good luck."
13880,Boy,70," Hey pops, isn't there a better way to spend your twilight 
              years?"
13881,Kramer,70," I may be old, but I'm spry."
13882,Boy,70," The tryout lasts three and a half to four hours. Are you up 
              for it?"
13883,Kramer,70, Oh I'll be up for it punk.
13884,Jerry,70," See I was saying ""six"" but she thought I was saying 
              ""sex"". We straightened the whole thing out though."
13885,George,70," She confused ""six"" with ""sex""?"
13886,Jerry,70, Yeah.
13887,George,70," Well if she can't tell ""six"" from ""sex"" 
              then how is she going to lip read from across the room?"
13888,Jerry,70," Well ""six"" and ""sex"" are close."
13889,George,70," It's two completely different sounds. ""ih"" and 
              ""eh""."
13890,Jerry,70, Eh.
13891,George,70, It seems like a problem.
13892,Jerry,70, Well I'm not dating any other deaf women.
13893,Kramer,70, Hey guess who's going to be the new ball man for the finals.
13894,Jerry,70, You're kidding.
13895,Kramer,70," Yeah. They said they haven't seen anybody go after balls 
              with such gusto."
13896,George,70, When is that car service comming?
13897,Jerry,70," In five minutes. He's then going to pick us up, then we're 
              going to pick up Elaine, and Laura is going to meet us there."
13898,George,70," If this lip reading thing works tonight do you know how 
              incredible this is going to be? It's like having Superman for your 
              friend."
13899,Jerry,70, I know. It's like X-ray vision.
13900,George,70," If we could just harness this power and use it for our 
              own personal gain, there'd be no stopping us."
13901,Newman,70," I hear you've got some lip reader working for you. You 
              gotta let me use her for one day. Just one day."
13902,Jerry,70, Can't do it Newman.
13903,Newman,70," But Jerry, we've got this new supervisor down at the post 
              office. He's working behind this glass. I know they're talking about 
              me. They're going to transfer me, I know it. Two hours, give me 
              two hours."
13904,Jerry,70, Not going to happen.
13905,Newman,70," (Sinister) All right, all right. All right you go ahead. 
              You go ahead and keep it secret. But you remember this. When you 
              control the mail, you control... information."
13906,Jerry,70, Oh just pull over right there by the stop sign.
13907,Driver (The same driver as before),70, Pardon me sir?
13908,Jerry,70, I said pull over by the stop sign.
13909,Driver,70," I'm so sorry, you'll have to forgive me. I can't hear a 
              damn thing. I went to that rock concert last night at the garden. 
              My seats were right up agains the speaker. It's a heavy metal group. 
              Metalla-something."
13910,Kramer,70, -ca.
13911,Driver,70, Huh?
13912,George,70, What?
13913,Jerry,70, ca.
13914,George,70, ah.
13915,Driver,70, My ears are still ringing. Some woman's idea of a joke.
13916,Driver,70, Get out. Get out. Go on. Hey. Shut the door.
13917,Jerry,70," You know the whole idea of taking the car service was so 
              I wouldn't have to fight the traffic on Friday night."
13918,Jerry,70," I know. I'm late. Hey now I know two signs, (puts his hand 
              in the air) check, and (points to his watch) late. Hey this is the 
              guy you helped become the first ball man."
13919,Kramer,70, She doesn't know what she's talking about.
13920,Todd,70, Guys you made it.
13921,George,70, Hey hey.
13922,Todd,70, Sorry to hear about Gwen.
13923,George,70," Why? Did she say something to you about why she broke up 
              with me?"
13924,Todd,70," Oh no. Tonight will be the first chance I've had to talk 
              to her. Look George, I'm friends with both of you. I can't betray 
              her confidence by telling you anything."
13925,George,70," I wouldn't hear of it, huh. It's none of my business. You 
              should try to find out everything you possibly can. In fact, I'll 
              even stay all the way on the other side of the room so there's no 
              chance of me overhearing anything."
13926,Todd,70, You are so centered.
13927,George,70," (to the others) Let's go, let's go. All right what are 
              they saying?"
13928,Kramer,70," ""Hi Gwen, hi tide."""
13929,Jerry,70, Hi tide?
13930,Kramer,70, Hi Todd.
13931,Kramer,70," ""You've got something between your teeth"""
13932,George,70, What?
13933,Kramer,70," No that's what he said. ""That's interesting. I love 
              carrots, but I hate carrot soup. And I hate peas, but I love pea 
              soup."" So do I."
13934,Elaine,70," She's so wild. Can I borrow her for a few hours tomorrow 
              afternoon?"
13935,Jerry,70, No. If I lend her to you I'll have to lend her to everybody.
13936,Gwen,70, I don't envy you Todd. The place is going to be a mess.
13937,Todd,70," Maybe you can stick around after everybody leaves and we 
              can sweep together."
13938,Kramer,70," ""Why don't you stick around and we can sleep together."""
13939,George,70, What?
13940,Kramer,70," ""You want me to sleep with you?"""
13941,Todd,70, I don't want to sweep alone.
13942,Kramer,70," He says ""I don't want to sleep alone."" She says, 
              oh boy, ""love to."""
13943,George,70," So you're getting rid of me and now the two of you are 
              going to sleep together?"
13944,Gwen,70, What? You're crazy.
13945,Kramer,70," ""What? You're crazy."""
13946,George,70, I heard your whole conversation.
13947,Gwen,70, How?
13948,Kramer,70," ""How?"""
13949,George,70," (looks back to the group) I can read lips. You said let's 
              sleep together."
13950,Gwen,70," No I didn't. I said ""sweep"". Let's sweep together, 
              you know with a broom. Cleaning up."
13951,Kramer,70," ""... with a broom, cleaning up."""
13952,George,70, Sweep?
13953,Gwen,70, Yes sweep.
13954,Kramer,70," ""Yes sweep."""
13955,George,70, Cut it.
13956,Kramer,70," George says ""Cut it."""
13957,George,70, Cut it.
13958,Kramer,70," George is saying ""Cut it."""
13959,George,70," Cut it. (goes back to the group) (Yelling) Would you stop 
              signing? She said ""sweep together"" you idiots, not ""sleep 
              together."""
13960,Kramer,70, I know how to sign.
13961,George,70," Ow. My eye, my eye."
13962,Elaine,70," It's so amazing getting to see Monica Sellas playing in 
              the finals."
13963,Jerry,70, I know and on the first tournament of her comeback.
13964,Jerry,70, Thus ends the great ball man experiment.
13965,Driver (The same driver as before),70, You with the tennis center?
13966,Laura,70, Yep.
13967,Driver,70," Hey how about that ball man injuring Monica Sellas. Wasn't 
              that something."
13968,Driver,70," Oh. (Very suspicious look on his face.)

              as a fairly progressive company. We"
13973,George,72, Well a lot of people consider me small and prestigious.
13974,Mr. Tuttle,72," That's funny George. You're very quick. I feel like 
              I, like I don't have to explain every little"
13975,George,72, I enjoy understanding.
13976,Mr. Tuttle,72, I want you to have this job. Of course...
13977,Secretary,72, Mr. Zimmer is on line 2.
13978,Mr. Tuttle,72," Thanks. I've got to take this call. Listen, I'm really 
              glad that you came in."
13979,George,72, I want you to have this job. Of course...
13980,Jerry,72, Yeah?
13981,George,72, That's it.
13982,Jerry,72, What do you mean that's it?
13983,George,72," He never finished the sentence. He got a call, that was 
              the end of the interview."
13984,Jerry,72," ""Of course"" was the last thing he said?"
13985,George,72," Maybe he was going to say ""Of course I have to check 
              with my associates."""
13986,Elaine,72," ""I want you to have this job, of course the Board 
              of Directors is under indictment and will be"
13987,Jerry,72," ""I want you to have this job, of course sodomy is a 
              prerequisite."""
13988,George,72, All right.
13989,Elaine,72, Why don't you go ahead and call him?
13990,George,72," Because he made a big deal about how I understand everything 
              immediately. That's what"
13991,Jerry,72," So if you call and ask if you have the job, you might lose 
              the job."
13992,George,72, And if I don't call...
13993,Jerry,72," You might have the job, but you'll never know it. What kind 
              of company is it?"
13994,George,72, Rest stop supply.
13995,Kramer,72," Yeah, yeah, yeah, hey."
13996,Jerry,72, Shower?
13997,Kramer,72, Haircut.
13998,Jerry,72, Who'd you use? Gino?
13999,Kramer,72, Oh course. I wouldn't let that other butcher cut my hair.
14000,Elaine,72, What butcher?
14001,Kramer,72, The uncle Enzo. That's the guy Jerry uses.
14002,Jerry,72," Well I've been going with him for 12 years. I can't switch. 
              I'd hurt his feelings."
14003,Elaine,72, You never get good haircuts.
14004,Kramer,72," You can get a good one today. It's Enzo's day off. Gino's 
              there all by himself."
14005,Jerry,72, Really?
14006,Elaine,72," Yeah. You know what, you should go over there and get one 
              to look good for my bachelor"
14007,Kramer,72, What bachelor auction?
14008,Elaine,72," Oh it's a thing where they auction off dates with bachelors 
              for charity."
14009,Kramer,72," And you didn't ask me to do it? I could raise enough money 
              to cure polio."
14010,Jerry,72, I believe they've had a cure for polio for quite some time.
14011,Kramer,72, Polio?
14012,Elaine,72, Will you go ahead? You need a haircut.
14013,Jerry,72, Okay.
14014,Kramer,72, What are you all dressed up for?
14015,George,72, I had a job interview.
14016,Kramer,72, Yeah. How'd it go?
14017,George,72, Good. Of course...
14018,Enzo,72, Oh Jerry.
14019,Jerry,72, Oh hi Enzo.
14020,Enzo,72," Oh, you've come for the haircut."
14021,Jerry,72," No, actually I was just..."
14022,Enzo,72," It's my day off, but I take care of you anyway because you're 
              my favorite customer. You've been "
14023,Jerry,72," Well I, if it's your day off I really... (tries to leave)"
14024,Enzo,72," (He pulls Jerry into the barber chair. Jerry is trying to 
              get away but can't.) Eh, what's the difference."
14025,Jerry,72, Well I don't want to take too much off.
14026,Enzo,72," Hey who's your barber, eh? You tell the joke, I cut the hair."
14027,Man,72," Gino, you've outdone yourself this time. This is the best 
              haircut I've ever had."
14028,George,72, He massacred you. You look like you're five years old.
14029,Jerry,72, What if I shampoo? Sometimes a shampoo helps.
14030,George,72," You've got to start seeing someone else. Get out of this 
              relationship."
14031,Jerry,72," I can't. He loves me. He says I'm his most loyal customer. 
              Plus he's right there on the corner. I'd"
14032,George,72, You gotta do it.
14033,Jerry,72," I can't, I can't. I'd break his heart."
14034,Kramer,72, No way my Gino did that. It's an Enzo.
14035,Jerry,72, He did the job. You told me he wasn't going to be there.
14036,Kramer,72, So what?
14037,Jerry,72, I didn't want to hurt his feelings.
14038,Kramer,72," His feelings? You can't continue seeing him. You're destroying 
              yourself. I'm not going to let "
14039,Jerry,72, No Kramer. I don't want you to do that. You can't do that.
14040,Kramer,72," I'm going to call Gino, you're going to see him, and we're 
              going to get that haircut fixed up."
14041,Jerry,72, I don't want you to call him.
14042,Kramer,72," All right, geez. You're crazy."
14043,George,72, So I still haven't heard about that job.
14044,Jerry,72," Yeah that's a tough one. What are you going to do about 
              that?"
14045,George,72, I have an idea.
14046,Jerry,72, Yeah?
14047,George,72, I show up.
14048,Jerry,72, What do you mean you show up?
14049,George,72," I show up. I pretend I have the job. The guy's on vacation. 
              If I have the job, it's fine. If I don't"
14050,Jerry,72, Hmm. Not bad.
14051,George,72, What's the worst thing that could happen?
14052,Jerry,72," Well, you'd be embarrassed and humiliated in front of a 
              large group of people and have to walk out"
14053,George,72," Yeah, so?"
14054,George,72," (to various people as he walks in) Good morning. Good morning. 
              Good morning. Hi nice to see"
14055,Secretary,72, How can I help you?
14056,George,72," The name's George Constanza. I'm starting work here today. 
              I was wondering if you could tell"
14057,Secretary,72," I wasn't aware that, uh, Mike, this is George Constanza. 
              He's starting here today."
14058,Mike,72, Welcome aboard.
14059,George,72, Thanks Mike. Nice to be aboard.
14060,Mike,72, I wasn't aware that Mr. Tuttle was finished interviewing.
14061,George,72," Oh, well, he was probably just getting anxious to start 
              his vacation."
14062,Secretary,72, He wants to know where his office is.
14063,Mike,72," Oh, ah, let's see, we've got two. There's a big one down 
              the hall there and a small one over here."
14064,George,72," Oh leave Jack alone. Jack's got enough problems. I'll just 
              take the small office."
14065,Mike,72, Really?
14066,George,72," Yes. I like to feel cozy. I have a very small apartment. 
              I like to feel tucked in, nestled in. Love"
14067,Mike,72," All right, it's 808 right down there. Meanwhile, I'll get 
              you the Pensky file, you can start working on that."
14068,George,72," Yes, yes of course. The Pensky file. Ho ho, can't wait 
              to sink my teeth into that. Wow that "
14069,Camera shot at the clock on his wall. The clock says 9,72,00.
14070,"A moment later, the clock flips to 5",72,00.
14071,Jerry,72, So what did you do there all day?
14072,George,72, They gave me the Pensky file.
14073,Jerry,72, So it's a nice place to work?
14074,George,72," You know I'm enjoying it very much. I think my coworkers 
              are really taking to me. "
14075,George,72," (continuing) I feel like a family. In fact, yesterday was 
              Grace's birthday. She's such a sweet "
14076,Jerry,72, What about your boss? The guys you interviewed you?
14077,George,72, He'll be back on Monday.
14078,Jerry,72, Hi.
14079,Elaine,72, Hi. How come you're wearing a hat?
14080,Jerry,72, I got a haircut.
14081,Elaine,72, Oh yeah? Can I see it?
14082,Jerry,72, Oh there's nothing to see.
14083,Elaine,72, Come on. Let me see it.
14084,Jerry,72, Forget it.
14085,Elaine,72, Come on.
14086,Jerry,72, All right.
14087,Elaine,72," (still laughing, tears in her eyes) I'm sorry. I'm so sorry."
14088,Jerry,72," Well I'll tell you this, you can forget about me going to 
              that bachelor auction."
14089,Elaine,72," What? No Jerry, you have to go."
14090,George,72," You know Elaine, I'd do it but I'm working that day."
14091,Elaine,72," (dryly) Yeah, too bad."
14092,Kramer,72, It the worst haircut Jerry's ever had. You gotta fix it.
14093,Gino,72," Sure, I fix it. But you gotta make sure you no tell anybody. 
              He's a little crazy. I don't know what"
14094,Enzo,72," Oh ah, again with the Edward Scissorhands. How can you have 
              hand like scissors, huh? Show me"
14095,Gino,72," Hey, it's a beautiful dream. I'd love to be this man."
14096,Enzo,72," Did you ever think about what you're going to do on the toilet? 
              (yelling) What are you going to do"
14097,Kramer,72, I'd like to have shoehorn hands.
14098,Kramer,72," Okay listen to me. I talked to Gino, he's going to fix 
              the haircut."
14099,Elaine,72," Oh great, then you can go to the bachelor auction."
14100,Jerry,72," Yeah, but how am I..."
14101,Kramer,72," No buts. His apartment tonight, Eight o'clock."
14102,Elaine,72, Can he fix it?
14103,Kramer,72, I don't know.
14104,Gino,72," Boy, you've got a beautiful head of hair."
14105,Jerry,72, Thank you.
14106,Gino,72," I bet uncle Enzo, he tell you that all the time."
14107,Jerry,72, Well actually Enzo hasn't said that to me in a while.
14108,Gino,72, I don't think uncle Enzo realize what a lucky barber he is.
14109,Jerry,72, That's nice of you to say.
14110,Gino,72, Just a second. Yes.
14111,Enzo,72, (over the speaker) It's your uncle Enzo.
14112,Gino,72, It's Uncle Enzo. Go in there. I'll clean up.
14113,Gino,72," Uncle Enzo, what are you doing here?"
14114,Enzo,72, I've come to apologize.
14115,Gino,72, Apologize?
14116,Enzo,72," Yes. I rented the move Edward Scissorhands. That Johnny Depp, 
              he make me cry."
14117,Gino,72, He make me cry too. You want something to drink?
14118,Enzo,72," Hey, what's all of this?"
14119,Gino,72, Nothing. It's just hair.
14120,Enzo,72, You do haircut in the apartment?
14121,Gino,72, No. Pizza man was here. Maybe some fall off. He's going bald.
14122,Enzo,72, It looks very familiar.
14123,Jerry,72," In the one minute he worked on me I could tell he was really 
              good."
14124,Kramer,72," Yeah. Slow, gentle, attentive. I told you he could do it."
14125,Jerry,72, Enzo picked up one of my hairs off the floor.
14126,Kramer,72," Yeah, so?"
14127,Jerry,72, I think he knew.
14128,Kramer,72, No. He doesn't know.
14129,Jerry,72, Who do you know? He knows my hair.
14130,Kramer,72," Listen you're just imagining things. He doesn't know a 
              thing. Now come on. Pull yourself "
14131,Jerry,72," Okay, okay."
14132,Elaine,72, What happened? It looks the same.
14133,Jerry,72," He didn't get to finish it. His uncle came in. We almost 
              got caught."
14134,Elaine,72," Jerry, the auction is in a few hours."
14135,Jerry,72, Take the K-man.
14136,Elaine,72, You can still go.
14137,Kramer,72, What are you kidding? Look at him. He's grotesque.
14138,Elaine,72, You think?
14139,Kramer,72, Do I think? He's repugnant.
14140,Elaine,72, What would you wear?
14141,Kramer,72, Whatever it takes.
14142,Enzo,72," See, now Newman is a good customer."
14143,Newman,72," Once I find a barber I stick with him. I almost went to 
              barber school. I always felt I had a talent "
14144,Enzo,72," Oh, not everyone like Newman, so loyal."
14145,Newman,72," Yeah, just the way that I was raised. I'm special."
14146,Enzo,72," You know I don't mind if somebody's funny, but I no like 
              the funny business."
14147,Gino,72, I'm going to go out for a little bit. I'll be right back.
14148,Enzo,72, Take your time. (Gino leaves) You happy with the haircut?
14149,Newman,72, It's okay. A little crooked.
14150,Enzo,72, How'd you like to have free haircut for six months.
14151,Newman,72, What's the catch?
14152,Enzo,72, You're going to get me a sample of Jerry's hair.
14153,Newman,72," Hmm, that job sounds like it might be worth a *year's* 
              free haircuts. And a comb."
14154,Secretary,72," (over the speaker) Mr. Costanza, Mr. Pensky is here 
              to see you."
14155,George,72, Mr. Pensky? Of the Pensky file?
14156,Pensky,72, Costanza? Arthur Pensky.
14157,George,72," Mr. Pensky. I was just working on your file. I was transferring 
              the contents of the file into this"
14158,Pensky,72, Where's Tuttle?
14159,George,72, He's on vacation.
14160,Pensky,72," He was on vacation the last time I dropped by. Give me 
              my file. (looks through the file) Looks"
14161,George,72," Well you know in college they used to call me the little 
              bulldog."
14162,Pensky,72," Hey, you are Pensky material. Would you ever consider coming 
              to work directly for me?"
14163,George,72, Really?
14164,Pensky,72, You are aware...
14165,Secretary,72, (over the speaker) Mr. Castanza?
14166,George,72, Not now Florice.
14167,Secretary,72," (speaker) I thought Mr. Pensky should know they're towing 
              his car."
14168,Pensky,72, Damn this city.
14169,George,72, I am aware. I am aware.
14170,Gino,72, He knows. He knows about us.
14171,Jerry,72, How do you know?
14172,Gino,72," Because I know. He's crazy. All morning, he looking at the 
              hair. He *staring* at the hair."
14173,Jerry,72, Who is it?
14174,Newman,72, It's Newman.
14175,Gino,72, He was in the shop with Enzo. He can't see me here.
14176,Jerry,72," All right, go in the bedroom. Open the window. You can go 
              out the fire escape."
14177,Jerry,72, What do you want?
14178,Newman,72, Can I use your bathroom?
14179,Jerry,72, What's wrong with yours?
14180,Newman,72, My toilet's clogged.
14181,Jerry,72, You can't unclog it?
14182,Newman,72, No.
14183,Jerry,72, Did you ask Kramer?
14184,Newman,72, He's out.
14185,Jerry,72, Number one?
14186,Newman,72," Yes, yes. Can I go? Cause I gotta go very badly."
14187,Jerry,72, All right. Flush twice.
14188,Newman,72," (thinking to himself) (checks a comb) No. (checks a brush) 
              Jackpot. I don't believe this."
14189,Jerry,72, You all right?
14190,Newman,72," Yeah, yeah."
14191,Jerry,72," All right, I'll see you later."
14192,Newman,72, What are you doing?
14193,Jerry,72, I'm watching Edward Scissorhands.
14194,Newman,72," Oh, can I watch a little? It's my favorite movie."
14195,Jerry,72, Yeah all right.
14196,Jerry,72, You want something to drink?
14197,Newman,72, No.
14198,Jerry,72," If you want to watch, sit down. You're making me nervous. 
              I tell you this Scissorhands is a hell of "
14199,Newman,72," Gotta go. Oh gee, I dropped a nickel (reaches down and 
              picks up the hair.)"
14200,Enzo,72, Did you get it? Oh you done good Newman.
14201,Newman,72, It was a cinch. Where are you going?
14202,Enzo,72, Io volgio vandetta.
14203,Elaine,72," Nine hundred. Do I hear a thousand? Ladies, he is a Harvard 
              graduate."
14204,Woman,72, A thousand.
14205,Elaine,72," A thousand. Okay, a thousand once, a thousand twice, a 
              thousand three times, sold to the lucky"
14206,Elaine,72," Okay next bachelor is number, um 124 on your program. He's 
              uh, he's a high school graduate."
14207,Kramer,72, Equivalent.
14208,Elaine,72," Oh, uh equivalency. A high school equivalency program graduate. 
              He's uh, self-employed. He's..."
14209,Elaine,72," Oh, Kramer. Okay uh, why don't we start the bidding. Do 
              I hear, uh, five bucks? "
14210,Jerry,72," I don't get this Scissorhands. What, is he supposed to be 
              like a super hero, like Green Lantern or "
14211,Jerry,72, Who is it?
14212,Enzo,72, (yelling) Enzo Manginero.
14213,Jerry,72," Oh my god, he knows. (Jerry and Gino scrambling) Go. (yelling 
              to the door) One second."
14214,Enzo,72, It was you that was in Gino's apartment the other night.
14215,Jerry,72, No I wasn't there.
14216,Enzo,72," Don't lie. I know it was you. I get a sample of your hair. 
              I match them up."
14217,Jerry,72," Sample? (under his breath) Newman. Uh, I was there but I 
              was just dropping off a book."
14218,Gino,72, Don't Jerry.
14219,Enzo,72," So, it's true."
14220,Gino,72, Yes it's true.
14221,Enzo,72, I'm going to kill the both of you.
14222,George,72," Mr. Tuttle, you're back."
14223,Tuttle,72," George, I'm surprised to see you here."
14224,George,72, You are?
14225,Tuttle,72, I though you would have taken the large office.
14226,George,72, Oh. Really.
14227,Tuttle,72," I guess I didn't make that clear when I hired you. So where's 
              that Pensky file? Let's see what "
14228,George,72, Well you missed a lovely little party that we had for Grace.
14229,Tuttle,72, You haven't done anything with this.
14230,George,72, Well bear in mind that I am in the smaller office.
14231,Tuttle,72, I'm beginning to wonder if you understand anything.
14232,George,72, You are aware that Pensky is interested in me.
14233,Tuttle,72, (scoffs) You're not Pensky material.
14234,George,72," Well, we'll just see about that. Ta-ta, Tut-tle."
14235,Pensky,72," Gee George, I'm sorry I gave you the wrong impression. 
              What is was going to say was, now you"
14236,George,72, Obviously.
14237,Pensky,72, Yes.
14238,Secretary,72," (over the speaker) Excuse me, but Mr. Costanza's car 
              is being towed."

14245,George,75," Yes, well, you know, Im not thinking about the price. 
              You know "
14246,Georges girlfriend,75," George, George, uh, I think we have to 
              talk. I think we "
14247,George,75, We do?
14248,Georges girlfriend,75, We cant keep seeing each other.
14249,George,75, Why?
14250,Georges girlfriend,75," (crying) Because its over. *sob, 
              sob, sob* Its my "
14251,Waiter,75," Uh, have you decided yet?"
14252,Georges girlfriend,75, (crying) Yes. Ill have the lobster.
14253,George,75," Um, you know Im starting to think that maybe lobster 
              isnt the way "
14254,Jerry,75, Then he asked you out?
14255,Elaine,75," We started to talk, and I told him that I jog, and then 
              he put his "
14256,Jerry,75, On your heart?
14257,Elaine,75," Jerry, the man is a doctor."
14258,Jerry,75, Doctor? Hes a podiatrist.
14259,Elaine,75, Its the same thing.
14260,Jerry,75," Anyone can get into podiatry school. *George* got into podiatry 
            "
14261,Elaine,75, Really?
14262,Jerrys girlfriend (name?),75, Hello.
14263,Jerry,75, Oh hi.
14264,Jerrys girlfriend,75, Are you going to be stopping by later?
14265,Jerry,75," Yes, Ill be stopping. See you later. (to Elaine) Well 
              we cant all "
14266,George,75, Its over.
14267,Elaine,75, What?
14268,Jerry,75, How did you get in?
14269,George,75, Kramer.
14270,Elaine,75, Whats that?
14271,George,75, Lobster.
14272,Jerry,75, Looks like a swan.
14273,George,75, She says we cant go out anymore.
14274,Elaine,75, Why?
14275,George,75," Because Im not Latvian Orthodox. Her parents wont 
              let her get "
14276,Elaine,75," Latvian Orthodox? Mmm, it is lobster."
14277,Jerry,75, Shes limiting herself to Latvian Orthodox? Too bad.
14278,George,75," I know. This was the only woman I never lied to. Well thats 
              not "
14279,Elaine,75," Mmm, delicious."
14280,Jerry,75," Mmm, succulent."
14281,George,75," She knew I didnt have a job, she knew I lived at 
              home. Didnt seem "
14282,Elaine,75, Why dont you just ask her parents?
14283,George,75," I cant. I met them. Theyre devout. You know, 
              In the cab on the "
14284,Jerry,75, To Latvian Orthodox?
14285,George,75, Why not? What do I care?
14286,Jerry,75, You know its not like changing toothpaste.
14287,Elaine,75, I think it would be romantic.
14288,George,75, Really?
14289,Elaine,75," Yeah, its like Edward the Eighth abdicating the throne 
              and marrying "
14290,George,75," King Edward. King Edward, Jerry."
14291,Jerry,75," Yeah well King Edward didnt live in Queens with Frank 
              and Estelle "
14292,George,75," You know what? I could probably do this. Whats the 
              difference."
14293,Elaine,75, George I was just kidding around.
14294,George,75," No. I wouldnt even have to tell her. I could surprise 
              her."
14295,Elaine,75, George I wasnt serious.
14296,George,75," How hard could it be? You make a little contribution, have 
              a "
14297,Elaine,75, I guess this one is my fault.
14298,Jerry,75, Oh yeah.
14299,Jerrys girlfriend,75," *kiss, kiss, kiss* Oh that was nice. Have 
              you always "
14300,Jerry,75," Oh I dont know. Not always. No I uh I had to work 
              at it. When I "
14301,Jerrys girlfriend,75," Well it was worth it. *kiss* Ill 
              be *kiss* right *kiss* "
14302,Jerry,75, To wash my hands. Theyre sticky from the orange. 
14303,Jerrys girlfriend,75, Meet you back here?
14304,Jerry,75, Right there.
14305,Jerry,75," (thinking to himself) ""Fungicide"". Fungus?"
14306,Jerry,75, Fungicide. I mean what could she have?
14307,Elaine,75, I dont know.
14308,Kramer,75, Fungus.
14309,Elaine,75, So what did you say?
14310,Jerry,75," I said I was coming down with the flu or something and I 
              had to go "
14311,Elaine,75, What were you doing opening her medicine cabinet?
14312,Jerry,75, I didnt open it. It was open. I just nudged it a little.
14313,Elaine,75, You were snooping.
14314,Jerry,75," I was not snooping. I did not break the seal. There was 
              no breaking "
14315,Kramer,75, I would. I always open medicine cabinets.
14316,Elaine,75, Well I trust people not to do that.
14317,Kramer,75, Big mistake.
14318,Jerry,75, Why dont you ask that doctor what it is?
14319,Elaine,75, What? Now hes a doctor? Before he was a podiatrist.
14320,Jerry,75," But thats what podiatrists do. They deal in fungus. 
              Theyre knee-"
14321,Elaine,75, I am not going to ask him about funguses.
14322,Kramer,75, Fungi.
14323,Jerry,75, What?
14324,Kramer,75, Fungi.
14325,Father-priest (name?),75," Why do you want to accept the Latvian Orthodox 
              faith?"
14326,George,75," *ahem* In this age of uncertainty and confusion, a man 
              begins to ask "
14327,Father-priest,75, Enigmatic?
14328,George,75, No.
14329,Father-priest,75," Vast? (he pronounces it as ""vost"")"
14330,George,75," No not vast (he pronounces it as ""vost"")"
14331,Father-priest,75," Well whatever it is, basically you like the religion."
14332,George,75, Yes.
14333,Father-priest 2,75," Is there one aspect of the faith that you find 
              particularly "
14334,George,75," (he thinks) I think the hats. The hat convey that solemn 
              religious "
14335,Father-priest,75, Are you familiar with Orthodox theology?
14336,George,75," Well perhaps, not to the extent that you are. But I know 
              the basic "
14337,Father-priest,75, Plot?
14338,George,75," Yeah, yeah. You know the uh flood, and the uh lepers, and 
              the "
14339,Father-priest 2,75," Well its obvious that you are sincere in 
              your desire."
14340,George,75," Oh yes I am Father. Incredibly sincere. So, uh, pffft, 
              am I in?"
14341,Father-priest,75," The first step would be to familiarize yourself 
              with these "
14342,George,75," Ah hah. You see Father, Im Im incredibly anxious 
              to become a "
14343,Sister Roberta,75," Oh Im sorry. Father, theres a man waiting 
              in the chapel."
14344,Father-priest,75," You may attend to it Sister, oh this is George Costanza. 
              He "
14345,Sister Roberta,75," Oh are you? Thats wonderful. Well good luck 
              to you."
14346,George,75, Nice nun.
14347,Father-priest,75," No, Sister Roberta is not a nun. She is what we 
              call a "
14348,Father-priest 2,75," She wont be taking her final vows until 
              next Thursday."
14349,Sister Roberta,75, May I help you?
14350,Kramer,75," Oh yeah, Im here to pick up my friend George Costanza."
14351,Sister Roberta,75, Well hes in with the Father.
14352,Kramer,75, Oh yeah.
14353,Sister Roberta,75, Im Sister Roberta.
14354,Kramer,75, Oh. Kramer. Pleasure.
14355,Sister Roberta,75, Mine. (she smiles at Kramer)
14356,George,75," I cant believe how easy it is. Im virtually 
              Orthodox. All I have "
14357,Jerry,75, Thats all there is to it.
14358,George,75," Thats all there is to it. By Christmas day I will 
              be Brother "
14359,Jerry,75," And when is Brother Costanza planning on telling Mother 
              Costanza?"
14360,George,75, Brother Costanza will be taking the vow of silence.
14361,Jerry,75, Oh a slinky. Where did you get it?
14362,Kramer,75, Sister Roberta gave it to me.
14363,Jerry,75, Why did she give you that?
14364,Kramer,75, I think she liked me.
14365,Jerry,75, What do you mean she liked you?
14366,Kramer,75, *Liked* me.
14367,George,75," Kramer, they like everybody. Theyre friendly people."
14368,Kramer,75, No. I think I picked up on a vibe.
14369,Jerry,75," You picked up on a vibe, from a nun."
14370,Kramer,75," Yeah, Jerry Im telling you I have this power. And 
              I have no control "
14371,Jerry,75, Oh hi.
14372,Jerrys girlfriend,75," I just wanted to stop by and see how you 
              were feeling."
14373,Jerry,75, (weakly) A little better. *fake cough*
14374,Jerrys girlfriend,75, If you need anything let me know.
14375,Jerry,75, Okay. All right bye.
14376,George,75, Story.
14377,Jerry,75, Shes subletting Carols place for a month.
14378,George,75, She likes you.
14379,Jerry,75," Yeah but theres a problem. I found a tube of a fungicide 
              in her "
14380,George,75, So?
14381,Jerry,75, So I dont know what shes using it for.
14382,George,75," Well how do you even know its hers? Maybe it belonged 
              to Carol. "
14383,Jerry,75, I didnt even think to look.
14384,George,75, Well take a look. It might not even belong to her.
14385,Jerry,75, Yeah.
14386,George,75, People always leave old things in their medicine cabinet.
14387,Jerry,75, Yeah Ive got this old bottle of cough medicine.
14388,George,75, I still have brill cream.
14389,Jerrys girlfriend,75, Hi.
14390,Jerry,75, Hi. Can I use your bathroom?
14391,Elaine,75, You sure you dont mind?
14392,Doctor (name?),75," No of course not. People ask me medical questions 
              all the "
14393,Elaine,75," Well the question isnt even for me its for 
              a friend."
14394,Doctor,75," Elaine, Im used to it. Im a doctor."
14395,Elaine,75, Well podiatrist.
14396,Doctor,75, Huh?
14397,Elaine,75," No no, Im just saying you didnt really go to 
              medical school, you "
14398,Doctor,75," I went to podiatry school because I like feet. I chose 
              to work with "
14399,Elaine,75, I like feet too. Im just saying
14400,Doctor,75, Saying what?
14401,Jerrys girlfriend,75, How are you doing in there?
14402,Jerry,75," Fine all done, just looking for the soap."
14403,Jerrys girlfriend,75, No soap?
14404,Jerry,75, No I dont see it.
14405,Jerrys girlfriend,75, (giving Jerry the soap) Here you go.
14406,Estelle,75, George what are you doing in there?
14407,George,75, What? Nothing.
14408,Frank,75, Youve been in there an hour.
14409,Estelle,75, You dont feel well?
14410,George,75, Im fine.
14411,Estelle,75, I want to know what youre doing in there.
14412,George,75, Nothing.
14413,Frank,75," George, open the door."
14414,George,75, No.
14415,Estelle,75, Georgie.
14416,George,75, No!
14417,Kramer,75, Hey.
14418,Sister Roberta,75," Good evening. I hope Im not disturbing you, 
              but I found "
14419,Jerry,75," Okay, Latvius was the son of which apostle? And Ill 
              need that in the "
14420,George,75," I dont know. I cant believe theyre making 
              me take this test."
14421,Jerry,75," Hey, did you talk to the doctor?"
14422,Elaine,75, No.
14423,Jerry,75," All right, the next time you see him show him this. (He 
              presents the "
14424,Elaine,75, You *took* her medicine.
14425,Jerry,75," Not on purpose. I was hoping there would be a name on the 
              tube. When "
14426,Elaine,75," I dont know. We got into this whole thing about how 
              podiatrists "
14427,Jerry,75, How could you say that?
14428,Elaine,75, Its you fault. You just got me thinking.
14429,Jerry,75, I was merely speaking extemporaneously.
14430,Elaine,75, Ive got nothing against the foot. Im pro-foot.
14431,Jerry,75, Me too.
14432,Elaine,75, Do you think I should call him and apologize?
14433,Jerry,75, Yes. Hes a doctor.
14434,Jerry,75, Wait a second.
14435,Jerry,75, (to George) What are you doing?
14436,George,75, What does it look like Im doing?
14437,Jerry,75," (Reading words George wrote on his hand) ""Matthew, 
              Luke, Paul"", what "
14438,Kramer,75, I told you.
14439,Jerry,75, What?
14440,Kramer,75, I told you she liked me.
14441,Jerry,75, Who?
14442,Kramer,75, Sister Roberta.
14443,Jerry,75, How do you know?
14444,Kramer,75," She told me. She said shes never had a man stir up 
              all of these "
14445,Father-priest,75," I must say George, I was somewhat surprised at the 
              results of "
14446,George,75," Oh, Im Im full of it Father."
14447,Father-priest 2,75," (muttering something to Father-Priest 1) (mumble) 
              Kramer "
14448,Father-priest,75," Yes, yes I see. (To George) Im sorry something 
              has come up."
14449,George,75," Oh, I understand."
14450,Kramer,75," Um, you wanted to see me Father?"
14451,Father-priest,75," Yes. Please, sit down. Sister Roberta came to see 
              me "
14452,Kramer,75," I know what this is about Father. I didnt do anything. 
              I just "
14453,Father-priest,75, Yes. Kavorka.
14454,Kramer,75, Kavorka?
14455,Father-priest,75," It is a Latvian word which means ""the lure 
              of the animal""."
14456,Kramer,75, I dont understand.
14457,Father-priest,75," Women are drawn to you. They would give anything 
              to be "
14458,Kramer,75, Help me Father. Help me.
14459,Father-priest,75," Yes, yes I will help you. Listen very carefully. 
              I want you "
14460,Jerry,75," What is that stench? I got it. (He follows the smell to 
              Kramers "
14461,Kramer,75, Hey.
14462,Jerry,75, Hey. What are you doing?
14463,Kramer,75, Ive got the Kavorka Jerry.
14464,Jerry,75, The Kavorka? Whats that?
14465,Kramer,75, The lure of the animal. Im dangerous.
14466,Jerry,75, What is this thing around your neck?
14467,Kramer,75, The priests theyre helping me. I just bathed in vinegar.
14468,Jerry,75, You know youre funcifying the whole building.
14469,Kramer,75, Keep away Jerry. Keep away.
14470,Jerry,75," Kramer. *knock, knock, knock* Kramer."
14471,At the entrance of the church. There is a sign there. It reads,75,
14472,| 3,75,P.M. |
14473,Woman,75, George Costanza? Estelles son?
14474,Estelle,75, Latvian Orthodox? Why are you doing this?
14475,George,75, For a woman.
14476,Frank,75, A woman? What are you out of your mind?
14477,Estelle,75, Why cant you do anything like a normal person?
14478,Frank,75, Wait. Is this the group that goes around mutilating squirrels?
14479,George,75, No its a regular religion.
14480,Frank,75," Im calling my lawyer. It might not be too late to 
              get out of this."
14481,George,75, I dont want to get out of it.
14482,Estelle,75," George, you dont know what youre saying. Youre 
              under their "
14483,Frank,75," What, they brainwashed you?"
14484,George,75, No no.
14485,Frank,75, Youre not performing any rituals in this house.
14486,Estelle,75, Go back to the psychiatrist. I beg you.
14487,Frank,75, And stay away from those squirrels.
14488,Jerrys girlfriend,75, Oh how you doing Jerry?
14489,Jerry,75, Good. Whats the matter?
14490,Jerrys girlfriend,75," Im tired. I hardly slept last night 
              with all this "
14491,Jerry,75, Bonkers?
14492,Jerrys girlfriend,75," My cat. Hes got this weird sort 
              of skin condition. "
14493,Jerry,75, Oh its your cat! 
14494,Jerrys girlfriend,75, What?
14495,Jerry,75," Ooh, nothing."
14496,Father-priest,75, Are you ready my son?
14497,George,75, Yes faddah.
14498,Father-priest,75, What did you say?
14499,George,75, What?
14500,Father-priest,75, I thought you said faddah.
14501,George,75," I said faddah, I meant Father. Just a little bit nervous."
14502,Kramer,75, How you doing?
14503,Woman,75, Get away from me you creep. (She walks away.)
14504,Kramer,75," Yes, Yes. It worked. Sister Roberta Ive still got 
              time to catch "
14505,Father-priest,75," Congratulations George. Welcome to the faith. Sister 
              Roberta "
14506,Sister Roberta,75," (hesitates) I cant. (crowd murmurs) Im 
              sorry. Its a "
14507,Sister Roberta,75, Him.
14508,Crowd,75," Kavorka, Kavorka."
14509,Elaine,75," *kiss, kiss* Because I love the foot. Im a big fan 
              of the foot."
14510,Doctor,75, Well its my fault. I got a little defensive.
14511,Elaine,75," And that pinkie toe, come on . How adorable is the pinkie 
              toe."
14512,Doctor,75, Its my favorite toe.
14513,Elaine,75," Lets face it, you get a bunion, where are you going? 
              Youre not "
14514,Doctor,75, No youre not.
14515,Elaine,75, Ill be right back.
14516,Doctor,75," Oh uh, wheres the bathroom?"
14517,Elaine,75," Its right down here to the left. I will meet you 
              right back here."
14518,Jerry,75," Elaine its her cat. Her cat had the fungus. So I need 
              the tube "
14519,Doctor,75," (Thinking to himself) ""Fungicide""? Fungus?"
14520,Sister Roberta,75," Somethings wrong. I dont feel the same 
              lure."
14521,Kramer,75, You dont?
14522,Sister Roberta,75," What have I? I must return to the church.

14524,Georges girlfriend,75, For me?
14525,George,75, Well I didnt do it for my mother.
14526,Georges girlfriend,75," Im really flattered. But I just 
              dont feel ready to "
14527,George,75, Latvia?

              relatives there for a "
14529,George,75," Enjoy, enjoy."
14530,Georges girlfriend,75," Oh George, you are so sweet. Dont 
              ever change."

14542,ELAINE,77," Hey, do you believe I got happy new year today? It's February."
14543,JERRY,77, I once got Happy new Year in July.
14544,ELAINE,77, It's 
14545,JERRY,77," It's pathetic. . . . hey, is it cold out?"
14546,ELAINE,77, It's really cold.
14547,JERRY,77, Scary cold.
14548,ELAINE,77, I don't know. What's your definition of scary cold?
14549,JERRY,77, That.
14550,ELAINE,77," Huh, What is that, ha?"
14551,GEORGE,77, What?
14552,JERRY,77, When did you get that?
14553,GEORGE,77," This week. My father got a deal from a friend of his. It's Gore-Tex. 
        You know about Gore-Tex?"
14554,JERRY,77," You like saying Gore-Tex, don't you?"
14555,ELAINE,77, You can't even turn around in that thing.
14556,JERRY,77, Look at this [start hitting George]
14557,ELAINE,77," Hey George, can you feel this? [they are hitting his jacket]"
14558,GEORGE,77," All right, all right. KNOCK IT OFF. Come on, let's go."
14559,ELAINE,77," Maybe we should stop off on the way and get a bottle of wine 
        or something."
14560,GEORGE,77, What for?
14561,ELAINE,77, These people invited us for dinner. We have to bring something.
14562,GEORGE,77," You mean just going there because I'm invited, that's rude?"
14563,ELAINE,77, Yeah.
14564,GEORGE,77," So you're telling me instead of being happy to see me they're 
        going to be upset because I didn't bring anything. You see what I'm saying?"
14565,JERRY,77, The fabric of society is very complex George.
14566,GEORGE,77, I don't even drink wine. I drink Pepsi.
14567,ELAINE,77, You can't bring Pepsi.
14568,GEORGE,77, Why not?
14569,ELAINE,77, Because we're adults?
14570,GEORGE,77," You telling me that wine is better than Pepsi? Huh, no way wine 
        is better than Pepsi."
14571,JERRY,77," I'm telling you George, I don't think we want to walk in there 
        and put a big plastic jug of Pepsi on the table."
14572,George,77," I just don't like the ideas that every time there is a dinner 
        invitation there's this annoying little chore that goes along with it."
14573,JERRY,77," You know, you're getting to be an annoying little chore yourself."
14574,KRAMER,77," All right, let's go. Who's driving?"
14575,JERRY,77, You are. I can't get that thing [George] in my car.
14576,JERRY,77," Where's the heat in this car? Come on Elaine warm me up, oh! I'm 
        cold. Give me a squeeze."
14577,ELAINE,77, Get off of me. Get off of ME!
14578,JERRY,77, You're pretty comfortable up there eh. Bubble boy?
14579,GEORGE,77," Oh, yeah. You wish you had this coat."
14580,ELAINE,77," I was just thinking. The four of us can't show up with just one 
        bottle of wine."
14581,GEORGE,77," Oh, here we go. Why don't we get them a couch? Bring them a nice 
        sectional."
14582,ELAINE,77, We'll get some cake. Can you stop off at the bakery?
14583,GEORGE,77, Why don't you just get some Ring Dings at the liquor store?
14584,KRAMER,77, I like Ring Dings.
14585,ELAINE,77," George, we can't show up at someone's house with Ring Dings and 
        Pepsi."
14586,KRAMER,77, HEY YOUR LIGHTS ARE ON!
14587,GEORGE,77," It's a funeral procession. . . . And I got news for you. I show 
        up with Ring Dings and Pepsi, I become the biggest hit at the party. People 
        be coming up to me, ""just between you and me I'm really excited about 
        the Ring Dings and the Pepsi. Europeans with the Beaujolais 
        and Chardonnay . . . "
14588,ELAINE,77," Oh, wait a minute. There's the bakery. Stop here. Stop here. 
        Okay, let me out. You, whatever your name is"
14589,JERRY,77, Jerry.
14590,ELAINE,77," Yeah, Jerry, come with me."
14591,KRAMER,77," Okay, so we're going to get the wine and we'll pick you up here 
        in ten minutes."
14592,ELAINE,77, Yeah.
14593,KRAMER,77, All right
14594,ELAINE,77," Ummm, I love the smell of bakeries."
14595,JERRY,77," Oh look Elaine, the black and white cookie. I love the black and 
        white. Two races of flavor living side by side [mumble?] It's a wonderful 
        thing isn't it?"
14596,ELAINE,77, You know I often wonder what you'll be like when you're senile.
14597,JERRY,77, I'm looking forward to it.
14598,ELAINE,77, Yeah. I think it will be a very smooth transition for you.
14599,JERRY,77," Thank you. All right, look at all this stuff. What are we getting'? 
      "
14600,ELAINE,77, CHOCOLATE BOBKA! That's their specialty.
14601,JERRY,77, Love that Bobka.
14602,ELAINE,77," Yeah, yeah!"
14603,JERRY,77," So listen Elaine, when we get up to the door, you , you hold the 
        cake box."
14604,ELAINE,77, Why?
14605,JERRY,77," I don't know, just standing there with a box, holding it by the 
        little string."
14606,ELAINE,77, You think it's effeminate? 
14607,JERRY,77, It's a tad dainty.
14608,ELAINE,77," Oh, we forgot to pick a number."
14609,JERRY,77, You see that's not fair. We were here ahead of all these people.
14610,ELAINE,77, You think I should go ask her for hers?
14611,JERRY,77," No, forget it."
14612,ELAINE,77," No, no it's not fair. Just because they have a ticket doesn't 
        mean they were here first. We were here and we were ahead of them, and 
        them, and her. Come on let's just go ask them. Come on. . . . Excuse me."
14613,KRAMER,77, No
14614,GEORGE,77, Why not?
14615,KRAMER,77," I'll get a ticket! Besides,, what if somebody wants to get out 
        of here?"
14616,GEORGE,77," Are you kidding? People get spaces this good, they never give 
        them up. "
14617,KRAMER,77, It's a fallacy.
14618,GEORGE,77," All right, I'll tell you what, why don't you go into the store 
        and I'll wait in the car? "
14619,KRAMER,77, Why don't YOU go into the store and I'LL wait in the car?
14620,GEORGE,77," Because, I've got the coat. I can sit in the car and not get 
        cold. "
14621,KRAMER,77," So what I'm going to leave the car running and the heater'll 
        be on."
14622,GEORGE,77, Does the heater even work in this car?
14623,KRAMER,77, No.
14624,GEORGE,77," Hey, there's a spot right in front of the liquor store. You see"
14625,KRAMER,77, I see.
14626,GEORGE,77," You see, ho ho, "
14627,ELAINE,77, But we were here ahead of you.
14628,Barbara,77, How do I know that?
14629,JERRY,77, Well we saw you come in.
14630,YYY,77," Well, that's easy for you to say."
14631,ELAINE,77," Oh, yeah, right, that's something I do all the time, right. I 
        make up stories to get ahead in line at bakeries."
14632,CLERK,77, 46?
14633,ELAINE,77," Wait, wait a second are, are you Barbara Benedict?"
14634,BARBARA,77, Yes.
14635,ELAINE,77," Oh my god. I, I know you. Um, I'm Elaine Benes, you remember 
        we met at Linda van Grak's baby shower."
14636,BARBARA,77, I'm on my way over there right now.
14637,ELAINE,77, Me too.
14638,ELAINE,77," Well,, this is a little awkward, isn't it?"
14639,BARBARA,77, Yes it is.
14640,ELAINE,77, You know we were here ahead of you.
14641,BARBARA,77, You're NOT getting my number.
14642,JERRY,77, Oh so you still don't believe us.
14643,CLERK,77, 47!
14644,BARBARA,77, Us.
14645,ELAINE,77," Oh, oh, fine, go ahead. But listen let me tell you something 

        as soon as I get there I'm going to tell everyone what a jerk you are."
14646,BARBARA,77," Well, I'll be there ahead of you and I'LL be telling them what 
        a jerk YOU are. . . . I'll have the chocolate Bobka."
14647,CLERK,77, You're lucky Mrs. Benedict it's our last one.
14648,GEORGE,77," So alright, what are we getting? It's so hot in here!"
14649,KRAMER,77, What do you say we get a Mouton Cadet?
14650,GEORGE,77, What's that?
14651,KRAMER,77," It's robust, bold, very dry. As opposed to a Beaujolais which 
        is richer and fruitier. Here's one. Twelve dollars."
14652,GEORGE,77," Twelve dollars? I knew we should have gone to the bakery. I guarantee 
        you they aren't getting no twelve dollar cake."
14653,KRAMER,77," All right but I am going to have to pay you back latter I don't 
        have my wallet."
14654,GEORGE,77, . . . Why not?
14655,KRAMER,77," Because I don't like to carry my wallet. My osteopath says it's 
        bad for my spine. It throws my hips off kilter "
14656,GEORGE,77," ""throws your hips off kilter"" So where's your money? 
      "
14657,KRAMER,77, I never take it.
14658,GEORGE,77, So what do you do?
14659,KRAMER,77," Oh, I get by."
14660,BARBARA,77, See you later [exits with the Bobka]
14661,JERRY,77, That's the last Bobka. They got the last Bobka.
14662,ELAINE,77, I know. They're going in first with the last Bobka.
14663,JERRY,77, That was our Bobka.
14664,ELAINE,77, You can't beat a Bobka.
14665,JERRY,77, We should have had that Bobka.
14666,ELAINE,77, They're going to be heroes. 
14667,JERRY,77," What are we going to do now. If we can't get the Bobka the whole 
        thing's useless."
14668,ELAINE,77, Well how about a carrot cake?
14669,JERRY,77," Carrot cake? Now why is that a cake? You don't make carrots into 
        a cake. I'm sorry."
14670,ELAINE,77, Black Forrest? 
14671,JERRY,77," Black Forrest? Too scary. You're in the Forrest, oohh."
14672,JERRY,77, How about a Napoleon? 
14673,ELAINE,77," Napoleon? Who's he to have a cake? He was a ruthless war monger. 
        Might as well get Mengle. "
14674,JERRY,77, That wa sour Bobka. We had that Bobka!
14675,ELAINE,77, What's this one?
14676,CLERK,77, That's cinnamon Bobka.
14677,JERRY,77, Another Bobka?
14678,CLERK,77, There's chocolate and there's cinnamon. 
14679,JERRY,77," Well, we've got to get the cinnamon."
14680,ELAINE,77," No, but they got the chocolate. We'll be going in with a lesser 
        Bobka."
14681,JERRY,77," I beg your pardon? Cinnamon takes a back seat to no Bobka. People 
        love cinnamon. It should be on tables at restaurants along with salt and 
        pepper. Anytime anyone says, ""Oh This is so good. What's in it?"" 
        The answer invariably comes back, Cinnamon. Cinnamon. Again and again. 
        Lesser Bobka - I think not."
14682,CLERK,77, 49?
14683,ELAINE,77, I'll have the cinnamon Bobka. 
14684,JERRY,77,"  and a black and white cookie, for me. Peace!"
14685,Cleck,77, That will be 13.05
14686,GEORGE,77, All right here you go.
14687,Clerk,77, A hundred? I can't change that.
14688,GEORGE,77, You can't - oh uh oh All right let's go.
14689,KRAMER,77, Wait a second. I can get change.
14690,KRAMER,77," Hey, anybody got change for a hundred?"
14691,GEORGE,77," Hey, hey What are you doing? You'll get us killed."
14692,KRAMER,77, What?
14693,GEORGE,77," Don't go shouting we got a hundred dollar bill. People will be 
        jumping out of windows after us."
14694,KRAMER,77, Okay. Let's go but something. Then we'll get some change.
14695,GEORGE,77, I am not buying something just to get change.
14696,KRAMER,77," George, there's a news stand right over there. Now come on."
14697,KRAMER,77, All rright let's get some gum or something.
14698,GEORGE,77," Pack of gum, okay here you go."
14699,CLERK,77, What I this a hundred? I can't change a hundred.
14700,GEORGE,77, Why not?
14701,CLERK,77, You got to buy more than that.
14702,KRAMER,77," Here, get a newspaper."
14703,GEORGE,77, A newspaper.
14704,CLERK,77, That's not enough.
14705,KRAMER,77, A Clark Bar.
14706,GEORGE,77, Clark Bar.
14707,CLERK,77, Keep going.
14708,GEORGE,77, There's 22 dollars here.
14709,KRAMER,77," George, George, Get a Penthouse Forum."
14710,GEORGE,77, I'm not getting a Penthouse Forum.
14711,KRAMER,77," That will make great dinner party conversation. We'll read the 
        letters at the dinner table."
14712,GEORGE,77," Oh, that's nice."
14713,KRAMER,77," Hey, did you ever read one of these?"
14714,GEORGE,77, It's not real. They're all made up.
14715,KRAMER,77," Oh, it's real."
14716,GEORGE,77," You know there is an unusual number of people in this country 
        having sex with AMPUTEES! . . . Penthouse forum, newspaper, gum, Clark 
        Bar."
14717,CLERK,77, 6.75.
14718,GEORGE,77," Ah, great. With the wine I'm in over twenty dollars now."
14719,MAN1,77, [gibberish Arabic yelling]
14720,GEORGE,77," Sorry, it's a new coat. It's Gore-Tex."
14721,KRAMER,77, You better be careful with that thing. You'll start a war. 
14722,JERRY,77," Uhm, The thing about eating the Black and White cookie, Elaine, 
        is you want to get some black and some white in each bite. Nothing mixes 
        better than vanilla and chocolate And yet somehow racial harmony eludes 
        us. If people would only look to the cookie all our problems would be 
        solved. "
14723,ELAINE,77," Your views on race relations are fascinating. You really should 
        do an op-ed piece for the Times. "
14724,JERRY,77," Um, um, Look to the cookie Elaine. Look to the cookie."
14725,ELAINE,77, What is this? 
14726,JERRY,77, What?
14727,ELAINE,77, It's a hair.
14728,JERRY,77," Oh, take it back. Let's get another one."
14729,ELAINE,77," No, we've already got this. I'll just take it off."
14730,JERRY,77," No, really, let's get another one. It will just take a second."
14731,ELAINE,77, Excuse me.
14732,Man,77," Hey hey, I'm in line here."
14733,ELAINE,77," No noo no, we just bought this. . . . Um, you sold us a cake 
        with a hair on it. "
14734,CLERK,77, You have to take a number.
14735,ELAINE,77," We waited fifteen minutes for this. Oh. YOU SOLD ME A CAKE WITH 
        A HAIR ON IT. Then you want me to wait? . . . What are you doing (to Jerry 
        taking a number) are you going to wait here?"
14736,JERRY,77," Well, I'm not going to eat a cake with a hair on it."
14737,ELAINE,77, It was a little hair. I took it off.
14738,JERRY,77, A little hair? Do you think that makes it better?
14739,ELAINE,77, What if it's your hair?
14740,JERRY,77, What if it's your hair?
14741,ELAINE,77," What is wrong with my hair? Nothing. Nobody takes better care 
        of their hair than me. You can serve dinner on my head."
14742,JERRY,77," Who needs misty herbal rain water crap they sell in the health 
        food store. I use Prell, the hard stuff. A hundred proof - takes your 
        roots out."
14743,ELAINE,77," Okay, fine, we'll just wait until she calls the number."
14744,JERRY,77," Well, why don't we just forget about the cake? "
14745,ELAINE,77, No I'm bringing cake!
14746,GEORGE,77," All right we got the wine. Aren't we lucky? We got wine. Imagine 
        if we didn't bring wine. We'd be shunned by society. Outcasts! WHERE'S 
        YOUR WINE? GET OUT! "
14747,KRAMER,77," ""I know this is going to sound like a crazy fantasy but 
        every word of this story is true"" [exits to street] "" 
        A weeks days ago my girlfriend happened to mention to me how attractive 
        our new neighbor Linda was"""
14748,GEORGE,77," Look at this? Somebody double parked and blocked us in. DOES 
        ANYBODY KNOW WHOSE CAR THAT IS? Maybe there's a note on it. No, no note. 
        Can you believe this?"
14749,KRAMER,77," ""well of course I noticed it too with those ample 
        breasts and those pouty lips. I don't have to tell you she was a knock 
        out."""
14750,GEORGE,77," I really can't comprehend how stupid people can be sometimes. 
        Can you comprehend it?"
14751,KRAMER,77," Yeah, he could build the rocket but he's still stupid for double-parking 
        and blocking somebody in."
14752,GEORGE,77," So you really understand my point about building a rocket and 
        double-parking."
14753,KRAMER,77," Yeah, on one hand he's smart with rockets and on the other part 
        he's dumb with parking. . . . It's cold out here huh?"
14754,GEORGE,77," Maybe it's not even stupidity. Maybe it's just a blatant disregard 
        for basic human decency. If this how dictator's start. Do you think Mussolini 
        would circle the block six times looking for a spot?"
14755,KRAMER,77, How about Idi Amin?
14756,GEORGE,77," Ill tell you, if I was running for office I would ask for the 
        death penalty for double-parking. If this is allowed to go on this is 
        not a society. THIS IS ANARCHY!"
14757,KRAMER,77, Are those shoes comfortable?
14758,GEORGE,77, No not really.
14759,KRAMER,77, They look comfortable.
14760,GEORGE,77, I know that's why I bought them but they're not comfortable.
14761,ELAINE,77, Why couldn't we have just taken the hair off and go?
14762,JERRY,77," No, out of the question."
14763,ELAINE,77, Why?
14764,JERRY,77, Because I had a bad experience with a hair when I was younger.
14765,ELAINE,77, What happened?
14766,JERRY,77, I'd rather not talk about it.
14767,ELAINE,77, You can't tell me?
14768,JERRY,77, All right . . . I once had a hair in my Farina and I freaked out.
14769,ELAINE,77, You found a hair in your Farina?
14770,JERRY,77," Yeah,"
14771,ELAINE,77, What happened?
14772,JERRY,77," I started screaming, ""There's a hair in my farina. There's 
        a hair in my farina."" Then I ran out of the house and I was running 
        and running. I was little but I could run very fast. I just kept running 
        and they found me like three hours later collapsed at a construction site."
14773,CLERK,77, 68!
14774,ELAINE,77, That's us.
14775,JERRY,77," Oh, good."
14776,ELAINE,77, You sold us a hair with a cake around it. I'd like another one.
14777,CLERK,77, [coughing and coughing] 
14778,JERRY,77," Ah, that's lovely."
14779,ELAINE,77," Ah,"
14780,JERRY,77," Just what you want to see, yeah. . . . You want to trade your 
        hair for some phlegm "
14781,CLERK,77, Here you are.
14782,ELAINE,77," Um, okay, we got the cake now. Where are George and Kramer?"
14783,KRAMER,77, HEY DOUBLE-PARKER. SOVIET SCUM. COME ON OUT. IT'S FREEZING!
14784,GEORGE,77, We're really late now. We're in big trouble. Big trouble.
14785,KRAMER,77, Why?
14786,GEORGE,77," You know, Elaine."
14787,KRAMER,77, What about her?
14788,GEORGE,77, . . . I'm a little scared of her. 
14789,KRAMER,77, You're scared of Elaine?
14790,GEORGE,77, Yes!
14791,KRAMER,77, Why?
14792,GEORGE,77," Did you ever see her lose her temper. I was once late because 
        I bought a Panama hat she grabbed it by the brim, pulled it down so hard 
        my head came right through the top of it."
14793,KRAMER,77, Let's go inside the liquor store. It's freezing in here.
14794,GEORGE,77," Hey, hey that's great! That's very nice. We've been waiting twenty 
        minutes for you people? What do you think? You're Mussolini?"
14795,MAN2,77, Back off puff ball it's not my car! 
14796,GEORGE,77, I wasn't talking to you.
14797,ELAINE,77," Wait until I get my hands on that George. I'm going to pull that 
        big hood over his little head, tie the string and suffocate him. You remember 
        that Panama hat? That was nothing."
14798,JERRY,77," Uh, wa?"
14799,ELAINE,77, What's the matter with you?
14800,JERRY,77," Uh, I don't feel so good."
14801,ELAINE,77, What's wrong?
14802,JERRY,77," My stomach, I , I think it was that cookie."
14803,ELAINE,77, The black and white?
14804,JERRY,77, Yeah.
14805,ELAINE,77, Not getting along?
14806,JERRY,77, I think I got David Duke and Fahrikan down there.
14807,ELAINE,77, Well if we can't look to the cookie where can we look?
14808,JERRY,77, I feel like I'm going to throw up.
14809,ELAINE,77," Hey, what about your vomit streak?"
14810,JERRY,77," I know, I haven't thrown up since June 29th, 1980."
14811,ELAINE,77," Oh, oh!"
14812,MAN3,77, Sooory.
14813,ELAINE,77," Sorry? You almost took my toe off. Why don't you watch what you're 
        doing you, LUNATIC! uh, I think he broke my toe. [Jerry gets up] 
        Where're you going?"
14814,JERRY,77, Fourteen years down the drain.
14815,GEORGE,77, Do chickens have individual personalities?
14816,KRAMER,77, (shivering) I don't care.
14817,GEORGE,77," If you had five chickens could you tell them apart by just the 
        way they acted? Or would they all just be walking around? Cluck, puk cluck? 
        Because if they have individual personalities I don't think we should 
        be eating them. What's the matter with you?"
14818,CLERK,77, Can I help you guys with anything?
14819,GEORGE,77," We bought the wine here before, but now we're blocked in by some 
        car that's double parked and we're just waiting for the guy to pull out."
14820,CLERK,77," Well wait outside. This isn't a hangout. But my friend here has 
        hypothermia."
14821,KRAMER,77, I've got hypothermia.
14822,CLERK,77," All right guys, take it outside."
14823,CLERK,77, You're paying for these.
14824,ELAINE,77, How was it?
14825,JERRY,77, As good as it gets.
14826,GEORGE,77," You know that coat was Gore-Tex. It was worth a hell of a lot 
        more than that cheap Chardonnay."
14827,KRAMER,77, I'm freezing. Definitely freezing. I can't stop shaking. 
14828,GEORGE,77," I'm cold too. At least you've got a coat. Let's get in the car. 
      "
14829,GEORGE,77," Oh, my god that's Saddam Hussein."
14830,MAN4,77," Don't walk around without a coat in this weather; you'll catch 
        your death of cold. So long. "
14831,CLERK,77, Can I get you anything else?
14832,JERRY,77," Oh, no thanks. "
14833,CLERK,77," How about a nice box of ""scram""."
14834,GEORGE,77," Somebody double parked, we couldn't help it. It might have been 
        Saddam Hussein, we're not really sure. He had a British accent though. 
        What, what happened to you? "
14835,ELAINE,77," Somebody put a cane on my foot. Just like the one I'm going to 
        put up your ."
14836,JERRY,77," Hey, what happened to your coat? And what's the smell, what are 
        you drunk? "
14837,GEORGE,77, I had to give it to the liquor store guy.
14838,JERRY,77, What for?
14839,GEORGE,77, I spilled some Chardonnay. So what did you get?
14840,ELAINE,77, Cinnamon Bobka.
14841,GEORGE,77, Cinnamon? Why didn't you get chocolate?
14842,JERRY,77, George!
14843,ELAINE,77," Here, here's your cake."
14844,GEORGE,77, And your wine.
14845,ELAINE,77, See ya'.

15038,Elaine,78," What, how did you know that?"
15039,Jerry,78, Because I know who has it. 
15040,Elaine,78," What, how did you find it?"
15041,Jerry,78," Because the woman who got hit in the head with it found 
              my name in "
15042,Elaine,78," Well where is it, give it to me!"
15043,Jerry,78, I don't have it!

              back for the"
15046,Elaine,78," But I didn't do Testikov did it, he should have to pay 
              for it!"

15048,Elaine,78, One million.
15049,Jerry,78, Well that's a start.
15050,George,78," Then of course with evolution the octopus lost the nostrils 
              and took"
15051,Diane,78, Really?
15052,George,78," Yeah, but enough about fish I can talk about other things 
              like... "
15053,Jerry,78, You know what room Testikov's in?
15054,Elaine,78," Ya, 308. I'm crazy for doing this!"
15055,Jerry,78," Well, you want to get your organizer back don't you?"
15056,Elaine,78," Why are you so interested, you want to take her out?"
15057,Jerry,78," You know when Super Man saves someone no one asks if he's 
              trying to"
15058,Elaine,78, Well you're not Super Man.
15059,Jerry,78, Well you're not Louis Lane.
15060,Elaine,78," Oh. Listen, you have the tape-recorder."
15061,Jerry,78," Ya, are you sure you want to do this."
15062,Elaine,78," Ya I got to get Testikov on tape. If this woman ends up 
              in the "
15063,Jerry,78," Ah, here she comes. "
15064,Jerry,78," Hi, Elaine, this is Corinne."
15065,Elaine,78," Hi, you got the organizer?"
15066,Jerry,78," All right lets go. We'll meet you back here in ten minutes 
              hopefully"
15067,Diane,78," Your parents must be so proud of you, George."
15068,George,78," Oh, they're busting!"
15069,Diane,78, What are those people doing over there?
15070,Testikov,78," (In a loud and cranky voice) What, What is it! Oh! Come 
              in. That"
15071,Elaine,78," Um, yes this is my friend Jerry. He accompanied me, ya 
              know, single"
15072,Jerry,78," Yes. That's why I where these sneakers, in case of any trouble 
              and "
15073,Testikov,78," Yeah, Yeah. The sneakers. The Americans and their sneakers.            "
15074,Jerry,78," Oh! Ramscy<?>, great great book if I my say so sir. 
              I almost read the"
15075,Corinne,78, What!
15076,Hotel Clerk,78," If you can't thing off I'm going to have to ask you 
              to leave."
15077,Corinne,78, I'm waitin for two people!
15078,Hotel Clerk,78, Well you can wait for them outside.
15079,Corinne,78," Yeah I guess I'd better. Wouldn't want to take any attention 
              away "
15080,Hotel Clerk,78," All right, All right. Out, Out."
15081,Corinne,78, What ever you say Cro..w-well!
15082,Diane,78, What's going on over here?
15083,Woman at beach,78," There is a beached whale, she's dying."
15084,Voice,78, Is anyone here a marine biologist?
15085,Testikov,78," Here is the latest draft. I see you next week. Same time, 
              same "
15086,Jerry,78," It was nice meeting you, real pleasure!"
15087,Elaine,78," Oh, by the way Mr. Testikov do you remember the other day 
              when we "
15088,Testikov,78, How could I forget?
15089,Elaine,78," Well would you believe that it hit actually somebody in 
              the head."
15090,Jerry,78, Right in the head!
15091,Elaine,78, Boing!
15092,Testikov,78, (Shouting)What is that noise!
15093,Elaine,78," Um ,nothing."
15094,Testikov,78, What is the noise!
15095,Elaine,78, Hey that's my purse!
15096,Testikov,78, A recorder!
15097,Elaine,78, No that's a radio..
15098,Testikov,78, You were spying on me!
15099,Elaine,78, No I wasn't.
15100,Crowd,78, Come on! Save the whale! Hurry up it's gonna die!
15101,Diane,78, Save the whale George... for me.
15102,George,78," So I started to walk into the water. I won't lie to you 
              boys, I "
15103,Elaine,78," George I was just reading this thing in the papers, it's 
              amazing!"
15104,George,78, I know I was just telling them the story.
15105,Kramer,78," Come on George, finish the story."
15106,George,78," The sea was angry that day my friends, like an old man 
              trying to "
15107,George,78," I got about fifty-feet out and then suddenly the great 
              beast"
15108,Jerry,78, Mammal.
15109,George,78, Whatever. 
15110,Kramer,78," Well, what did you do next?"
15111,George,78," Then from out of nowhere a huge title wave lifted, tossed 
              like a cork and I found myself on top of him face to face with the blow-hole. I could barely see from all of the waves crashing down 
              on top of me but I knew something was there so I reached my hand and pulled out the obstruction!"
15112,Kramer,78, What is that a Titleist? A hole in one eh.
15113,Jerry,78, Well the crowd most have gone wild!
15114,George,78," Oh yes they did Jerry they were all over me. It was like 
              Rocky 1. "
15115,Jerry,78, Wow! What'd she say?
15116,George,78," She told me to ""Go to hell!"" and I took the bus 
              home."
15117,Jerry,78, All right lets go.
15118,Elaine,78, Are you in a bad mood?
15119,Jerry,78," No, I just got my laundry back."
15120,Elaine,78, Ohhh! GoldenBoy?
15121,Jerry,78, He didn't make it. 
15122,Elaine,78, I'm sorry.
15123,Jerry,78," This is GoldenBoy's son, BabyBlue."
15124,Kramer,78, What's with you?
15125,George,78, Sand. It's everywhere

15127,Guest Stars,79,
15128,[setting,79," Monk's coffee shop, evening] "
15129,AUDREY,79, Hum! That was really good! 
15130,JERRY,79, Yeah. Are you full? 
15131,AUDREY,79," Oh no, I've had just enough. "
15132,JERRY,79," Here we go... apple pie! Best apple pie in the city. (Jerry 
        starts eating) Delicious. I'm not waiting for you. Take some. "
15133,AUDREY,79, No thanks. 
15134,JERRY,79, You're not gonna have any? 
15135,AUDREY,79, No (with a disgusted face) 
15136,JERRY,79, Do you not like apple pie? 
15137,AUDREY,79," No, it's not that. "
15138,JERRY,79," Well, at least taste it. "
15139,AUDREY,79," No (a resolute ""no"") "
15140,JERRY,79, You won't even taste it? 
15141,AUDREY,79, No. 
15142,JERRY,79," Come on, try it! (Audrey shakes her head doing ""no"") 
        A little taste! (still shaking) Come on! (still shaking)
"
15143,[setting,79," Jerry's appartment, the next day] "
15144,GEORGE,79, Did she say why? 
15145,JERRY,79," No. She wouldn't say anything. She just kept shaking her head 
        like this (Imitating Audrey) "
15146,GEORGE,79, Maybe she's diabetic. 
15147,JERRY,79, No. She carries Entemanns doughnuts in her purse. 
15148,GEORGE,79, Maybe you said something that offended her. 
15149,JERRY,79," The only thing I can think of is I told her we should have those 
        moving walkways all over the city. "
15150,GEORGE,79, Like at the airport? (getting excited) 
15151,JERRY,79, Yeah. 
15152,GEORGE,79, That's a great idea!!! 
15153,JERRY,79, Tell me about it! 
15154,GEORGE,79, We could be zipping all over the place. 
15155,JERRY,79, They could at least try it. 
15156,GEORGE,79, They never try anything. 
15157,JERRY,79, What's the harm? 
15158,GEORGE,79, No harm! 
15159,JERRY,79," (still talking to George) I'm sorry. There's no reason 
        for her not to taste that pie. "
15160,ELAINE,79, Who wouldn't taste a pie? 
15161,JERRY,79, Audrey. 
15162,ELAINE,79, Dump her. 
15163,JERRY,79," Boy, I never broke up with anyone for not tasting pie??? "
15164,ELAINE,79," (piffling) I once broke up with someone for not offering 
        me pie. "
15165,JERRY,79, You did? 
15166,ELAINE,79," He could be eating a Hero, he wouldn't offer me anything. It's 
        a sickness. "
15167,GEORGE,79," Well, I can't walk anywhere now. I just gonna be wishing there 
        were walkways. (seeing Elaine removing her shoe) What are you doing? 
      "
15168,ELAINE,79, I got a pebble. 
15169,JERRY,79," Boy, I never heard of that happening to a woman? "
15170,ELAINE,79, What the hell does that mean? 
15171,KRAMER,79," Hey! Elaine. Go Like this. (imitating a mannequin posture)
"
15172,ELAINE,79, What? Why? 
15173,KRAMER,79, Do it. Do it. This. 
15174,ELAINE,79, Like... (doing it) Like this? 
15175,KRAMER,79, Oh yeah! It's you! 
15176,ELAINE,79, What's me? 
15177,KRAMER,79," (to the gang) There's a clothing store downtown. They 
        got a mannequin in there that looks exactly like Elaine. "
15178,ELAINE,79, Get out! 
15179,KRAMER,79," It's uncanny! It's like they chopped off your arms and legs, 
        dipped you in plastic, and screwed you back all together, and stuck you 
        on a pedestal. It's really quite exquisite. "
15180,GEORGE,79," Kramer, what's the name of the store with the mannequin? "
15181,KRAMER,79," Rinitze. (he takes Jerry's spatula and starts rubbing his 
        back with it) Oh yeah... "
15182,JERRY,79," (to Kramer) Uh... may I help you? (wondering what the 
        hell's Kramer doing) "
15183,KRAMER,79," It's this itch. I was watching TV without my shirt on, and one 
        my couch cushion didn't have any fabric on it. "
15184,GEORGE,79," Wait a minute, Rinitze? Don't they have somme really cool suits 
        in there? "
15185,KRAMER,79, Real Boss! 
15186,ELAINE,79, I'm going down there. 
15187,GEORGE,79," I'm gonna go with you. I gotta get a new suit. I got a second 
        interview with MacKenzie, and I think I'm really close. They're all taking 
        me out to lunch on Friday. "
15188,ELAINE,79," (grabbing George by the arm, hurried to leave) Let's go. 
      "
15189,GEORGE,79, All right. All right. (They both leave) 
15190,KRAMER,79," (leaving too, with the spatula) Are you gonna need this? 
      "
15191,[setting,79, Rinitze] 
15192,ELAINE,79, It looks exactly like me. 
15193,GEORGE,79," It's like some pod landed from another planet and took your body. 
        Don't fall asleep Elaine. "
15194,ELAINE,79, What's going on here? How do you think this happened? 
15195,GEORGE,79," Whoa, look at this. This is a beautiful suit. Huh? "
15196,ELAINE,79," You think that could be a coincidence George? Is that possible? 
      "
15197,SALESWOMAN,79, (european accent) You are perfect for that suit. 
15198,GEORGE,79, You think so? 
15199,ELAINE,79," (to the saleswoman) Excuse me. Where did this come from? 
      "
15200,SALESWOMAN,79, I don't know. 
15201,GEORGE,79, You really think this looks O.K. on me? 
15202,SALESWOMAN,79, Fabulous. Perfect fit. And it's the last one we have. 
15203,ELAINE,79, I'm sorry. You can't tell me where the mannequin came from? 
15204,SALESWOMAN,79," I told you, I don't know. "
15205,ELAINE,79," (irritated, but still polite) Well, is there somebody 
        around here I could talk to who would know? "
15206,SALESWOMAN,79, Why? 
15207,ELAINE,79, Isn't it obvious? This mannequin looks exactly like me. 
15208,ELAINE,79," (upset) Did you just roll your eyes at him? Because let 
        me tell you something, if anobody should be rolling their eyes, it is 
        me at him about you. "
15209,SALESWOMAN,79," I think maybe you're flattering yourself. That mannquein 
        is wearing a 1200$ Gaultier dress. "
15210,ELAINE,79," What are you saying, that I'm not good enough for this hideous 
        dress? (looking at her name tag) Listen Natasha... I wouldn't be 
        caught dead wearing your crummy little euro-trash rags. (to George) 
        I'll meet you outside. "
15211,SALESWOMAN,79, What is her problem? 
15212,GEORGE,79," Pfft! What can you do? (looking at a tag on the suit) 
        Is this the price tag? "
15213,SALESWOMAN,79, Yes. 
15214,GEORGE,79," Yes, hello. Party's over. (taking off the suit) "
15215,SALESWOMAN,79," I'll tell you a little secret. We're having an unadvertised 
        sale starting Friday, that suit will be half-price. "
15216,GEORGE,79, So you think you can put the suit aside and hold it for me? 
15217,SALESWOMAN,79," Oh, I'm afraid I could't do that. It wouldn't be fair to 
        the other customers. "
15218,GEORGE,79," Oh yes, of course, and we have to be fair. (placing the suit 
        further away in the rack) "
15219,[setting,79, Monk's] 
15220,ELAINE,79," So, I found out who supplies the mannequins and I called 'em 
        up. "
15221,KRAMER,79, How did they get your face? 
15222,ELAINE,79," I don't know. They wouldn't tell me. (Jerry is not listening, 
        he's looking at two women sitting in the other booth) Jerry? Je... 
        Hello? "
15223,JERRY,79," (Jerry gets up and walk to these persons) Uh... Excuse 
        me. I couldn't help but notice you offered her a piece of your pie. "
15224,WOMAN 1,79, That's right. 
15225,JERRY,79, And you waved it away. 
15226,WOMAN 2,79, Right. 
15227,JERRY,79, Did you give her a reason? 
15228,WOMAN 2,79," Yes, I was full. "
15229,JERRY,79," You were full. So you gave a reason. You didn't just shake your 
        head. "
15230,WOMAN 2,79," No, I'm not a psycho. "
15231,JERRY,79," Exactly. You're not a psycho. You've been very helpful. Thank 
        you very much. Allow me to leave the tip. (sits back with Elaine and 
        Kramer) Well, I think we proven who the psycho is. "
15232,ELAINE,79, We certainly have. 
15233,KRAMER,79," Hey, Elaine scratch my back. "
15234,ELAINE,79, No way! 
15235,KRAMER,79," Come on, one lap around. "
15236,ELAINE,79, No. 
15237,KRAMER,79, It will be a funky adventure. 
15238,ELAINE,79," Kramer, forget it. "
15239,KRAMER,79," Jerry, how about you? "
15240,JERRY,79, I think you know my policy. 
15241,KRAMER,79," I'm going home to spatula. (picks up the check and walks to 
        the cashier) "
15242,ELAINE,79, I thought George was meeting us here? 
15243,JERRY,79, No he's going downtown to guard the suit. 
15244,ELAINE,79, He's guarding a suit? 
15245,OLIVE (the cashier) ,79," (to Kramer) Do you need some help 
        with that itch? "
15246,KRAMER,79," Madam, I pray you're not toying with me. (Olive shows her 
        long finger nails) Whoa. "
15247,OLIVE,79, Turn around. 
15248,KRAMER,79," Oh, all right. (Olive scratches, Kramer enjoys, Elaine and 
        Jerry watch.) "
15249,[setting,79, Rinitze] 
15250,SALESWOMAN,79," (makes a guy trying the suit. His name is not mentionned 
        but it seems to be Bob as it appears in the credits at the end of the 
        episode.) It fits you perfectly. "
15251,BOB,79, You think so? (she nods and walks away) 
15252,GEORGE,79," (outside, looking the guy trying the suit through the window, 
        and thinking out loud) What's this? Can't I leave this place for a 
        second? (goes in, take off his jacket, walks to the guy and talks to 
        him with an european accent) Can I help you? "
15253,BOB,79, I'm buying the suit. 
15254,GEORGE,79," No, no, no, this suit is not for sale. (tries to take off 
        the suit from the guy) "
15255,BOB,79," Excuse me, do you work here? "
15256,GEORGE,79, (leaving the european accent) No. 
15257,BOB,79, Then what the hell business is it of yours? 
15258,GEORGE,79," Look, I'm doing you a favor. They're having an unadvertised sale. 
        This suit is gonna be half-priced starting ... Monday. "
15259,BOB,79, Really? This Monday? 
15260,GEORGE,79, Yes. Now take off those pants. 
15261,SALESWOMAN,79," Actually, the unadvertised sale starts on Friday. "
15262,BOB,79," Friday? Thanks. (Gives a dirty look at George and leaves)
"
15263,GEORGE,79," (to the saleswoman) You know honey for an unadvertised 
        sale, you're doing a lot of yapping about it. "
15264,[setting,79, Poppie's restaurant] 
15265,JERRY,79," I can't beleive your father owns this place. So how are the desserts 
        here? "
15266,AUDREY,79, Everything is delicious. 
15267,JERRY,79, You've tasted them? 
15268,AUDREY,79," Um-hmm, I think almost all of them. "
15269,JERRY,79, Oh I see they have apple pie. 
15270,AUDREY,79, Mmm-hmm. 
15271,JERRY,79, You've had the apple pie? 
15272,AUDREY,79, Many times. 
15273,JERRY,79," Audrey, I got to be honest with you. I'm a very curious guy. It's 
        my nature. I need to know things. Not tasting the apple pie the other 
        day, I can't get past it. You obviously like pies. You carry doughnuts 
        in your bag, you're not averse to pastry. Surely you could see how such 
        a thing would prey on my mind. "
15274,AUDREY,79, Can we drop this? 
15275,JERRY,79, (like a frustrated child) Why can't I know? 
15276,AUDREY,79, Ah! Poppie. 
15277,POPPIE,79," Sweetheart, hello. "
15278,AUDREY,79," Poppie, this is Jerry. "
15279,POPPIE,79, Welcome (shakes Jerry's hand) 
15280,JERRY,79, Hello Poppie. 
15281,POPPIE,79," Don't fill up on the bread. I'm making you a very special dinner. 
        Very special. (he leaves) "
15282,JERRY,79," The pies. I'm going to the bathroom. You know. (he leaves)
"
15283,POPPIE,79," Ah, Jerry! Tonight you in for a real treat. I'm personnaly going 
        to prepare the dinner for you and my Audrey. "
15284,AUDREY,79, Jerry are you OK? 
15285,JERRY,79, Huh? 
15286,AUDREY,79, Is anything wrong? 
15287,JERRY,79," No, Nothing. "
15288,AUDREY,79, You look like you've seen a ghost. 
15289,[setting,79, Monk's] 
15290,OLIVE,79, (to another cashier) I'll see you tomorrow. 
15291,KRAMER,79, Hey. These are for you Olive. 
15292,OLIVE,79, Thank you. 
15293,KRAMER,79, Ohh! 
15294,[setting,79, Poppie's] 
15295,POPPIE,79, Here it is. 
15296,AUDREY,79," Wait till you taste this. (she eats) Poppie, this is perfect. 
      "
15297,POPPIE,79, (to Jerry) Well? 
15298,AUDREY,79, Jerry have some. 
15299,AUDREY,79, You're not gonna taste it? 
15300,AUDREY,79, Jerry. 
15301,[setting,79, Jerry's appartment] 
15302,JERRY,79, So she tought I did it to get back at her 
15303,GEORGE,79, Why didn't you just tell her? 
15304,JERRY,79," I don't think that's the kind of thing you wanna hear about your 
        father. But I'll tell you when he came out of that bathroom and he was 
        kneading that dough, it was a wild scene. "
15305,GEORGE,79, How could he not have washed? 
15306,JERRY,79," Even if you're not gonna soap up, at least pretend for my benefit. 
        Turn the water on, do something. "
15307,GEORGE,79," Yeah, just like I do. "
15308,JERRY,79," You know a chef who doesn't wash is like a cop who steals. It's 
        a cry for help, he wants to get caught. "
15309,GEORGE,79," Well, I think Poppie's got some problems. There's a whole other 
        thing going on with Poppie. So how did you leave ti? "
15310,JERRY,79, We haven't spoken. 
15311,KRAMER,79," Well, I'm not gonna need this anymore. I got Olive. (Jerry 
        throws out the spatula) "
15312,GEORGE,79, Olive? 
15313,KRAMER,79," Yeah. My lady friend down at Monks. You guys ought to see the 
        way she works her nails across my back. Ohh! She's a maestro. The crisscross. 
        The figure eight, strummin' the ol' banjo, and this wild, savage free-for-all 
        where anything can happen. "
15314,GEORGE,79," I got to get downtown and buy that suit. The store opens in twenty 
        minutes. "
15315,KRAMER,79, Is that Elaine mannequin still there? 
15316,GEORGE,79," Yeah. The last time I saw her, she was naked. "
15317,JERRY,79," Yeah, and Poppie's got problems... "
15318,[setting,79, Rinitze] 
15319,BOB,79, Where is it? Where is it? 
15320,GEORGE,79," (George takes out the suit from the other rack) Well, 
        look at this. (innocently) This doesn't belong here! Someone has 
        made a terrible mistake. "
15321,BOB,79, You bastard! You hid the suit. 
15322,GEORGE,79," Hid? I have no idea how this suit got misplaced. Nevertheless, 
        I do believe I shall purchase it. "
15323,BOB,79," I hope you rot in that suit. I'm gonna get you for this. I don't 
        know how, but I'm gonna get you. You are going to pay! "
15324,GEORGE,79," Oh, I'll pay. Half-price. Arrivederci my fellow 40-short. "
15325,[setting,79, Monks] 
15326,ELAINE,79," So I made a little list of people who might've made the mannequin. 
        You know, possible suspects. "
15327,JERRY,79," Yeah, all right. Go ahead. (not very interested) "
15328,ELAINE,79," There's this blind guy at a party I was at, and he felt my face 
        for a really long time. You know, to see what I looked like. He almost 
        put his finger up my nose. "
15329,JERRY,79," Hum... ok, what else you got? "
15330,ELAINE,79," OK, I'm not gonna tell you the rest of the list. "
15331,JERRY,79," Oh, because I didn't think the blind guy did it? "
15332,ELAINE,79, Because you have an attitude. 
15333,JERRY and ELAINE,79, Oh! 
15334,JERRY,79, Georgio! Nice duds! 
15335,GEORGE,79," You're telling me. (he walks around and the suit makes a swooshing 
        sound) So, what do you think? "
15336,JERRY,79, Did you hear something? 
15337,ELAINE,79," Yeah, like a swoosh. "
15338,JERRY,79, Yeah. 
15339,ELAINE,79," It must be the fabric. It's rubbing between you thighs when you 
        walk. That's what's making that swooshy sound. "
15340,GEORGE,79," I probably didn't hear it on the way over because of the street 
        noise. (he panics) This is no good! I got to meet these guys from 
        MacKenzie for lunch in half an hour! "
15341,JERRY,79, So what? What would they care? 
15342,GEORGE,79," This MacKenzie, he's a bit of a nut. Someone told me he fired 
        the last guy because his nose whistled when he breathed. "
15343,JERRY,79," So you think you're not gonna get the job because your pants make 
        a noise? "
15344,GEORGE,79," Let's say it comes down to me and one other guy. He's got a nice 
        quiet suit, and I'm whooshing all over the place! Who do you think he's 
        gonna hire? "
15345,JERRY,79," You know, I think all these interviews are making you nuts. "
15346,KRAMER,79," Hey Jerry, I saw your girlfriend was in here before. "
15347,JERRY,79, Audrey? 
15348,KRAMER,79," Yep. Sat down, had herself a piece of pie. "
15349,JERRY,79, Was it apple? 
15350,KRAMER,79, What else? 
15351,JERRY,79, This woman is bending my mind into a pretzel! 
15352,STRANGER,79, Do I know you? 
15353,ELAINE,79, Hmm... No you don't. 
15354,STRANGER,79," Yeah! You were wearing a G-string and one of those bras with 
        points. "
15355,ELAINE,79, The mannequin! 
15356,JERRY,79," Oh, I got to see this thing. "
15357,[setting,79, Rinitze] 
15358,JERRY,79," Boy, the resemblance is uncanny. "
15359,ELAINE,79," You think you can pose me however you want? That's my ass in 
        your window! "
15360,SALESWOMAN,79," It's our store and our mannequin, we can do whatever we want 
        with it. "
15361,ELAINE,79," No! You take down that mannequin right now, or I'm pressing charges. 
        (Jerry goes along) Yes, this is my attorney. "
15362,SALESWOMAN,79, (to Jerry) Yeah? What law am I breaking? 
15363,JERRY,79," Well, I believe there's some legal precedent - Winchell vs. Mahoney, 
      "
15364,ELAINE,79, Uh-huh 
15365,JERRY,79, The Charlie Macarthy hearings. 
15366,ELAINE,79, Uh-huh. Are you taking this down? 
15367,SALESWOMAN,79, I'm getting the manager. (she leaves) 
15368,ELAINE,79, Jerry get the car. (she's getting the mannequin) 
15369,JERRY,79, What are you doing? 
15370,ELAINE,79, Just get the car! 
15371,JERRY,79," Elaine, as your legal counsel I must advise against this. "
15372,[setting,79, Jerry's car] 
15373,JERRY,79," I don't know about you, but I'm getting a hankering for some doublemint 
        gum. I'm dropping you off at work, right? "
15374,ELAINE,79, Where are you going? 
15375,JERRY,79, Poppie's 
15376,[setting,79, a restaurant] 
15377,MACKENZIE,79," Thanks for meeting me down here George. My office is out of 
        control, (George's pants are making noise) phones ringing, people 
        running in and out. (MacKenzie stops talking and walking, George too) 
        Did you hear something? "
15378,GEORGE,79," No, I didn't hear anything. "
15379,MACKENZIE,79," Huh, that's strange. (they start walking again) It's 
        quieter here. We can concentrate without people wooshing around... (he 
        stops again, George too) That sound again. Sure you didn't hear anything? 
      "
15380,GEORGE,79," No, can't say as I did. "
15381,MACKENZIE,79, Kind of like a... rustling. 
15382,GEORGE,79, Could be the leaves... 
15383,[setting,79, Poppie's] 
15384,JERRY,79, Hello. 
15385,AUDREY,79, What are you doing here? 
15386,JERRY,79, So how was the pie? 
15387,AUDREY,79, What pie? 
15388,JERRY,79, The apple pie you had today at Monks 
15389,AUDREY,79, I'm very busy here. 
15390,JERRY,79," Pretty good, wasn'it? I told you you should've tasted it. "
15391,AUDREY,79, You better not let Poppie see you here. 
15392,Health Inspector,79," All right, I'm looking for someone named Poppie. "
15393,AUDREY,79," Uh, who are you? "
15394,Health Inspector,79," Board of health, we've had several complaints. "
15395,JERRY,79," Oh, about the... uh (Jerry pretend to wash his hands) "
15396,Health Inspector,79, Are you Poppie? 
15397,POPPIE,79, I'm Poppie. 
15398,Health Inspector,79, I think you'd better come with me. 
15399,POPPIE,79, What's the problem? 
15400,AUDREY,79, What do they want from Poppie? 
15401,JERRY,79," Well, Poppie's a little sloppy. "
15402,[setting,79, at the restaurant with MacKenzie] 
15403,MACKENZIE,79, You taught I'd care about your pants wooshing? 
15404,GEORGE,79, I heard the last guy got fired because his nose whislted. 
15405,MACKENZIE,79," No, no, no. He got fired because he wasn't a team player. 
        That's something we don't joke about at MacKenzie. You'll find we're team 
        here George. We don't tolerate dissent. If you want to go your own way, 
        you're in the wrong place. "
15406,GEORGE,79, No problem there. Conformity is an obsession with me. 
15407,WAITER,79, Chocolate cream pie. Compliments of the house. 
15408,MACKENZIE,79, Oh! Hope you saved room for dessert. 
15409,WAITER,79," (to George) The chef said that he made it special for 
        you. "
15410,MACKENZIE,79," Mmm.. Best pie I've ever tasted. Take a bite George. (George 
        shakes his head doing ""no"") Well, take a bite. It's delicious. 
        (still shaking) I insist. (still shaking) "
15411,BUSINESSMAN,79," If you're one of us, you'll take a bite. "
15412,[setting,79, Monk's] 
15413,JERRY,79, So you didn't get the job. 
15414,GEORGE,79," No. But I was the only one at the table that didn't get violently 
        ill. "
15415,JERRY,79," Kramer, you can't keep avoiding her like this, you're gonna have 
        to say something. "
15416,KRAMER,79, What am I supposed to say? 
15417,JERRY,79, Tell her you lost your itch. 
15418,GEORGE,79, What happened to your itch? 
15419,KRAMER,79," I lost it two days ago. I've been faking it so I wouldn't hurt 
        her feelings. "
15420,JERRY,79, Well you should tell her. 
15421,KRAMER,79," I'll let her down easy. All right. (he gets up and walks to 
        Olive) Well, hi Olive. (she reaches for Kramer's back) No, 
        no. No more of that. There's something I have to tell you. "
15422,OLIVE,79, What? 
15423,KRAMER,79," Uh, well, there's someone else. "
15424,OLIVE,79, Someone else? 
15425,KRAMER,79," Yeah, yeah, yeah... "
15426,OLIVE,79, Who is she? 
15427,KRAMER,79," Her. (he points to the Elaine mannequin in Jerry's car)
"
15428,OLIVE,79, her? 
15429,KRAMER,79," Yeah, there she is. That's my gal. "
15430,OLIVE,79," You're a liar. I've seen her in here before. She's not your girlfriend. 
      "
15431,KRAMER,79," Now Olive, look, I'm sorry. "
15432,OLIVE,79, Why is she wearing her underwear? 
15433,KRAMER,79," Well, it's a style. (turns back to Jerry) Jerry give me 
        the keys. (Jerry throws his keys to Kramer) Well, I guess we're 
        gonna go for a drive now. She really loves that. "
15434,GEORGE,79, Did you ever solve the riddle of the pie? 
15435,JERRY,79," No. That's one for the ages. But I think they're gonna put Poppie 
        away for a long long time. "
15436,ELAINE,79," You guys are not gonna believe this. I just got a letter from 
        a friend of mine in Chicago who's shopping, and she said she saw a mannequin 
        that looked just like me. What if there're more. Where are they coming 
        from? "
15437,[setting,79," The building where Ricky works. Ricky's the guy in ""The 
        Cigar Store Indian"" who made a bouquet for Elaine from Frank's TV 
        guide.] "
15438,RICKY'S BOSS,79," Ricky, we've been getting a tremendous response to your 
        TR-6 mannequin. "
15439,RICKY,79, TR-6? I prefer to think of her as... Elaine.

15441,Jerry's stand-up,81," Of all the places that you go all the time, 
        the dry-cleaning relationship is one of the most bizarre. Because you 
        keep giving each other the same thing, back and forth, over and over again. 
        He gives it to you, you give it to him, he gives it back to you. It's 
        like it's half his shirt, in a way. He has it as much as you do...you 
        oughta go shopping with him. 'What do you think of this shirt?' 'That 
        would look good with a light starch.' The only warning label people really 
        respect is 'dry-clean only.' Y'know what I mean? Speed limits, lung cancer, 
        cigarette warnings - your very life is at stake! People go, 'Ah, the hell 
        with it!' But dry-clean only? 'Oh, don't put that in the wash! It's dry-clean 
        only! Are you crazy?!'"
15442,MERYL,81, Good morning. 
15443,JERRY,81, Good morning.
15444,MERYL,81, How'd you sleep?
15445,JERRY,81," Hey, you are the couch tonight, young lady. You were all over 
        my side."
15446,MERYL,81, I was not!
15447,JERRY,81," C'mon, I was sleeping with one cheek off the bed!"
15448,MERYL,81," By the way, you're falling way behind on the 'I love you's.'"
15449,JERRY,81," No, no, 12-8!"
15450,MERYL,81," No, it's 15-8."
15451,JERRY,81," I know I can't beat ya, I'm just trying to stay competitive."
15452,MERYL,81," Alright c'mon, let's get some breakfast."
15453,JERRY,81," Uh, let me get a coat. I think I'll try a sport jacket and scarf 
        thing, you know, like an unemployed actor. <Goes into his room, and 
        comes back out with the jacket on.> Haven't worn this one in a long 
        time."
15454,MERYL (feels Jerry's material),81," Ooh, cashmere?"
15455,JERRY,81," No, gore-tex. It's new. <Checks his pockets.> Hey, look 
        at this locket. What the hell is this? There's a picture in here, look 
        at that."
15456,MERYL,81," Wow, this is really old. You don't know whose it is?"
15457,JERRY,81," No, I haven't worn this jacket since I got it back from the dry-cleaner. 
        Maybe we should ask him. "
15458,MERYL,81," Alright, we'll stop over there."
15459,JERRY,81, Yeah. What do you want to get for breakfast?
15460,MERYL,81, Pancakes.
15461,JERRY,81," Oh now, c'mon, you know I'm getting pancakes."
15462,MERYL,81, I don't know that!  
15463,JERRY,81," But we can't both get pancakes, it's embarrassing. It's like one 
        step from the couples who dress alike."
15464,MERYL,81, I'll get the short stack.
15465,JERRY,81," Ah, that's why I love ya. 15-9. <They go out into the hallway 
        and run into Kramer and his African-American girlfriend, Anna.> Hey, 
        how ya doin.'"
15466,KRAMER,81, We just got back from breakfast. The pancakes were dynamite.
15467,JERRY,81," Hey, is that my maple syrup? <Kramer hands it over.>"
15468,MERYL,81, You bring your own syrup?
15469,KRAMER,81, Got to.
15470,JERRY (to Meryl),81, You got a lot to learn about pancakes.
15471,MARTY (looking at the locket),81," This is my wife. She died eight years 
        ago. I been looking all over for this! "
15472,JERRY,81," Boy, it's a lucky thing I put the jacket on. But how did it get 
        in the pocket? "
15473,MARTY,81," Well, see here, the chain is broken...it must have slipped in 
        when I was, uh...<gestures at the racks of clothes behind him.>"
15474,JERRY,81," Oh, wow."
15475,MARTY,81," I turned my house upside-down looking for this! It's all I have 
        left of her."
15476,MERYL,81," Oh, that's so touching."
15477,MARTY (to Jerry),81," Know what I'm gonna do for you? I'm gonna give you 
        and your family 25% off all your dry-cleaning from now on."
15478,JERRY,81," Oh, come on!"
15479,MARTY,81, What are you talkin' about?
15480,JERRY,81, It's silly!
15481,MARTY,81," Hey, forget it!"
15482,JERRY,81, Get outta here!
15483,MARTY,81, It's done!
15484,JERRY (giving in),81, Alright.
15485,MERYL,81," Well, I guess I get it too, because I'm his wife."
15486,MARTY (to Jerry),81, I didn't know you were married.
15487,JERRY,81," Oh...yeah...you've never met my wife, Meryl? Meryl Seinfeld."
15488,MARTY (to Meryl),81," Sure, you get the discount, too."
15489,JERRY,81," You might regret that, because the money my wife spends on clothes..."
15490,MERYL,81, I'm taking him to the cleaners!
15491,JERRY,81," Ah - see the sense of humor? C'mere, I'm so nuts about you...<hugs 
        Meryl.> I tell ya, it was fun being single, but when you meet a woman 
        like this, you don't walk to get married - you run! "
15492,ELAINE,81," Oh, hi Greg."
15493,GREG,81, Haven't seen you in a while.
15494,ELAINE,81," Yeah. Well, today was the first day I worked out since the Central 
        Park Mini-Marathon."
15495,GREG,81, You ran the Mini-Marathon?
15496,ELAINE,81," No, but I exercised that day. <Laughs.>"
15497,GREG,81," Well, I gotta take off."
15498,ELAINE,81," Yeah, I guess as an airline pilot, you're one of the few people 
        who can say that and mean it. <Laughs again. Greg looks at her, unamused.> 
        Um, do you have the time?"
15499,GREG (looks at his watch),81, Eleven-thirty.
15500,ELAINE (surprised),81, Eleven-thirty?
15501,GREG,81," Wait, ten-thirty. Sorry."
15502,ELAINE,81, Oh.
15503,GREG,81, Do you have to be somewhere?
15504,ELAINE,81, No.
15505,GREG,81, Then what are you doing?
15506,ELAINE,81," I'm just waiting for my friend George, we worked out together."
15507,GREG,81," Oh. Well, it was good seeing you."
15508,ELAINE,81," Yeah, nice to see you, too."
15509,MERYL,81," Uh, would you, um...can I..."
15510,JERRY,81, Pardon?
15511,MERYL,81, The syrup. Would you pass the syrup?
15512,JERRY (holds up the syrup bottle),81," Oh, you want to try the syrup! <Meryl 
        smiles and takes it. The waitress comes over.>"
15513,WAITRESS,81, Can I get you anything else?
15514,JERRY,81," Um, yeah...I think my wife and I'll have a little more coffee."
15515,WAITRESS,81, Okay.
15516,MERYL,81, And a check for my husband.
15517,JERRY (toasts with his orange juice),81, To my beautiful wife.
15518,MERYL,81, To my adoring husband.
15519,JERRY,81, Adoring? What about handsome? 
15520,MERYL,81, I like adoring.
15521,JERRY,81," Sure, adoring's good for you, what does it do for me? <Meryl 
        laughs. The owner of the coffee shop comes over.>"
15522,OWNER (points at the bottle of maple syrup),81," Excuse me...where did you 
        get that?"
15523,JERRY,81," I, uh...well..."
15524,OWNER,81," Uh, we don't allow any outside syrups, jams or condiments in the 
        restaurant. (To Jerry) And if I catch you in here with that again...I 
        will confiscate it."
15525,JERRY,81," Well, I told my wife not to bring it."
15526,KRAMER,81," Really? 25% off? Do I get that, too?"
15527,JERRY,81," No, just Meryl."
15528,KRAMER,81," Why, why? Why does she get it?"
15529,KRAMER,81," ""My wife has an inner ear infection."" "
15530,JERRY,81, See?
15531,KRAMER,81," I like that! Hey look, will you do me a favor? Will you take 
        my quilt into the cleaners for me, so I can get the discount too?"
15532,JERRY,81," Oh come on, we're gonna start doing this now? I can't be taking 
        all your dry-cleaning in!"
15533,KRAMER,81," C'mon, just this one time! It's expensive!"
15534,JERRY,81, Alright. <Elaine enters.>
15535,KRAMER,81," Hey. Hey Elaine, what do you say if neither of us is married 
        in ten years, we get hitched?"
15536,ELAINE,81, Let's make it fifty.
15537,KRAMER,81," We're engaged! Alright, I'm gonna get my quilt. <Kramer leaves.>"
15538,ELAINE,81," Alright, listen to this. Remember that guy I was telling you 
        about at the health club?"
15539,JERRY,81, The fly-boy.
15540,ELAINE,81, Yeah.
15541,JERRY,81," Hey, where's George? I thought he was with you."
15542,ELAINE,81," I waited, he didn't show up. Anyway, this guy gave me an open-lip 
        kiss."
15543,JERRY,81, So?
15544,ELAINE,81," So? We've always just kind've pecked. This one had a totally 
        different dynamic."
15545,JERRY,81, Really.
15546,ELAINE,81," Yeah. I mean, his upper lip landed flush on my upper lip. But 
        his lower lip landed well below my rim. "
15547,JERRY,81, Moisture?
15548,ELAINE,81, Yeah. Definite moisture.
15549,JERRY,81," That's an open-lip kiss, alright."
15550,ELAINE,81," Yeah. Listen, I think he's giving me a big signal...maybe he 
        wants to change our relationship. <The buzzer sounds, Elaine answers 
        it.> Yeah?"
15551,GEORGE (on intercom),81," Oh, uh...it's George."
15552,ELAINE,81," Hey, what happened to you?"
15553,GEORGE (meekly),81, Nothing...little problem.
15554,ELAINE,81," Well, what was it? I mean, I was waiting."
15555,GEORGE,81," Can I come upstairs, please? <Elaine pushes the button and 
        lets George in.>"
15556,ELAINE (to Jerry),81," I mean, maybe he wants to ask me out."
15557,JERRY,81," I don't know why you're interested in this guy, he's a jerk."
15558,ELAINE,81," Because, he doesn't pay any attention to me, and he ignores me."
15559,JERRY,81," Yeah, so?"
15560,ELAINE,81," I respect that. <George enters.> Mmm, what happened?"
15561,GEORGE,81," Nothing, I... said it was a little problem."
15562,ELAINE,81, Yeah? What was it?
15563,GEORGE (defensive),81," Well...I was in the locker room showering, and I...I 
        had to go, so..."
15564,JERRY,81, Here we go.
15565,GEORGE,81," Anyway, I think the guy in the shower opposite saw me. He gave 
        me a dirty look."
15566,ELAINE,81, You went...in the shower?
15567,GEORGE,81," Yeah, so what? I'm not the only one! <Kramer enters with his 
        quilt.>"
15568,ELAINE (to Jerry),81, Do you go in the shower?
15569,JERRY,81," No, never."
15570,ELAINE (to Kramer),81, Do you?
15571,KRAMER,81, I take baths.
15572,GEORGE,81," Well, what was I supposed to do? Get out of the shower, put on 
        my bathrobe? Go all the way down to the other end? Come all the way back?"
15573,ELAINE,81, Ever hear of...holding it in?
15574,GEORGE,81," Oh, no...no, that's very bad for the kidneys."
15575,ELAINE,81, How do you know?
15576,GEORGE,81, Medical journals!
15577,JERRY,81," Do the medical journals mention anything about standing in a pool 
        of someone else's urine?"
15578,JERRY,81, Hello.
15579,MERYL,81," Oh, hi...honey."
15580,JERRY,81, What are you doing here?
15581,MERYL,81, I just thought I'd drop off a few things.
15582,JERRY,81," Oh. <Smiles at Marty nervously.> Well, I must have been 
        in the incinerator room when you left. Here you go, Marty. <Hands over 
        Kramer's quilt.>"
15583,MARTY,81, Another quilt? Huh? <Uncle Leo enters.>
15584,UNCLE LEO,81, Jerry! 
15585,JERRY,81, Uncle Leo!
15586,UNCLE LEO,81, Hello!
15587,JERRY,81, Hello.
15588,MARTY (to Jerry),81," So, if you or your wife want to drop by on Wednesday, 
        it should be ready."
15589,UNCLE LEO,81, Your wife?
15590,JERRY (hoping Leo will pick up on the scam),81, Yeah...my wife.
15591,UNCLE LEO,81, What are you talking about?
15592,JERRY,81, Uh...I got married.
15593,UNCLE LEO (shocked),81," You got married? I wasn't invited? Nobody sends 
        me an invitation?"
15594,JERRY,81," Well, it was sudden."
15595,UNCLE LEO,81, Are you ashamed of your uncle? Do I embarrass you?
15596,JERRY,81," No, no, it was a small ceremony."
15597,UNCLE LEO,81, Haven't I always been a good uncle?
15598,JERRY,81," Yes, yes, you have."
15599,UNCLE LEO,81, Who told you when you went to school that you print well?
15600,JERRY,81," You did, you did."
15601,UNCLE LEO (to Meryl),81," When he was younger, he had a beautiful penmanship. 
        I used to encourage him to print."
15602,JERRY,81, I'm a good printer.
15603,UNCLE LEO,81," I remember your 'V.' It was like a perfect triangle. Whoa, 
        there's my bus! <Rushes out.> Hello! Wait! <Jerry tries to catch 
        Leo before he runs off to tell him about his ""pretend marriage,"" 
        but doesn't make it.>"
15604,GREG,81," I'm glad you're here. This can get really boring. Do you know where 
        I can get some good olives?"
15605,ELAINE,81, I can find out.
15606,GREG,81, Would ya?
15607,ELAINE,81," Sure. <Thinks - Ooh, a project. That's a definite signal!>"
15608,GREG,81," By the way, you look really great in that leotard."
15609,ELAINE,81," Oh, thanks. <Thinks - That's no signal, who wouldn't like 
        me in this leotard? I look amazing in this leotard.>"
15610,GREG,81," Hey, you know what's weird? I think I had a dream about you last 
        night."
15611,ELAINE,81," <Thinks - Okay, he open-lips me, he dreams about me, we 
        have an olive project...that's it, I'm asking this guy out.> Um, 
        you know Greg, I..."
15612,GREG,81, Can I have a sip of your water?
15613,ELAINE,81," Oh, yeah, sure. <Hands Greg her bottle.>"
15614,GREG,81," Thanks. <Is about to take a drink, but wipes the neck of the 
        bottle with his shirt first.>"
15615,ELAINE (shocked expression),81, <Thinks - Oh my God.>
15616,GREG (hands the bottle back),81," I'm sorry, what were you saying?"
15617,ELAINE,81," It was nothing, forget it. <George enters the gym.>"
15618,GREG,81," See that guy right there? I caught him urinating in the shower. 
        I'm thinking about turning him in, too. <On the other side of the room, 
        George falls off an exercise machine and gets his foot caught in it.>"
15619,MERYL,81, Honey? Could you get me something to drink?
15620,"JERRY (from his bedroom hallway, alluding to the fact that she should 
        get the drink herself)",81, You're right there.
15621,MERYL,81," C'mon, I'm sitting! <Jerry walks to the kitchen, annoyed. Meryl 
        laughs at the TV show she's watching.>"
15622,JERRY (looking in a drawer),81," Honey, what'd you do with the can opener?"
15623,MERYL,81, I didn't do anything with it.
15624,JERRY,81," Well, it's not here, it was here yesterday."
15625,MERYL,81, It's in the first drawer.
15626,JERRY,81, I'm looking in the first drawer. It's not here.
15627,MERYL,81," Yes, it is."
15628,JERRY (irritated),81," Hey...I'm not stupid. I'm looking in that drawer, 
        there's no can opener."
15629,MERYL,81, Did I say you were stupid?
15630,JERRY (angrily),81," Well, wouldn't I have to be? You tell me there's a can 
        opener in the drawer, I'm looking in the drawer, there's no can opener 
        - what other conclusion could one reach? <The phone rings.>"
15631,MERYL (getting up),81, Do you want me to go find it?
15632,JERRY (slams the drawer),81," Yes. I do. You show me where there's a can 
        opener in that drawer. <Answers the phone.> Hello! I'm sorry, I'm 
        just fighting with my wife."
15633,HELEN,81," Jerry, we just heard, what's going on?"
15634,MORTY,81, Why the hell didn't you tell us?
15635,JERRY,81," Listen, Ma..."
15636,MERYL (looking in the drawer),81, It was in here yesterday!
15637,JERRY (angrily),81," Yeah, that's what I said!"
15638,HELEN,81, Who is she? When did this happen?
15639,MORTY (to Jerry),81," I told her you'd get married. She thought you'd never 
        do it."
15640,HELEN,81," Morty, you're talking too loud."
15641,MORTY,81, I'm not talking loud!
15642,HELEN,81, You're hurting my eardrum.
15643,MERYL (looking for the can opener),81," Well, you must have done something 
        with it!"
15644,JERRY (to Meryl),81, I'm on the phone!
15645,HELEN,81, Is she there? Can we talk to her? What's her name?
15646,JERRY,81," Mom, I'm not married."
15647,HELEN,81, What?
15648,JERRY,81, I'm not married!
15649,MORTY,81," I knew it, I told ya!"
15650,HELEN (to Jerry),81, Uncle Leo said.
15651,JERRY,81," I'm just pretending I'm married to get a discount on dry-cleaning. 
      "
15652,HELEN,81, A discount on dry-cleaning?
15653,"JERRY (to Meryl, who's making a racket in the kitchen looking for the 
        can opener)",81," Could you make a little more noise? <To his parents> 
        Listen, I'm gonna have to call you later."
15654,MERYL (not finding the opener),81," Well, I give up."
15655,JERRY,81," Well, whoopie whoop. <Meryl goes into the other room. Kramer 
        staggers in the door in his bathrobe.>"
15656,KRAMER,81, Got any coffee?
15657,JERRY,81," Yeah. <Kramer lurches into the kitchen, trips, and falls onto 
        the kitchen floor.> I'll get it, I'll get it! Take it easy, why are 
        you so tired?"
15658,KRAMER,81," My quilt is still at the cleaners. Jerry, I can't sleep without 
        my quilt. Like the other night? I was cold. So, last night, I turn up 
        the heat - it's too hot. I open up a window - it's too cold. <Frantic> 
        I can't get into a zone!"
15659,JERRY,81, What is that? <Points to Kramer's pocket as Meryl comes back.>
15660,KRAMER,81," Oh, I forgot. <Hands back Jerry's can opener.>"
15661,JERRY,81," Hey, I'm sorry about all that can opener stuff."
15662,MERYL,81," Yeah, me too. Love you."
15663,JERRY,81, Love you.
15664,MERYL,81," Well, goodnight."
15665,JERRY,81," Goodnight. <They kiss goodnight, then promptly roll away from 
        each other and go to sleep.>"
15666,GEORGE,81, They could kick me out of the health club if he tells them!
15667,ELAINE,81, So what do you want me to do?
15668,GEORGE,81, Talk to him!
15669,ELAINE,81, How can I do that?
15670,GEORGE,81, You said the guy gave you an open-lipped kiss!
15671,ELAINE (enunciating clearly so George gets the point),81," Yes, but then 

        he wiped his hand on the top of the bottle when I offered him water!"
15672,GEORGE,81," Well, that doesn't mean anything!"
15673,ELAINE,81," Are you kidding? That's very significant! If he was interested 
        in me, he'd want my germs! He'd just crave my germs!"
15674,JERRY (patiently),81," She's right, George. Bottle-wipe is big."
15675,GEORGE,81," Well, what about the open-lipped kiss?"
15676,JERRY,81, Bottle-wipe supercedes it.
15677,GEORGE,81," Yeah, you're right, you're right. <To Elaine> Alright, 
        maybe he's not interested, but you still know him - can't you just ask 
        him?"
15678,ELAINE,81," George...but if I ask him now, I will have no chance of going 
        out with him."
15679,GEORGE,81, Why?
15680,ELAINE,81, I...I don't know...
15681,GEORGE,81," Aha. Aha. Could it be because you don't want him to know that 
        you have a friend who pees in the shower, is that it?!"
15682,ELAINE,81," No, that's not it!"
15683,GEORGE,81," Oh, I think it is! I think that's exactly what it is!"
15684,ELAINE,81, Why couldn't you just wait?
15685,GEORGE,81, I was there! I saw a drain!
15686,ELAINE,81, Since when is a drain a toilet?!
15687,GEORGE,81, It's all pipes! What's the difference?!
15688,ELAINE,81," Different pipes go to different places! You're gonna mix 'em 
        up!"
15689,GEORGE,81, I'll call a plumber right now! <Goes for the phone.>
15690,JERRY,81," Alright, can we just drop all the pee-pipe stuff here?"
15691,ELAINE (to George),81, Okay! Okay! I will talk to him. <Kramer enters.>
15692,KRAMER,81," Jerry, I think that quilt is ready."
15693,JERRY,81, Alright.
15694,KRAMER,81," Well, you gotta pick it up for me!"
15695,JERRY,81," Alright, I'll pick it up, but it's the last time I'm doin' it!"
15696,KRAMER,81, I'm so tired!
15697,ELAINE (to Kramer),81," Boy, you don't look good."
15698,KRAMER,81, Huh? I don't?
15699,ELAINE,81," No, you look pale."
15700,KRAMER,81," Pale? Oh my God...I gotta meet Anna's parents today! <The 
        phone rings.>"
15701,JERRY,81," Hello? Oh, hi honey. <annoyed, weary> Yes, I told him. I'll 
        get it. <George and Elaine give each other a look, then leave Jerry 
        to argue with Meryl on the phone.> Whenever. Okay, I'm sorry..."
15702,MARTY,81," I'm sorry, it's not ready yet. <Kramer bursts in.>"
15703,KRAMER,81," Not ready? It has to be ready! What kind of a business are you 
        running here?"
15704,MARTY,81, Who the hell are you? It's not your quilt.
15705,JERRY,81," He's a very good friend of mine, he's kind've like an older brother 
        to me...when things don't go right, he kinda takes it personally."
15706,MARTY,81," Well, uh...maybe tomorrow."
15707,"KRAMER (angrily, to Jerry)",81, Maybe.
15708,JERRY,81," Oh, it's okay, it'll be okay."
15709,KRAMER,81," Alright, I'm gonna see you later."
15710,JERRY,81, Where you goin'?
15711,KRAMER,81," I gotta meet Anna's parents today, remember? I look terrible! 
        I'm gonna hit the tanning machines."
15712,JERRY,81," I can't believe you still do that. You know those things are bad 
        for ya."
15713,KRAMER,81," Hey, that's how I maintain my glow. "
15714,JERRY,81," I'm goin' home. <Kramer exits. An attractive woman enters the 
        dry-cleaners with a bundle of clothes in her hands. Jerry notices her 
        and waits by the door.>"
15715,"PAULA (to Marty, in a foreign accent)",81," Excuse me? Uh, how much would 
        it cost to clean this?"
15716,MARTY,81," Oh, about thirteen dollars."
15717,PAULA,81," Thirteen? Well, I can't afford that."
15718,MARTY,81," Well, I'm sorry."
15719,ELAINE,81," Hi, Greg."
15720,GREG,81," Hey, Elaine. I'll be off in a second. <Another guy approaches 
        the exercise machine.>"
15721,ELAINE,81," I got the machine next, buddy. <Greg finishes up his workout 
        and gets off the machine.>"
15722,GREG (to Elaine),81," It's all yours. <Walks away. Elaine looks at the 
        machine, then George runs over.>"
15723,GEORGE,81, What happened? Did he bring it up?
15724,ELAINE,81," Never mind that, look at the signal I just got."
15725,GEORGE,81, Signal? What signal?
15726,ELAINE,81," Lookit. He knew I was gonna use the machine next, he didn't wipe 
        his sweat off. That's a gesture of intimacy."
15727,GEORGE,81," I'll tell you what that is - that's a violation of club rules. 
        Now I got him! And you're my witness!"
15728,ELAINE,81," Listen, George! Listen! He knew what he was doing, this was a 
        signal."
15729,GEORGE,81," A guy leaves a puddle of sweat, that's a signal?"
15730,ELAINE,81, Yeah! It's a social thing.
15731,GEORGE,81," What if he left you a used Kleenex, what's that, a valentine? 
        Now you go up to him and you tell him that if he's thinking of turning 
        me in, that I got the goods on him!"
15732,ELAINE,81, No! I won't be a party to this.
15733,GEORGE,81, So you're gonna let me get suspended for shower urination?
15734,ELAINE,81," Okay, I'll talk to him. But you're putting me in a very difficult 
        position. <Walks away.>"
15735,PAULA,81, I won't let you do this!
15736,JERRY,81, I want to!
15737,PAULA,81, But it isn't right! I can't.
15738,JERRY,81, Give me the clothes. 
15739,PAULA,81," Jerry, please. What about her?"
15740,JERRY,81," Oh, the hell with her. <Paula dramatically flees from the coffee 
        shop. Jerry thinks for a second, then follows her and catches up to her 
        on the street.>"
15741,PAULA,81," No, Jerry, please!"
15742,JERRY,81, I'm not gonna let you walk out of my life.
15743,PAULA (hands over the clothes),81," I can't fight you. <They embrace and 
        kiss passionately.>"
15744,JERRY,81, Do you want box or hanger?
15745,PAULA,81, You decide. <Jerry considers.>
15746,ELAINE,81," You're really working up quite a sweat today, huh?"
15747,GREG,81," Yeah. <Spies the shapely manager of the health club.> Oh, 
        there's the manager. Good. I think I'm gonna talk to her about that guy, 
        you know, we cannot have people like that in here."
15748,ELAINE,81, Are you sure you want to do that?
15749,GREG,81," Yeah. He's disgusting! Besides, I'll take any chance I can to talk 
        to her."
15750,ELAINE,81, You're interested in...in her? <Points at the manager.>
15751,GREG,81, Very.
15752,ELAINE,81," Ah. You know, uh...I'm engaged. <preens> Yep, gettin' married 
        in fifty years. <Snaps the straps of her leotard against her chest 
        and winces. George walks by the manager.>"
15753,GREG,81," Oh good, there he is. I wanna be able to point him out."
15754,ELAINE,81," You know, Greg, I wouldn't do that if I were you."
15755,GREG,81, Why?
15756,ELAINE,81," Well, correct me if I'm wrong, but isn't it a violation of club 
        policy to not wipe down a machine after using it?"
15757,GREG,81," Oh, I see...you're friends with the urinator, aren't you?"
15758,ELAINE,81," Yeah, well, at least he had a drain."
15759,MARTY,81," Here you go, Mrs. Seinfeld...with your 25% discount, it comes 
        to $17.80."
15760,MERYL,81," Here you go. <Pays Marty, then looks at the clothes on the 
        hanger.> Excuse me, this isn't mine."
15761,MARTY,81," Oh, yes it is. Your husband brought it in himself."
15762,MERYL,81," Really? <Takes her change and grabs the clothes off the hanger.> 
        Thank you. <Exits.>"
15763,ANNA,81," That's him! <Opens the door. Kramer stands there, deeply 
        tanned and smiling. Anna and her grandfather are shocked.>"
15764,MERYL (throws Paula's clothes at Jerry),81, You son of a bitch!
15765,JERRY,81, I'm sorry.
15766,MERYL,81, Who is she? I want to know who she is.
15767,JERRY,81, It doesn't matter. I want a divorce.
15768,MERYL,81," A divorce? Oh, so you can marry her and give her the discount?"
15769,JERRY,81," Yes, that's right."
15770,MERYL,81," What happened to us, Jerry?"
15771,JERRY,81, I'll tell you what happened. We got married.
15772,MERYL,81," I'm sorry, this is my fault. I pushed it on you."
15773,JERRY,81," No. I guess I just wasn't ready for the responsibilities of a 
        pretend marriage."
15774,MERYL,81," Goodbye, Jerry. Oh, I forgot...<reaches in her purse>...this 
        is your maple syrup."
15775,JERRY,81," It's alright, I want you to have it."
15776,MERYL,81," Okay, thanks."
15777,JERRY,81, We'll always have...pancakes.
15778,MERYL,81," Bye, Jerry. <Exits.>"
15779,GRANDPA (to Anna),81," I thought you said you was bringin' a white boy home! 
        I don't see a white boy! I see a damn fool!"

        Julia Louis-Dreyfus ............. Elaine Benes
        Michael Richards ................. Cosmo Kramer"
15781,JERRY,82, You know their timing couldn't be worse.
15782,GEORGE,82, Is there ever a good time to have your parents stay with you?
15783,JERRY,82," You don't understand, I haven't been together with Rachel for 
        like three weeks. First I was on the road, then my parents show up, I'm 
        getting a little uh backed up. "
15784,GEORGE,82, When are they leaving for Paris?
15785,JERRY,82, Not for another three days.
15786,GEORGE,82, What about her place?
15787,JERRY,82, She lives with her parents.
15788,GEORGE,82," Really? (Jerry shakes his head) Maybe this will become like a 
        cool thing, living with your parents."
15789,JERRY,82," (sarcastically)Ya, then maybe baldness will catch on. This will 
        all be turning your way. "
15790,GEORGE,82," Hey believe me, baldness will catch on. When the aliens come, 
        who do you think they're gonna relate to? Who do you think is going to 
        be the first ones getting a tour of the ship?"
15791,JERRY,82, The baldies
15792,GEORGE,82," Hey by the way my parents really want to have your parents over 
        dinner before they leave town."
15793,JERRY,82," That's good, then I get the apartment for at least one night. 
        You know I'm paying for this whole Paris trip it's their anniversary present."
15794,ALEC,82, (walking over to Jerry and George's table) Hey guys.
15795,GEORGE,82, Hey Alec
15796,JERRY,82, Hey Alec
15797,ALEC,82, This is Joey. 
15798,GEORGE,82," Hey Joey, how you doin'?"
15799,ALEC,82," (Joey was about to talk) Hey listen, I was wondering if either 
        one of you guys would be interested in doing some work for the Big Brother 
        program? I'm kinda running the local chapter. What do you say George?"
15800,GEORGE,82, Well uh....
15801,JOEY,82," (interrupts) Wouldn't you like to be a big brother to someone like 
        me? Please?"
15802,GEORGE,82," Well, sure Joey, sure, I would be thrilled."
15803,ALEC,82," That's great George, thanks a lot I'll get in touch with you."
15804,JOEY,82, Wouldn't you like to be a big brother..
15805,ALEC,82," (grabs Joey to stop him) Ya alright Joey that's enough, let's go 
        (walking over to the counter) See ya."
15806,JERRY,82, What happened?
15807,GEORGE,82, What could I do? Did you see the mug on that kid?
15808,JERRY,82," (acting like Joey) Wouldn't you like to pass the ketchup to someone 
        like me? Please?"
15809,JERRY,82," Hey did you notice they moved where they do the interview on Jeopardy 
        now?"
15810,GEORGE,82," Ya it used to be right in the middle of single Jeopardy and now 
        they do it right after single Jeopardy."
15811,JERRY,82," Ya, it's much better isn't it?"
15812,GEORGE,82," Oh, n-no comparison."
15813,JERRY,82," Hey, I gotta stop off at the bookstore to pick up my parents one 
        of those French-English dictionaries."
15814,GEORGE,82, (stops Jerry realizing something) Hey hey hey hey hey hey.
15815,JERRY,82, What?
15816,GEORGE,82, Your parents are going to Paris right?
15817,JERRY,82, Yea?
15818,GEORGE,82," So I tell Alec that I have to goto Paris for an undetermined 
        amount of time. Then all I have to do is buy some post cards and have 
        your parents mail them from Paris."
15819,JERRY,82, What about little Joey?
15820,GEORGE,82, Who?
15821,JERRY,82," Ah, I think he's probably better off."
15822,GEORGE,82," I'm trying to get out of this Big Brother program. So when you 
        get to Paris (handing Morty the postcards) all you have to do is drop 
        'em in any mailbox. "
15823,MORTY,82, But there are no stamps on these.
15824,GEORGE,82," Well no not yet, you gotta buy french stamps (pauses) I-I'll 
        reimburse you of course. "
15825,HELEN,82, Why are you doing this?
15826,JERRY,82, He wants this guy to think he's in Paris. 
15827,HELEN,82, Why?
15828,JERRY,82, Because George is a deeply disturbed individual.
15829,KRAMER,82," Oh hey, Helen uh, Could I uh, use some more of your hand lotion?"
15830,HELEN,82, I told you it was good. (hands Kramer the lotion)
15831,KRAMER,82, (putting on the lotion) Ya
15832,HELEN,82, It's from the Sachs Fifth Avenue in Miami.
15833,KRAMER,82," Mmm (smelling the lotion as he rubs it in) I'm gonna remember 
        that if I'm ever in Florida."
15834,JERRY,82," Ya, or if you're ever on Fifth Avenue here in New York City, you 
        could get some there."
15835,KRAMER,82, Ya
15836,MORTY,82," Say those are some nice pants. I got a pair just like them at 
        home."
15837,KRAMER,82," Well uh that doesn't surprise me, ya i bought these at Rudy's. 
        It's a used clothing store. See when people like you die, the widows they 
        bring in their wardrobes, they make a bundle."
15838,GEORGE,82," Really? My father has a ton of old clothes just sitting up in 
        the attic, y-you think they're worth something?"
15839,KRAMER,82," Ya if they're vintage, and you're a widow."
15840,GEORGE,82," What happens if the husband dies after the wife, who brings in 
        the clothing in then?"
15841,KRAMER,82, Well I suppose the children do.
15842,GEORGE,82, (pondering) Yes I suppose they do.
15843,KRAMER,82," (takes another smell of his hands) Alright I gotta a ten o'clock, 
        I'll see everybody later."
15844,GEORGE,82," (grabbing his jacket) Hey oo, I just remembered uh my parents 
        really wanna have you guys over for dinner before you leave town. What 
        about tonight? "
15845,HELEN,82, Tonight?
15846,GEORGE,82, Yea they're making Payaya.
15847,HELEN,82," (looking at Morty) Uh oh I don't think we think we can make it 
        tonight, (turns toward George) we have plans."
15848,JERRY,82, (watching the whole conversation from his desk) What plans? 
15849,HELEN,82, (turns to Jerry) We have plans.
15850,JERRY,82, Where'd you get plans?
15851,HELEN,82, (annoyed) We have plans.
15852,GEORGE,82," Well um, what about tomorrow night?"
15853,HELEN,82, (turns back toward George) Maybe
15854,GEORGE,82," Ok uh, I guess I'll tell them that."
15855,MORTY,82, (to George as he is about to leave) Hey give 'em our best though.
15856,GEORGE,82, (quietly) Ya.
15857,JERRY,82, (walking over toward George and the door) I'll call you later.
15858,GEORGE,82, Ya.
15859,JERRY,82, So what plans do you have?
15860,MORTY,82, None
15861,JERRY,82, So how come you're not going over there for dinner?
15862,HELEN,82, Jerry we don't care much for the Costanzas'.
15863,MORTY,82, We can't stand them.
15864,JERRY,82, Really? Since when?
15865,HELEN,82, Since always. We've never liked them.
15866,JERRY,82, Why?
15867,HELEN,82," Well they're so loud, they're always fighting it's uncomfortable, 
        you never notice?"
15868,JERRY,82," No I notice but they're from your age group I didn't know you 
        could detect abnormal behavior among your own kind. "
15869,MORTY,82, Well we do.
15870,JERRY,82, Ya?
15871,ELAINE,82, It's us.
15872,JERRY,82," U-oh come on up. (buzzes them up) It's Elaine you don't have a 
        problem with her do you?"
15873,HELEN,82, We adore Elaine.
15874,JERRY,82," She wants to say hi, she's with her new boyfriend."
15875,HELEN,82, What's he like?
15876,JERRY,82," He's nice, bit of a close talker."
15877,HELEN,82, A what?
15878,JERRY,82," You'll see. (pause) Boy, I had no idea you felt this way about 
        the Costanzas'"
15879,HELEN,82, They're exhausting it's like being in an Asylum.
15880,EVERYONE,82, Hi.
15881,MORTY,82, Hello Elaine
15882,ELAINE,82, This is Aaron.
15883,HELEN,82, Hello Aaron
15884,MORTY,82, Hello.
15885,AARON,82, (getting up in Helen's face) So how long you folks in town?
15886,HELEN,82," Oh, three more days, three more days then we're off to Paris."
15887,AARON,82, Ah
15888,MORTY,82, We're going with a select charter group.
15889,AARON,82," I love France, (moving over to Morty's face) I was just there 
        last year. In fact, you know I still have an envelope full of French Franks, 
        I'll give 'em to ya."
15890,HELEN,82, We can't take money.
15891,AARON,82," Oh, no, it's a gift. (looking toward Elaine) from us."
15892,ELAINE,82," Oh, that is soo nice (very elaborate nice) Aaron. Isn't he nice? 
        (to Helen) So listen has Jerry been showin' you a good time?"
15893,JERRY,82, No I haven't.
15894,AARON,82," You know (to Morty) I have a friend who works at the Metropolitan 
        Museum of Art. How would you like a behind the scenes tour?"
15895,HELEN,82," (grabbing Aaron) Really, you could do that?"
15896,AARON,82, (up in Helen's face) Easily
15897,HELEN,82, I wouldn't be any trouble?
15898,AARON,82, (gets closer) Of course not.
15899,HELEN,82, When would we go?
15900,AARON,82, How about right now?
15901,MORTY,82, I'm ready
15902,HELEN,82, Are you sure?
15903,AARON,82, Yes.
15904,HELEN,82," Ok, let me get my coat."
15905,AARON,82," (walking over to Elaine and getting into her face) Elaine what 
        do you say?"
15906,ELAINE,82," W-well I don't think so Aaron, uh, I have plans."
15907,AARON,82, Oh. (getting into Jerry's face) How about you Jerry?
15908,JERRY,82, I'm swamped.
15909,AARON,82, You sure? You could examine the art work up close.
15910,JERRY,82, Maybe I'll try and catch up with you.
15911,ELAINE,82, (under her breath) Ya that'll happen)
15912,AARON,82, (Moving toward the door) Alright. We're off.
15913,MORTY,82," Ok, bye."
15914,HELEN & AARON,82, Bye.
15915,JERRY,82, Ok buh bye. Have a good time.
15916,ELAINE,82, Bye.
15917,AARON,82," See everybody later (Morty and Helen leave; Aaron closes the door 
        blowing Elaine a kiss)"
15918,JERRY,82, Ok.
15919,ELAINE,82, Why would he ask your parents to go to a museum?
15920,JERRY,82, I don't know.
15921,ELAINE,82, What is that?
15922,JERRY,82, Maybe he was just trying to be nice.
15923,ELAINE,82, Have you ever heard of anyone doing anything like this?
15924,JERRY,82," Wait a second, he just did me a big favor."
15925,ELAINE,82, What?
15926,JERRY,82, (dialing) He got em out of the house.
15927,ELAINE,82, What?
15928,JERRY,82, Call Rachel.
15929,ELAINE,82, Oh.
15930,JERRY,82," (on the phone) ah no, I got the machine. Rachel! Are you there?! 
        I got the place to myself for a few hours! Rachel! Where are you? Rachel! 
        (hangs up the phone very disappointed) "
15931,ELAINE,82," (putting on lipstick) Sorry pal, wish I could help you out. "
15932,FRANK,82, They're not coming?
15933,GEORGE,82," No, they had plans."
15934,ESTELLE,82, How could they have plans?
15935,GEORGE,82, That's what I wanna know.
15936,FRANK,82," Well what difference does it make? They wouldn't lie to us, they're 
        are dear friends."
15937,ESTELLE,82, What am I supposed to do with all this Paella?
15938,GEORGE,82," They said tomorrow, maybe."
15939,FRANK,82, Maybe?
15940,ESTELLE,82, Maybe they don't like us.
15941,FRANK,82," Why wouldn't they like us? (tastes the Paella; disgusted) Again 
        with the pepper? What do you gotta use all the pepper for?"
15942,ESTELLE,82, Ah keep quiet.
15943,FRANK,82, What are you trying to set my mouth on fire?
15944,GEORGE,82, I don't know what the reason could be.
15945,JERRY,82," (disappointed) Oh, Hi, hi."
15946,AARON,82, Ah Jerry you would not believe the time we had.
15947,HELEN,82, Aaron is quite the tour guide.
15948,MORTY,82," Jerry have you ever seen any of those impressionist paintings? 
      "
15949,JERRY,82, Oh sure like Monet.
15950,MORTY,82," Don't you think he had to be uh near sighted? I mean nobody would 
        paint like that if they could see. It's all out of focus."
15951,JERRY,82," Well he's from the impressionist school, you know like Monet, 
        Manet, Tippi Tippi Dayday."
15952,MORTY,82, I say the guy was painting without his glasses.
15953,JERRY,82," (answering phone) Hello? Rachel, ya uh no they're back."
15954,HELEN,82," Jerry if you have something to do we could just sit right here 
        and read."
15955,JERRY,82," Uh haha ya well uh I'm sorry too I'll call you later, ok bye (hangs 
        phone up)"
15956,AARON,82, Well I should be going.
15957,HELEN,82, Oh thanks again.
15958,AARON & HELEN,82, Buh bye.
15959,AARON,82," Oh you must be Kramer (advances on Kramer to close to his face 
        Kramer walks back into the fridge to avoid him and falls to the ground) 
        I've heard about you. "
15960,KRAMER,82," You must be Aaron, I've heard about you."
15961,AARON,82, (Laughing) Well see you later.
15962,KRAMER,82, Yeah.
15963,AARON,82, (leaving) Bye
15964,JERRY,82, Bye
15965,KRAMER,82, So uh what are you guys doing for dinner?
15966,HELEN,82, We have no plans.
15967,MORTY,82," (noticing Kramer's coat) Look at that, Helen do you see what he's 
        wearing? That's the Executive."
15968,KRAMER,82, Now what is Executive?
15969,JERRY,82, The belt-less trench coat. My father invented it.
15970,MORTY,82," I sure did. Raincoats were my business. The Executive was a classic, 
        these haven't been made in twenty years."
15971,HELEN,82, Why would they? Nobody bought them then.
15972,MORTY,82, He's wearing one.
15973,KRAMER,82, Yea these are a hot item over at Rudy's.
15974,MORTY,82," You don't say? You know I have boxes of those sitting in my garage 
        in Florida?"
15975,KRAMER,82," Get 'em up here. You give me twenty-five percent I-I'll take 
        care of everything."
15976,MORTY,82, You gotta deal.
15977,KRAMER,82, Yaaaa.
15978,JERRY,82, This is like the meeting of Smith and Wesson.
15979,MORTY,82," I'll call Jack Klompus, he's got a key to the garage. He can send 
        them overnight delivery."
15980,HELEN,82," You're gonna first start shipping boxes? We're leaving for Paris 
        in three days."
15981,MORTY,82, He'll send them express.
15982,HELEN,82, You're crazy.
15983,MORTY,82," I'll tell you how crazy I am, I'm gonna pay for this whole trip 
        with these coats."
15984,JERRY,82, N-na I'm paying for the trip.
15985,MORTY,82, So much the better.
15986,GEORGE,82," Anyway it's kind of a fluke thing but uh I'll be leaving for 
        Paris in two days. I will send you a postcard when I get there."
15987,ALEC,82, Paris huh?
15988,GEORGE,82," Yea, ya..ya know I feel terrible about Joey but it's jus..it's 
        a great business opportunity. I-I don't even know how long I'm gonna be 
        away for."
15989,ALEC,82, Where will you stay?
15990,GEORGE,82," An apartment complex, the uh the Eiffel Towers. uumm Like I said 
        uh you'll be getting a postcard uh in a few days and again I'm sorry."
15991,ALEC,82," George, you have no idea how fantastic this is. "
15992,GEORGE,82, Fantastic?
15993,ALEC,82," Ya, we've been trying to reunite Joey with his father who lives 
        in Paris. But he's afraid to fly alone, you know he's kinda withdrawn, 
        but he seems to take to you. (George smiling in surprise) So it's a perfect 
        solution. "
15994,GEORGE,82, How gee what a coincidence.
15995,ALEC,82, And you'll send me a postcard.
15996,AARON,82," Helen really seemed to respond to Renoir. I think she really connected 

        to the way he painted children."
15997,ELAINE,82, Mm hmm.
15998,AARON,82," And that Morty, I'll tell ya that guy is full of life. (laughs) 
        He was convinced Monet was near sighted. I kept telling him"
15999,ELAINE,82, Aaron
16000,AARON,82, Yes?
16001,ELAINE,82," Uh, let me ask you a question. How come you asked Mr. and Mrs. 
        Seinfeld to go to the museum with you? "
16002,AARON,82," Well, they were in from out of town, I thought they would enjoy 
        it."
16003,ELAINE,82," Uhuh, um you didn't feel uncomfortable spending the whole day 
        at the museum with two complete strangers who were more than twice your 
        age?"
16004,AARON,82," No, it was fun."
16005,ELAINE,82, You had fun with Mr. and Mrs. Seinfeld.
16006,AARON,82," Yea, they bought me a coke."
16007,KRAMER,82, So how'd you come up with the idea for the belt-less trench coat?
16008,MORTY,82," I came home one night, and I tripped over one of Jerry's toys. 
        (Jerry smiling points to himself and nods with cards in his hands) So 
        I took out my belt just to threaten him, and I got a glimpse of myself 
        in the mirror."
16009,KRAMER,82, How serendipitous.
16010,MORTY,82, So that night I cut off the loops and the Executive was born.
16011,KRAMER,82, Mmm
16012,JERRY,82," He also came up with an idea for a brimless rain-hat but that 
        never materialized. (to Morty) Alright come on let's play."
16013,KRAMER,82, Did you call Jack Klompus yet?
16014,MORTY,82," I haven't been able to reach him. Hey I'll call him right now. 
      "
16015,JERRY,82, Ah come on.
16016,MORTY,82, Just a second. (Goes to grab the phone)
16017,HELEN,82, Jerry have you seen Schindler's List?
16018,JERRY,82, No I haven't seen it yet.
16019,HELEN,82, Oh you have to go you have to
16020,JERRY,82, I'm going
16021,HELEN,82, You have to
16022,JERRY,82, Ok
16023,MORTY,82, (on the phone) Hello Jack.
16024,JACK,82, Ya
16025,MORTY,82, It's Morty
16026,JACK,82, Who died?
16027,MORTY,82," Nobody died. Jack I want you to do me a big favor. (Jerry holding 
        up some cards looking at his father) In my garage there are a couple of 
        boxes."
16028,JACK,82, What boxes?
16029,MORTY,82, I'm gonna explain what boxes.
16030,JACK,82, Alright how the hell do I know?
16031,MORTY,82," Anyway there are these three big boxes, you can't miss them. I 
        want you to ship them here to New York for me."
16032,JACK,82, I thought you're going to Paris
16033,MORTY,82, I'm still going to Paris. I got a big deal cooking here.
16034,JACK,82, What's in the boxes?
16035,MORTY,82, Raincoats.
16036,JACK,82," Raincoats? (Doris sighs) You think you're gonna sell those old 
        crappy raincoats? That's garbage."
16037,HELEN,82, I guarantee you Doris is not letting him mail those boxes.
16038,JACK,82, When do you want these?
16039,MORTY,82, Send them tomorrow.
16040,ESTELLE,82, You think they're coming tonight?
16041,GEORGE,82, I dunno they said maybe.
16042,FRANK,82," Of course they're coming, they're leaving soon. If they don't 
        come tonight they might not see us."
16043,ESTELLE,82," Well they better come, I got all this Paella."
16044,FRANK,82," I admire Morty and Helen going to France. We should take a trip, 
        maybe a cruise. "
16045,GEORGE,82," Yes a cruise, a long cruise, just the two of you. "
16046,ESTELLE,82, Georgie what were you doing poking around the attic last night?
16047,GEORGE,82, I-I wasn't in the attic.
16048,ESTELLE,82, I heard noise.
16049,GEORGE,82, Maybe it was a mouse.
16050,FRANK,82, (jumping to his feet) OK that's it! We're moving! 
16051,GEORGE,82, What?
16052,FRANK,82, I will not tolerate infestation.
16053,GEORGE,82, You haven't even seen one.
16054,FRANK,82," Don't you understand the very thought, the very idea, I'll never 
        be comfortable again."
16055,Regulars,83,"
        Jerry Seinfeld ....................... Jerry Seinfeld
        Jason Alexander .................. George Costanza
        Julia Louis-Dreyfus ............. Elaine Benes
        Michael Richards ................. Cosmo Kramer"
16056,JERRY,83, You know their timing couldn't be worse.
16057,GEORGE,83, Is there ever a good time to have your parents stay with you?
16058,JERRY,83," You don't understand, I haven't been together with Rachel for 
        like three weeks. First I was on the road, then my parents show up, I'm 
        getting a little uh backed up. "
16059,GEORGE,83, When are they leaving for Paris?
16060,JERRY,83, Not for another three days.
16061,GEORGE,83, What about her place?
16062,JERRY,83, She lives with her parents.
16063,GEORGE,83," Really? (Jerry shakes his head) Maybe this will become like a 
        cool thing, living with your parents."
16064,JERRY,83," (sarcastically)Ya, then maybe baldness will catch on. This will 
        all be turning your way. "
16065,GEORGE,83," Hey believe me, baldness will catch on. When the aliens come, 
        who do you think they're gonna relate to? Who do you think is going to 
        be the first ones getting a tour of the ship?"
16066,JERRY,83, The baldies
16067,GEORGE,83," Hey by the way my parents really want to have your parents over 
        dinner before they leave town."
16068,JERRY,83," That's good, then I get the apartment for at least one night. 
        You know I'm paying for this whole Paris trip it's their anniversary present."
16069,ALEC,83, (walking over to Jerry and George's table) Hey guys.
16070,GEORGE,83, Hey Alec
16071,JERRY,83, Hey Alec
16072,ALEC,83, This is Joey. 
16073,GEORGE,83," Hey Joey, how you doin'?"
16074,ALEC,83," (Joey was about to talk) Hey listen, I was wondering if either 
        one of you guys would be interested in doing some work for the Big Brother 
        program? I'm kinda running the local chapter. What do you say George?"
16075,GEORGE,83, Well uh....
16076,JOEY,83," (interrupts) Wouldn't you like to be a big brother to someone like 
        me? Please?"
16077,GEORGE,83," Well, sure Joey, sure, I would be thrilled."
16078,ALEC,83," That's great George, thanks a lot I'll get in touch with you."
16079,JOEY,83, Wouldn't you like to be a big brother..
16080,ALEC,83," (grabs Joey to stop him) Ya alright Joey that's enough, let's go 
        (walking over to the counter) See ya."
16081,JERRY,83, What happened?
16082,GEORGE,83, What could I do? Did you see the mug on that kid?
16083,JERRY,83," (acting like Joey) Wouldn't you like to pass the ketchup to someone 
        like me? Please?"
16084,JERRY,83," Hey did you notice they moved where they do the interview on Jeopardy 
        now?"
16085,GEORGE,83," Ya it used to be right in the middle of single Jeopardy and now 
        they do it right after single Jeopardy."
16086,JERRY,83," Ya, it's much better isn't it?"
16087,GEORGE,83," Oh, n-no comparison."
16088,JERRY,83," Hey, I gotta stop off at the bookstore to pick up my parents one 
        of those French-English dictionaries."
16089,GEORGE,83, (stops Jerry realizing something) Hey hey hey hey hey hey.
16090,JERRY,83, What?
16091,GEORGE,83, Your parents are going to Paris right?
16092,JERRY,83, Yea?
16093,GEORGE,83," So I tell Alec that I have to goto Paris for an undetermined 
        amount of time. Then all I have to do is buy some post cards and have 
        your parents mail them from Paris."
16094,JERRY,83, What about little Joey?
16095,GEORGE,83, Who?
16096,JERRY,83," Ah, I think he's probably better off."
16097,GEORGE,83," I'm trying to get out of this Big Brother program. So when you 
        get to Paris (handing Morty the postcards) all you have to do is drop 
        'em in any mailbox. "
16098,MORTY,83, But there are no stamps on these.
16099,GEORGE,83," Well no not yet, you gotta buy french stamps (pauses) I-I'll 
        reimburse you of course. "
16100,HELEN,83, Why are you doing this?
16101,JERRY,83, He wants this guy to think he's in Paris. 
16102,HELEN,83, Why?
16103,JERRY,83, Because George is a deeply disturbed individual.
16104,KRAMER,83," Oh hey, Helen uh, Could I uh, use some more of your hand lotion?"
16105,HELEN,83, I told you it was good. (hands Kramer the lotion)
16106,KRAMER,83, (putting on the lotion) Ya
16107,HELEN,83, It's from the Sachs Fifth Avenue in Miami.
16108,KRAMER,83," Mmm (smelling the lotion as he rubs it in) I'm gonna remember 
        that if I'm ever in Florida."
16109,JERRY,83," Ya, or if you're ever on Fifth Avenue here in New York City, you 
        could get some there."
16110,KRAMER,83, Ya
16111,MORTY,83," Say those are some nice pants. I got a pair just like them at 
        home."
16112,KRAMER,83," Well uh that doesn't surprise me, ya i bought these at Rudy's. 
        It's a used clothing store. See when people like you die, the widows they 
        bring in their wardrobes, they make a bundle."
16113,GEORGE,83," Really? My father has a ton of old clothes just sitting up in 
        the attic, y-you think they're worth something?"
16114,KRAMER,83," Ya if they're vintage, and you're a widow."
16115,GEORGE,83," What happens if the husband dies after the wife, who brings in 
        the clothing in then?"
16116,KRAMER,83, Well I suppose the children do.
16117,GEORGE,83, (pondering) Yes I suppose they do.
16118,KRAMER,83," (takes another smell of his hands) Alright I gotta a ten o'clock, 
        I'll see everybody later."
16119,GEORGE,83," (grabbing his jacket) Hey oo, I just remembered uh my parents 
        really wanna have you guys over for dinner before you leave town. What 
        about tonight? "
16120,HELEN,83, Tonight?
16121,GEORGE,83, Yea they're making Payaya.
16122,HELEN,83," (looking at Morty) Uh oh I don't think we think we can make it 
        tonight, (turns toward George) we have plans."
16123,JERRY,83, (watching the whole conversation from his desk) What plans? 
16124,HELEN,83, (turns to Jerry) We have plans.
16125,JERRY,83, Where'd you get plans?
16126,HELEN,83, (annoyed) We have plans.
16127,GEORGE,83," Well um, what about tomorrow night?"
16128,HELEN,83, (turns back toward George) Maybe
16129,GEORGE,83," Ok uh, I guess I'll tell them that."
16130,MORTY,83, (to George as he is about to leave) Hey give 'em our best though.
16131,GEORGE,83, (quietly) Ya.
16132,JERRY,83, (walking over toward George and the door) I'll call you later.
16133,GEORGE,83, Ya.
16134,JERRY,83, So what plans do you have?
16135,MORTY,83, None
16136,JERRY,83, So how come you're not going over there for dinner?
16137,HELEN,83, Jerry we don't care much for the Costanzas'.
16138,MORTY,83, We can't stand them.
16139,JERRY,83, Really? Since when?
16140,HELEN,83, Since always. We've never liked them.
16141,JERRY,83, Why?
16142,HELEN,83," Well they're so loud, they're always fighting it's uncomfortable, 
        you never notice?"
16143,JERRY,83," No I notice but they're from your age group I didn't know you 
        could detect abnormal behavior among your own kind. "
16144,MORTY,83, Well we do.
16145,JERRY,83, Ya?
16146,ELAINE,83, It's us.
16147,JERRY,83," U-oh come on up. (buzzes them up) It's Elaine you don't have a 
        problem with her do you?"
16148,HELEN,83, We adore Elaine.
16149,JERRY,83," She wants to say hi, she's with her new boyfriend."
16150,HELEN,83, What's he like?
16151,JERRY,83," He's nice, bit of a close talker."
16152,HELEN,83, A what?
16153,JERRY,83," You'll see. (pause) Boy, I had no idea you felt this way about 
        the Costanzas'"
16154,HELEN,83, They're exhausting it's like being in an Asylum.
16155,EVERYONE,83, Hi.
16156,MORTY,83, Hello Elaine
16157,ELAINE,83, This is Aaron.
16158,HELEN,83, Hello Aaron
16159,MORTY,83, Hello.
16160,AARON,83, (getting up in Helen's face) So how long you folks in town?
16161,HELEN,83," Oh, three more days, three more days then we're off to Paris."
16162,AARON,83, Ah
16163,MORTY,83, We're going with a select charter group.
16164,AARON,83," I love France, (moving over to Morty's face) I was just there 
        last year. In fact, you know I still have an envelope full of French Franks, 
        I'll give 'em to ya."
16165,HELEN,83, We can't take money.
16166,AARON,83," Oh, no, it's a gift. (looking toward Elaine) from us."
16167,ELAINE,83," Oh, that is soo nice (very elaborate nice) Aaron. Isn't he nice? 
        (to Helen) So listen has Jerry been showin' you a good time?"
16168,JERRY,83, No I haven't.
16169,AARON,83," You know (to Morty) I have a friend who works at the Metropolitan 
        Museum of Art. How would you like a behind the scenes tour?"
16170,HELEN,83," (grabbing Aaron) Really, you could do that?"
16171,AARON,83, (up in Helen's face) Easily
16172,HELEN,83, I wouldn't be any trouble?
16173,AARON,83, (gets closer) Of course not.
16174,HELEN,83, When would we go?
16175,AARON,83, How about right now?
16176,MORTY,83, I'm ready
16177,HELEN,83, Are you sure?
16178,AARON,83, Yes.
16179,HELEN,83," Ok, let me get my coat."
16180,AARON,83," (walking over to Elaine and getting into her face) Elaine what 
        do you say?"
16181,ELAINE,83," W-well I don't think so Aaron, uh, I have plans."
16182,AARON,83, Oh. (getting into Jerry's face) How about you Jerry?
16183,JERRY,83, I'm swamped.
16184,AARON,83, You sure? You could examine the art work up close.
16185,JERRY,83, Maybe I'll try and catch up with you.
16186,ELAINE,83, (under her breath) Ya that'll happen)
16187,AARON,83, (Moving toward the door) Alright. We're off.
16188,MORTY,83," Ok, bye."
16189,HELEN & AARON,83, Bye.
16190,JERRY,83, Ok buh bye. Have a good time.
16191,ELAINE,83, Bye.
16192,AARON,83," See everybody later (Morty and Helen leave; Aaron closes the door 
        blowing Elaine a kiss)"
16193,JERRY,83, Ok.
16194,ELAINE,83, Why would he ask your parents to go to a museum?
16195,JERRY,83, I don't know.
16196,ELAINE,83, What is that?
16197,JERRY,83, Maybe he was just trying to be nice.
16198,ELAINE,83, Have you ever heard of anyone doing anything like this?
16199,JERRY,83," Wait a second, he just did me a big favor."
16200,ELAINE,83, What?
16201,JERRY,83, (dialing) He got em out of the house.
16202,ELAINE,83, What?
16203,JERRY,83, Call Rachel.
16204,ELAINE,83, Oh.
16205,JERRY,83," (on the phone) ah no, I got the machine. Rachel! Are you there?! 
        I got the place to myself for a few hours! Rachel! Where are you? Rachel! 
        (hangs up the phone very disappointed) "
16206,ELAINE,83," (putting on lipstick) Sorry pal, wish I could help you out. "
16207,FRANK,83, They're not coming?
16208,GEORGE,83," No, they had plans."
16209,ESTELLE,83, How could they have plans?
16210,GEORGE,83, That's what I wanna know.
16211,FRANK,83," Well what difference does it make? They wouldn't lie to us, they're 
        are dear friends."
16212,ESTELLE,83, What am I supposed to do with all this Paella?
16213,GEORGE,83," They said tomorrow, maybe."
16214,FRANK,83, Maybe?
16215,ESTELLE,83, Maybe they don't like us.
16216,FRANK,83," Why wouldn't they like us? (tastes the Paella; disgusted) Again 
        with the pepper? What do you gotta use all the pepper for?"
16217,ESTELLE,83, Ah keep quiet.
16218,FRANK,83, What are you trying to set my mouth on fire?
16219,GEORGE,83, I don't know what the reason could be.
16220,JERRY,83," (disappointed) Oh, Hi, hi."
16221,AARON,83, Ah Jerry you would not believe the time we had.
16222,HELEN,83, Aaron is quite the tour guide.
16223,MORTY,83," Jerry have you ever seen any of those impressionist paintings? 
      "
16224,JERRY,83, Oh sure like Monet.
16225,MORTY,83," Don't you think he had to be uh near sighted? I mean nobody would 
        paint like that if they could see. It's all out of focus."
16226,JERRY,83," Well he's from the impressionist school, you know like Monet, 
        Manet, Tippi Tippi Dayday."
16227,MORTY,83, I say the guy was painting without his glasses.
16228,JERRY,83," (answering phone) Hello? Rachel, ya uh no they're back."
16229,HELEN,83," Jerry if you have something to do we could just sit right here 
        and read."
16230,JERRY,83," Uh haha ya well uh I'm sorry too I'll call you later, ok bye (hangs 
        phone up)"
16231,AARON,83, Well I should be going.
16232,HELEN,83, Oh thanks again.
16233,AARON & HELEN,83, Buh bye.
16234,AARON,83," Oh you must be Kramer (advances on Kramer to close to his face 
        Kramer walks back into the fridge to avoid him and falls to the ground) 
        I've heard about you. "
16235,KRAMER,83," You must be Aaron, I've heard about you."
16236,AARON,83, (Laughing) Well see you later.
16237,KRAMER,83, Yeah.
16238,AARON,83, (leaving) Bye
16239,JERRY,83, Bye
16240,KRAMER,83, So uh what are you guys doing for dinner?
16241,HELEN,83, We have no plans.
16242,MORTY,83," (noticing Kramer's coat) Look at that, Helen do you see what he's 
        wearing? That's the Executive."
16243,KRAMER,83, Now what is Executive?
16244,JERRY,83, The belt-less trench coat. My father invented it.
16245,MORTY,83," I sure did. Raincoats were my business. The Executive was a classic, 
        these haven't been made in twenty years."
16246,HELEN,83, Why would they? Nobody bought them then.
16247,MORTY,83, He's wearing one.
16248,KRAMER,83, Yea these are a hot item over at Rudy's.
16249,MORTY,83," You don't say? You know I have boxes of those sitting in my garage 
        in Florida?"
16250,KRAMER,83," Get 'em up here. You give me twenty-five percent I-I'll take 
        care of everything."
16251,MORTY,83, You gotta deal.
16252,KRAMER,83, Yaaaa.
16253,JERRY,83, This is like the meeting of Smith and Wesson.
16254,MORTY,83," I'll call Jack Klompus, he's got a key to the garage. He can send 
        them overnight delivery."
16255,HELEN,83," You're gonna first start shipping boxes? We're leaving for Paris 
        in three days."
16256,MORTY,83, He'll send them express.
16257,HELEN,83, You're crazy.
16258,MORTY,83," I'll tell you how crazy I am, I'm gonna pay for this whole trip 
        with these coats."
16259,JERRY,83, N-na I'm paying for the trip.
16260,MORTY,83, So much the better.
16261,GEORGE,83," Anyway it's kind of a fluke thing but uh I'll be leaving for 
        Paris in two days. I will send you a postcard when I get there."
16262,ALEC,83, Paris huh?
16263,GEORGE,83," Yea, ya..ya know I feel terrible about Joey but it's jus..it's 
        a great business opportunity. I-I don't even know how long I'm gonna be 
        away for."
16264,ALEC,83, Where will you stay?
16265,GEORGE,83," An apartment complex, the uh the Eiffel Towers. uumm Like I said 
        uh you'll be getting a postcard uh in a few days and again I'm sorry."
16266,ALEC,83," George, you have no idea how fantastic this is. "
16267,GEORGE,83, Fantastic?
16268,ALEC,83," Ya, we've been trying to reunite Joey with his father who lives 
        in Paris. But he's afraid to fly alone, you know he's kinda withdrawn, 
        but he seems to take to you. (George smiling in surprise) So it's a perfect 
        solution. "
16269,GEORGE,83, How gee what a coincidence.
16270,ALEC,83, And you'll send me a postcard.
16271,AARON,83," Helen really seemed to respond to Renoir. I think she really connected 
        to the way he painted children."
16272,ELAINE,83, Mm hmm.
16273,AARON,83," And that Morty, I'll tell ya that guy is full of life. (laughs) 
        He was convinced Monet was near sighted. I kept telling him"
16274,ELAINE,83, Aaron
16275,AARON,83, Yes?
16276,ELAINE,83," Uh, let me ask you a question. How come you asked Mr. and Mrs. 
        Seinfeld to go to the museum with you? "
16277,AARON,83," Well, they were in from out of town, I thought they would enjoy 
        it."
16278,ELAINE,83," Uhuh, um you didn't feel uncomfortable spending the whole day 
        at the museum with two complete strangers who were more than twice your 
        age?"
16279,AARON,83," No, it was fun."
16280,ELAINE,83, You had fun with Mr. and Mrs. Seinfeld.
16281,AARON,83," Yea, they bought me a coke."
16282,KRAMER,83, So how'd you come up with the idea for the belt-less trench coat?
16283,MORTY,83," I came home one night, and I tripped over one of Jerry's toys. 
        (Jerry smiling points to himself and nods with cards in his hands) So 
        I took out my belt just to threaten him, and I got a glimpse of myself 
        in the mirror."
16284,KRAMER,83, How serendipitous.
16285,MORTY,83, So that night I cut off the loops and the Executive was born.
16286,KRAMER,83, Mmm
16287,JERRY,83," He also came up with an idea for a brimless rain-hat but that 
        never materialized. (to Morty) Alright come on let's play."
16288,KRAMER,83, Did you call Jack Klompus yet?
16289,MORTY,83," I haven't been able to reach him. Hey I'll call him right now. 
      "
16290,JERRY,83, Ah come on.
16291,MORTY,83, Just a second. (Goes to grab the phone)
16292,HELEN,83, Jerry have you seen Schindler's List?
16293,JERRY,83, No I haven't seen it yet.
16294,HELEN,83, Oh you have to go you have to
16295,JERRY,83, I'm going
16296,HELEN,83, You have to
16297,JERRY,83, Ok
16298,MORTY,83, (on the phone) Hello Jack.
16299,JACK,83, Ya
16300,MORTY,83, It's Morty
16301,JACK,83, Who died?
16302,MORTY,83," Nobody died. Jack I want you to do me a big favor. (Jerry holding 
        up some cards looking at his father) In my garage there are a couple of 
        boxes."
16303,JACK,83, What boxes?
16304,MORTY,83, I'm gonna explain what boxes.
16305,JACK,83, Alright how the hell do I know?
16306,MORTY,83," Anyway there are these three big boxes, you can't miss them. I 
        want you to ship them here to New York for me."
16307,JACK,83, I thought you're going to Paris
16308,MORTY,83, I'm still going to Paris. I got a big deal cooking here.
16309,JACK,83, What's in the boxes?
16310,MORTY,83, Raincoats.
16311,JACK,83," Raincoats? (Doris sighs) You think you're gonna sell those old 
        crappy raincoats? That's garbage."
16312,HELEN,83, I guarantee you Doris is not letting him mail those boxes.
16313,JACK,83, When do you want these?
16314,MORTY,83, Send them tomorrow.
16315,ESTELLE,83, You think they're coming tonight?
16316,GEORGE,83, I dunno they said maybe.
16317,FRANK,83," Of course they're coming, they're leaving soon. If they don't 
        come tonight they might not see us."
16318,ESTELLE,83," Well they better come, I got all this Paella."
16319,FRANK,83," I admire Morty and Helen going to France. We should take a trip, 
        maybe a cruise. "
16320,GEORGE,83," Yes a cruise, a long cruise, just the two of you. "
16321,ESTELLE,83, Georgie what were you doing poking around the attic last night?
16322,GEORGE,83, I-I wasn't in the attic.
16323,ESTELLE,83, I heard noise.
16324,GEORGE,83, Maybe it was a mouse.
16325,FRANK,83, (jumping to his feet) OK that's it! We're moving! 
16326,GEORGE,83, What?
16327,FRANK,83, I will not tolerate infestation.
16328,GEORGE,83, You haven't even seen one.
16329,FRANK,83," Don't you understand the very thought, the very idea, I'll never 
        be comfortable again."

16331,Jerry's stand-up,84," To me, the thing about birthday parties is that 
        the first birthday party you have and the last birthday party you have 
        are actually quite similar. You know, you just kinda sit there...you're 
        the least excited person at the party. You don't even really realize that 
        there is a party. You don't know what's goin' on. Both birthday parties, 
        people have to kinda help you blow out the candles, you can't do it...you 
        don't even know why you're doing it. What is this ritual? What is going 
        on? It's also the only two birthday parties where other people have to 
        gather your friends together for you. Sometimes they're not even 
        your friends. They make the judgement. They bring 'em in, they sit 'em 
        down, and they tell you - 'these are your friends! Tell them thank you 
        for coming to my birthday party.'"
16332,TOBY (exuberantly),84," These are great! Just great! Really great! Really, 
        really great! Don't you think so, Elaine?"
16333,ELAINE (put off by Toby's exuberance),84," Yeah, really great."
16334,TOBY,84," A coffee table book about coffee tables! <To Kramer> How 
        did you come up with this idea?"
16335,KRAMER,84, It was there!
16336,TOBY,84," Oh, look at this one! It's saying, 'I'm a coffee table, put some 
        coffee on me! Oh, the hotter the better, that's what I'm here for!' <laughs>"
16337,ELAINE,84," Actually, I've got some work I gotta do, so..."
16338,KRAMER,84," Hey, how about if the book came with these little fold-out legs...so 
        the book itself becomes a coffee table?"
16339,TOBY,84," Ohhh, that is a great idea! Really, really great!"
16340,ELAINE (imitating Toby),84," 'And that coffee table is saying, put some coffee 
        on me!' I'd like to put some coffee on her. Hot, scalding coffee - right 
        in her face! I swear! This is like working with a contestant from ""The 
        Price Is Right""! <demonstrates>"
16341,JERRY,84," Yeah, that's real interesting. Elaine, listen, tell me if you 
        think this is funny - <reads comedy he's written> ""Men definitely 
        hit the remote more than women...men don't care what's on TV, men only 
        care what else is on TV. Women want to see what the show is before 
        they change the channel, because men hunt and women nest."""
16342,ELAINE (uninterested),84," Yeah, it's funny, I dunno."
16343,JERRY,84," You don't know? Come on, that's gold!"
16344,ELAINE,84," Well, I don't know about ""gold."""
16345,JERRY,84," Oh, that's gold, baby."
16346,ELAINE,84," 'Baby'? What, are you doing George now?"
16347,JERRY,84, I was saying 'baby' way before George!
16348,ELAINE,84," Well, I don't know, don't ask me any more questions about jokes, 
        Jerry, it puts too much pressure on me."
16349,JERRY,84," Well, this guy Leonard Christian's gonna be there tomorrow night."
16350,ELAINE,84," Yeah, who's he?"
16351,JERRY,84," He's a writer from Entertainment Weekly. I would like to 
        have a good show."
16352,KRAMER,84," Danke schoen, my little dumplings."
16353,ELAINE,84, Hi.
16354,KRAMER (to Elaine),84," Hey, how about that Toby, huh?"
16355,ELAINE,84," Yeah, how about her?"
16356,KRAMER,84," Ooh, she's a package full of energy!"
16357,ELAINE,84," Yeah, she's a package full of something."
16358,KRAMER,84," And that something is life. Jerry, you gotta meet this gal - 
        she's brimmin' with positivity!"
16359,ELAINE (absolutely disgusted),84," Oh, pleeeeease. <moves to the living 
        room and sits down>"
16360,KRAMER (to Jerry),84," Hey, are you performing tomorrow night?"
16361,JERRY,84, Yeah.
16362,KRAMER,84," Great, I'm gonna bring Toby."
16363,JERRY,84," Well, you better laugh 'cause I'm being reviewed. Leonard Christian's 
        gonna be there."
16364,KRAMER,84," Oh, she's a great laugher - right, Elaine?"
16365,ELAINE,84," Oh yeah, she's a great laugher, Jerry. <imitates Toby> 
        Really, really great!"
16366,JERRY (to Kramer),84," Well, you want to sit with George? I think he's coming 
        with Robin. "
16367,KRAMER,84, Is that the waitress from the comedy club?
16368,JERRY,84, Yeah.
16369,ELAINE,84," What about her kid, is she bringing him, too?"
16370,KRAMER,84, She's got a kid?
16371,JERRY,84," Yeah, you should see George get along with this kid!"
16372,GEORGE,84," Ow! What are you doing under there? Hey, stop that! Don't eat 
        that! That's not food! <to Robin> He's suckin' down Equal packets!"
16373,ROBIN,84, Do you think 25 kids is too much?
16374,GEORGE,84," 25 kids for his birthday party? <to kid under table> Don't 
        put your tongue on the floor! He's putting his tongue on the floor! Here, 
        here, have some more sugar packets."
16375,ROBIN,84," So, what about entertainment? <to kid> Should I get Barney?"
16376,KID,84, No Barney!
16377,ROBIN (to George),84, Maybe a clown.
16378,GEORGE,84, How about Bozo?
16379,KID,84, Who's Bozo?
16380,GEORGE,84," Who's Bozo? Bozo the Clown, that's who Bozo is. When I was a 
        kid, Bozo the Clown was the clown, bar none. "
16381,ROBIN,84, George...
16382,GEORGE,84," With the orange hair, and the big clown shirt with the ruffles..."
16383,ROBIN,84, George...
16384,GEORGE,84, And the TV show! He had cartoons!
16385,ROBIN,84," George! Forget Bozo, George. Bozo's out. He's finished. It's over 
        for Bozo."
16386,GEORGE,84," You know, when I was a kid, we didn't have these elaborate birthday 
        parties with catered food and entertainment. I remember my 7th birthday 
        party..."
16387,"We see a flashback of George at seven, sitting in front of a birthday 
        cake with a shocked expression on his face, while Frank and Estelle scream

16388,FRANK,84," Blow out the candles! Blow out the candles, I said! Blow out 
        the damn candles!"
16389,ESTELLE,84," Stop it, Frank! You're killing him!"
16390,ROBIN,84," Well, this time, you can blow out the candles."
16391,GEORGE,84," Nah, I have asthma. <Robin's kid grabs George's leg from under 
        the table, and George struggles.>"
16392,TOBY,84, Hi!
16393,ELAINE (in a dreadful tone),84," Hi, Toby."
16394,TOBY,84, How are you doing today?
16395,ELAINE,84," Fine... <Toby sits and waits for Elaine to speak.> How 
        are you?"
16396,TOBY,84," Oh, I'm great! Just great. Really great! Oh, hey - did you hear 
        about Bob Rosen?"
16397,ELAINE,84, Nope.
16398,TOBY,84, He is going to Knopp. He is going to be a vice president.
16399,ELAINE,84," Knopp? Really? Boy. That means there's an opening here for senior 
        editor...has Lippman, uh, hired anyone?"
16400,TOBY,84, No. I hear he wants to promote someone in-house. 
16401,ELAINE,84, Really!
16402,TOBY,84, Maybe it'll be you!
16403,ELAINE,84, Oh...well...
16404,TOBY,84," You really deserve it. I mean, you have experience, seniority...Lippman 
        really respects your opinion..."
16405,ELAINE (beaming),84," Well! Well, it could be you."
16406,TOBY,84, No...
16407,ELAINE,84," No, really."
16408,TOBY (standing),84, Really? You think so?
16409,ELAINE (humoring her),84, Sure.
16410,TOBY,84," Boy, wouldn't that be exciting! "
16411,ELAINE,84," I mean, stranger things have happened..."
16412,TOBY,84, Wow! Me! A senior editor! <deadly serious> I'd like that.
16413,ELAINE,84," Well, you shouldn't get your hopes up, Toby."
16414,TOBY,84," Well, it's a possibility, like you said! Stranger things have happened! 
        Thank you, Elaine. Thank you. <Exits.>"
16415,JERRY,84," Hey, Ronnie. <To bartender> Can I have a club soda? <To 
        Ronnie> Goin' on tonight?"
16416,RONNIE,84, Yeah. You?
16417,JERRY,84, Yeah.
16418,RONNIE,84, You know Leonard Christian's here?
16419,JERRY,84," Yeah, I know."
16420,RONNIE,84, Can I ask you something? Are my nostrils getting bigger?
16421,JERRY,84, I don't...think so.
16422,RONNIE,84, Are you sure? Take a good look. They seem a little bigger?
16423,JERRY,84, I don't...I dunno.
16424,RONNIE,84, Is it possible for nostrils to expand? 
16425,JERRY,84," Oh, is this a bit?"
16426,RONNIE,84," Hey, I don't do ""bits."" I'm a prop comic. Dammit, I 
        can't find my water gun. I can't go on without my water gun."
16427,KRAMER,84," Hey, Jerry. Toby, this is Jerry."
16428,TOBY,84," This is so exciting! Look, I have goosebumps! <To Jerry> 
        Touch! Touch them! <Jerry touches her arm. Toby screeches with excitement.> 
        I've never been to a comedy club before!"
16429,JERRY,84," Really! You know, a lot of restaurants are serving brewed decaf 
        now, too."
16430,TOBY (laughing),84, You are so funny! 
16431,JERRY,84," Oh, you'll have a good time, I swear."
16432,TOBY,84," Oh! He swears like he thinks I don't believe him. I believe you. 
        I believe you! Oh, he's so funny! <laughs>"
16433,KRAMER,84, What about me?
16434,TOBY (serious),84," What about you? <laughs> I'm only kidding. You're 
        funny, too. I love to laugh."
16435,JERRY,84," Good, good."
16436,KRAMER (to Jerry),84," So, you up next?"
16437,JERRY,84," Yeah, why don't you guys get a table so you'll have good seats?"
16438,TOBY,84," Oh yeah, we don't want some jerk sitting in front of us, it'll 
        be like, 'Hey, big head, can you move out of the way? I didn't pay a cover 
        charge to stare at your bald spot.' <laughs>"
16439,KRAMER,84," Alright, so you have a good show, huh buddy?"
16440,JERRY,84, Yeah.
16441,TOBY,84," Oh, have a great show. Hey, we'll make sure it's a great show!"
16442,JERRY,84," O.k., good, I'll see you later. <Kramer and Toby are about 
        to exit. She turns around and clutches Kramer's jacket.>"
16443,TOBY,84," Oh, he's so great! This is so great! I'm so excited!"
16444,JERRY,84, Men definitely hit the remote button more than women...
16445,TOBY (loudly),84," Oh, really! Really! That is so true!"
16446,JERRY,84," Yes, yeah...see, men don't care what's on TV, men only care what 
        else is on TV."
16447,TOBY,84," Yes! Yes! Right on! Right on! <Other audience members give her 
        puzzled looks.>"
16448,JERRY (attempting to carry on despite Toby's interruptions),84," See...women 
        really want to see what the show is before they change the channel..."
16449,TOBY,84," Oh, that is so true, yes!"
16450,JERRY,84, ...that's why men hunt and women nest.
16451,TOBY,84," BOO! BOO! Hiss! Boo! <Toby's obnoxious behavior causes Jerry 
        to completely lose his place and mess up his act.>"
16452,JERRY,84," Hey, what's the deal? What was goin' on there? I invite you down 
        here, I have an important show, and she heckles me?!"
16453,KRAMER,84," Look, she didn't mean anything."
16454,JERRY,84," Well, what is the matter with her? Is she crazy?!"
16455,KRAMER,84," She's just being enthusiastic, that's all!"
16456,JERRY,84, Hey! What is wrong with you?!
16457,TOBY,84, Me? Nothing's wrong with me.
16458,JERRY,84," You boo me?! You hiss?! You didn't stop blathering throughout 
        the whole set!"
16459,TOBY,84," Oh, come on! I thought you're a pro! That's part of the show."
16460,JERRY,84," No! Not part of the show! Booing and hissing are not part of the 
        show! You boo puppets! You hiss villains in silent movies!"
16461,TOBY,84," Well, that's the way I express myself. How are you gonna make it 
        in this business if you can't take it?"
16462,JERRY,84," Oh, I can take it."
16463,TOBY (to Kramer),84, Let's go. <Ronnie walks by Jerry.>
16464,RONNIE,84," Hey, man. Good set."
16465,GEORGE,84, Bozo? 
16466,ERIC,84, No.
16467,GEORGE,84, B-O-Z-O? 
16468,ERIC,84," Sorry, I..."
16469,GEORGE,84, You've never heard of Bozo the Clown?
16470,ERIC,84, No!
16471,GEORGE,84, How could you not know who Bozo the Clown is?
16472,ERIC,84," I don't know, I just don't."
16473,GEORGE,84, How can you call yourself a clown and not know who Bozo is?
16474,ERIC,84," Hey, man - what are you hassling me for? This is just a gig, it's 
        not my life. I don't know who Bozo is, what - is he a clown?"
16475,GEORGE,84," Is he a clown? What, are you kidding me!?"
16476,ERIC,84," Well, what is he?"
16477,GEORGE,84," Yes, he's a clown!"
16478,ERIC,84," Alright, so what's the big deal! There's millions of clowns!"
16479,GEORGE,84," Alright, just forget it."
16480,ERIC,84," Me forget it? You should forget it! You're livin' in the past, 
        man! You're hung up on some clown from the sixties, man!"
16481,GEORGE,84," Alright, very good, very good...go fold your little balloon animals, 
        Eric. Eric! What kind of name is that for a clown, huh?"
16482,ROBIN'S MOTHER,84," Excuse me...you must be George! I'm Robin's mother. Oh, 
        you seem like such a lovely young man!"
16483,GEORGE,84," Well, I do what I can. <Robin comes over.>"
16484,ROBIN,84," Hi Mom, how's everything?"
16485,ROBIN'S MOTHER,84," Oh, this is just a wonderful party!"
16486,ROBIN,84, The burgers should be ready in a minute.
16487,GEORGE,84," Ah, great, great. <sniffs> What's that smell? Smoke? <walks 
        to the kitchen> Hey everybody, I think I smell some smoke back here...<smoke 
        boils into the doorway.> FIRE! FIRE! Get out of the way!"
16488,GEORGE (to the EMTs),84," It was an inferno in there! An inferno! <Eric, 
        Robin's mother, and all the kids rush at George.>"
16489,ERIC,84," There he is! That's him! <Tries to clobber George with his big 
        shoe.>"
16490,ROBIN'S MOTHER,84, That's the coward that left us to die!
16491,GEORGE (voice is hoarse from screaming),84," I...was trying to lead the way. 
        We needed a leader! Someone to lead the way to safety. "
16492,ROBIN,84," But you yelled ""get out of my way""!"
16493,GEORGE,84," Because! Because, as the leader...if I die...then all hope is 
        lost! Who would lead? The clown? Instead of castigating me, you should 
        all be thanking me. What kind of a topsy-turvy world do we live in, where 
        heroes are cast as villains? Brave men as cowards?"
16494,ROBIN,84," But I saw you push the women and children out of the way in a 
        mad panic! I saw you knock them down! And when you ran out, you left everyone 
        behind!"
16495,GEORGE,84," Seemingly. Seemingly, to the untrained eye, I can fully understand 
        how you got that impression. What looked like pushing...what looked like 
        knocking down...was a safety precaution! In a fire, you stay close to 
        the ground, am I right? And when I ran out that door, I was not leaving 
        anyone behind! Oh, quite the contrary! I risked my life making sure that 
        exit was clear. Any other questions?"
16496,FIREMAN,84, How do you live with yourself?
16497,GEORGE,84, Its not easy.
16498,GEORGE,84, So she doesn't want to see me anymore.
16499,JERRY,84," Did you knock her over too, or just the kids?"
16500,GEORGE,84," No, her too. And her mother."
16501,JERRY,84, Really? Her mother.
16502,GEORGE,84," Yeah. I may have stepped on her arm, too, I don't know."
16503,JERRY,84, You probably couldn't see because of the smoke.
16504,GEORGE,84, Yeah. But it was somebody's arm.
16505,JERRY,84," So you feel ""women and children first,"" in this day 
        and age, is somewhat of an antiquated notion."
16506,GEORGE,84, To some degree.
16507,JERRY,84," So basically, it's every man, woman, child, and invalid for themselves."
16508,GEORGE,84, In a manner of speaking.
16509,JERRY,84," Well, it's honest."
16510,GEORGE,84," Yeah. She should be commending me for treating everyone like 
        equals."
16511,JERRY,84," Well, perhaps when she's released from the burn center, she'll 
        see things differently."
16512,GEORGE,84, Perhaps.
16513,JERRY,84," So, what was the fire? Just a couple of greasy hamburgers?"
16514,GEORGE,84, Yeah. Eric the Clown put it out with his big shoe.
16515,JERRY,84," By the way, did you see this? <Hands George a magazine>"
16516,GEORGE,84, What's that?
16517,JERRY,84," It's the Leonard Christian article about my show. Plus my gig 
        in Miami got cancelled, I betcha it's because of the article."
16518,GEORGE,84," Wow, he really does a number on you. <reads> ""Seinfeld 
        froze like a deer in the headlights in the face of incessant heckling."""
16519,JERRY,84, I should have let her have it! I held back because of Kramer.
16520,GEORGE,84," You know what you oughta do. You should go to her office and 
        heckle her. "
16521,JERRY,84," Yeah, right."
16522,GEORGE,84," You know, like all the comedians always say, 'How would you like 
        it if I came to where you work and heckled you?'"
16523,JERRY,84," Yeah, that'd be something."
16524,GEORGE,84," I'm not kidding, you should do it."
16525,JERRY,84," But wouldn't that be the ultimate comedian's revenge? I've always 
        had a fantasy about doing that."
16526,GEORGE,84," Well, go ahead! Do it!"
16527,JERRY,84, Why can't I?
16528,GEORGE,84, No reason!
16529,JERRY,84," You know what? I think I'm gonna do that! She came down to where 
        I work, I'll go down to where she works!"
16530,GEORGE,84, This is unprecedented!
16531,JERRY,84," There's no precedent, baby!"
16532,GEORGE,84, What...are you using my babies now?
16533,JERRY,84," Hey, nice shoes. What, you wear sandals to work? It's always nice 
        to walk into a room and get the aroma of feet. That's real conducive to 
        the work atmosphere. I'm sure your co-workers really appreciate it. 'Hey, 
        let's go eat in Toby's office. Great idea! We can check on her bunions!'"
16534,TOBY,84," You know, I have work to do here! I'm very busy!"
16535,JERRY,84," Oh, is this disruptive? You find it hard to work with someone...interrupting?"
16536,TOBY,84," Well, how would you like it if I called security?"
16537,JERRY,84," Security? Well, I don't know how you're gonna make it in this 
        business if you can't take it! Ya gotta be tough! Booo! Boooo!"
16538,KRAMER,84," Wait a second, what's happenin' here? Toby! Toby!"
16539,KRAMER,84, What did you go up there to heckle her for?
16540,JERRY,84," Because she came down to the club and heckled me! Give her a taste 
        of her own medicine! <George enters.>"
16541,KRAMER,84," Oh, YEAH! You gave her a taste of medicine, alright."
16542,JERRY,84," Well, I didn't want her to have an accident."
16543,GEORGE,84, What accident?
16544,KRAMER,84," Well, after he heckled Toby, she got so upset, she ran out of 
        the building and a street sweeper ran over her foot and severed her pinky 
        toe."
16545,GEORGE,84, That's unbelievable!
16546,KRAMER,84," Yeah! Then after the ambulance left, I found the toe! So I put 
        it in a Cracker Jack box, filled it with ice, and took off for the hospital."
16547,GEORGE,84, You ran?
16548,KRAMER,84," No, I jumped on the bus. I told the driver, ""I got a toe 
        here, buddy - step on it."""
16549,GEORGE,84, Holy cow!
16550,KRAMER,84," Yeah, yeah, then all of a sudden, this guy pulls out a gun. Well, 
        I knew any delay is gonna cost her her pinky toe, so I got out of the 
        seat and I started walking towards him. He says, ""Where do you think 
        you're going, Cracker Jack?"" I said, ""Well, I got a little prize 
        for ya, buddy - "" <Kramer throws two quick punches and a massive 
        uppercut> - knocked him out cold!"
16551,GEORGE,84, How could you do that?!
16552,KRAMER,84," Then everybody is screamin,' because the driver, he's passed 
        out from all the commotion...the bus is out of control! So, I grab him 
        by the collar, I take him out of the seat, I get behind the wheel and 
        now I'm drivin' the bus."
16553,GEORGE,84, You're Batman.
16554,KRAMER,84," Yeah. Yeah, I am Batman. Then the mugger, he comes to, and he 
        starts chokin' me! So I'm fightin' him off with one hand and I kept drivin' 
        the bus with the other, y'know? Then I managed to open up the door, and 
        I kicked him out the door with my foot, you know - at the next stop."
16555,JERRY,84, You kept makin' all the stops?
16556,KRAMER,84," Well, people kept ringin' the bell!"
16557,GEORGE,84," Well, what about the toe? What happened to the toe?"
16558,KRAMER,84," Well! I am happy to say that the little guy is back in place 
        at the end of the line."
16559,GEORGE,84, You did all this...for a pinky toe?
16560,KRAMER,84," Well, it's a valuable appendage."
16561,JOANNE,84," So, Kramer found the toe, and they re-attached it."
16562,ELAINE,84, Really.
16563,JOANNE,84, Poor kid. What an ordeal.
16564,MICHAEL,84," And you know how extremely sensitive she is...she's gonna need 
        our full support."
16565,ELAINE (wearily),84," Yeah, right."
16566,OTHER CO-WORKERS IN HALLWAY,84," Look who's here! Toby! <Toby enters on 
        crutches.>"
16567,MICHAEL,84," Toby, what can I do? Can I get you something?"
16568,TOBY,84," Oh no, I'll be fine..."
16569,JERRY,84, She got the promotion?
16570,ELAINE (standing in the doorway),84, Yep.
16571,JERRY,84, Why?
16572,ELAINE,84," I'll tell ya why. Because of her pinky toe, that's why. Because 
        Lippman felt so sorry for her, he didn't want to hurt her feelings."
16573,JERRY,84, Too bad.
16574,ELAINE,84," Sure, the pinky toe is cute! But, I mean, what is it? It's useless! 
        It does nothing. It's got that little nail that is just impossible to 
        cut. What do we need it for?"
16575,JERRY,84," Because Elaine, that's the one that goes 'wee-wee-wee all the 
        home.'"
16576,ELAINE,84, Why don't you just shut the f-
16577,KRAMER (from his doorway),84," Hey Elaine, did you hear the good news? Toby 
        got promoted!"
16578,ELAINE,84," Yes, I heard, Kramer - I work there, remember??"
16579,KRAMER,84," Yeah, and you know what she told me? She said her first order 
        of business is to put my coffee table book into the bookstores as soon 
        as possible."
16580,ELAINE,84," Oh, wonderful!"
16581,KRAMER,84," You know, throughout this whole thing, she always kept a smile 
        on her face."
16582,ELAINE,84," Oh, of course! She's deranged."
16583,JERRY,84," So, I went down to the magazine, I pleaded with him to come and 
        see me again, finally he agreed to come down tonight, and he's going to 
        write another article."
16584,RONNIE,84, I heard you went down to somebody's office and heckled them?
16585,JERRY,84, Damn right! We've been lapdogs long enough!
16586,RONNIE,84," How could you do that? I mean, everybody's talking about it."
16587,JERRY,84," Well, it's about time one of us drew a line in the sand."
16588,RONNIE,84," Jerry, you're like Rosa Parks. You opened the door for all of 
        us. I can't wait till the next time someone heckles me."
16589,JERRY,84," Yeah, well, won't be long."
16590,ANNOUNCER,84," Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome Jerry Seinfeld!"
16591,JERRY,84, Gotta go. <heads out on stage>
16592,GEORGE,84, Robin? Robin!
16593,ROBIN,84," George, what is it? I'm working."
16594,GEORGE,84," Robin, listen to me. The most amazing thing has happened. Kramer 
        has opened my eyes. I think I've changed. "
16595,ROBIN,84, What are you talking about?
16596,GEORGE,84, O.k....<is about to explain. Cut to Jerry on-stage.>
16597,JERRY,84," I mean, Bozo the Clown...does he really need ""the clown"" 
        in his title, as clown? Bozo, ""the"" clown? Are we going to confuse 
        him with Bozo the district attorney? Bozo the pope? There's no other Bozo..."
16598,GEORGE,84," ...you'll see, things will be different now - if you just give 
        me one more chance. "
16599,ROBIN,84, Listen...I gotta think about this. <walks away.>
16600,GEORGE,84," Alright, but I'm serious about this."
16601,RONNIE (points his water gun at the bartender),84," Alright, hand it over 
        man!"
16602,JERRY,84, ...that's why men hunt and women nest.
16603,GEORGE (from backstage),84," He's got a gun! He's got a gun! <Tries to 
        flee the bar in a mad panic. The audience in the club also goes nuts and 
        heads for the exits. Jerry stands onstage, perplexed.>"
16604,ROBIN,84, George! This is Ronnie Kaye!
16605,GEORGE,84," The prop comic? <Ronnie holds up his water gun and smiles.> 
        Oh, hi...I didn't recognize you, what...did you get a haircut?"
16606,RONNIE (points to his nose),84, Nostrils.
16607,JERRY,84, George - could I have a word?
16608,Jerry's stand-up #2,84," I was in a hotel the other day, and on the 
        back of the door in the hotel they have the fire map. I'm flattered that 
        they think I have it together enough to stand in a burning hotel room 
        memorizing directions. 'Yeah, I'll go left by the stairs, right by the 
        candy machine...' I'd probably get lost, have to go back to the room, 
        check the map again...and they always tell you, no matter what, whatever 
        you do in a hotel fire - do not panic. Hey, I got four minutes to live, 
        I've never panicked in my whole life - it's my option. Even if they find 
        you, you have a perfect excuse...'Gee, I heard they saved you swingin' 
        from the shower curtain naked with an ice bucket on your head. What happened 
        there?' 'Well, I panicked.' 'That's understandable.'"

16610,Opening Monologue,85, Look at the work people do to get to the ocean.
16611,Kramer,85," All right, get off at the next exit."
16612,Jerry,85," Kramer, I've driven to the Hamptons many times, I know the 
              exit."
16613,Kramer,85," It's a great house, pool's something? Yeah, I'll be there."
16614,Jerry,85, (To Elaine) You sure we're makin' the right move?
16615,Elaine,85," We gotta see the new baby anyway, at least we'll get a 
              weekend in"
16616,Jerry,85, Didn't they just have a baby?

              to visit"
16619,Kramer,85," Hey Jerry, you ever wear silk underwear?"
16620,Jerry,85, No.
16621,Kramer,85, Put that on the top of your list.
16622,Jerry,85," No, not for me. A little too delightful. Well, George and 
              Jane"
16623,Elaine,85," Oh, isn't that weird that George and Jane haven't had sex 
              yet, but"
16624,Jerry,85," I know, George is pretty pleased about it. It's like she 
              signed a"
16625,Elaine,85, When's Rachel comin' out?
16626,Jerry,85, She's makin' the three o'clock train.
16627,Elaine,85," Her father is so religious, I'm just amazed that he's letting 
              you"
16628,Jerry,85, I bought him some kishka.
16629,Kramer,85, What's that?
16630,Jerry,85," It's kind of a stuffed meat thing. Israeli soldiers carry 
              it. In"
16631,George,85, I never tasted a cough medicine I didn't love.
16632,Jane,85, Me too. I love cough medicine.
16633,George,85," You see? We were made for each other. (Thinking to himself) 
              It's"
16634,Jane,85, What's your favorite?
16635,George,85, Pertussin. Ever try it with club soda?
16636,Jane,85, No.
16637,George,85," Oh, very refreshing. (Thinking again) Sex is like joining 
              a"
16638,Jane,85, Are we almost there?
16639,George,85," Yeah, about ten, fifteen minutes. But I have to stop at 
              a"
16640,Jane,85, What for?
16641,George,85," My mother loves Hampton tomatoes. She's nuts for Hampton 
              tomatoes."
16642,Jane,85, Can you buy 'em later? I really wanna get some... sun.
16643,Kramer,85, Hey Jerry. Rub some lotion on my back.
16644,Jerry,85," Who are you, Mrs. Robinson?"
16645,Kramer,85," Come on, I'll rub some on yours."
16646,Jerry,85," No, that's no sweet'ning the deal. No."
16647,George,85," (To Jane) You know, when I was a kid, I once found a dollar 
              and"
16648,Jane,85, (No feeling in her voice) You must've been excited.
16649,George,85," Yeah. Hey, you know, I gotta go get these tomatoes. You 
              wanna go"
16650,Jane,85, I don't think so.
16651,George,85," 'Kay. I'll uh, I'll see you later. Anybody want some tomatoes?"
16652,Jerry,85, No thanks.
16653,Kramer,85, No. (George leaves for the tomatoes)
16654,Jane,85," I'm gonna take a dip. (She leaves for beach, Elaine enters"
16655,Jerry,85, And then there's Maude. (She sits down next to Jerry)
16656,Elaine,85," Look at my face, look at it. You see any lines?"
16657,Jerry,85, No lines.
16658,Jerry,85," So when're we gonna see this baby? When is the momentous 
              event?"
16659,Elaine,85, I don't know. They're takin' a nap or something.
16660,Kramer,85," I'm gonna go see if there are any girls on the beach. Elaine, 
              you"
16661,Elaine,85, (Sarcastic) No thanks. I got plenty of girlfriends.
16662,Jerry,85, (Looking toward beach) Oh this is interesting.
16663,Elaine,85, What?
16664,Jerry,85, Jane's topless. (They all look)
16665,Kramer,85, Yo yo ma.
16666,Jerry,85, Boutros Boutros-Ghali.
16667,Elaine,85, Nice rack. (Carol and Michael inside open back door)
16668,Carol,85," Come on, you guys. You can come on and see the bay-bee!"
16669,Jerry,85," Oh, in a minute, Carol."
16670,Kramer,85, We're gonna be right there.
16671,Jerry,85, This is weird wild stuff. George hasn't even seen her yet.
16672,Elaine,85, Why do you think we're getting the sneak preview?
16673,Kramer,85, Maybe she's trying to create a buzz.
16674,Elaine,85, What?
16675,Kramer,85," You know, get some good word of mouth goin'."
16676,Jerry,85," Oh, here she comes. (They pretend to not have watched as 
              Jane"
16677,Jane,85, I'm thirsty. Anyone want a drink?
16678,Jerry,85, No thanks.
16679,Elaine,85, I'm good.
16680,Kramer,85," Deh-deh-deh-deh- (Jane exits) All right, show's over. I'm 
              goin'"
16681,Carol,85," Adam (the baby's name), Jerry and Elaine are here."
16682,Elaine,85," Oh, he's a cute little shnugly baby."
16683,Carol,85," Isn't he gorgeous? (Elaine looks at baby, only to be frightened"
16684,Elaine,85, Ugghh.
16685,Carol,85, Is she gorgeous? (Elaine + Jerry looking away)
16686,Elaine,85," Oh, gorgeous, yes."
16687,Jerry,85, So very gorgeous.
16688,Carol,85," Michael, shut the door! You're letting bugs in."
16689,Jerry,85, Is it me or was that the ugliest baby you have ever seen?
16690,Elaine,85," Uh, I couldn't look. It was like the Pekinese."
16691,Jerry,85," Boy, a little too much chlorine in that gene pool. (They 
              sit)"
16692,Elaine,85," Oh, you have to lie."
16693,Jerry,85, It's a must lie situation.
16694,Elaine,85," Yes, it's a must lie situation."
16695,Jerry,85," You know, I don't think we should tell George we saw Jane 
              topless."
16696,Elaine,85," No, I don't think so."
16697,Jerry,85," You know, we might want to tell Kramer."
16698,Ben,85, Oh this ointment should do it.
16699,Carol,85," How are you feeling, Adam? (She sees Elaine in the hall) 
              Elaine!"
16700,Elaine,85, Hi.
16701,Carol,85," Look at him, Elaine. How gorgeous is he? I ask you, how 
              gorgeous?"
16702,Elaine,85, (Looking at Ben) Pretty gorgeous.
16703,Ben,85," Elaine, you have children?"
16704,Elaine,85," Me? Oh no, but I'd love to have a baby, I mean, I can't 
              wait to"
16705,Ben,85, A beautiful woman like you should. You're quite
16706,Elaine,85, Breathtaking? I'm breathtaking?
16707,Carol,85," And he's very particular. Ben, you're staying tonight, right?"
16708,Ben,85, Sure. (Elaine celebrates to herself as Jerry enters and
16709,Jerry,85," Ah, I'm gonna go pick up Rachel at the station."
16710,Elaine,85," Yeah, see ya."
16711,Jerry,85, Okay. (He leaves)
16712,Carol,85," Oh, just look at him!"
16713,Ben,85," Yeah, he really is breathtaking. (Elaine confused by his"
16714,Rachel,85," Train was so crowded. I had to sit in the seat facing the 
              wrong"
16715,Jerry,85, Oh I like that. It's like going back in time. (George comes
16716,George,85, Hey Rachel!
16717,Rachel,85," (Quickly gets out of seat) Hi. I'm gonna go in there to 
              change."
16718,George,85, What kind of a greeting was that?
16719,Jerry,85, She's got greeting problems.
16720,George,85," Yeah. I love Hampton tomatoes. You know, you can eat 'em 
              like"
16721,Jerry,85," Well, the tomato's an anomaly. So successful with the ketchup"
16722,Kramer,85," Hey, hey, hey! Look at what I got!"
16723,George,85," Hey! Wow, the K-Man! (They walk into the kitchen inside)"
16724,Jerry,85, You got lobster for everybody?
16725,Kramer,85," Yeah, and they're fresh! Right out of the ocean."
16726,George,85," This is fantastic. Man, what a weekend. Swimming, lobster 
              for"
16727,Kramer,85," I know, it's great. And I saw Jane topless. (Jerry shows 
              that"
16728,George,85," You saw who, what?"
16729,Kramer,85," Yeah, I saw Jane topless. Well, we all saw her."
16730,Jerry,85, (Jerry realizes the situation is hopeless) All right.
16731,George,85, You saw Jane topless?
16732,Jerry,85," Well, when you went for the tomatoes she lied out topless."
16733,George,85, Oh you mean face down on her chest.
16734,Jerry,85, No.
16735,George,85, Face up on her back?
16736,Jerry,85, Yeah.
16737,George,85, Well why'd she do that?
16738,Kramer,85, I guess she was hot.
16739,George,85, You mean she just laid there topless?
16740,Kramer,85," No, no, she got up, walked around..."
16741,George,85, Walked around? And you looked?
16742,Kramer,85," Of course. She's got a great body, buddy. All right, I'm 
              gonna go"
16743,George,85," I can't believe it, you saw her before me."
16744,Jerry,85, Think of me as a doctor. (They go outside again)
16745,George,85," Well, how good a look did you get?"
16746,Jerry,85, Well what'd you mean?
16747,George,85," Well, if she was a criminal and you had to describe her 
              to a police"
16748,Jerry,85, They'd pick her up in about ten minutes.
16749,George,85," Great, great. So anytime you want you can just visualize 
              her"
16750,Jerry,85, I guess that's true...
16751,George,85," Stop it, stop it! It's not fair. It's not fair. I don't 
              like"
16752,Jerry,85, What do you want me to do? You wanna see Rachel naked?
16753,George,85," Yes, yes! The punishment should fit the crime."
16754,Jerry,85, You can see me naked. I can offer you that.
16755,George,85," It's like I'm Neil Armstrong. I turn around for a sip of 
              Tang and"
16756,Elaine,85, Nobody ever called me breathtaking before.
16757,Jerry,85, I've never been called breathtaking either.
16758,Elaine,85," I mean, if he thinks that that baby's breathtaking, then 
              who's not"
16759,Jerry,85, Maybe he just said it because the mother was in the room.
16760,Elaine,85," Yeah, right, that's a possibility. I have to find out."
16761,Jerry,85, How are you gonna do that?
16762,Elaine,85, I can be very clever.
16763,Rachel,85, I'm gonna take a swim.
16764,Elaine,85," Oh, me too. I'll meet you down. (She goes in the hall and 
              sees"
16765,George,85," Oh, okay. (Starts to walk other way and then walks to their 
              room"
16766,Rachel,85, Hey!
16767,George,85," Oh, sorry."
16768,Rachel,85, Don't you knock?
16769,George,85," I'm sorry, uh, it's not like I'm gonna see something I've 
              never"
16770,Jerry,85, You might have.
16771,George,85, I didn't.
16772,Jerry,85, You won't.
16773,Rachel,85," What'd you want anyway, George?"
16774,Jerry,85," Yes, George. I'm kind of wondering myself. What is it what 
              you"
16775,George,85," No, I was just wondering... if you guys, uh, had any gum."
16776,Jerry,85," Oh! So you were swimming in the pool, and you wanted some 
              gum."
16777,George,85," Yes, because the water was cold... and the chewing warms 
              me up."
16778,Rachel,85, We don't have any gum.
16779,George,85," Okay. (Chewing) Thanks anyway. (Continues to chew as he 
              exits)"
16780,Rachel,85, Strange man.
16781,Jerry,85, Wait'll you get to know him.
16782,Rachel,85," So where is this baby, anyway?"
16783,Jerry,85," Oh, check it out. I guarantee you've never seen anything 
              quite so"
16784,Rachel,85," (She screams) Oh my God! I'm sorry, I thought this was 
              the baby's"
16785,George,85, I was in the pool! I was in the pool!
16786,George,85, Did she do it on purpose?
16787,Jerry,85," It was my fault, I told her the wrong door."
16788,George,85, I was supposed to see her. She wasn't supposed to see me.
16789,Jerry,85, So what?
16790,George,85, Well ordinarily I wouldn't mind. But...
16791,Jerry,85, But...
16792,George,85," Well I just got back from swimming in the pool. And the 
              water was"
16793,Jerry,85, Oh... You mean... shrinkage.
16794,George,85, Yes. Significant shrinkage!
16795,Jerry,85, So you feel you were short changed.
16796,George,85," Yes! I mean, if she thinks that's me she's under a complete"
16797,Jerry,85," Well, so what's the difference?"
16798,George,85, What if she discusses it with Jane?
16799,Jerry,85," Oh, she's not gonna tell Jane."
16800,George,85, How do you know?
16801,Jerry,85, Women aren't like us.
16802,George,85," They're worse! They're much worse than us, they talk about"
16803,Jerry,85," No, I'm not gonna tell her about your shrinkage. Besides, 
              I think"
16804,George,85," How do women know about shrinkage? (They see Elaine walking 
              down"
16805,Elaine,85," What do you mean, like laundry?"
16806,George,85, No.
16807,Jerry,85, Like when a man goes swimming... afterwards...
16808,Elaine,85, It shrinks?
16809,Jerry,85, Like a frightened turtle!
16810,Elaine,85, Why does it shrink?
16811,George,85, It just does.
16812,Elaine,85, I don't know how you guys walk around with those things.
16813,Michael,85," Thanks for the lobster, Kramer."
16814,Kramer,85," Rachel, aren't you gonna have any?"
16815,Rachel,85," Oh, no, I can't. I'm kosher, we don't eat shellfish."
16816,Kramer,85, You mean you've never tasted lobster?
16817,Rachel,85, No.
16818,Kramer,85," Wow. You're so pious. I really respect that. You know when 
              you"
16819,Carol,85," Oh, the baby's crying. I'll go get him. He can sit with 
              us."
16820,Elaine + Jerry,85, No!
16821,Jerry,85," No, you don't wanna do that. You'll be uncomfortable."
16822,Elaine,85," Yeah, finish eating. The baby's not gonna have any fun 
              over here."
16823,Jerry,85," Yeah, the lobster'll scare him."
16824,Carol,85, I'm gonna get him.
16825,George,85," See, look at this. Rachel, my T-shirt shrunk. It used to 
              be much"
16826,Elaine,85," Really? Tell us more, Mr. Science. (Rachel whispers in 
              Jane's"
16827,George,85," What're you doing? What're you, telling secrets? What're 
              you"
16828,Jane,85," It's nothing, George."
16829,George,85," You know, it's very impolite to tell secrets. Are you talking"
16830,Jane,85, What is it with you?
16831,Jerry,85, (To George) Easy big fella.
16832,Michael,85," So Kramer, where'd you get all these lobster, at the"
16833,Kramer,85," No, I got 'em in the ocean."
16834,Michael,85, The ocean? What'd you mean?
16835,Kramer,85," Well, I found this rope and I kept tugging on it, and all 
              these"
16836,Michael,85, Those are commercial lobster traps. You can't take those
16837,Kramer,85, Take it easy. There's plenty of lobsters in the ocean for
16838,Michael,85, My father was a lobsterman. He got up every morning at
16839,Carol,85, (Entering with baby) Here he is.
16840,Kramer,85, Ahhh! (Falls to floor as he sees the baby)
16841,Elaine,85," Some night, huh?"
16842,Ben,85," Yeah, I wish I had my telescope."
16843,Elaine,85," Some dinner, huh?"
16844,Ben,85, Nothing like fresh caught lobster.
16845,Elaine,85," Some house, huh?"
16846,Ben,85, It was built by Mark Farman.
16847,Elaine,85," Some ugly baby, huh?"
16848,Ben,85, What did you say?
16849,Elaine,85," I said, uh, some snuggly baby."
16850,Ben,85, He is something.
16851,Elaine,85," Well, to tell you the truth, Dr. Feffa, I , I was surprised 
              to hear"
16852,Ben,85," Well, you know Elaine, sometimes you say things just to be"
16853,Jerry,85, You told her?
16854,Rachel,85," Yeah, what's the big deal?"
16855,Jerry,85," You don't understand. This organ, it's very... schizophrenic."
16856,Rachel,85," Jerry, what the difference? You know, you're the ones obsessed"
16857,George,85, You're going back to New York now?
16858,Jane,85," Yeah, I have some things to do."
16859,George,85," Uh huh. Uh huh! I think you spoke to your little friend 
              Rachel,"
16860,Jane,85, So what if I did?
16861,George,85, And she didn't say something to you about a certain something?
16862,Jane,85, I don't know what you're talking about.
16863,George,85," *I* think that *you* think that a certain *something* is 
              not all"
16864,Jane,85, I'm sure it is.
16865,George,85," Look, you don't understand. There was shrinkage."
16866,Kramer,85, Looking for this? (Holding up lobster)
16867,Rachel,85," Oh, Kramer! You startled me."
16868,Kramer,85," Well, I thought you might wind up around here."
16869,Rachel,85," Yeah, well, I couldn't stop thinking about how everyone 
              was"
16870,Kramer,85, I'm afraid I couldn't do that.
16871,Rachel,85, Why not?
16872,Kramer,85," Well, that wouldn't be kosher."
16873,Rachel,85," C'mon, Kramer. I really want to try it."
16874,Kramer,85," Nah, I'm sorry, honey. Not on my watch."
16875,Rachel,85," Come on, Kramer."
16876,Kramer,85, Heyahhh!
16877,Rachel,85, I just heard a car drive out. What was that?
16878,Jerry,85," Oh, that's just Jane driving home to New York in the middle 
              of the"
16879,Carol,85," George, thanks so much for making breakfast."
16880,Elaine,85," George, these are the best scrambled eggs I've ever tasted."
16881,Kramer,85, I didn't know you could cook.
16882,George,85," Well, I'm just expressing my gratitude to our gracious 
              host."
16883,Ben,85," Yes, George, the whole breakfast is breathtaking. (Rachel"
16884,Rachel,85, Good morning.
16885,All,85," Hey, hey."
16886,Rachel,85," Kramer, I just want to thank you again for last night, 
              you really"
16887,Michael,85, What happened?
16888,Rachel,85," Well, I almost tried the lobster, but Kramer stopped me."
16889,Kramer,85, You'd regret it for the rest of your life.
16890,Rachel,85," You're right, I would have. "
16891,Jerry,85," (Referring to George) Hey, look at this guy."
16892,George,85, A little breakfast.
16893,Jerry,85, Yeah.
16894,George,85," (To Rachel) And, uh, you eat eggs, right?"
16895,Rachel,85," Yes, I do, thanks."
16896,Jerry,85," Geez, these are delicious. Where did you learn to make eggs 
              like"
16897,Rachel,85, Umm... This is so good.
16898,George,85," Ah, enjoying them?"
16899,Rachel,85, Mm-hmm.
16900,George,85," Uh, good. You know, you might wanna try eating it with 
              one of"
16901,Rachel,85, There's lobster in these eggs?
16902,George,85," Not that much. You know, they tend to shrink in the water."
16903,Jerry,85," Well, I guess I gotta go, too."
16904,Elaine,85," Well, this has turned out to be one *helluva* weekend. 
              (Policeman"
16905,Michael,85, Excuse me?
16906,Police,85," I'm sorry to bother you, but we're trying to track down 
              a lobster"
16907,Kramer,85, Wonder what's goin' on.
16908,George,85," Ah, I guess I should go up and apologize."
16909,Michael,85," There he is, officer. (Michael points to Kramer, Kramer"
16910,Rachel,85, Ahh! Don't you ever knock?
16911,George,85," I don't know why Rachel had to drive back with Michael 
              to town."
16912,Elaine,85," Hey, if you saw me naked, I wouldn't want to ride back 
              in the same"
16913,Jerry,85, I still can't believe Michael finked on Kramer.
16914,Elaine,85, How is he gonna pay off a thousand dollar fine?
16915,Jerry,85, They got some sort of program.
16916,George,85," Hey, there's a tomato stand, let's stop, I can get some 
              more."
16917,Jerry,85," Hey, isn't that Michael's car?"
16918,Elaine,85, There's Rachel.
16919,George,85, Where? (He looks out window and gets hit by a tomato)
16920,Jerry ,86," It is pretty hard to justify, at this point in history, 
              the existence of men and their"
16921,Mr. Lippman ,86, To your promotion.
16922,Elaine ,86," Oh, thank you! ( They drink ) Oh, thank you, Mr Lippman, 
              I can't tell you"
16923,Mr Lippman ,86," Well, you're really on your way now."
16924,Elaine ,86, You really oughtta do something about that cold.
16925,Jerry ,86, You got a raise?
16926,Elaine ,86," I don't fool around, baby!"
16927,Jerry ,86, I thought you said Pendant was in financial trouble.
16928,Elaine ,86," They were, but they're being absorbed by Matsushimi, that 
              big Japanese conglomerate."
16929,Jerry ,86," Oh, when did that happen?"
16930,Elaine ,86, They're signing the papers next week.
16931,Jerry ,86," Does this mean they're gonna be publishing Kramer's coffee 
              table book?"
16932,Elaine ,86," Yeah, they'll definitely do it now."
16933,Jerry ,86," Boy, you're on quite a streak. Job promotion, plus you're 
              back with Jake Jarmal."
16934,Elaine ,86," Yeah, it's gettin' serious, we're talking about moving 
              in together."
16935,Jerry ,86," Boy, you really got it all, I'm sure Helen ""Girlie"" 
              Brown would be very proud of you."
16936,Jerry ,86, Speaking of having it all ... Where were you?
16937,George ,86, I went to the beach. ( J and E exchange looks )
16938,Jerry ,86," Oh, the beach."
16939,George ,86," It's not working, Jerry. It's just not working."
16940,Jerry ,86, What is it that isn't working?
16941,George ,86," Why did it all turn out like this for me? I had so much 
              promise. I was personable, I was bright. Oh, maybe not academically 
              speaking, but ... I was perceptive. I always know when someone's 
              uncomfortable at a party. It became very clear to me sitting out 
              there today, that every decision I've ever made, in my entire life, 
              has been wrong. My life is the opposite of everything I want it 
              to be. Every instinct I have, in every of life, be it something 
              to wear, something to eat ... It's all been wrong."
16942,Waitress ,86," Tuna on toast, coleslaw, cup of coffee."
16943,George ,86," Yeah. No, no, no, wait a minute, I always have tuna on 
              toast. Nothing's ever worked out for me with tuna on toast. I want 
              the complete opposite of on toast. Chicken salad, on rye, untoasted 
              ... and a cup of tea."
16944,Elaine ,86," Well, there's no telling what can happen from this."
16945,Jerry ,86," You know chicken salad is not the opposite of tuna, salmon 
              is the opposite of tuna, 'cos salmon swim against the current, and 
              the tuna swim with it."
16946,George ,86, Good for the tuna.
16947,Elaine ,86," Ah, George, you know, that woman just looked at you."
16948,George ,86, So what? What am I supposed to do?
16949,Elaine ,86, Go talk to her.
16950,George ,86," Elaine, bald men, with no jobs, and no money, who live 
              with their parents, don't approach strange women."
16951,Jerry ,86," Well here's your chance to try the opposite. Instead of 
              tuna salad and being intimidated by women, chicken salad and going 
              right up to them."
16952,George ,86," Yeah, I should do the opposite, I should."
16953,Jerry ,86," If every instinct you have is wrong, then the opposite 
              would have to be right."
16954,George ,86," Yes, I will do the opposite. I used to sit here and do 
              nothing, and regret it for the rest of the day, so now I will do 
              the opposite, and I will do"
16955,George ,86," Excuse me, I couldn't help but notice that you were looking 
              in my direction."
16956,Victoria ,86," Oh, yes I was, you just ordered the same exact lunch 
              as me."
16957,George ,86, My name is George. I'm unemployed and I live with my parents.
16958,Victoria ,86, I'm Victoria. Hi.
16959,Jerry ,86," Are you kidding? They can't cancel that show on me now, 
              it's too late for me to book anything else for that weekend. Alright, 
              alright ... okay, bye."
16960,Kramer ,86," Hey. Buddy, it's all happening!"
16961,Jerry ,86, What's happening?
16962,Kramer ,86, The coffee table book. It's a go!
16963,Jerry ,86," Oh yeah, I heard all about it."
16964,Jerry ,86, You're going on Regis and Kathy Lee?
16965,Kramer ,86," Oh, you better believe it!"
16966,Jerry ,86, I'll loan you my puffy shirt.
16967,Kramer ,86," No,no,no."
16968,Jerry ,86, What're you gonna talk about?
16969,Kramer ,86," Well, coffee tables."
16970,Jerry ,86," Hello? What? Yeah, sure, I'll do it. I just had something 
              cancelled the same weekend. Ok. Great. Bye."
16971,Jerry ,86," You know, life is amazing. I just lost a job and five minutes 
              later get another, same weekend, same money."
16972,Kramer ,86, You know who you are? Even Steven
16973,Victoria ,86, Are you growing a beard?
16974,George ,86, Why shave every day? It just grows right back.
16975,Victoria ,86, I guess ...
16976,George ,86," I'm afraid I'm just not interested in how I present myself. 
              If those kind of superficialities are important to you, this probably 
              isn't gonna work."
16977,Victoria ,86," Hey watch, he just cut you off! Did you see that?!"
16978,George ,86, Take it easy. Take it easy. It's not the end of the world.
16979,Man no.1 ,86," Hey baby, how about a little tongue action, huh?"
16980,Man no.2 ,86," Yeah, stick your tongue down his throat!"
16981,Victoria ,86, What are we gonna do? Shall we just move?
16982,George ,86, That won't be necessary.
16983,George ,86," Shut your traps and stop kicking the seats! We're trying 
              to watch the movie! And if I have to tell you again, we're gonna 
              take it outside and I'm gonna show you what it's like! You understand 
              me? Now, shut your mouths or I'll"
16984,Victoria ,86," Are you sure you don't wanna come up, I mean, it's only 
              nine thirty."
16985,George ,86," I don't think we should. We really don't know each other 
              very well."
16986,Victoria ,86," Who are you, George Costanza?"
16987,George ,86, I'm the opposite of every guy you've ever met.
16988,Theater Manager ,86," Excuse me, is your name Elaine?"
16989,Elaine ,86, Yes.
16990,Theater Manager ,86, Were you suposed to meet a Jake Jarmal here?
16991,Elaine ,86, Yeah.
16992,Theater Manager ,86," Well, I'm afraid he's been in an accident."
16993,Elaine ,86, An accident? What happened?
16994,Theater Manager ,86," He got side-swiped by a cab, but he's alright. 
              He's in St.Vincent"
16995,Elaine ,86, Oh. Ok. Thank you.
16996,Elaine ,86, Could I have a box of Jujyfruit?
16997,Jake ,86," So, then, you know, the light was clearly green, I started 
              walking, he skidded and he went right into my hip."
16998,Elaine ,86," ( With her mouth full of Jujyfruit ) Oh, that is so terrible. 
              That is so terrible, Jake. I mean, how can people be so stupid? 
              Just sickening."
16999,Elaine ,86, You want one?
17000,Jake ,86, No thanks.
17001,Elaine ,86, So when do you think you're gonna get outta here?
17002,Jake ,86, Where did you get those?
17003,Elaine ,86, At the movies.
17004,Jake ,86," Didn't the theater manager give you the message before you 
              went in?"
17005,Elaine ,86," Yeah, he did."
17006,Jake ,86, Then when did you get those?
17007,Elaine ,86, Right after ... that ...
17008,Jake ,86," So you heard that I was in a car accident , and then decided 
              to stop off for some Jujyfruit?"
17009,Elaine ,86," Well... the counter...was right there, and..."
17010,Jake ,86," I would think, under the circumstances, it would have sent 
              you running out the building. Apparently, it didn't have any effect 
              on you."
17011,Elaine ,86," No, no, it does!"
17012,Jake ,86," If you got into a car accident, I can guarantee you I wouldn't 
              stop for Jujyfruit!"
17013,Elaine ,86, But...Jake...
17014,Jake ,86," I would like to be alone now, please."
17015,Elaine ,86," But, Jake, I didn't..."
17016,Jake ,86, Goodnight!
17017,Man no.1 ,86," Ah, whaddya say we call it a night?"
17018,Man no.2 ,86," Good idea, I'm kinda tired."
17019,Man no.3 ,86, How'd you do?
17020,Man no.4 ,86, Won 50.
17021,Man no.2 ,86, Lost 72.
17022,Man no.1 ,86, Won 37.
17023,Man no.3 ,86, Lost 15.
17024,Jerry ,86, Broke even.
17025,Regis ,86, Can I bring out our next guest now?
17026,Kathy Lee ,86," Please, please."
17027,Regis ,86," Young guy, he's got a new book coming out, and it's about, 
              and this is the best part -"
17028,Kathy Lee ,86, I love this.
17029,Regis ,86, It's a coffee table book about coffee tables!
17030,Kathy Lee ,86, Yeah. Is that clever? I think that is so clever!
17031,Regis ,86, I think so too. Did you get to meet him back stage?
17032,Kathy Lee ,86, I did.
17033,Regis ,86," I mean, he looks like a fun guy, doesn't he?"
17034,Kathy Lee ,86, I love his hair.
17035,Kathy Lee ,86," I don't know, maybe it's the hair or something!"
17036,Regis ,86," Kramer. So, a coffee table book about coffee tables. Where 
              did you come up with this idea?"
17037,Kramer ,86," Yeah, well, ah, I'll tell you, Regis... actually, this 
              is a true story. I was skiing at the time."
17038,Regis ,86," You know, when I'm skiing, Kramer, I'm trying not to kill 
              myself, and you're writing books!"
17039,Kramer ,86," Yeah, well, now you kids don't go out and try that. You 
              stay in school!"
17040,Kathy Lee ,86," Have you always had an interest in coffee tables, because, 
              really, I love coffee tables, and I thought I was the only one."
17041,Kramer ,86," You see the beauty of my book is, if you don't have a 
              coffee table, it turns into a coffee table."
17042,Kathy Lee ,86, Is that fabulous?
17043,Regis ,86, Look at this!
17044,Kathy Lee ,86, Is that fabulous?
17045,Regis ,86, Fabulous!
17046,Kathy Lee ,86, I want one of these.
17047,Regis ,86, Did I tell you this guy was bonkos?
17048,Kathy Lee ,86," This coffee table (book) is full of pictures of celebrities' 
              coffee tables."
17049,Kramer ,86, That's true. That's right.
17050,Regis ,86," Yeah? Well, I'm not in there. Where's mine?"
17051,Kramer ,86," Oh, it's on file, right here. ( points to his head )"
17052,Regis ,86," I'm tellin' ya, this guy's bonkos! He really is!"
17053,Kathy Lee ,86, But he's adorable.
17054,Regis ,86, We'll be right back.
17055,Jerry ,86, So it's all over?
17056,Elaine ,86," Yeah, it got pretty nasty."
17057,Jerry ,86, And what did you go back for? Jujyfruit?
17058,Elaine ,86," It's not like I went across the street. I bought the Jujyfruit 
              and I got in a cab."
17059,Jerry ,86, Why didn't you eat it in the cab?
17060,Elaine ,86," Because I got popcorn too, and I ate that first."
17061,Elaine ,86, What's all this?
17062,Jerry ,86, Played cards last night.
17063,Elaine ,86, Oh yeah? How'd you do?
17064,Jerry ,86, Broke even.
17065,Elaine ,86, You always break even.
17066,Jerry ,86," Yeah, I know; like yesterday I lost a job, and then I got 
              another one, and then I missed a TV show, and later on they re-ran 
              it. And then today I missed a train, went outside and caught a bus. 
              It never fails! I always even out!"
17067,Elaine ,86, Do you have twenty bucks?
17068,Jerry ,86, What for?
17069,Elaine ,86, Just gimme twenty bucks.
17070,Jerry ,86, What the hell was that?
17071,Elaine ,86, Let's see if you get the twenty bucks back.
17072,Jerry ,86," You know you could've thrown a pencil out the window and 
              seen if that came back."
17073,Elaine ,86," You know, things were going so good for me, you know, 
              I got the job"
17074,Jerry ,86," Well, maybe next time someone's in a car accident you won't 
              stop off for candy first."
17075,George ,86," Hey, I just found twenty dollars! I tell you this, something 
              is happening in my life. I did this opposite thing last night. Up 
              was down, black was white, good was -"
17076,Jerry,86, Bad.
17077,George ,86, Day was -
17078,Elaine ,86, Night.
17079,George ,86, Yes!
17080,Jerry ,86, So you just did the opposite of everything?
17081,George ,86," Yes. And listen to this, listen to this; her uncle works 
              for the Yankees and he's gonna get me a job interview. A front office 
              kind of thing. Assistant to the travelling secretary. A job with 
              the New York Yankees! This has been the dream of my life ever since 
              I was a child, and it's all happening because I'm completely ignoring 
              every urge towards common sense and good judgment I've ever had. 
              This is no longer just some crazy notion. Jerry, this is my religion."
17082,Jerry ,86, So I guess your Messiah would be the Anti-Christ.
17083,Jerry ,86, Elaine ... look! A twenty!
17084,Elaine ,86, Oh my God.
17085,Kramer ,86, Hey boss.
17086,Mr. Lippman ,86, Kramer. Come in.
17087,Kramer ,86," How're you doin' there, big guy? ( Puts his arm around 
              the tobacco store Indian )"
17088,Mr. Lippman ,86, Have a seat.
17089,Kramer ,86," What, have you got yourself a cold?"
17090,Kramer ,86," Wow, that's quite a honk! Get yourself some vitamin C 
              with rose hips and bioflavenoids."
17091,Mr. Lippman ,86," The reason I asked you in here, is I caught your 
              appearance on ""Regis and Kathy Lee"" the other day and 
              -"
17092,Kramer ,86," It was pretty good, huh?"
17093,Mr. Lippman ,86," Anyway, the thinking here is that it would be best 
              if you didn't do any more of these shows."
17094,Kramer ,86, Because of the coffee thing?
17095,Mr.Lippman ,86," Kramer, I'm sorry."
17096,Kramer ,86," What about ""Sonia Live""? Now you're not cancelling 
              ""Sonia Live""?"
17097,Mr. Lippman ,86, It's out -
17098,Kramer ,86," She's a doctor, I got a thing for her."
17099,Mr. Lippman ,86," Kramer, I -"
17100,Mr. Cushman ,86," Why don't you tell me about some of your previous 
              job experiences?"
17101,George ,86," Alrighty. Ah ... my last job was in publishing ... I got 
              fired for having sex in my office with the cleaning woman."
17102,Mr. Cushman ,86, Go on.
17103,George ,86," Alright, before that, I was in real estate. I quit, because 
              the boss wouldn't let me use his private bathroom. That was it."
17104,Mr. Cushman ,86, Do you talk to everybody like this?
17105,George ,86, Of course.
17106,Mr. Cushman ,86, My niece told me you were different.
17107,George ,86," I am different, yeah."
17108,Mr. Cushman ,86," I gotta tell you, you are the complete opposite of 
              every applicant we've seen."
17109,Mr. Cushman ,86," Ah, Mr. Steinbrenner, sir. There's someone here I'd 
              like you to meet. This is Mr. Costanza. He's one of the applicants."
17110,Mr. Steinbrenner ,86, Nice to meet you.
17111,George ,86," Well, I wish I could say the same, but I must say, with 
              all due respect, I find it very hard to see the logic behind some 
              of the moves you have made with this fine organization. In the past 
              twenty years you have caused myself, and the city of New York, a 
              good deal of distress, as we have watched you take our beloved Yankees 
              and reduced them to a laughing stock, all for the glorification 
              of your massive ego!"
17112,Mr. Steinbrenner ,86, Hire this man!
17113,Secretary ,86, Tina Robbins is here to see you. 
17114,Man ,86, Who's that?
17115,Elaine ,86," Ah, it's my ex-roommate, she moved out four years ago, 
              but I've been sub-"
17116,Man ,86," Alright, see ya. ( Meets Tina in the door ) Hey."
17117,Tina ,86, Please.
17118,Elaine ,86, Hi Tina.
17119,Tina,86, Hi Elaine.
17120,Elaine ,86," So, I haven't seen you in a while."
17121,Tina ,86," Elaine, we have a problem."
17122,Elaine ,86," Well, what is it?"
17123,Tina ,86, You're getting kicked out.
17124,Elaine ,86, Kicked out?! Why?!
17125,Tina ,86," Well, there's been a number of complaints."
17126,Elaine ,86, Yeah? Like what?
17127,Tina ,86," Well, like last Thanksgiving you buzzed up a jewel thief."
17128,Elaine ,86, I didn't know who he was!
17129,Tina ,86, That's why there's a buzzer.
17130,Elaine ,86, What else?
17131,Tina ,86," Well, apparently, the week after that, you buzzed up some 
              Jehova's Witnesses and they couldn't get them out of the building."
17132,Elaine ,86, What else have you got?
17133,Tina ,86," Well, let's see. ( Takes out a list from her bag )"
17134,Jerry ,86," I'll tell you what the big advantage of homosexuality is. 
              If you're going out with someone your size, right there you double 

              your wardrobe."
17135,Rachel ,86, I suppose...
17136,Jerry ,86," Oh, come on, that's a huge feature. When they approach 
              a new recruit, I'm sure that's one of the big selling points."
17137,Rachel ,86, Jerry ...
17138,Jerry ,86, Yes?
17139,Rachel ,86, I've been doing a lot of thinking.
17140,Jerry ,86, Aha?
17141,Rachel ,86," Well, I don't think we should see each other any more."
17142,Jerry ,86," Oh, that's okay."
17143,Rachel ,86, What?
17144,Jerry ,86," Nah, that's fine. No problem. I'll meet somebody else."
17145,Rachel ,86, You will?
17146,Jerry ,86," Sure. See, things always even out for me."
17147,Rachel ,86, Huh?
17148,Jerry ,86," It's fine. Anyway, it's been really nice dating you for 
              a while. And ... good luck!"
17149,Rachel ,86," Yeah, you too."
17150,Jerry ,86, The New York Yankees?!
17151,George ,86, The New York Yankees!
17152,Jerry ,86," Ruth, Gehrig, DiMaggio, Mantle ... Costanza?"
17153,George ,86," I'm the assistant to the travelling secretary. I'm going 
              on the road trips with them! I'll be on the plane... I'm working 
              in Yankee Stadium! This is a dream, I'm busting, Jerry, I'm busting!"
17154,Jerry ,86, I can't believe it.
17155,George ,86," And I' moving out of my parents' house, I'm taking that 
              apartment on 86th street, remember the one we saw?"
17156,Jerry ,86, That's a great place!
17157,George ,86," I'm back in business, baby!"
17158,Jerry ,86," George, I wouldn't get too excited about this stuff, you 
              know, things have a way of evening out."
17159,George ,86," Hey! ( to Elaine, who doesn't look too cheerful )"
17160,Jerry ,86, Hi Elaine.
17161,Elaine ,86, Hi.
17162,Jerry ,86, How're things going?
17163,Elaine ,86," How're things going? You wanna know how things are going? 
              I'll tell you how things are going. I am getting kicked out of my 
              apartment!"
17164,Jerry ,86, Why? Why are they doing that?
17165,Elaine ,86, I don't know! They have a list of grievances.
17166,Jerry ,86, The jewel thief?
17167,Elaine ,86," Yeah, the jewel thief."
17168,Jerry ,86, What else?
17169,Elaine ,86," I put Canadian quarters in the washing machine. I gotta 
              be out by the end of the month."
17170,George ,86," Well, you could move in with my parents."
17171,Elaine ,86," Was that the ... opposite ... of what you were going to 
              say, or was that just instinct? ( She squeezes G's mouth between 
              her fingers )"
17172,George ,86, Instinct.
17173,Elaine ,86," Stick ... with the opposite. ( Slaps G on the forehead 
              )"
17174,Jerry ,86," Elaine, don't get too down. Everything'll even out, see, 
              I have two friends, you were up, he was down. Now he's up, you're 
              down. You see how it all evens out for me?"
17175,Secretary ,86," Mr. Lippman, the people from Matsushimi are here. "
17176,Mr. Lippman ,86," Alright... tell them I'll be right there. Well, this 
              is it, Elaine. You know, without this merger, we'd be out on the 
              street. Boy, they sure saved us."
17177,Interpreter ,86," Mr Lippman, it is with great pride that we undertake 
              this partnership with your company."
17178,Mr Lippman ,86," I ... I'm sorry, I can't shake your hand right now. 
              It's germs."
17179,Jerry ,86, Is that the end of it?
17180,George ,86," Yeah, it's the last one."
17181,Estelle ,86," I can't believe you're moving out. ( Grabs Kramer ) Kramer, 
              is this true? Is it really happening? It's ... it's like a dream."
17182,Kramer ,86," Oh, it's true."
17183,George ,86," Alright, let's go."
17184,Frank ,86," Don't get in trouble with the Yankees. You be nice. ( Slaps 
              G's forehead )"
17185,George ,86, I'm not gonna be nice. That's how I got the job.
17186,Estelle ,86," Jerry, did you hear this?"
17187,Jerry ,86, He knows what he's doing.
17188,George ,86," I just want the both of you to know how much you mean 
              to me, and I love you both very, very much."
17189,Jerry ,86, Opposite.
17190,Elaine ,86," I must've had at least eight in my mouth. I couldn't talk. 
              I couldn't talk!"
17191,Jerry ,86, Why'd you have to eat so many?
17192,Elaine ,86," Because they're Jujyfruit. I like them. I didn't know 
              it would start a chain reaction that would lead to the end of Pendant 
              Publishing."
17193,Jerry ,86, Not to mention the end of Kramer's coffee table book.
17194,Kramer ,86," Yeah, you knew he had a cold. How'd you expect him to 
              blow his nose?"
17195,Elaine ,86," Do you know what's going on here? Can't you see what's 
              happened? I've become George."
17196,Jerry ,86, Don't say that.
17197,Elaine ,86, It's true. I'm George! I'm George!
17198,Kramer ,86," Wait, wait, wait, that's too much. Mine was more than 
              yours."
17199,Jerry ,86, Ah ... let's call it even.
17200,Jerry ,86," Coffee's a drink that seems to encourage a lot of accessories 
              around it. Coffee cake, coffee table, coffee table book, clutches 
              of people. Say what you want about alcohol, but not only are there 
              not a lot of optional accessories, alcohol actually helps you get 
              rid of things. Family, home, job, driver's license. In fact, at 
              a certain point, the only thing you have to remember to get, is 
              more alcohol And maybe a rag for your squeegee."

17203,Jerry's stand-up,87," Baseball is so associated with sex. ""He's

        get to first base."" ""I struck out."" ""Why?"" ""She 
        wanted a diamond."" It's always about baseball. Always baseball. As 
        far as baseball goes, I prefer the fat umpires...I feel if you're on the 
        field and you're not in the game, you should be in the worst physical 
        condition a human being could possibly be in. They should be allowed to 
        eat during the game. We're a little too into sports in this country, I 
        think we gotta throttle back. Know what I mean? People come home from 
        these games, ""We won! We won!"" No, they won - you watched."
17204,GEORGE,87," O.K., Danny, take a swing. <Tartabull swings the bat.> 
        N-No! No! No! You're opening up your shoulder."
17205,TARTABULL,87, Really?
17206,GEORGE,87," No, not really. I'm just saying this to you because I like to 
        hear myself talk. Yes, really!"
17207,TARTABULL (wiping sweat from his brow),87," Alright, alright."
17208,GEORGE,87, What are all sweatin' for?
17209,TARTABULL,87, It's hot in this uniform.
17210,GEORGE,87, Hot? <Feels Tartabull's material.> What is this?
17211,TARTBULL,87, What is what?
17212,GEORGE,87," This uniform, what's it made from?"
17213,TARTBULL,87," I don't know, cotton?"
17214,GEORGE,87," No. This is not cotton. Here, lemme see. <Tries to look at 
        the tag on the uniform. Tartabull gets creeped out and resists.> Will 
        you stop it? <Looks at the tag.> Oh. Of course. Polyester! "
17215,TARTABULL,87, So?
17216,GEORGE,87, I can't believe you're not playing in cotton.
17217,TARTABULL,87," Well, this is what they give us."
17218,GEORGE,87, You know they used to make leisure suits out of this fabric?
17219,TARTABULL,87, You really think cotton's better?
17220,GEORGE,87," Of course! Alright, maybe I'll say something to Buck."

17237,JERRY,87," Right, just like you. "
17238,ELAINE,87, Yeah. Can you hold my seat? <Elaine gets up.>
17239,CROWD,87, Hey! Down in front! <Elaine clambers over Jerry and exits.>
17240,JERRY (offers a hot dog to Miss Rhode Island),87, Hot dog?
17241,MISS RHODE ISLAND,87," No, thanks. I'm watching my weight."
17242,JERRY,87," Ah. I'm watching my height. My doctor doesn't want me to get any 
        taller. So you're Miss, uh..."
17243,MISS RHODE ISLAND,87, Rhode Island. 
17244,JERRY,87," I was almost Mr. Coffee. They felt I was a little too relaxed. 
        <Miss Rhode Island laughs.>"
17245,GEORGE,87, Miss Rhode Island? When are you seeing her?
17246,JERRY,87," Tonight. I have to call her, she's staying in a hotel."
17247,GEORGE,87, You're incredible.
17248,JERRY,87," And get this - I'm working in Atlantic City this weekend, and 
        she's going to be down there for the pageant."
17249,GEORGE,87," What if she becomes Miss America? You could be dating Miss America, 
        Jerry!"
17250,JERRY,87," The only bad thing is, we have to go out with a chaperone."
17251,GEORGE,87," Chaperone? What, are you kidding?"
17252,JERRY,87," No, it's part of the contest rules."
17253,GEORGE,87, What does the chaperone do?
17254,JERRY,87," I don't know, she just sits there."
17255,GEORGE,87, Can she talk?
17256,JERRY,87," I'm not sure if she's allowed to talk. <Picks up the phone 
        and dials.>"
17257,GEORGE,87, You're calling her?
17258,JERRY,87," Yeah. (sings) There she is...Miss - yes, room 417 please? Karen 
        Hanson?"
17259,GEORGE,87," Hey, did you know that the Yankees don't wear cotton jerseys?"
17260,JERRY,87," Of course, they're polyester."
17261,GEORGE,87," Well, what is that? That's a crime! Do you know how hot those 
        things get? They should be wearing cotton."
17262,JERRY,87, Why do they wear polyester?
17263,GEORGE,87, I don't know. That's all gonna change.
17264,JERRY,87, You're going to do something about it?
17265,GEORGE,87, Why shouldn't I?
17266,JERRY (doubtfully),87, No reason... 
17267,LANDIS,87," Of course, Jackie O. was a great lady. Those are going to be 
        some tough shoes to fill. Everyone loved her. She had such...grace."
17268,ELAINE (gushing),87, Yes! Grace!
17269,LANDIS,87, Not many people have grace.
17270,ELAINE,87," Well, you know, grace is a tough one. I like to think I have 
        a little grace...not as much as Jackie - "
17271,LANDIS,87," You can't have ""a little grace."" You either have grace, 
        or you...don't."
17272,ELAINE,87," O.K., fine, I have...no grace."
17273,LANDIS,87, And you can't acquire grace.
17274,ELAINE,87," Well, I have no intention of ""getting"" grace."
17275,LANDIS,87, Grace isn't something you can pick up at the market.
17276,ELAINE (fed up),87," Alright, alright, look - I don't have grace, I don't 
        want grace...I don't even say grace, O.K.?"
17277,LANDIS,87, Thank you for coming in.
17278,ELAINE,87," Yeah, yeah, right."
17279,LANDIS,87," We'll make our choice in a few days, and we'll let you know."
17280,ELAINE (stands up),87," I have no chance, do I?"
17281,LANDIS,87, No. <They shake hands.>
17282,LANDIS'S INTERCOM,87, Justin Pitt to see you.
17283,ELAINE,87, Justin Pitt?
17284,LANDIS,87, He was a very close friend of Mrs. Onassis's.
17285,ELAINE,87," ""Mrs. Onassis's""? That's hard to pronounce."
17286,LANDIS,87, Excuse me?
17287,ELAINE,87, Nothing. <Mr. Pitt comes in with some papers in hand.>
17288,PITT,87," Mrs. Landis, there's something wrong with this copying machine, 
        it's all coming out slanted. Now, I don't know if this is your department 
        or not."
17289,LANDIS,87," Justin Pitt, this is Elaine Benes. <Elaine turns around. With 
        sunglasses and a scarf on her head, she bears a close resemblance to Jackie 
        O.>"
17290,PITT (clearly affected by Elaine's appearance),87, Charmed.
17291,ELAINE,87, I was a great admirer of Mrs. Onass-sis-sis-sis...
17292,JERRY,87," Hello, Karen? It's Jerry Seinfeld. Oh, that's very sweet of you. 
        You know, you better be careful, you don't want to get too congenial. 
        They'll slap that ""Miss Congeniality"" on you, and you'll congene 
        yourself right out of the contest. So, what time do you want to get together 
        later? What? So what, we don't need the chaperone. (To George) The chaperone 
        can't make it. (To Karen) Oh, you're not gonna get disqualified! So, we're 
        not going? <Kramer enters.> Hold on one second. (To Kramer) Hey, 
        what are you doing tonight?"
17293,KRAMER,87, Nothin.'
17294,JERRY,87," I'm going out with one of the Miss America contestants, you wanna 
        go?"
17295,KRAMER,87, What state?
17296,JERRY,87, Rhode Island.
17297,KRAMER,87, They're never in contention.
17298,GEORGE,87, How do you know?
17299,KRAMER,87," Because I've seen every Miss America pageant since I was six. 
      "
17300,JERRY,87," Look, do you want to go or not? I'll buy you dinner."
17301,KRAMER,87, Giddy-up!
17302,JERRY (to Karen),87, I think I got someone!
17303,PITT (looking at Elaine and smiling),87," The resemblance is uncanny. <Elaine, 
        sipping soda through a straw, looks up with a sour expression on her face.> 
        Even the brown eyes."
17304,ELAINE,87," Well, a lot of people have brown eyes."
17305,PITT,87," No, there's something else. An indefinable quality."
17306,ELAINE,87, Grace?
17307,PITT,87," Grace, yes. "
17308,ELAINE,87, You think I have grace?
17309,PITT,87," Some grace, yes. "
17310,ELAINE,87, Just some?
17311,PITT,87," Well, you don't want too much grace or you won't be able to stand."
17312,ELAINE (laughing),87," Oh, Mr. Pitt."
17313,PITT,87," Elaine, I want you to come and work for me as my personal assistant. 

        Now, I'll pay you the same as Pendant, but I would need you to start right 
        away."
17314,GEORGE,87," Hey, Buck. Talk to you for a second?"
17315,SHOWALTER,87," Sure, George."
17316,GEORGE,87, How's everything going? Everything O.K.?
17317,SHOWALTER,87," Well, all of a sudden there's a problem with Tartabull's swing..."
17318,GEORGE,87," Listen, Buck, I uh...obviously I don't need to talk to you about 
        the importance of player morale, but uh...I've been talking to some of 
        the guys, and some of them - I don't want to mention any names - but some 
        of them...they're not too happy with the polyester uniforms."
17319,SHOWALTER,87, How so?
17320,GEORGE,87," Well, they get very hot in the polyester. You know, it's not 
        a natural fibre. I think they would prefer cotton."
17321,SHOWALTER,87," Cotton, huh?"
17322,GEORGE,87," Yeah. Cotton breathes, you see, it's much softer. Imagine playing 
        games and your team is five degrees cooler than the other team. Don't 
        you think that would be an advantage? They're cooler, they're more comfortable...they're 
        happier - they're gonna play better."
17323,SHOWALTER,87," You may have something there, George."
17324,GEORGE,87, Oh - I've got something.
17325,SHOWALTER (considering),87, Hmm. Cotton uniforms.
17326,JERRY,87, Congratulations!
17327,ELAINE,87," Yeah! And the best part is, I still get to look for work in publishing."
17328,JERRY,87," Now, what is it that you do, exactly?"
17329,ELAINE,87, I attend to his personal affairs. 
17330,JERRY,87, Like what?
17331,ELAINE,87," Well, like tomorrow for example, I have to uh...I have to buy 
        him some socks."
17332,JERRY,87, Really! Socks!
17333,ELAINE,87, Yeah. White ones. Like the ones you wear with sneakers.
17334,JERRY,87," Hey, maybe you can pick me up some underwear! <Kramer enters.>"
17335,KRAMER (shows Jerry his outfit),87," So, what do you think? Does this work?"
17336,JERRY,87," Listen...tonight, after we finish eating, you make like you got 
        something else to do and just ""recede into the night,"" if you 
        know what I mean."
17337,KRAMER,87, No way!
17338,JERRY,87, What?
17339,KRAMER,87," Look, if you think I'm just going to step aside and do nothing 
        while you defile this woman, you're crazy."
17340,JERRY,87," I'm not going to ""defile"" her!"
17341,KRAMER,87," That's right, because I'm going to see it doesn't happen. Look, 
        Jerry, these girls are Miss America contestants. It's every little girl's 
        dream. And I'm not going to let you trample that dream and make a mockery 
        of everything the pageant stands for. "
17342,JERRY,87, But - 
17343,KRAMER (holds up his hand),87, AAAH! No buts! Those are my rules.
17344,JERRY,87, But wait a minute...
17345,KRAMER,87," Now, if you want to go out and have some good, wholesome fun 
        with a nice girl, I'd be glad to help you out...if you're looking for 
        something more than that, you've got the wrong guy, buddy! <Jerry tries 
        to get a word in during this entire speech, but Kramer won't budge an 
        inch.>"
17346,KRAMER,87," If you were Miss America, what would you do to make the world 
        a better place?"
17347,KAREN,87," As Miss America, I would try and bring an end to world hunger. 
        If every person sacrificed one meal a week, there would be enough to feed 
        the whole world!"
17348,JERRY,87, That's a hell of a plan. (To Kramer) Listen - 
17349,KRAMER (to Karen),87, What advice would you give young people?
17350,JERRY,87," Alright, Kramer!"
17351,KRAMER,87," This is important stuff! She's got to be able to answer these 
        questions. She's not going to have time to think, out there, with millions 
        of people watching her. Any hesitation could cost her the crown. You know, 
        poise counts."
17352,KAREN,87," You really know a lot about this, don't you?"
17353,KRAMER,87," Oh yeah, like last year? Miss Texas? Now, she should have won 
        easily, but she lost points in the swimsuit competition."
17354,KAREN,87," Well, what could she have done?"
17355,KRAMER,87, Tape her breasts together. <Jerry is shocked.>
17356,KAREN,87, What else?
17357,KRAMER,87," Well, take you for example. Now, you're very attractive, but 
        you got a big waist."
17358,JERRY,87," Hey, come on!"
17359,KAREN,87," No, no...it's O.K. (To Kramer) Go on."
17360,KRAMER,87," Well, I'd recommend a waist cincher. "
17361,KAREN,87, Really.
17362,KRAMER,87," Oh, yeah. Just - thip! - suck you in."
17363,JERRY,87, I'll be right back. <Leaves the table.>
17364,KRAMER,87," So, what's your talent?"
17365,KAREN,87, Magic.
17366,KRAMER,87, Mmm. I'm thinking of a number from one to ten.
17367,KAREN,87, Six.
17368,KRAMER,87," No, five. But you were close. "
17369,ANNOUNCER #1,87, And the Yankees take the field!
17370,ANNOUNCER #2,87," Is it my imagination, or do the Yankees look a little different 
        tonight? I can't put my finger on it..."
17371,ANNOUNCER #1,87," Well, from what I understand, they've switched to cotton 
        uniforms."
17372,ANNOUNCER #2,87," They seem blousier, softer..."
17373,ANNOUNCER #1,87," Well, it is a natural fibre..."
17374,KRAMER,87, How's your evening?
17375,KAREN,87," Well, I'm wearing this red dress - "
17376,KRAMER,87, Stop right there.
17377,KAREN,87, No good?
17378,KRAMER,87, Disaster. 
17379,KAREN,87, Why?
17380,KRAMER,87," Well, you got brown eyes. You want to wear a green dress."
17381,KAREN,87, That makes sense. <The limo stops at Karen's hotel.>
17382,JERRY,87," Well, here we are..."
17383,KAREN,87," Kramer, would you consider being my personal consultant for the 
        pageant?"
17384,KRAMER,87," Okay. But if I'm going to do this, we play by my rules or we 
        don't play at all."
17385,KAREN,87," I am in your hands. <They shake hands.> Well! Oh, good night, 
        Jerry. <They're about to kiss, but Kramer stops them by clearing his 
        throat.> Kenneth will take you home. <She gets out, leaving Jerry 
        staring at Kramer with an angry expression on his face.>"
17386,KRAMER,87, Hey.
17387,JERRY,87," Well, if it isn't Mr. Blackwell."
17388,KRAMER,87," Oh, come on."
17389,JERRY,87," And that waist cincher, that was the topper!"
17390,KRAMER,87," Oh, you're poo-pooing!"
17391,JERRY,87," Yes, I poo-poo."
17392,KRAMER,87," Well, let me tell you something. I'm taking this kid to the top. 
        To the top, Jerry! We're going for the crown, and you can't stop her!"
17393,JERRY,87, I don't want to stop her!
17394,KRAMER,87," You can't stop her, Jerry! Oh, I've seen 'em come and 
        go, but this kid has got something! <Turns to leave.>"
17395,JERRY,87," Yeah, so do you. <George enters with a newspaper.>"
17396,GEORGE,87," Well, did you see it?"
17397,JERRY,87, See what?
17398,JERRY,87," Boy, they really do sound comfortable."
17399,GEORGE (noticing Jerry's suitcase),87," Hey, where ya goin'?"
17400,JERRY,87, I'm working in Atlantic City.
17401,GEORGE,87, Really!
17402,JERRY,87," Yeah. Hey, you're not working this weekend, why don't you come 
        down?"
17403,GEORGE,87," Atlantic City? (thinks) Yes! Yes! I will go to Atlantic City. 
        I'm in. I'm down."
17404,JERRY,87," You know what, maybe Elaine wants to go too, lemme call her. <Picks 
        up the phone.> She's at Mr. Pitt's, I think I got the number..."
17405,ELAINE,87," So, what do you think?"
17406,PITT (pulling up the socks),87, No.
17407,ELAINE,87, You don't like them?
17408,PITT,87," No, I don't like them. "
17409,ELAINE,87, What's wrong?
17410,PITT,87, They're too tight.
17411,ELAINE,87, Too tight?
17412,PITT,87," There's no elastic, you need to pull too much <pulls them up 
        more>."
17413,ELAINE (examining the socks),87, I think they look good!
17414,PITT,87, They're cutting off the circulation. 
17415,ELAINE,87," Alright, well, I'll just take them back. <The phone rings.>"
17416,PITT,87, Hello?
17417,JERRY,87," Hi, Mr. Pitt! Is Elaine there?"
17418,PITT (hands the phone to Elaine),87, It's for you.
17419,ELAINE,87, Sorry. Hello?
17420,JERRY,87," Hey Elaine, it's me."
17421,ELAINE,87, Jerry?
17422,JERRY,87, We're going to Atlantic City.
17423,ELAINE,87, Really? When?
17424,JERRY,87," Today, right now! Are you in?"
17425,ELAINE,87," One second, hang on. (To Mr. Pitt) Excuse me, Mr. Pitt? Would 
        it be alright if I got you the socks tomorrow?"
17426,PITT,87, Tomorrow?
17427,ELAINE,87, Yes.
17428,PITT,87, But I was hoping for my new socks today!
17429,ELAINE,87," Well, it's just one more day. "
17430,PITT,87, I'm sorry. I must have them today.
17431,ELAINE (to Jerry),87, I can't go.
17432,JERRY,87, Why not?
17433,ELAINE,87, Because I have to return the socks and get different ones.
17434,PITT,87, Elaine!
17435,ELAINE,87, I gotta go. <Hangs up.>
17436,KRAMER,87," No. Alright, watch me now. <Karen sits on the bed. Kramer 
        walks across the room like a Miss America contestant with a big smile 
        on his face.> Turn, back, head up, shoulders back...posture. You see? 
        Posture."
17437,KAREN,87," Yes, I see. O.K."
17438,KRAMER,87," Let's try a few more questions, alright? <Karen stands up.> 
        If you were Miss America, and the U.S. was on the brink of a nuclear war, 
        and the only way the conflict could be averted was if you agreed to sleep 
        with the enemy's leader, what would you do?"
17439,KAREN,87," Kramer, are these questions really that important...?"
17440,KRAMER,87," Yes, they're important! If you stumble, if you hesitate, you 
        can kiss the crown goodbye. Now if I've told you once, I've told you a 
        thousand times - poise counts! It's just as important as the others. Swimsuit! 

        Evening wear! Talent! POISE!"
17441,GEORGE,87, Hey. 
17442,JERRY,87, Hey.
17443,GEORGE,87, How was the show?
17444,JERRY,87, Good. How was the roulette?
17445,GEORGE,87," I won fifty bucks! Boy, this is great. Too bad Elaine's not here."
17446,JERRY,87," Yeah, all she had to do was buy Mr. Pitt a pair of socks!"
17447,PITT,87," It's good, but..."
17448,ELAINE,87, But what??
17449,PITT,87, Ultimately I don't think they'll stay up. 
17450,ELAINE (pulling up Pitt's socks),87," No, no! They'll stay up!"
17451,PITT,87," For a while, yes, but not in the long run."
17452,ELAINE,87, But that's why I got you the tighter ones! <Holds them up.>
17453,PITT,87," Oh, forget about those! <Takes the socks from Elaine and throws 
        them on the floor.> Why do you keep mentioning those?"
17454,ELAINE,87, What do you want!?
17455,PITT,87," I want a decent sock that's comfortable, that will stay on my foot!!"
17456,JERRY,87, What the hell is that?
17457,GEORGE,87," I don't know, it sounds like pigeons or something!"
17458,JERRY (getting out of bed),87," Well, I can't sleep with that noise. "
17459,GEORGE,87, Me either. Is there anything you can do to shut them up?
17460,JERRY,87," Wait a second. <Grabs the icebucket off the counter.> This'll 
        scare 'em off. <Dumps the bucket of water over the balcony. We hear 
        a loud squawking noise and the flapping of wings, then the noise is gone. 
        Jerry gets back into bed.> Well, good night, Ollie."
17461,GEORGE,87," Good night, Stan."
17462,KRAMER,87, What is it?
17463,KAREN,87," My doves! They're dead! I trained those birds for eight years! 
        How am I supposed to do my magic act now?"
17464,KRAMER,87, How did this happen?
17465,KAREN,87," They like it outside, so I kept them in a cage on the terrace...then 
        I found them dead in a pool of water!"
17466,"KRAMER (goes out on the terrace to look, and slips in the water)",87," Well, 
        how did this happen?"
17467,KAREN,87, It must have been an accident.
17468,KRAMER,87, Accident? This was no accident. These doves were murdered.
17469,KRAMER,87," Well, that's it! She's out of the pageant!"
17470,JERRY,87, What? Why? What happened?
17471,KRAMER,87, Her birds are dead.
17472,JERRY,87, Birds?
17473,KRAMER,87," Yeah, birds. She's got these trained doves, she does this magic 
        act, that was her talent for the pageant. You know what I think, Jerry? 
        I think somebody murdered those doves. Somebody wanted her out of that 
        contest bad. Somebody who was just eaten up with jealousy. Somebody who 
        just couldn't stand to have the spotlight taken off of them! <Kramer 
        turns around and notices the empty icebucket on the edge of Jerry's balcony.>"
17474,JERRY,87," What are you looking at? <Kramer goes out onto the terrace 
        and looks down.> Oh, that! We had to leave that outside, last night, 
        because the water was making the room too cold."
17475,KRAMER (comes back inside with his finger pointed at Jerry),87," You killed 
        them, didn't you? "
17476,JERRY,87," No, you don't understand - it's not what you think! It was an 
        accident!"
17477,KRAMER,87," Well, don't think you've won, because you haven't! This kid is 
        a fighter! And if you think I'm gonna let a couple of dead birds get in 
        our way, you're crazy!"
17478,JERRY,87," Kramer, you gotta explain to her what happened...! <Kramer 
        exits.>"
17479,GEORGE (comes out of the bathroom brushing his teeth),87," What was that 
        all about?"
17480,JERRY,87," Oh, it was just Kramer...apparently I killed Miss Rhode Island's 
        doves with a bucket of water last night."
17481,GEORGE,87, Oh. <Goes back into the bathroom.>
17482,KAREN,87," O.K., this is it!"
17483,KRAMER,87, How ya feelin'?
17484,KAREN,87, I'm a little nervous!
17485,KRAMER,87, There's nothing to be nervous about.
17486,KAREN,87, But I've never sung before in my life!
17487,PHILBIN,87," And now, let's welcome Karen Ann Hanson, Miss Rhode Island!"
17488,JERRY,87, I heard those doves were really incredible. 
17489,GEORGE,87, That's a shame. <Karen is shown singing off-key on the television.>
17490,JERRY,87, It's like watching an animal get tortured.
17491,GEORGE,87," Hey, hey! Yankee game! <Changes the channel.>"
17492,JERRY,87," Oh, great! Alright. <We hear the announcers calling the game.>"
17493,ANNOUNCER #1,87, And the Yankees take the field!
17494,ANNOUNCER #2,87," What is with the Yankees? They look like they're having 
        trouble running, they can't move!"
17495,ANNOUNCER #1,87," It's their uniforms, they're too tight, they've shrunk! 
        They're running like penguins! Forget this game!"
17496,ANNOUNCER #2,87," Oh my God, Mattingly just split his pants!"
17497,JERRY,87, That's a shame.
17498,KRAMER,87, Poise. Poise!
17499,"Jerry's stand-up, part 2",87," The Miss America pageant seems like 
        a really tough contest. You know, you gotta come out there in the bathing 
        suit, in the dress shoes...they got that ""sanitized for your protection"" 
        toilet seat-thing hangin' off them, you know...plus, they gotta wear all 
        the other outfits. I don't know why, the bathing suit is the contest. 
        You win the bathing suit, you win. What is the formal wear? Everybody 
        looks good in formal wear; it's dark, it covers everything - that's why 
        we have weddings in it. I mean, if we had weddings in bathing suits, a 
        lot of ceremonies wouldn't be able to get past ""If anyone sees any 
        reason why these two people should not be joined together..."" About 
        eighty hands go up..."

        =========
        Its fascinating. When you go into a stationery store that theyre 
        
        manufacturing millions of pens; constantly were all buying them. 
        I 
        must have bought six thousand Bics in my life. Ive used up maybe 
        two of 
        them. Where are the rest of them? When you move the refrigerator theres 
        a 
        couple back there but it doesnt account for it. Where are all the 
        pens? 
        Thats why its so embarrassing if you dont have one. 
        You got a pen? Can I borrow 
        a pen? We always have to whisper because its so humiliating. I dont 
        
        have a pen. Theyre making millions of them every week!   
        I know; where are they?
"
17503,Stationer,88, May I help you?
17504,Elaine,88," Yeah, uh, I'm looking for a Rollamech 1000 mechanical pencil."
17505,Stationer,88," Oh, I know the Rollamech 1000. "
17506,Elaine,88," No, I'm sure you do."
17507,Stationer,88, They're pretty expensive.
17508,Elaine,88," Well, it's for my boss."
17509,Stationer,88, What do you do?
17510,Stationer,88," Well, we don't have any in stock right now but I would be 
        happy to order it for you. Just give me your phone number and when it 
        comes in I'll give you a call. You're name is? "
17511,Elaine,88, Elaine.
17512,Stationer,88," Elaine, . . . and your last name?"
17513,Elaine,88," It's just Elaine, like Cher. Ha ha ha"
17514,Stationer,88, And your number?
17515,Elaine,88," Uh, aw, KL5-239O."
17516,Stationer,88, Okay. Thanks a lot. You'll be hearing from me. 
17517,Elaine,88," Okay, [to Jerry]  Move  along. . . "
17518,Jerry,88, Why did you give him MY number?
17519,Elaine,88, I think he's got ideas. 
17520,Jerry,88, I wonder if any woman ever said that about Einstein?
17521,Jerry,88, Call me when the pencil comes in Okay?
17522,Elaine,88," Just call me when the new pen comes in, okay?"
17523,Jerry,88," Why does Mr. Pitt prefer a pencil to a pen anyway? Hey. Look who's 
        here."
17524,George,88," Hey, hey."
17525,Elaine,88, Hey hey
17526,Julie,88, Hi Jerry.
17527,Jerry,88, Hi Julie.
17528,George,88," Elaine, Julie."
17529,Elaine,88, Hi.
17530,Julie,88, Hi.
17531,Julie,88," Oh, hi.  Elaine's my middle name."
17532,Elaine,88," Oh, mine's ""Ike""."
17533,George,88," Hey, wanna get some lunch?"
17534,Jerry,88, Just had a big bowl of Kix.
17535,George,88," Ah, well, that's very mature. What about you?"
17536,Elaine,88," Ah, no."
17537,Julie,88," Please come, Elaine."
17538,Elaine,88," No, no. How about if you bring me back something?"
17539,George,88," Sure, all right, what do you want?"
17540,Elaine,88," Um, hum, I don't know.. . . A big salad? "
17541,George,88, What big salad? I'm going to the coffee shop.
17542,Elaine,88, They have big salads.
17543,George,88, I've never seen a big salad.
17544,Elaine,88, They have a big salad.
17545,George,88, Is that what I ask for? The BIG salad?
17546,Elaine,88," It's okay, you don't"
17547,George,88," No, no, Hey I'll get it. What's in the BIG salad?"
17548,Jerry,88," Big lettuce, big carrots, tomatoes like volleyballs."
17549,George,88," (???), we'll see you in a little while."
17550,Elaine,88, Maybe I should just get married.
17551,Jerry,88, Dating is really starting to get embarrassing isn't it?
17552,Elaine,88," I know. You know, whenever I'm on a date I feel people can tell."
17553,Jerry,88, People on dates shouldn't even be allowed out in public.
17554,Elaine,88, You can say that again.
17555,Jerry,88," It's embarrassing for them. It's painful for us to watch. I'm 
        going out with someone later, I'm not even taking her out of the house."
17556,Elaine,88, Good for you.
17557,Jerry,88, I don't need a bunch of people staring at us.
17558,Elaine,88, Right on baby. (???)
17559,Jerry,88, What was that?
17560,Kramer,88," That Gendason, what a jerk. I'm never playing golf with him again."
17561,Elaine,88, Who Gendason?
17562,Kramer,88, Steve Gendason.
17563,Elaine,88," Oh, how did you end up playing golf with him?"
17564,Kramer,88," Well, I met him on the course a couple of years ago. Yeah. Played 
        with him a lot. But today was it! We're on the fifteenth hole, ya, he's 
        beating me by a couple of strokes. Then, he's about to hit his second 
        shot, when, he picks up the ball and CLEANS it."
17565,Elaine,88, So what?
17566,Kramer,88," Umph, sorry! But the rules clearly state that you cannot clean 
        the ball unless it's on the green. The rules are very clear about that. 
      "
17567,Jerry,88, Certainly are. 
17568,Kramer,88," Ya, so I penalized him a stroke. "
17569,Kramer,88," He LOST IT! We almost came to blows. We were face to face like 
        a manager and an umpire like this . . kara a pukka ba ya ka ba . . . "
17570,Jerry,88, All right. You're in MY face.
17571,Elaine,88, I still don't see what the big deal is. 
17572,Kramer,88," A rule is a rule. And let's face it. Without rules there's chaos. 
      "
17573,Julie,88, I like Anna ???'s column and Sapphire. Don't you like Sapphire?
17574,George,88," Oh, Sapphire. Uh ha "
17575,Julie,88, Although at times can be rather pedantic.
17576,George,88, He can be pedantic. He can be pedantic.
17577,Julie,88, And Bob Herbert's great. He's the Daily News.
17578,George,88," Yes. Yes. You know what's interesting. The quarterback for the 
        Atlanta Falcons is Bobby Hebert. No ""r"" which I find fascinating. 
        You know it's Herbert h-e-r-b-e-r-t, Hebert h-e-b-e-r-t. ""Hebert"" 
        it's a fun name to pronounce. Try and say it Hebert. Take a shot. All 
        right. [check arrives] All right. I "
17579,Julie,88," No, no. I'd like to take you out."
17580,George,88," No, Julie, Julie, don't insult me. You know, what difference 
        does it make who pays for lunch. It's totally meaningless. "
17581,Julie,88," Okay, thanks, George."
17582,Wx,88, Here's your big salad to go.
17583,Julie,88," Oh, thank you. "
17584,Jerry,88," [on phone] Hello. No she's not here. Okay, fine, whatever. I'll 
        tell her. Okay. Goodbye. The stationery store guy called to say he ORDERED 
        your pencil. "
17585,Elaine,88, I told ya'. He has ideas.
17586,Jerry,88, He doesn't even care if a man answers.
17587,Elaine,88, Or you.
17588,George,88," Hey, hey."
17589,Elaine,88, Hey.
17590,Julie,88, Sorry e're late.
17591,Elaine,88, No problem.
17592,Julie,88, Here's your big salad.
17593,Elaine,88," Thank you, Julie."
17594,Julie,88," Oh, you're very welcome. So, I guess I better get going. Gotta 
        meet mother a t the Guggenheim. Sure you don't want to go?"
17595,George,88," No, you go Guggenheim. I'm not much of a Guggenheim."
17596,Julie,88," Sure, George."
17597,George,88," Ya, you go. "
17598,Julie,88," Okay, I'll see you later. Goodbye."
17599,Jerry,88, Bye bye
17600,George,88, Did you see what just happened?
17601,Jerry,88," Well, that all depends. . . "
17602,George,88, Did you happen to notice that Julie handed the big salad to Elaine?
17603,Jerry,88," Yeah, so?"
17604,George,88," Well, she didn't BUY the big salad. I bought the big salad. "
17605,Jerry,88, Is that a fact?
17606,George,88, Yes it is. She just took credit for my salad. That's not right.
17607,Jerry,88, No it isn't. 
17608,George,88, I mean I'm the one who bought it. 
17609,Jerry,88, Yes you did.
17610,George,88, You think she should have said something?
17611,Jerry,88, She could have.
17612,George,88," Oh, I know."
17613,Jerry,88," Imagine, her taking credit for your big salad. "
17614,George,88," You know you buy a big salad for somebody it would be nice if 

        they knew it. "
17615,Jerry,88, Obviously.
17616,Kramer,88, Turn on the TV.
17617,Jerry,88, What?
17618,Kramer,88, I'm puttin it on
17619,TV,88," . . . the district attorney's office and the police department have 
        not answered any questions as yet. To repeat in case you're just joining 
        us. Former baseball start Steve Genderson, has been taken to Police headquarters 
        for questioning the murder of Bobby Pinkus the owner of Royal Dry Cleaners 
        at 2759 Amsterdam Avenue. According to Pinkus' wife, Gendeson had been 
        involved in a dispute with the cleaner about a stain on a pair of gray 
        Sans-A-Belt slacks. We also have a report that earlier in the day a groundskeeper 
        at Vancourtland's Golf Course saw an irate Gendeson leaving the clubhouse 
        in a huff. Whether there is a possible connection between the two is something 
        we'll just have to wait."
17620,Kramer,88," Yeah, but maybe he was so mad from the penalty stroke that he 
        murdered the dry cleaner."
17621,Jerry,88," Well, generally speaking you don't need any extra incentive to 
        murder a dry cleaner. I wouldn't worry about that. "
17622,Elaine,88, I like Julie. She's very personable.
17623,George,88," Yeah, she's very lovely."
17624,Elaine,88, That's great George. 
17625,George,88, So did you enjoy your lunch?
17626,Elaine,88," Yeah, A big salad. Very good. Actually it was too big. Ha ha 
        ha Wht?"
17627,George,88," oh, . . .because she handed you the bag. I could have handed 
        you the bag. She happened to pick it up at the restaurant even though, 
        . . . "
17628,Elaine,88, Even though what?
17629,George,88," . . . naw, it's just you thanked HER, and and oh, . . . what's 
        the difference?"
17630,Elaine,88," What? What are you trying to say, George?"
17631,George,88," It's just that I was the one who actually paid for the big salad. 
        She just happened to hand it to you. But it's no big deal. "
17632,Elaine,88," You want the money for the big salad, George?"
17633,George,88," No, no,"
17634,Elaine,88, What is the problem?
17635,George,88," There is no problem. . . just a small miscommunication. Whereby 
        you thanked her instead of the person actually responsible for purchasing 
        the big salad."
17636,Jerry,88, And Kramer thinks a penalty stroke may have driven him to it.
17637,Margaret,88," Well, they haven't even arrested him yet. Come on, let's go 
        out."
17638,Jerry,88," Ah, no , I don't think so."
17639,Margaret,88, Why not?
17640,Jerry,88, We don't need a bunch of people staring at us.
17641,Jerry,88," Hello. No she's not here. Yes I will tell her. No I don't know 
        what time she might be coming back. Look I gotta' go. Goodbye. . . . That, 
        that's a long story. "
17642,Jerry,88, Hello Newman.
17643,Margaret,88," Hello Jerry, I was wondering if you knew where Kramer was. 
      "
17644,Jerry,88," No, no I don't. Why?"
17645,Margaret,88," You know, Genderson. This is something big. "
17646,Jerry,88, I suppose.
17647,Margaret,88, What did Kramer say? 
17648,Jerry,88, I don't know. Nothing.? 
17649,Margaret,88," Come on Jerry. You know something TELL ME! TELL ME!, Oh, chocolates 
        . . . Margaret?"
17650,Margaret,88, Hello.
17651,Jerry,88, You two know each other?
17652,Newman,88, You might say that.
17653,Margaret,88, We used to go out.
17654,Newman,88," Well, tootle loo. And nice seeing you again Margaret, goodbye 
        Jerry. Have fun. Hehe "
17655,Jerry,88, . . . YOU went out with . . . Newman?
17656,Margaret,88, Just a few times. 
17657,Jerry,88, Why?
17658,Margaret,88, I liked him. 
17659,Jerry,88," You liked, Newman?"
17660,Margaret,88, Look I'm a little uncomfortable talking about this okay?
17661,Jerry,88," No, I'm sorry. I'm just a little curious. I mean why did you stop 
        seeing him. "
17662,Margaret,88, He ended it. 
17663,Jerry,88, . . . HE ended it? 
17664,Margaret,88," YES!! Yes! It was a couple of years ago. Why does it matter? 
      "
17665,Jerry,88," No, no of course not. "
17666,Kramer,88," Jerry, Jerry they found a tee. "
17667,Jerry,88, What tee?
17668,Kramer,88, A golf tee. In the dry cleaner.
17669,Jerry,88, Newman! She went out with Newman!
17670,Elaine,88, It must be a mistake.
17671,Jerry,88," No. It isn't and the most distressing part of it is, not that 
        she went out with him but that HE stopped seeing her. Do you understand? 
        He, Newman; Newman stopped seeing her. Newman never stopped seeing anybody. 
        Newman will see whoever is willing to see him. Not so much why she did 
        see him as disturbing as that is. But why, did HE, Newman, stop seeing 
        her? "
17672,Elaine,88, Perhaps there's more to him than meets the eye. 
17673,Jerry,88," No, there's less. "
17674,Elaine,88, It's possible.
17675,Jerry,88, No it isn't. I've looked into his eyes. He's pure evil. 
17676,Elaine,88," He's an enigma, a mystery wrapped in a riddle. "
17677,Jerry,88," Yeah, he's a mystery wrapped in a Twinkie."
17678,Wx,88, Would you like some more coffee? 
17679,Jerry,88," No,, but thank you. "
17680,Jerry,88," Oh, by the way, your stationery store guy called and he's got 
        your pencil. "
17681,Elaine,88, Ugh! You are kidding me. 
17682,Jerry,88," No, he left the store early, made a special trip to the distributor 
        and got it. "
17683,Elaine,88, I bought mine yesterday on 14th Street. 
17684,Jerry,88," Well, what did you do that for? You ordered it."
17685,Elaine,88, To please Mr. Pitt. 
17686,Jerry,88," Well, you better go down there and tell this guy. He's very excited. 
      "
17687,Elaine,88," Uh, great!"
17688,Jerry,88, Hi Julie.
17689,Jerry,88, Hi. 
17690,Elaine,88, Hi Julie.
17691,Jerry,88," Hi, how are you, Elaine? I'm meeting George here. "
17692,Elaine,88," Oh, well then I better get going otherwise George will make me 
        buy him lunch to make up for that big salad he bought me yesterday. "
17693,Jerry,88, How do you know THAT?
17694,Newman,88, Who is it.
17695,Jerry,88, It's Jerry.
17696,Newman,88, You've come at a bad time now. Could you come back later?
17697,Jerry,88, Come on Newman. OPEN THE DOOR!
17698,Newman,88," Hellooo Jerry. What a rare treat. What brings you down to the 
        east wing?"
17699,Jerry,88," Okay, pudgy, lets stop playing games. What happened with margaret?"
17700,Newman,88, There's no need to get excited. Can't we discuss this like gentlemen?
17701,Jerry,88," No, we can't. My skin is crawling just being inside your little 
        rat's nest. Now, what happened?"
17702,Newman,88," Do you really want to know what happened? I'll tell you what 
        Happened. She wasn't my type. "
17703,Jerry,88, Noit your type? 
17704,Newman,88, Not really. 
17705,Jerry,88," Well, how come? "
17706,Newman,88," Ah, she just didn't do it for me. "
17707,Jerry,88," What, what is wrong with her? "
17708,Newman,88," Well, h ha ha- if you're happy with her, that's all that matters."
17709,Jerry,88, You don't think she's attractive?
17710,Newman,88," No. I need a really pretty face. But, Hey, that's me. "
17711,Jerry,88," Okay, Newman, thanks a lot. "
17712,Newman,88, Care for some lemonade? 
17713,Jerry,88," No, thank you. "
17714,Newman,88," Drop bye anytime, jerry. Hah, ha ha "
17715,Kramer,88," Listen to this, ""If a player cleans his ball during the 
        play of a hole accept on the putting green he shall incur a penalty of 
        one stroke. "" That's a rule, Jerry."
17716,Jerry,88, But it's just a friendly game. Why do you have to be such a stickler?
17717,Kramer,88," Because that's the way I weas raised. You know when I was growing 
        up I had to be in bed every night by nine o'clock. And if I wasn't, well 
        I don't have to tell you what happened. "
17718,Jerry,88, What are you so worried about this for?
17719,Kramer,88, You know he talked about Pinkus on the course? 
17720,Jerry,88, He did?
17721,Kramer,88," Oh yeah, he said he brought a pair of pants into Pinkus' and 
        they came back stained with some kind of dry cleaning fluid. And Pinkus 
        denied responsibility. You see he was very upset with Pinkus. "
17722,Jerry,88, So it had nothing to do with you. 
17723,Kramer,88," Yeah, but maybe I pushed him over the edge. "
17724,Jerry,88," No, I don't think so. "
17725,Kramer,88," Poor Pinkus, poor little Pinkus."
17726,Jerry,88," Hey, let me ask you a question. You met margaret. Doo you think 
        Margaret's good looking? Um, she's a natural beauty. Oh, no makeup. I 
        like that. "
17727,Jerry,88," Yeah, and the curls. You like the curls?"
17728,Kramer,88," Oh, I love curls."
17729,Jerry,88," Yeah,, me too. "
17730,Kramer,88," All right, I'll see you later."
17731,Jerry,88, Where you going?
17732,Kramer,88, Genderson's.
17733,Jerry,88, You're going to see Genderson?
17734,Kramer,88, It's weighing on my conscience. 
17735,George,88," You know, I think I could have played with dolls if their were 
        dolls in the house. It seems like fun to me. It doesn't seem like a gender 
        thing. I think I would like to play with dolls. What's so terrible?"
17736,Julie,88," Ha. So, George, I was talking to Elaine before."
17737,George,88, A ha! We're just friends. 
17738,Julie,88," Yes, well anyway, she said something that was kind of intriguing. 
      "
17739,George,88," Oh, share."
17740,Julie,88," Well, when I came over to the table she mentioned something about 
        how she better hurry up and leave or you'd make her buy lunch to make 
        up for the one you bought yesterday."
17741,George,88," Ha, ha ha uh, I'm not following that. "
17742,Julie,88," Well, my question is, How could Elaine be under the impression 
        that you bought the big salad, when I was the one who handed it to her? 
      "
17743,George,88," Well, she probably just assumed. "
17744,Julie,88," Um, did she?"
17745,George,88," . . .uh, . . . wait a second. Are you suggesting that I went 
        out of my way to tell Elaine that even though you handed her the big salad, 
        that it came from me? "
17746,Julie,88, That's what I'm suggesting. 
17747,George,88," . . . WELL IT WAS A BIG SALAD. AND WHAT I WOULD LIKE TO KNOW 
        IS, HOW DOES A PERSON WHO HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH THE BIG SALAD CLAIM RESPONSIBILITY 
        FOR THAT SALAD AND ACCEPT THE THANK YOU UNDER FALSE PRETENSES - AH - AH?"
17748,Julie,88," George, all I did was hand someone a bag. "
17749,Elaine,88," It's just that my boss is very demanding and he needed the pencil 
        right away."
17750,Stationer,88," Well,, why did you tell me to order it if you knew you were 
        going to get one someplace else?"
17751,Elaine,88," No, no no I didn't know. I, I'm sorry. "
17752,Stationer,88," I went all the way down to the warehouse. It took me three 
        hours. I had a big fight with the foreman. "
17753,Elaine,88, Really? A fight with the foreman? 
17754,Stationer,88, Yes. 
17755,Elaine,88," Well, again, I'm just awfully sorry. "
17756,Stationer,88," Yeah? Well, then how about going out with me tonight? "
17757,Elaine,88, Okay. 
17758,Margaret,88," I mean they found a tee and he played golf that day. Nobody 
        walks into a dry cleaner's with a tee. The circumstantial evidence is 
        overwhelming. "
17759,Jerry,88, You had how many dates with him? Three? 
17760,Margaret,88, Around three. I don't know. 
17761,Jerry,88, And . . 
17762,Margaret,88," I told you. He stopped calling me. I moved on. I'm not hung 
        up on him. What are you looking at? "
17763,Jerry,88, What? I'm not looking. Nothing. 
17764,Jerry,88, Why are you looking at my face? 
17765,Jerry,88, Where am I going to look? 
17766,Margaret,88, Kiss me.
17767,Jerry,88, . . . I can't. 
17768,Jerry,88, Newman!
17769,Jerry,88," All I could think of was when I was looking at her face was; Newman 
        found this unacceptable. "
17770,Elaine,88," Well, ,I'm going out with the stationery store guy. "
17771,Jerry,88, You're going out with the stationery store guy?
17772,Elaine,88, I felt so guilty about the pencil I couldn't say no. 
17773,Elaine,88," Well, well, well, I'm not treating you to lunch ANYMORE! You 
        had to tell Julie that I made a special point of telling you that I bought 
        you the big salad. Didn't ya'. "
17774,Elaine,88," Uh, uh."
17775,George,88," You know, if it was a regular salad I wouldn't have said anything. 
        But you had to have the BIG SALAD. "
17776,Jerry,88," Hello, what? You're kidding. I'm turning it on. Oh, my god. Get 
        out of here. [hangs up] Hey listen to this. They issued a warrant for 
        Genderson's arrest. He escaped and the police spotted him on the New Jersey 
        Turnpike. "
17777,TV,88," As you can see white Bronco. The police have cleared the highway 
        traffic in front of him but they are keeping their distance and don't 
        want the situation to escalate. And we have gotten an identification on 
        the driver of the vehicle. His name is; Kramer, one of Genderson's golfing 
        buddies. "
17778,Police,88, 9-1-1 What are you reporting
17779,Kramer,88," Yeah, this is Kramer. I got Genderson in the car. He wants to 
        see his fish. I'm taking him to see his fish. So tell the police to back 
        off. "
17780,Police,88," Okay, sir, and what's your name?"
17781,Kramer,88, My name is Kramer. You know who I am dammit! 
17782,Genderson,88, I told you not to take the turnpike.
17783,Kramer,88, I thought we would blend in.
17784,Genderson,88, If we took the palisades this never have happened. 
17785,Kramer,88, we would have had all that bridge traffic. 
17786,Genderson,88," Ah, just drive. "
17787,"

17792,No. Jacket and tie,90, no cape.

17794,I mean,90, I'm Donna Chang.

17801,Yeah--I just remembered,90," I'm gonna have to cancel my acupuncture 
              class. "
17802,All right. Let me just say one thing,90," there is no way that this 
              is goin' "
17803,Jerry,90," how come you didn't say hello to me the other day, huh?!"
17804,Last Updated,90," 3 June, 1997"
17805,JERRY,92," I've never been able to figure out why they make these bizarre 
        toilet seats that they have. You know, like those clear Lucite ones, with 
        all the, the coins in it? It's a lovely tribute to our past president, 
        by the way. It's not bad enough Lincoln got shot in the head, we gotta 
        pull down our pants and sit on him, too. It's just incomprehensible that 
        you would buy a thing like this, you install it on your toilet seat, and 
        this says what about you? ""Well, I can't afford to just throw money 
        down the toilet, but look how close I am!"""
17806,JERRY,92," I cannot believe Lindsay's still seeing you after that ""Breakfast 
        at Tiffany's"" thing."
17807,GEORGE,92, I think she finds my stupidity charming.
17808,JERRY,92, As we all do.
17809,GEORGE,92," Yeah, anyway, she's uh, having some kind of a family lunch, I'll 
        swing by after."
17810,JERRY,92," Oh, so you're gonna meet the mother?"
17811,GEORGE,92," Yeah, I'll zip in, ""How do you do?"", zip out. She'll 
        love me."
17812,JERRY,92, You're good with the mothers.
17813,GEORGE,92," Y'know, I'm better with the mothers than I am with the daughters."
17814,JERRY,92, Maybe you should date the mothers.
17815,GEORGE,92," Well, if I could talk to the mothers and have sex with the daughters, 
        then I'd really have something goin'."
17816,JERRY,92," Oh, you got something goin'."
17817,GEORGE,92, Yeah.
17818,KRAMER,92, (enters apartment) Hey.
17819,GEORGE,92, Hey! (heads toward bathroom)
17820,KRAMER,92," Hey, you got a hammer?"
17821,JERRY,92, What do you need a hammer for?
17822,KRAMER,92," Well, I got this new poster. 3-D art? Computers generate 'em."
17823,JERRY,92," Oh, yeah! I wanna see that. Bring it over."
17824,KRAMER,92," No, no, I don't have it now. I gotta pick it up at Mr. Pitt's. 
        Elaine was framing a bunch of stuff for him, so she did me a favor. What, 
        you wanna take a ride?"
17825,JERRY,92," Nah, I don't think so."
17826,KRAMER,92," (shouting to the bathroom door) George, you wanna go for a ride?"
17827,GEORGE,92, (inside bathroom) Nah.
17828,KRAMER,92," Oh, COME ON!"
17829,JERRY,92," Hey, could you wait until the man finishes?"
17830,KRAMER,92," All right, I've had it with you two. (opens apartment door to 
        leave)"
17831,JERRY,92," Hey, guess what? Remember that woman you saw me with the other 
        day? You know, she used to be an Olympic gymnast?"
17832,KRAMER,92, A gymnast!
17833,JERRY,92," Yeah, she's Romanian, she won a silver at the '84 Olympics."
17834,KRAMER,92," A gymnast, Jerry. Think of the flexibility. Mmm, that sex'll 
        melt your face."
17835,JERRY,92," Yeah, well, I think I'm bailing."
17836,KRAMER,92," (shuts door) ""Bailing""?"
17837,JERRY,92," Yeah, you know, Kramer, there's always a price to pay for just 
        a sexual dalliance."
17838,KRAMER,92," Jerry, you should pay that price."
17839,JERRY,92," She's Romanian. What am I gonna talk to her about, Ceausescu?"
17840,KRAMER,92, Ch- oo-... what?
17841,GEORGE,92," (emerging from bathroom, buttoning his shirt) A gymnast! I can't 
        believe it, you didn't tell me she was a gymnast."
17842,JERRY,92, (watching George buttoning his shirt) What is this?
17843,GEORGE,92," What, I'm puttin' my shirt back on."
17844,JERRY,92," (stares at George, incredulous) ""Back on""? What was 
        it doing off?"
17845,GEORGE,92," I take it off when I go to the, uh, y'know, to the ""office""."
17846,JERRY,92, (laughing) What for?
17847,GEORGE,92," Well, it frees me up. No encumbrances."
17848,JERRY,92," Unbuttoned, or all the way off?"
17849,GEORGE,92," ALL the way, baby!"
17850,JERRY,92, Of course.
17851,KRAMER,92, (convulses in pain) Yeow! Whoa.
17852,JERRY,92," What, again? Kramer, if you keep getting these attacks, you should 
        see the doctor and have it checked out."
17853,KRAMER,92," (exiting apartment) Yeah, yeah, yeah..."
17854,JERRY,92," (picks up newspaper, turns to George) You always take the shirt 
        off?"
17855,GEORGE,92, Always.
17856,JERRY,92," Boy, I tell ya', knowing you is like going out in the jungle. 
        I never know what I'm going to find next, and I'm real scared."
17857,MR. PITT,92," Elaine, I need you to proofread this report for my meeting 
        with the Poland Creek Bottled Water people."
17858,ELAINE,92, What meeting?
17859,MR. PITT,92," I told you. I sit on the Board of Trustees for Morgan Springs, 
        and we're trying to acquire Poland Creek."
17860,ELAINE,92, Oh! (tries to take paper)
17861,MR. PITT,92, (pulls away) Are you using a fountain pen?
17862,ELAINE,92, Yes?
17863,MR. PITT,92," They smear! Under no circumstances is ink to be used in this 
        office."
17864,ELAINE,92," All right! I'll use a pencil, Mr. Pitt."
17865,KRAMER,92, Elaine?
17866,ELAINE,92," Come in, come in!"
17867,KRAMER,92," Yeah. (enters, points at package) Yah, huh?"
17868,ELAINE,92," Ah, right there, yeah."
17869,KRAMER,92," (rips open package) Yeah, that's..."
17870,ELAINE,92," Kramer, it's..."
17871,ELAINE,92," Kramer, Kramer, can you do this at home? I've got, I've got work 
        to do, okay?"
17872,KRAMER,92," Oh, these are nice corners, huh?"
17873,MR. PITT,92," Elaine, did I hear... (sees Kramer) Oh, this is very odd."
17874,KRAMER,92," (looking at picture) Yeah, it's 3-D art. Computers generate 'em. 
        BIG computers."
17875,MR. PITT,92," Yes, I've heard about these. How do they work?"
17876,KRAMER,92," Well, you blur your eyes like you're starin' straight through 
        the picture. And you keep your eyes unfocused. And then... (Kramer and 
        Pitt stare at picture) Oh, oh, oh, YEAH!"
17877,MR. PITT,92, I don't see it.
17878,KRAMER,92," Yeah, it's a spaceship, surrounded by planets, asteroids..."
17879,MR. PITT,92, I still don't see it.
17880,ELAINE,92," Okay, Kramer, that's enough. Mr. Pitt has got work to do."
17881,KRAMER,92," Ya' ever dream in 3-D? It's like the boogeyman is comin' right 
        at you."
17882,MR. PITT,92," A spaceship, where?"
17883,KRAMER,92," (pointing) Right in here. Just keep your eyes unfocused. (convulses 
        in pain) Waahh! Oh, mama!"
17884,ELAINE,92," Kramer, what's wrong?"
17885,KRAMER,92, Mama!
17886,ELAINE,92," Kramer, Kramer, are you okay?"
17887,KRAMER,92," I think I gotta go to the doctor! (exits) Oh, mama!"
17888,MR. PITT,92, (still staring at picture) How long does it usually take?
17889,MRS. ENRIGHT,92," Oh, George, it is so nice to finally meet you. And I'm 
        sorry we've kept Lindsay so long."
17890,LINDSAY,92, Mother...
17891,GEORGE,92," Oh, no, no, not at all. No, I have always felt that the most 
        important thing in the world is spending time with family."
17892,MRS. ENRIGHT,92, Oh? Are you and your family close?
17893,GEORGE,92," (hesitates) Very close, yes. Almost painfully close."
17894,LINDSAY,92," Mother, I'm going to walk Nana and Aunt Phyllis to the elevator. 
        George, do you mind waiting just one more minute?"
17895,GEORGE,92," Mind? Why would I mind? I would love to wait! (shakes hands with 
        Nana) Nana, nice to see you. Ni-ni-ni-ni-NANA! (embraces another guest, 
        kisses her) Aunt Phyllis, always a pleasure. What a pleasure! Hey, let's 
        do this again real soon. I had fun, huh?"
17896,MRS. ENRIGHT,92, Can I offer you anything to eat?
17897,GEORGE,92," Oh, no no no, I'm fine. Let me help you with these dishes, huh?"
17898,MRS. ENRIGHT,92," Oh no, George, you don't have to..."
17899,GEORGE,92," No, I know I don't have to, I want to."
17900,MRS. ENRIGHT,92," George, you are such a gentleman."
17901,GEORGE,92," I'd argue if I could, Mrs. Enright. (exits) Here we go, all right."
17902,MRS. ENRIGHT,92, (wide-eyed) Oh...
17903,ELAINE,92," (pointing at 3-D picture) Look, there's a spaceship! That is 
        so cool!"
17904,MR. PITT,92, Where is it?
17905,ELAINE,92, (pointing) Right here.
17906,MR. PITT,92, I'm looking there!
17907,ELAINE,92," No, no, unfocus."
17908,MR. PITT,92, I am unfocused!
17909,ELAINE,92," (answering phone) Hello? Oh, yeah, okay fine. Uh, he'll be right 
        down. (to Pitt) Car's here to pick you up and take you to the meeting."
17910,MR. PITT,92, (still staring at picture) Meeting?
17911,ELAINE,92," Yeah, the Poland Creek merger?"
17912,MR. PITT,92, Why don't you go for me?
17913,ELAINE,92, How can I go?
17914,MR. PITT,92," Oh, all they're gonna do is read the report."
17915,ELAINE,92," Mr. Pitt, I do not think that is such a good idea."
17916,MR. PITT,92," Oh, DAMN this thing!"
17917,JERRY,92," (trying desperately to make conversation) So, Ceausescu. He must've 
        been some dictator."
17918,KATYA,92, Oh yes. He was not shy about dictating.
17919,JERRY,92," He, uh, he must've been dictating first thing in the morning. 
        ""I want a cup of coffee and a muffin!"""
17920,KATYA,92, And you could not refuse.
17921,JERRY,92," No, you'd have to be crazy."
17922,KATYA,92, He was a very bad dictator.
17923,JERRY,92," Yes. Very bad. Very, very bad."
17924,GEORGE,92," No, no. No, no, no. It was not trash!"
17925,JERRY,92, Was it in the trash?
17926,GEORGE,92, Yes.
17927,JERRY,92, Then it was trash.
17928,GEORGE,92," It wasn't down in, it was sort of on top."
17929,JERRY,92, But it was in the cylinder!
17930,GEORGE,92, Above the rim.
17931,JERRY,92," Adjacent to refuse, is refuse."
17932,GEORGE,92, It was on a magazine! And it still had the doily on.
17933,JERRY,92, Was it eaten?
17934,GEORGE,92, One little bite.
17935,JERRY,92," Well, that's garbage."
17936,GEORGE,92, But I know who took the bite. It was her aunt!
17937,JERRY,92," Well, you, my friend, have crossed the line that divides Man and 
        Bum. You are now a Bum."
17938,JERRY,92, Hey!
17939,KRAMER,92, Hey.
17940,JERRY,92, What's with you?
17941,KRAMER,92, I got a stone.
17942,JERRY,92, What stone?
17943,KRAMER,92, A kidney stone.
17944,JERRY,92," What is that, anyway?"
17945,KRAMER,92," It's a, it's a stony mineral concretion, formed abnormally in 
        the kidney. And this jagged shard of calcium pushes its way through the 
        ureter into the bladder. It's forced out through the urine!"
17946,JERRY,92," Oh, that's gotta hurt."
17947,ARONSON,92," Our shareholders have given basic approval for the merger, including 
        the stock swap."
17948,ELAINE,92," Ah. The ""stock swap"". Let's swap some stock. (giggles)"
17949,BECK,92," And if you'll just give this to Mr. Pitt, and tell him we expect 
        to be in full-scale production by the spring."
17950,ELAINE,92," All right. (standing up) Hey, you guys--what's the name of the 
        new company gonna be?"
17951,BECK,92, Moland Spring.
17952,ELAINE,92," (making a face) ""Moland""?"
17953,ARONSON,92," Yes, we combined Morgan and Poland."
17954,ELAINE,92," Yeah, I know, but... ""Moland""? I wouldn't drink anything 
        called ""Moland""."
17955,ARONSON,92, But it was Mr. Pitt's idea.
17956,ELAINE,92," Oh! Well, ah, what's in a name? I mean, water's water. Right?"
17957,ARONSON,92, (to Beck) We've got to do something about that name.
17958,GEORGE,92," (on phone, as Jerry gestures beside him) No, Lindsay, it was 
        not IN the garbage. It was above the garbage. Hovering. Like an angel. 
        Of course I know your aunt bit it. I kissed her goodbye. Listen, can I 
        tell you something else? In my family, we used to eat out of the garbage 
        all the time. (Jerry makes a face) It was no big thing. That's right. 
        Oh, okay. Buh-bye. (hangs up phone) I'm back in, she gave me a second 
        chance."
17959,JERRY,92, Good for you.
17960,GEORGE,92," Yes, good for me!"
17961,JERRY,92," Y'know what you should do now? Get her some flowers, smooth it 
        out."
17962,GEORGE,92," Yes, flowers. I will get her flowers, I will go to the florist!"
17963,KRAMER,92," (enters apartment, holding up videotape) Behold! The Games of 
        the '84 Olympiad! Katya's silver medal performance! (inserts tape into 
        VCR, sets up TV)"
17964,JERRY,92," Kramer, are you still on this? I've seen gymnasts. I know what 
        they do. It's not going to make any difference."
17965,KRAMER,92," Jerry, what is your problem?"
17966,JERRY,92," Kramer, y'know, guys like you, with no conscience, don't know 
        what it's like for guys like me. I'm in the unfortunate position of having 
        to consider people's feelings."
17967,KRAMER,92," All right, Jerry--are you familiar with the Kama Sutra?"
17968,JERRY,92, No.
17969,KRAMER,92, Tantric yoga?
17970,JERRY,92, No.
17971,KRAMER,92," Jerry, you stand on the threshold to the magical world of sensual 
        delights that most men dare not dream of!"
17972,JERRY,92," Boy, you can really talk some trash. (to George) I guess that's 
        better than eating it."
17973,KRAMER,92," All right, all right, why don't we just watch the tape? (starts 
        playback)"
17974,JERRY,92, All right.
17975,GEORGE,92, Did you pass your stone yet?
17976,KRAMER,92, Not yet. But the suspense is killing me.
17977,JERRY,92," (pointing at TV) Hey, that's her!"
17978,KRAMER,92," Oh yeah. Oh yeah, that's her. (feminine grunts and sighs can 
        be heard as they watch the tape) Look at the height, Jerry, the extension! 
        Now watch the tuck. Handstand, half-turn, giant into a straddle, back 
        into another handstand. Nice kip. Reverse hecht. Oh, nice leg extension, 
        good form! Now, here comes the big dismount. Look at the rotation, full 
        in, double back, and she sticks the landing! (gets up to leave as George 
        and Jerry continue to watch, mouths agape) Perhaps you'd like to keep 
        the tape? (silence) Well, I'll take that as a yes."
17979,JERRY,92," (smiling and excited) Well, here we are."
17980,KATYA,92, Yes. We are here.
17981,JERRY,92," How did you stay on that beam like that? (holds up hand) I mean, 
        it's only this wide!"
17982,KATYA,92, I can balance myself in any position.
17983,KATYA,92," It is amazing after years of training how one can contort one's 
        body. Of course, it is only useful in gymnastics."
17984,JERRY,92, Oh boy...
17985,JERRY,92," I couldn't believe it. Uh, I mean I thought I was entering a ""magical 
        world"" of sensual delights, but it was just so ordinary. I mean, 
        there was nothing gymnastic about it."
17986,ELAINE,92," Well, what did you think she was gonna do?"
17987,JERRY,92," Well, you know. I mean... I dunno."
17988,ELAINE,92," No, what?"
17989,JERRY,92," Well, obviously I prefer not to mention any, you know..."
17990,ELAINE,92," What did you think, she was going to take some of that chalk 
        and..."
17991,JERRY,92," You see, now I really don't want to get into this, any kind of 
        specifics..."
17992,ELAINE,92," Oh, come on. One thing? One thing! What?"
17993,JERRY,92," Well... Frankly, I thought, you know, I was gonna kinda' be like 
        the apparatus."
17994,KRAMER,92, You mean like the uneven parallel bars?
17995,JERRY,92," See, again, I really don't feel that..."
17996,ELAINE,92, The balance beam?
17997,JERRY,92, Could we stop?
17998,ELAINE,92, (gasps in mock surprise) Not the pommel horse?
17999,JERRY,92, All right. Let's just drop it.
18000,ELAINE,92," I dunno, at least three weeks."
18001,JERRY,92," (sarcastic) Oh, great."
18002,ELAINE,92," Jerry, that is such small potatoes. I think that I may have single-handedly 
        put the kibosh on the big water merger."
18003,JERRY,92, Between Poland and Morgan?
18004,ELAINE,92, Yeah. Started a big name controversy.
18005,JERRY,92, Kramer! The stone!
18006,JERRY,92," What happened, did you pass the stone?"
18007,KRAMER,92," (Off-screen) No, I tried to do a reverse hecht off my couch and 
        I didn't make it."
18008,GEORGE,92," (singing as he exits florist with bouquet and a cup of coffee) 
        ""...tootsie, good-bye. Too-too, tootsie..."" (takes a drink, 
        makes a face, shouts back at shop) You call this coffee? (dumps out coffee 
        behind him, accidentally hitting a parked car's windshield)"
18009,MAN IN CAR,92, Hey! What the hell was that?!
18010,GEORGE,92, I'm sorry! I'm terribly sorry! I- I-
18011,MAN IN CAR,92, Clean that up!
18012,GEORGE,92," Oh, sure. Of course. (looks for place to set down flowers) Um, 
        uh, could you hold these? For just a second, just a second. (grabs newspapers 
        from trash bin, begins wiping windshield) Here you go, now don't worry 
        about a thing. It's gonna be fine. Here we go. Look at this shine."
18013,MRS. ENRIGHT,92," (sees George cleaning car windshield, looks appalled)"
18014,GEORGE,92," Look at this sparkle. (looks up, sees Lindsay's mother) Mrs. 
        Enright! (runs after her) Mrs. Enright! Mrs. Enright!"
18015,GEORGE,92," (on phone, as Jerry gestures beside him) No, Lindsay, I had accidentally 
        spilled coffee on the gentleman's windshield. Why would I do that? I have 
        a job! Well, did she see a squeegee? Well, you're not going to make a 
        dime without a squeegee. That's right, that's right, just tell your mother 
        it was all a big misunderstanding. You won't regret it. Okay, I'll see 
        you later. Buh-bye. (hangs up)"
18016,JERRY,92, Strike two!
18017,GEORGE,92, You think I'm going down?
18018,JERRY,92, You're behind in the count.
18019,GEORGE,92, I know.
18020,KRAMER,92," (enters apartment, points at Jerry) Hey, what are you doing later?"
18021,JERRY,92," I'm going out with Katya, thanks to you."
18022,JERRY,92," If I do it again, that extends my payment book another two weeks."
18023,KRAMER,92," All right, where you going?"
18024,JERRY,92," We're going to the circus. One of her old Olympic teammates is 
        an acrobat. I don't even feel like going out."
18025,KRAMER,92," Well, Jerry, it's your obligation. C'mon."
18026,JERRY,92," Yeah, well, y'know what? If I gotta go, and spend time with this 
        girl, then you're coming with me, Dr. Cyclops!"
18027,KRAMER,92," No, no, no, I don't wanna go to the circus, Jerry."
18028,JERRY,92," Yeah, well you're going."
18029,KRAMER,92," Yeah, but I'm afraid of clowns!"
18030,MR. PITT,92," (in polo outfit, complete with jacket and high boots) I didn't 
        send you over there to complain about the name."
18031,ELAINE,92," Well, I couldn't help it. ""Moland Spring""?"
18032,MR. PITT,92," I like the name ""Moland"". I picked it out. After 
        all those months of negotiating!"
18033,ELAINE,92," Well, I'm so sorry! I-"
18034,MR. PITT,92," Well, I'm going riding. I haven't been on Jenny for three days, 
        all because of this blasted painting. (phone rings) Elaine?"
18035,ELAINE,92," Oh, sorry. (picks up phone) Hello?"
18036,MR. PITT,92," (walks by 3-D poster, stops) Wait a minute! Wait a minute. 
        Ah!"
18037,KATYA,92," So, Jerry, you're enjoying the circus?"
18038,JERRY,92," ""Greatest Show on Earth""!"
18039,KATYA,92," My father used to take me to the circus. When the elephants came 
        by, he would scream curses at them, blaming them for all the ills of society."
18040,JERRY,92," Well, they certainly take up a lot of space."
18041,KATYA,92," Ah, Misha!"
18042,MISHA,92, Katya!
18043,KATYA,92," Misha, this is Jerry."
18044,MISHA,92," Ah, yes. The ""co-me-dian"", eh? (speaks in Romanian to 
        Katya)"
18045,KATYA,92," (laughs, replies in Romanian while pointing at Jerry)"
18046,ELAINE,92," (on phone) Oh, yes, yes I'll tell him. Yes, thank you. Um, um 
        hold on. (to Pitt) Mr. Pitt!"
18047,MR. PITT,92, (staring at 3-D poster) I think I'm on to something!
18048,ELAINE,92," Mr. Pitt! The board of directors is on the phone. They've called 
        an emergency meeting. They want you to be there to discuss the merger!"
18049,MR. PITT,92," You said keep your eyes out of focus, which is misleading. 
        You want DEEP focus!"
18050,ELAINE,92," (on phone) Yes, hi. Okay, fine, yeah, hold on just a second. 
        Lemme just... (reaches into purse) Yeah, I've got it... (pulls out both 
        hands completely covered in black ink) Oh! Oh! Yeah, yeah, he'll be there. 
        (drops phone, rushes to Pitt) Mr. Pitt, you have GOT to stop staring at 
        that poster!"
18051,MR. PITT,92," I see something that could be a spaceship. Is it round? Is 
        it pointy?"
18052,ELAINE,92," (grabs poster, smashes it) No, you don't see it, and you're never 
        going to see it! (grabs Pitt by the lapels, getting ink all over his jacket) 
        Mr. Pitt, you have to meet with the shareholders, you have to leave now. 
        Do you hear me? Do you hear me?!"
18053,MR. PITT,92," Hmm, what's happened to me? (straightens lapels) When's the 
        meeting?"
18054,ELAINE,92, In about twenty minutes.
18055,MR. PITT,92," Oh! (puts finger to face, smearing ink on his upper lip which 
        now resembles an ""Adolph Hitler""-style moustache) Do I have 
        time to change?"
18056,ELAINE,92," Um, no."
18057,MR. PITT,92," Well, excuse me, I'd better get straight over there."
18058,ELAINE,92," Uh, Mr. Pitt..."
18059,MR. PITT,92, Yes?
18060,ELAINE,92," Um, there's a just... (points at her own upper lip)"
18061,MR. PITT,92, (sees Elaine's hands covered in ink) Is that ink?
18062,ELAINE,92, No?
18063,GEORGE,92," Well, here we are."
18064,LINDSAY,92, Do you want to come in? My mother's having a little party.
18065,GEORGE,92, Maybe I could just use the bathroom.
18066,LINDSAY,92, Sure.
18067,ANNOUNCER,92," (voiceover) Ladies and gentlemen, could I direct your attention 
        to the center ring, where the incomparable Misha will balance ten stories 
        above the circus floor on a wire no wider than a human thumb."
18068,MISHA,92, It is time.
18069,JERRY,92," Well, break a leg."
18070,JERRY,92," Eh, show biz..."
18071,ANNOUNCER,92," Ladies and gentlemen, the incomparable Misha!"
18072,JERRY,92," Boy, those capes are really coming back."
18073,PARTY GUEST,92," (exits bathroom, finds George waiting) Oh, sorry I took 
        so long. They've got one of those 3-D art posters in there. (wipes eyes) 
        It's mesmerizing."
18074,JERRY,92, What is that sound?
18075,KATYA,92, (covering ears) It is horrible!
18076,GEORGE,92," Whew! Anybody see that poster in there? That is weird, wild stuff, 
        huh? Whew!"
18077,MR. PITT,92," I have been accused of wrong-doing. But these false accusations 
        will not deter us. We WILL annex Poland by the Spring, at any cost! AND... 
        our stock will rise HIGH! (raises hand)"
18078,KATYA,92," He'll be all right. I must go and be with Misha now. I don't want 
        you to come with me."
18079,JERRY,92," Oh, why not?"
18080,KATYA,92," It has been three days since our night together. Misha said that 
        was all the time I needed to put in."
18081,JERRY,92, Really?
18082,KATYA,92," In my country, they speak of a man so virile, so potent, that 
        to spend a night with such a man is to enter a world of such sensual delights 
        most women dare not dream of. This man is known as the ""Comedian"". 
        You may tell jokes, Mr. Jerry Seinfeld, but you are no Comedian. (walks 
        off)"

"
18085,JERRY,96, Ready to go Lois?
18086,LOIS,96, You really like to say my name? Don't you?
18087,JERRY,96, Excuse me Lois. Stand back Lois. Jimmy's in trouble Lois.
18088,LOIS,96," Oh, Mr. Meyers this is my friend, Jerry."
18089,DUNCAN,96, Jerry Seinfeld!
18090,JERRY,96, Duncan Meyers!
18091,LOIS,96, You two know each other?
18092,DUNCAN,96," Yeah! We uh, went to High School together. Didn't we "
18093,LOIS,96, Would you be able to come all the way downtown again in rush 
18094,JERRY,96," Well, I'd have to be Superman to do that Lois."
18095,ELAINE,96," No, no This is all wrong. Where's the Chicken Cashew?"
18096,LEW,96, You no order Chicken Cashew.
18097,ELAINE,96, I didn't order any of this. I'm not paying for this.
18098,LEW,96, Fine Benes. We are putting you on our list.
18099,ELAINE,96, What list?
18100,LEW,96," The ""do not deliver"" list."
18101,ELAINE,96," MERRY CHRISTMAS TO YOU! Well, I guess we'll just go out."
18102,GEORGE,96, Yeah. What are you doing with the Daily Worker?
18103,ELAINE,96, Ned must have left it here.
18104,GEORGE,96, Your boyfriend reads the Daily Worker? What is he? A 
18105,ELAINE,96," HE reads everything, you know, Ned's very well read."
18106,GEORGE,96," Maybe he's just ""very well RED""?"
18107,ELAINE,96, Communist? Don't you think he probably would have told 
18108,GEORGE,96," Well, does he wear bland, drab, olive colored clothing?"
18109,ELAINE,96," Yes, . . . yes he does dress a little drab."
18110,GEORGE,96," Huh, he's a communist. . . . Look at this. ""Exciting "
18111,JERRY,96, Hi oh.
18112,ELAINE,96, Where's Lois?
18113,JERRY,96, She couldn't make it.
18114,GEORGE,96, I can't believe you're really going out with a woman named 
18115,JERRY,96," I know, finally. But George, guess who her boss is. Duncan Meyers."
18116,GEORGE,96, Duncan Meyers? 
18117,ELAINE,96, Who's he?
18118,JERRY,96," Elaine, only one other person in the world knows what I am about 
        to tell you and that's George. When we were in the ninth grade they had 
        us all line up at one end of the school yard for this big race to see 
        who was going to represent the school in this track meet."
18119,ELAINE,96, Uh uh
18120,JERRY,96," I was the last one on the end. George was next to me. And Mr. 
        Bevilacqua, the gym . . . "
18121,ELAINE,96, What's that?
18122,JERRY,96," Mr. Bevilacqua, the gym teacher."
18123,ELAINE,96," Oh, of course."
18124,JERRY,96," He was down at the other end. So he yells out, ""Ready, On 
        your mark, Get set, "" and I was so keyed up I just took off. By the 
        time he said go I was ten yards ahead of everybody."
18125,ELAINE,96, No.
18126,GEORGE,96, I looked up. I couldn't believe it.
18127,JERRY,96," By the time the race was over I had won. I was shocked nobody 
        had noticed the head start."
18128,ELAINE,96, Really?
18129,JERRY,96, And I had won by so much a myth began to grow about my 
18130,ELAINE,96, Well what happened when you raced him again?
18131,JERRY,96," I never did. In four years of high school I would never race anyone 
        again. Not even to the end of the block to catch a bus. And so the legend 
        grew. Everyone wanted me to race. They begged me. The track coach called 
        my parents. Pleading. Telling them it was a sin to waste my god given 
        talent. But I answered him in the same way I answered everyone. I chose 
        not to run. "
18132,ELAINE,96, So now Duncan is back? 
18133,JERRY,96, He's back. And I knew he would be someday. (drinks) Man 
18134,LOIS,96,Hi.
18135,JERRY,96, Hi.
18136,LOIS,96, Sorry I missed the Chinese food.
18137,JERRY,96," Oh, so am I . Uh, how's Duncan?"
18138,LOIS,96, He's okay.
18139,JERRY,96, He say anything?
18140,LOIS,96, About what?
18141,JERRY,96," Oh, nothing in particular."
18142,LOIS,96, . . . Why did you cheat in that race? 
18143,JERRY,96, I did not cheat.
18144,LOIS,96, He said that you got a head start.
18145,JERRY,96," Oh, he's just jealous because he came in second."
18146,LOIS,96, Really?
18147,JERRY,96, Yes
18148,LOIS,96, So you WERE the fastest kid in school.
18149,JERRY,96, Faster than a speeding bullet Lois.
18150,ELAINE,96," So how was work? Another day, another dollar?"
18151,NED,96, I guess.
18152,ELAINE,96," Oh well nothing wrong with that. Gotta make those big bucks. 
        . . . money money money money money money money . . . ha ha ha ha ah . 
        . . are you a communist?"
18153,NED,96," Yes, as a matter of fact I am."
18154,ELAINE,96," OH, AH! OH! WOW! WHOA! A COMMIE! Wow, gee, man it must be a bummer 
        for you guys what with the fall of the soviet empire and everything ."
18155,NED,96," Yeah, well, we still got China, and Cuba, "
18156,ELAINE,96," Yeah, but come on . . . "
18157,NED,96, I know it's not the same. 
18158,ELAINE,96," Well, you had a good run, what was it 75, 80 years? Wreaking 
        havoc, making everybody nervous. "
18159,NED,96," Yeah, we had a good run. "
18160,ELAINE,96," Well, so enjoy yourself. (clink glasses) ha ha uh ha"
18161,GEORGE,96, So you lied to her?
18162,JERRY,96," I couldnt tell her the truth. I don't know what's going 
        to happen between us. What if we have a bad breakup. She'll go straight 
        to Duncan. And I want him to go to his grave never being certain I got 
        that "
18163,ELAINE,96," Well, I'm dating a communist."
18164,JERRY,96," Wow, a communist. That's something."
18165,ELAINE,96," Yeah, that's pretty cool isn't it?"
18166,GEORGE,96," Hey, did I tell you I called one of those girls from the personal 
        ads in The Daily Worker?"
18167,JERRY,96, The Daily Worker has personal ads?
18168,GEORGE,96, And they say appearance is not important.
18169,ELAINE,96, Yours or hers?
18170,KRAMER,96, Ho Ho Ho Ho Ho Merry Christmas everyone. Merry Christmas.
18171,JERRY,96," Wow, look at you. So you got the job."

        store."

18179,JERRY,96," Hello, Oh hi Lois, you want to get together, what for? I don't 
        know about that, I'll have to think about it. I'll let you know. Okay, 
        bye."
18180,GEORGE,96, What's up?
18181,JERRY,96," Duncan wants to get together with her and me for lunch tomorrow. 
        He obviously wants me to admit I got a head start. And I don't think she 
        believes me."
18182,GEORGE,96," He wants to meet you? I'll tell you what. I'll show up. He doesn't 
        know we're friends. I'll pretend I haven't seen you since High School. 
        I'll back up the story."
18183,JERRY,96, That's not bad.
18184,GEORGE,96, Not bad? It's gorgeous!
18185,KRAMER,96," Ho ho ho Well come on little Princess, tell Santa what you want. 
        Don't be shy."
18186,MoMICKEY,96, She doesn't speak English (with a Swedish accent).
18187,KRAMER,96," Santa speaks the language of all children. A notchie watchie 
        dotchie do."
18188,KRAMER,96," A dotchie cotchie dochie, "
18189,KRAMER,96," Het, Mickey when do we get a break? My lap is killing me."
18190,MICKEY,96, There is no break.

18192,KRAMER,96," Hey, hey, hey."
18193,ADA,96, Natalie on line 2.
18194,GEORGE,96, Natalie?
18195,ADA,96, From the Daily Worker.
18196,GEORGE,96, Thank you. 
18197,GEORGE,96," Hello, it's Natalie? Yeah, this is a business office but I'm 
        not a business man per se. I'm here working for the people. Yes, I'm causing 
        dissent. Stirring the pot. Getting people to question the whole rotten 
        system."
18198,ILENE,96, Elaine.
18199,ELAINE,96, Ilene.
18200,ILENE,96, Hi.
18201,ELAINE,96, Hello.
18202,ILENE,96, Doing a little Christmas shopping?
18203,ELAINE,96," Yeah, yeah. Oh, this is Ned. He's a communist."
18204,ILENE,96," Oh, really?"
18205,ELAINE,96," Yep . . . a big communist, a big big communist."
18206,ILENE,96," Oh, well, it's awfully nice to see you. See you later."
18207,ELAINE,96, Bye bye
18208,ELAINE,96," Hey, listen while we're here why don't we do a little shirt shopping? 
      "
18209,NED,96, Out of the question.
18210,ELAINE,96, Um. Kramer!
18211,KRAMER,96, Hi
18212,ELAINE,96," Hi, oh hi Mickey, this is Ned"
18213,KRAMER,96," Oh, hey, hi buddy."
18214,ELAINE,96," You guys stay here, I'll be right back."
18215,KRAMER,96," Eight hours of jingle belling and ho ho hoing. Boy, I am ho'd 
        out."
18216,NED,96, Anyone who works here is a sap.
18217,MICKEY,96, Watch it! 
18218,KRAMER,96," Woah, woah, come on."
18219,NED,96," You understand the Santa's at Bloomfields are making double what 
        you are?"
18220,KRAMER,96, Double?
18221,NED,96, I bet the beard itches doesn't it?
18222,KRAMER,96, You got that straight.
18223,NED,96," So when you get a rash all over your face in January do you think 
        Coleman's will be there with a "
18224,MICKEY,96," Look, you take that commie crap out into the street."
18225,NED,96," Kramer, I've got some literature in my car that will change your 
        whole way of thinking."
18226,KRAMER,96, Talk to me baby.
18227,MICKEY,96," Don't listen to him Kramer, you've got a good job here."
18228,DUNCAN,96," But there's no way you could have beaten me by that much. I already 
        beaten you in Junior High School three times."
18229,JERRY,96," I didn't hit puberty til the 9th grade. That's what gave me my 
        speed. Besides, if I got a head start why didn't Mr. Bevilacqua stop the 
        race?"
18230,DUNCAN,96, That's what I've always wondered about.
18231,JERRY,96," Well, I . . . [sees George]"
18232,GEORGE,96," Oh, my God, No, oh my God, . . . Jerry!"
18233,JERRY,96," I'm sorry, uh, "
18234,GEORGE,96," George, George Costanza!"
18235,JERRY,96," Oh, George Costanza , Kennedy High."
18236,GEORGE,96, Yes yes yes This is unbelievable.
18237,DUNCAN,96," Hi, George "
18238,GEORGE,96," Oh, wait a minute, wait a minute, don't tell me, don't tell me. 
        It starts with a . . . Duncan Meyers. Oh, wow, this is something. I haven't 
        seen you guys in what, twenty years? "
18239,JERRY,96, This is Lois. 
18240,LOIS,96, Hello.
18241,GEORGE,96, So what have you been doing with yourself?
18242,JERRY,96, I'm I'm a comedian.
18243,GEORGE,96," Ah ha, well, I really wouldn't know about that. I don't watch 
        much TV. I like to read. So what do you do, a lot of that ""did you 
        ever notice?"" this kind of stuff."
18244,JERRY,96," Yeah, yeah "
18245,GEORGE,96, It strikes me a lot of guys are doing that kind of humor now.
18246,JERRY,96," Yeah, yeah, Well, you really got bald there, didn't you? "
18247,GEORGE,96," Yeah, yeah."
18248,JERRY,96, You really used to have a think full head of hair.
18249,GEORGE,96," Yeah, yeah. Well, I guess I started losing it when I was about 
        twenty-eight right around the time I made my first million. You know what 
        they say. The first million is the hardest one."
18250,JERRY,96," yeah, yeah."
18251,LOIS,96, What do you do? 
18252,GEORGE,96, I'm an architect.
18253,LOIS,96, Have you designed any buildings in New York?
18254,GEORGE,96, Have you seen the new addition to the Guggenheim? 
18255,LOIS,96, You did that?
18256,GEORGE,96, Yep. And it didn't take very long either.
18257,JERRY,96, Well you've really built yourself up into something. 
18258,GEORGE,96," Well, well, I had a dream, Jerry. "
18259,JERRY,96," Well, one cannot help[ but wonder what brings you into a crummy 
        little coffee shop like this."
18260,GEORGE,96," Well, I like to stay in touch with the people."
18261,JERRY,96," Ah, you know you have a hole in your sneaker there. What is that 
        canvas?"
18262,GEORGE,96," You know my driver's waiting, I really should get running. Good 
        to see you guys again."
18263,JERRY,96," George, George, hang on. I haven't seen you in so long. "
18264,GEORGE,96," Ha, uh, "
18265,JERRY,96," I thought we might reminisce a little more. You know Duncan and 
        I were just taking about the big race. "
18266,GEORGE,96," Oh, the big race."
18267,JERRY,96, Yeah. 
18268,GEORGE,96," Yes, yes,."
18269,LOIS,96, You were there?
18270,GEORGE,96," Yes, sure, surely was. Yeah, I'll remember that day. Well I'll 
        never forget it because that was the day that I uh, lost my virginity 
        to Miss. Stafford, the uh, voluptuous home room teacher."
18271,DUNCAN,96, Miss Stafford?
18272,GEORGE,96," Yes, yes, you know I was in detention and she came up behind 
        me while I was erasing the blackboard . . . "
18273,JERRY,96, George! 
18274,GEORGE,96," But I digress. Let me see, now. You were standing at one end 
        of the line and I was right next to you. And I remember we were even for 
        like, the first five yards and then , BOOM,...You were gone. "
18275,JERRY,96, Did I get a head start? 
18276,GEORGE,96," Head start, oh no absolutely not."
18277,JERRY,96, You satisfied? So you see?
18278,DUNCAN,96," No, I'm still not convinced and I never will be."
18279,LOIS,96,Why don't the two of you just race again?
18280,DUNCAN,96, That's a good idea.
18281,JERRY,96," No, no, no, another race - out of the question. "
18282,DUNCAN,96," I know, you've been saying that for twenty years because you 
        know you can't beat me. You couldn't beat me then and you can't beat me 
        now. "
18283,LOIS,96, Race him Jerry. Race him. 
18284,JERRY,96, All right! I'll do it. The race is on.
18285,ELAINE,96, . . . shut up! (?)
18286,JERRY,96," And he's calling all these people from High School to come and 
        watch. I knew this day would come. I can't do it. I can't go through with 
        it. I'm calling it off. I can't let the legend die. It's like a kid finding 
        out there's no Santa Claus "
18287,KRAMER,96," Each according to his ability, to each according to his needs. 
      "
18288,MICKEY,96, What does that mean?
18289,KRAMER,96," Well, if you've got needs and abilities that's a pretty good 
        combination."
18290,MICKEY,96, So what if I want to open up a delicatessen? 
18291,KRAMER,96, There are no delicatessens under Communism.
18292,MICKEY,96, Why not?
18293,KRAMER,96," Well, because the meats are divided into a class system. You 
        got Pastrami and Corned Beef in one class and Salami and Bologna in another. 
        That's not right."
18294,MICKEY,96, So you can't get Corned Beef?
18295,KRAMER,96," Well, you know, if you're in the Politburo, maybe."
18296,GEORGE,96," (on phone) . It's George Costanza. . are there any messages for 
        me? Why does Mr. Steinbrenner want to see me in his office? . . . Communist? 
        I'm not a Communist . . . . All right, all right. All right, I'll be there. 
        - ( hangs up ) My secretary Ada, told Mr Steinbrenner I'm a Communist 
        Now he wants to see me "
18297,JERRY,96, So you'll just explain to him you're not a Communist. 
18298,NED,96, I'm sorry Elaine. The shirt's too fancy.
18299,ELAINE,96," Just because you're a communist, does that mean you can't wear 
        anything nice? You look like Trotsky. It's gorgeous. Fine, you want to 
        be a Communist, be a Communist. Can't you at least look like a successful 
        Communist? "
18300,NED,96," All right, I'll try it on."
18301,ELAINE,96, I'm going to order Chinese Food.
18302,NED,96," You're ordering from Hop Sing's, right?"
18303,ELAINE,96," Ugh, does it have to be Hop Sing's. I kind of had a fight with 
        him."
18304,NED,96," Elaine, when my father was black listed he couldn't work for years. 
        He and his friends used to sit at Hop Sing's every day figuring out how 
        to survive."
18305,ELAINE,96, You're father was blacklisted? 
18306,NED,96," Yes he was, and you know why? Because he was betrayed by people 
        he trusted. They ""named names"". "
18307,ELAINE,96," Okay, okay. (phones) Um, yeah, hi, I'd like delivery please to 
        16 West 75th St. apartment 2G."
18308,LEW,96," I know that address. You're Benes, right. You're on our list. No 
        more delivery."
18309,ELAINE,96," No. no, she doesn't live here anymore. This is someone else. 
      "
18310,LEW,96," Oh, yeah. What's the name?"
18311,ELAINE,96, Why do you need the name? You already have the address. 
18312,LEW,96, We need a name. Give us a name.
18313,ELAINE,96," Okay, okay, Ned Isakoff."
18314,KID,96, I want a racing car set. 
18315,KRAMER,96," Ho ho ho ho A racing car set! Those are assembled in Tai Wan 
        by kids like you. And these Coleman pigs, they sell it at triple the cost."
18316,KID,96, But I want a racing car set.
18317,KRAMER,96," You see kid, you're being bamboozaled. These capatalist fat cats 
        are inflating the profit margin and reducing your total number of toys. 
      "
18318,KID,96," Hey, this guy's a COMMIE! "
18319,MICKEY,96," Hey, kid, quiet. Were did a nice little boy like you learn such 
        a bad word like that? Huh?"
18320,KID,96," Commie, Commie, Commie . . . (unknown) ."
18321,MICKEY,96," Santa is not a Commie. He just forgot how his good friend stuck 
        his neck out for him to get him a good job like this. Didn't he Santa! 
      "
18322,STORE MANAGER,96, Is there a problem here?
18323,KRAMER,96, ho ho ho ho.
18324,KID,96, This guy's a Commie. He's spreading propoganda.
18325,STORE MANAGER,96," Oh yeah? Well that's enough pinko! You're through. The 
        both of ya'"
18326,MICKEY,96, I got two kids in college. 
18327,KRAMER,96," You can't fire me, I'm Santa Claus. "
18328,STORE MANAGER,96, Not anymore. Get your skinny ass out of here.
18329,JERRY,96, Hi how are you?
18330,LOIS,96, . . . Fine. 
18331,JERRY,96, What's the matter? 
18332,LOIS,96," I just spoke to Duncan. He said if you don't race, he's going to 
        fire me."
18333,JERRY,96, What? He can't do that.
18334,LOIS,96," Yes he can. He controls the means of production. What are you going 
        to do Jerry?"
18335,JERRY,96, Don't worry Lois. I'll think of something.
18336,LEW,96," Ah, I knew it was you! You tried to trick Hop Sing! You are onour 
        list; Elaine Benes! And now you are on our list; Ned Isakoff. "
18337,Ned,96, You got me blacklisted from Hop Sing's?
18338,LEW,96, She named name! 
18339,GEORGE,96," You, uh, wanted to see me, Mr. Steinbrenner?"
18340,STEINBRENNER,96," Yes George, I did. Come in, come in. George, the wordaround 
        the office is that you're a Communist."
18341,GEORGE,96," C-Communist? I am a Yankee, sir, first and foremost."
18342,STEINBRENNER,96," You know George, it struck me today me that a Communistpipeline 
        into the vast reservoir of Cuban baseball talent could be thegreatest 
        thing ever to happen to this organization. "
18343,GEORGE,96, Sir?
18344,STEINBRENNER,96," You could be invaluable to this franchise. George,"
18345,GEORGE,96," Yes, sir. Yes sir, do my best."
18346,STEINBRENNER,96," Good, Merry Christmas George. And bring me back some of 
        those cigars in the cedar boxes, you know the ones with the fancy rings? 
        I love those fancy rings. They kind of distract you while you're smoking. 
        The red and yellow are nice. It looks good against the brown of the cigar. 
        The Maduro, I like the Maduro wrapper. The darker the better, that's what 
        I say. Of course, the Claro's good too. That's more of a pale brown, almost 
        like a milky coffee. (George exits) I find the ring size very confusing. 
        They have it in centimeters which I don't really understand that well..."
18347,MICKEY,96," That was quick! Nice job, Santa!"
18348,KRAMER,96," Yeah, "
18349,MICKEY,96, I knew that Commie stuff was going to get us in trouble. 
18350,KRAMER,96," Yeah, well I didn't realize that was such a sensitive issue."
18351,MICKEY,96," Communism, You didn't realize Communism was a sensitive issue? 
        What do you think has been going on in the world for the past 60 years? 
        Wake up and smell the coffee. "
18352,MICKEY,96, You sure did. Big time. 
18353,ELAINE,96, How do you feel?
18354,JERRY,96, I need a miracle. 
18355,DUNCAN,96," Now you're going to see what kind of liar you're mixed up with. 
      "
18356,LOIS,96, If he beats you I want a big raise. 
18357,DUNCAN,96," If he beats me, I'll not only give you a raise, I'll send you 
        to Hawaii for two weeks. "
18358,KRAMER,96," I parked in front of that restaurant . As soon as this race is 
        over I got to go to the airport."
18359,GEORGE,96," Okay, all right, all right."
18360,MR. BEVILACQUA,96, You ready boys?
18361,JERRY,96," Yes, Mr. Beviacqua"
18362,MR. BEVILACQUA,96," Okay, this is hoiw it works. You take your marks, I say, 
        READY - ON YOUR MARK - GET SET - and then fire. You got it?"
18363,MR. BEVILACQUA,96, READY - ON YOUR MARK 
18364,LOIS,96,So will you come to Hawaii with me Jerry?
18365,JERRY,96," Maybe I will , Lois. Maybe I will. "
18366,GEORGE,96," You wanted to see me, El Presidente?"
18367,CASTRO,96," Si, si. (a Spanish word I can't figure out) Come here. "
18368,GEORGE,96," Si, si."
18369,CASTRO,96, Ordinarily I would not grant such a request but I've heard you
18370,GEORGE,96, Muy sumpatico. Muy muy muy.
18371,CASTRO,96," Well good, then you can have your pick."
18372,GEORGE,96," Oh, oh!"
18373,CASTRO,96, They will play for your Yankees.
18374,GEORGE,96," Oh well, gracias El Commandante, gracias. Muy muy."
18375,CASTRO,96," And I would be honored if you would be my guest for dinner tonight 
        at the Presidential palace. There will be girls there and, I hear, some 
        pretty good food. Of course the problem with parties is you invariably 
        have to eat standing up which I don't care for but on the other hand I 
        don't like to balance a plate on my lap either. Once when I was at a party, 
        I put my plate on someone's piano. I assure you, if I had not been a dictator, 
        I would not have been able to get away with that one. "

18387,LANDIS,97, I was watching you play 
18388,ELAINE,97," Oh, I'm not very good."
18389,LANDIS,97, No. You exhibited a lot of grace out there.

18404,SANDY,97, I gotta get going.

              me."
18430,SANDY,97, (nods silently)

            "
18454,ELAINE,97, So you're concerned.
18455,GEORGE,97," Elaine, of course I'm concerned. I'm payin' for those meals.

              might never "

18512,ELAINE,97," augh, he's got a big match tomorrow with Ethyl Kennedy"
18513,JERRY,97, He needs a three hundred-dollar Bruline to beat Ethyl Kennedy?
18514,ELAINE,97, He'll only play with his racquet
18515,JERRY,97," Well, why don't you wait 'til she's not there on her lunch 
              hour and just"

18523,GEORGE,97," Oh, she's a Kramer. And uh, while I was there I uh happened 
              to pick up "
18524,ELAINE,97," Ah, I'm ready what?"
18525,JERRY,97, What is it?
18526,GEORGE,97, I uh got the first name.
18527,ELAINE,97, You found out Kramer's first name?
18528,GEORGE,97, That's right. You ready? 
18529,JERRY,97," We've been trying to get it out of him for ten years. What 
              is it?"
18530,GEORGE,97, Cosmo
18531,GEORGE,97, Cosmo
18532,ELAINE,97," Cosmo, Cosmo?"

              out of the bag."
18536,ELAINE,97, It's not such a bad name.
18537,KRAMER,97," Well you know all my life I've been running away from that 
              name. "
18538,LAURA,97, Yes?
18539,JERRY,97," Hi, is Sandy here?"
18540,LAURA,97," Hi, you must be Jerry. Sandy's in the shower. Do you want 
              to come in?"
18541,JERRY,97, I would except I forgot to bring a towel.
18542,LAURA,97, (laughs nicely)
18543,JERRY,97, So the roommate laughed at everything I said.
18544,GEORGE,97, Wow.
18545,JERRY,97," It was a great sounding laugh too, kind of lilting and feminine--none 
              of"
18546,JERRY,97, Yeah.
18547,GEORGE,97," Hate the big coarse ""ha."" Hate those."
18548,JERRY,97," And the worst part of course is that she also possessed 
              many of the"
18549,GEORGE,97, I see.
18550,JERRY,97," So as you can see, I've got a bit of a problem here."
18551,GEORGE,97," Well, if I hear you correctly--and I think that I do--my 
              advice to you"
18552,JERRY,97," Can't be done, huh?"
18553,GEORGE,97, The Switch?
18554,JERRY,97," ""The Switch."""
18555,GEORGE,97, Can't be done.
18556,JERRY,97, I wonder.
18557,GEORGE,97," Do you realize in the entire history of western civilization 
              no one has"
18558,JERRY,97, They didn't have roommates in the Middle Ages.
18559,GEORGE,97," Well, I'm sure at some point between the years 800 and"
18560,JERRY,97," The point is I intend to undertake this. And I'll do it 
              with or without"
18561,GEORGE,97," All right, dammit, I'm in."
18562,JERRY,97, I couldn't do it without you.
18563,GEORGE,97, All right. Let's get to work.
18564,GEORGE,97," All right. That's enough for today. You're tired. Get some 
              sleep. I'll see"
18565,JERRY,97," Aw, we can't do it, who are we kidding? It's impossible! 
              It's true! You"
18566,GEORGE,97, We'll come up with something.
18567,JERRY,97," Yeah, sure we will."
18568,GEORGE,97," All right. See you tomorrow. {George sighs, exits.}"
18569,GEORGE,97, I-I-I-I-I got it!!!!!
18570,GEORGE,97," All right. Let's go over it again, one more time."
18571,JERRY,97," All right. So I tell Sandy that I want to have a mnage 
               trois with her"
18572,GEORGE,97, That's right.
18573,JERRY,97," And you believe this course of action will have a two-pronged 
              effect."
18574,GEORGE,97, Keep going.
18575,JERRY,97," At this point, it is inevitable that she will seek out the 
              roommate to"
18576,GEORGE,97, Continue.
18577,JERRY,97," The roommate will then offer her friend the requisite sympathy 
              even as"
18578,GEORGE,97," A few days go by and a call is placed at a time when Sandy 
              is known to"
18579,GEORGE,97," You disappoint me, my friend. Sandy wants nothing to do 
              with you. She"
18580,JERRY,97, It's a perfect plan. So inspired. So devious. Yet so simple.
18581,KEITH,97, Can I help you?
18582,ELAINE,97," Uh, no, I'm OK."
18583,KEITH,97, Well then what are you doing with that racquet?
18584,ELAINE,97," Um, it's mine. Miss. Landis borrowed it."
18585,KEITH,97," Well, I'm sorry you can't take that, no no no.."
18586,ELAINE,97," No no no, I can. I can. It's mine. It's my racquet."
18587,KEITH,97," Look sweetheart I don't know who you are. I don't know what 
              you're doing"
18588,ELAINE,97, All right. I'm going I'm going
18589,KEITH,97, Not with ...
18590,ELAINE,97, Give it give it ..
18591,KEITH,97, Leave ...
18592,ELAINE,97," All right all right forget it. You don't have to mention 
              any of this to "
18593,KEITH,97, I don't have to but I will.

18697,Elaine,102," Yeah. This friend of a friend knows this banker guy, he's, 
              I don't know, 30 years, unbelievably"
18698,Jerry,102, Yes.
18699,Elaine,102," So anyway his boss has a box at the Met and he invited 
              us to see Swan Lake, which is fine, but he's"
18700,Jerry,102, Why are you doing this?
18701,Elaine,102," Swan Lake, at the Met."
18702,Kramer,102," Oh, Chinese food. I knew I smelled something."
18703,Elaine,102," Hey, is George still wearing that toupee?"
18704,Jerry,102, Yeah.
18705,Elaine,102, Doesn't he know how ridiculous he looks in that thing?
18706,Kramer,102, I think he looks fantastic.
18707,Elaine,102," Oh, come on."
18708,Kramer,102," No, I never realized what an attractive man he is."
18709,George,102," Hey, people, people, people, people, people. Not bad, huh? 
              Excuse me."
18710,Elaine,102, You look ridiculous in that thing.
18711,George,102," Is that so? Or could it be that you're just a *little* 
              bit worried that you may have missed the boat?"
18712,Elaine,102," Well I think they might have sutured that thing to your 
              brain."
18713,George,102," Ha ha ha ha, oh all right, go ahead, deride, deride if 
              you must. But let me tell you something, with "
18714,Kramer,102," You know I just thought of something. I know this gorgeous 
              woman, she called me up this"
18715,Jerry,102, Well what about me?
18716,Kramer,102, No I think he's got you beat buddy.
18717,George,102, So she's gorgeous.
18718,Kramer,102," Oh yeah, last time I saw her she was, five years ago."
18719,George,102, Well have you got a picture?
18720,Kramer,102, No.
18721,George,102," Well, I have to see her."
18722,Kramer,102," Hey, I know what we can do. I've got a friend who works 
              over at the police station. He's a"
18723,George,102, Really?
18724,Kramer,102," Yeah, yeah, maybe I can get him to draw a picture of her 
              for you."
18725,George,102, Oh I would love that. You think he'd really do it?
18726,Kramer,102," Yeah, yeah. I think he will."
18727,Jerry,102, It sounds like an excellent idea.
18728,Kramer,102," Hey Jerry, you want this, cause I'm going to give it to 
              a homeless person."
18729,George,102," Well I'm very excited about this. I've always wanted to 
              see how those sketch artists do it."
18730,Kramer,102, Here you go brother. Some food for you.
18731,Homeless man,102, Thank you. You're a good man. Bless you.
18732,Kramer,102, Now are you going to be here in an hour?
18733,Homeless man,102, Where am I going?
18734,Kramer,102," Oh that's good, that's good. Make the eyes, uh, what's 
              that nut?"
18735,Lou,102, Almond?
18736,Kramer,102, Almond. Yeah. Make the lips fuller. Poutier.
18737,George,102, Pouty? I like that.
18738,Jerry,102, You can't go wrong with pouty.
18739,George,102, I'm excited about the pouty.
18740,Lou,102, All right I think that about does it.
18741,Kramer,102," All right George, come on, take a look."
18742,George,102," Oh yeah, you were right. She's gorgeous."
18743,Jerry,102," Hey, Lou, who's that woman over there?"
18744,Lou,102," Oh, that's Sergeant Tierney. Nice officer. You want to meet 
              her?"
18745,George,102," Well this worked out okay. So are you going to see the 
              police woman?"
18746,Jerry,102," Yeah, I think I will. I like the idea of having the law 
              on my side."
18747,Kramer,102," Hey, man. Enjoy the food?"
18748,Homeless man,102," Yes I did. Where did the Chinese learn to cook like 
              that?"
18749,Kramer,102," Oh, listen, I'll take that Tupperware now."
18750,Homeless man,102, I don't think so. 
18751,Kramer,102," Woah, woah, that's mine."
18752,Homeless man,102, You gave it to me.
18753,Kramer,102," No, no, I didn't say you could keep it. You see I don't 
              give away tupperware."
18754,Homeless man,102, You should have said something.
18755,Kramer,102," I didn't think I had to. Look with a piece of Tupperware 
              you just assume."
18756,Robert,102, I've really got to thank you for this.
18757,Elaine,102," Well by now, you think people would be a little more open 
              minded."
18758,Robert,102, Really. Would you excuse me? I have to run to the bathroom.
18759,Boss' wife,102," So, um, you and Robert."
18760,Elaine,102, Yes indeed.
18761,Boss,102, I'm surprised.
18762,Elaine,102, Really. Why?
18763,Boss,102, No reason.
18764,Elaine,102," Well believe me this didn't happen overnight. Robert's 
              not exactly a *one* *woman* *man*, if "
18765,Elaine,102," Oh, hi honey."
18766,Elaine,102, Oh it was such a great night.
18767,Jerry,102, And did they suspect anything?
18768,Elaine,102," No, I was a fantastic beard. I held hands, I called him 
              honey."
18769,Jerry,102," And we discover yet another talent. Posing as a girlfriend 
              for homosexuals."
18770,Elaine,102, Oh it was such a great night. Oh.
18771,Jerry,102, You said that already.
18772,Elaine,102, Oh I did?
18773,Jerry,102, Yeah.
18774,Elaine,102, Oh.
18775,Jerry,102, Oh no. Don't tell me. You like him?
18776,Elaine,102, He's incredible.
18777,Jerry,102," Yeah, but?"
18778,Elaine,102," Yeah, I know."
18779,Jerry,102, So?
18780,Elaine,102, What?
18781,Jerry,102, Not conversion. You're thinking conversion?
18782,Elaine,102, Well it did occur to me.
18783,Jerry,102," You think you can get him to just change teams? He's not 
              going to suddenly switch sides. Forget "
18784,Elaine,102, Why? Is it irrevocable?
18785,Jerry,102," Because when you join that team it's not a whim. He likes 
              his team. He's set with that team."
18786,Elaine,102, We've got a good team.
18787,Jerry,102," Yeah, we do. We do have a good team."
18788,Elaine,102, Why can't he play for us?
18789,Jerry,102, They're only comfortable with *their* equipment.
18790,Elaine,102, We just got along *so* great.
18791,Jerry,102," Of course you did. Everyone gets along great when there's 

              no possibility of sex."
18792,Elaine,102," No, no, no, I sensed something. I did sense something. 
              I perceived a possibility Jerry."
18793,Jerry,102, You realize you're venturing into uncharted waters. 
18794,Elaine,102, I realize that.
18795,Jerry,102, Are you that desperate?
18796,Elaine,102, Yes I am.
18797,Jerry,102," So are you going to bring your gun?... All right, then it's 
              settled. First date, no weapons... All right"
18798,Jerry,102, What are you looking for?
18799,Kramer,102, Tupperware.
18800,Jerry,102, Sorry. I don't have any tupperware.
18801,Kramer,102," I knew this was going to happen. I just made a delicious 
              casserole, but now it won't keep because"
18802,Jerry,102, What about a plastic bag?
18803,Kramer,102, You must be kidding.
18804,Jerry,102, What is the difference?
18805,Kramer,102," The patented burp, Jerry. It locks in freshness."
18806,George,102, So I spoke a little to your little friend Denise last night.
18807,Kramer,102," Oh yeah, you talked to her."
18808,George,102, Yeah for two hours. She's nuts about you.
18809,Kramer,102, Yeah well we go way back.
18810,George,102, Why didn't anything happen between you two?
18811,Kramer,102, Who's to say it didn't?
18812,Jerry,102, So did you describe yourself to her over the phone?
18813,George,102, Yes I did.
18814,Jerry,102, What did you say to her?
18815,George,102, What do you think I said?
18816,Jerry,102, I don't know.
18817,George,102, I told her the truth.
18818,Jerry,102, As you see it?
18819,George,102," Yes, as I see it."
18820,Jerry,102," Did you tell her about, uh, your little hat there?"
18821,George,102, What hat?
18822,Jerry,102," You know, you're little hair hat there."
18823,George,102, No.
18824,Jerry,102, Don't you think she could tell?
18825,Kramer,102," No, no, no she can't tell. It's a perfect match. Beautiful 
              job."
18826,Jerry,102," Are you kidding? I could spot that bird's nest two blocks 
              away."
18827,George,102, You only think that because you know me.
18828,Jerry,102, Have you noticed people staring at your head?
18829,George,102," I noticed people staring at my head because they like what 
              they see."
18830,Jerry,102," Well I think you should either take it off or tell her about 
              it."
18831,Kramer,102," No he's not going to take it off. If he was going to go 
              over there bald, I never would have"
18832,George,102," Look, I guarantee she won't know."
18833,Kramer,102," Yeah that's it. All right, I'm going to go down to the 
              precinct. I'm going to have lunch with Lou."
18834,Jerry,102," Oh, I'll split a cab with you."
18835,Kramer,102, Hey I'm really sorry about the other day. Really sorry.
18836,Homeless man,102, Hey that's my coffee!
18837,Jerry,102, Hi Sarge.
18838,Tierney,102," Hi, I'm sorry I'm late. Some of our lineup decoys didn't 
              show. Hey any of you guys want to be in"
18839,Kramer,102, Sure. I will.
18840,Tierney,102, Perfect. Just go over there with officer Lampert.
18841,Over the speaker,102," All of you, turn to the left."
18842,Over the speaker,102, The left.
18843,Over the speaker,102, Now turn to the right.
18844,George,102," (thinking to himself) Oh my god, there she is. That's the 
              face, just like the picture."
18845,Denise,102, George?
18846,George,102, Yeah. Hi. It's great to meet you.
18847,Denise,102, Likewise. Have you been waiting long?
18848,George,102," No, no. I just got here. A few minutes ago."
18849,Denise,102," Good, good."
18850,George,102, Well why don't you take off your hat and stay awhile.
18851,Jerry,102, What's that?
18852,Tierney,102," A polygraph. It's what you civilians call a lie detector 
              test."
18853,Jerry,102," Oh. Let me ask you, when someone is lying, is it true that 
              their pants are actually on fire?"
18854,Tierney,102," If I could tell you the famous faces that have been up 
              here. A certain cast member of Melrose"
18855,Jerry,102, Really.
18856,Tierney,102, Have you ever seen the show?
18857,Jerry,102, No.
18858,Tierney,102, You can admit it Jerry. It's okay.
18859,Jerry,102, I admit it. I don't watch it.
18860,Tierney,102," Hey Lou, maybe we should put him on the poly."
18861,Jerry,102, The poly?
18862,Tierney,102, Yeah. I think you've seen it.
18863,Elaine,102, Melrose Place?
18864,Jerry,102, Yes. Melrose Place.
18865,Elaine,102, I just didn't know you watched that.
18866,Jerry,102, Well I do.
18867,Elaine,102," I mean every time I mention it you never say anything or 
              join in the conversation."
18868,Jerry,102, Well maybe I was a little embarrassed.
18869,Elaine,102," You mean this whole time we could have been discussing 
              Sydney and Michael and Jane..."
18870,Jerry,102," And Billy and Jake and Allison, yes we could have discussed 
              it."
18871,Elaine,102, Why? Why were you so embarrassed?
18872,Jerry,102," The point is I'm going to be taking this lie detector test 
              and that needle's going to be going wild."
18873,Elaine,102, That is *so* stupid. Why don't you just confess?
18874,Jerry,102," It's too stupid to confess. Look at what I'm confessing 
              to."
18875,Elaine,102, So what are you going to do?
18876,Jerry,102, I don't know. Maybe I can beat the machine.
18877,Elaine,102," Oh, who do you think you are? Castanza?"
18878,Jerry,102," Hey you know what? I have access to one of the most deceitful, 
              duplicitous, deceptive minds of our"
18879,Elaine,102, Oh god this tastes terrible.
18880,Jerry,102, Did you shake it up?
18881,Elaine,102, No.
18882,Jerry,102, You gotta shake it up.
18883,Elaine,102, No. I'm sick of shaking. You've got to shake everything.
18884,Jerry,102," Yeah, that's a real nuisance. This is killing me."
18885,Elaine,102," So, I'm going out tonight with Robert and the boss and 
              his wife."
18886,Jerry,102, So tonight are you going to make the move?
18887,Elaine,102," Yeah, I think I might."
18888,Jerry,102, Hey there he is. So what happened? Could she detect it?
18889,George,102, That's an interesting question.
18890,Jerry,102, How so?
18891,George,102, How so? I'll tell you how so. She's bald!
18892,Elaine,102, What do you mean bald?
18893,George,102, What do you think I mean bald? Bald. Bald bald.
18894,Jerry,102, She's bald?
18895,George,102, She's bald.
18896,Elaine,102, Oh come on.
18897,George,102," Oh come on? No come on. She took off her hat and there 
              she was (waving his hand over his"
18898,Elaine,102, Well maybe she got a haircut or something.
18899,George,102," Let me tell you something. No one walks into a beauty parlor 
              and says ""Give me the Larry Fine."""
18900,Jerry,102, Women go bald?
18901,Elaine,102," Yeah, I've heard of that. I mean they usually wear a wig."
18902,Jerry,102, Hey.
18903,Kramer,102, Hey.
18904,George,102, You fixed me up with a bald woman.
18905,Kramer,102, Bald?
18906,George,102," Yeah, that's right."
18907,Elaine,102," Do you see the irony here? You're rejecting somebody because 
              they're bald."
18908,George,102, So?
18909,Elaine,102, (puts her hands up to her mouth) You're bald!
18910,George,102, No I'm not. I *was* bald.
18911,George,102, Elaine.
18912,George,102," No, no, no Elaine."
18913,Elaine,102," (shouting) I don't like this thing. And here's what I'm 
              doing with it."
18914,George,102, Nooooo.
18915,Robert,102," Hahaha, why'd you start that fight with me?"
18916,Elaine,102, Well I figured that's what couples do.
18917,Robert,102, You almost convinced me we were a couple.
18918,Elaine,102, Well it was easy. Really.
18919,Robert,102," Well good night, I'll call you tomorrow."
18920,Elaine,102," Oh, uh, wait a second. Would you like to come, upstairs?"
18921,Robert,102, Upstairs?
18922,Elaine,102, Yeah. Upstairs?
18923,Robert,102, Elaine...
18924,Elaine,102," I was hoping you know, that you might be interested in... 
              changing teams?"
18925,Robert,102, Changing teams?
18926,Elaine,102, Have you ever thought about it?
18927,Robert,102, But I'm a starting shortstop.
18928,Elaine,102," Robert, we need a shortstop. *Real bad*."
18929,George,102," I tell you, when she threw that toupee out the window, 
              it was the best thing that ever happened to"
18930,Jerry,102, Good to have you back.
18931,George,102," And you know what else I've decided to do? I'm going to 
              keep seeing the bald woman."
18932,Jerry,102, She's as good as anybody else.
18933,George,102," Her scalp was clean. She had a nice skull. There just wasn't 
              a lot of hair on it."
18934,Jerry,102," Yeah you've had like a religious awakening. You're like 
              a bald-again."
18935,George,102, Going to need a little more coffee here.
18936,Jerry,102," So George, how do I beat this lie detector?"
18937,George,102," I'm sorry, Jerry I can't help you."
18938,Jerry,102," Come on, you've got the gift. You're the only one that can 
              help me."
18939,George,102," Jerry, I can't. It's like saying to Pavorotti, ""Teach 
              me to sing like you."""
18940,Jerry,102," All right, well I've got to go take this test. I can't believe 
              I'm doing this."
18941,George,102," Jerry, just remember. It's not a lie... if you believe 
              it."
18942,Elaine,102," Hey, I did it."
18943,Jerry,102, What?
18944,Elaine,102, I turned him. He defected.
18945,Jerry,102, Get out! (pushes Elaine) How? How did you do that?
18946,Elaine,102, Because I'm a *woman*. (swiveling her hips) Ba-ba-ba-boom-chicka-boom-chicka-boom-boom-
18947,Jerry,102," Elaine, do you know what you've done? You've give hope to 
              every woman who's ever said ""Too"
18948,Elaine,102," Well it's a lesson for the kids out there. Anything's possible. 
              Jeromy, I have *hit* the jackpot."
18949,Lou,102, What's your name?
18950,Jerry,102, Jerry Seinfeld.
18951,Lou,102, What is your address?
18952,Jerry,102, 129 West 81st street.
18953,Lou,102, Did Kimberly steal Jo's baby?
18954,Jerry,102, I don't know.
18955,Lou,102, Did Billy sleep with Allison's best friend?
18956,Jerry,102, I don't know.
18957,Lou,102," Did Jane's finance kidnap Sydney and take her to Las Vegas? 
              And if so, did she enjoy it?"
18958,Jerry,102, I don't know.
18959,Lou,102, Did Jane sleep with Michael again?
18960,Jerry,102," (He hesitates) Yes! That stupid idiot. He left her for Kimberly, 
              he slept with her sister. He tricked"
18961,Jerry,102, He went back? What do you mean he went back?
18962,Elaine,102, He went back.
18963,Jerry,102," I don't understand it. You were having such a great time, 
              the sex, the shopping."
18964,Elaine,102," Well here's the thing. Being a woman, I only really have 
              access to the, uh... equipment, what,"
18965,Jerry,102, You can't. That's why they lose very few players.
18966,Elaine,102," Yeah, I guess I never really stood a chance."
18967,Jerry,102," Well there's always a place for you, on our team."
18968,Elaine,102, Yeah. (teary-eyed) Thanks. Is Melrose Place on?
18969,Jerry,102, Yeah. It's coming on in a few minutes.
18970,Elaine,102, Okay.
18971,Jerry,102, Hey. Don't worry it hasn't started.
18972,Elaine,102," Hey George, I am *really* proud of you. I really do admire 
              what you've done."
18973,George,102, Do you? That makes me so happy. Elaine's proud of me Jerry.
18974,Elaine,102, What is the matter?
18975,George,102," I got rejected by a bald woman. A bald woman rejected me. 
              Heh, you like that one? A woman"
18976,Kramer,102," Well I'll tell you what I think. I think she saw you with 
              that piece off and was devastated. You"
18977,Elaine,102," I didn't ruin anything. He looked like an idiot. He did, 
              and it made him act like a jerk."
18978,Jerry,102," All right, shut up, shut up, Melrose Place is coming on."
18979,Jerry,102," Oh that Michael, I hate him, he's just so smug."
18980,Kramer,102," Hey, how you doing Stu? Eddie, my man. You again? Boy, 
              you're a slippery one. You'd better"
18981,Man,102," I've got an eyewitness to that jewelry store break-in. Come 
              here. Do you recognize anybody in the"
18982,Homeless man,102," That's the guy officer. The guy there in the middle. 
              The tall guy with the, with the high"
18983,Man,102," Hey you, you with the high hair, step forward."

18989,JERRY,103," Now, I was thinking the other day about hair, and that the weird 
      "
18990,GEORGE,103, Say it's Saturday night in Spain. They go out dancing. You 
18991,JERRY,103, I would think.
18992,GEORGE,103," So you could call a woman for a date, ask her if she's free for 
      "
18993,JERRY,103, (scoffs) You don't flamenco on the first date.
18994,GEORGE,103," Boy, I wish the flamenco was popular here."
18995,JERRY,103, Yeah? Would you do it?
18996,GEORGE,103," Yes, I think I would."
18997,JERRY,103," Well, I knew you'd have an affinity for it, because it's the "
18998,JERRY,103," Hello. (listens) Oh, hi Nana. (listens) What? Oh. Oh, alright, 
      "
18999,JERRY,103, I have to go over to my grandmother's.
19000,GEORGE,103, What for?
19001,JERRY,103, I have to open a bottle of ketchup for her.
19002,GEORGE,103," So, what, no lunch?"
19003,JERRY,103," No, we have time."
19004,GEORGE,103, Oh. How's she doing?
19005,JERRY,103," Ah, she's starting to slip a little. Sometimes she has "
19006,GEORGE,103," Ah. You know, there's gotta be an easier way to open ketchups. 
      "
19007,JERRY,103, Like toothpaste?
19008,GEORGE,103, Ya-hah.
19009,JERRY,103, There's a squeeze ketchup.
19010,GEORGE,103, I've seen squeeze mustard. I've never seen squeeze ketchup.
19011,JERRY,103," Well, if they make squeeze mustard, doesn't it stand to reason 
      "
19012,GEORGE,103, Not necessarily. Mustard lends itself to the squeeze.
19013,JERRY,103, I really don't see the difference.
19014,GEORGE,103," Oh, there's a difference. It's subtle."
19015,JERRY,103, It's subtle.
19016,GEORGE,103," Hey uh, isn't Elaine supposed to meet us?"
19017,JERRY,103," (looking ahead) Yeah, there she is. Uh-oh."
19018,GEORGE,103, What?
19019,JERRY,103," Ah, she's with her friend Wendy."
19020,GEORGE,103," Wendy? Is that the uh, physical therapist?"
19021,JERRY,103, Yeah. I'm on a kiss hello program with her.
19022,GEORGE,103, Really?
19023,JERRY,103," Yeah. Every time I see her, I gotta kiss her hello. I just did 
      "
19024,ELAINE,103, (from a distance) Hey.
19025,GEORGE,103," You know, I'm down to one kiss hello. My aunt Sylvia."
19026,JERRY,103," Ah, that's fortunate. I really admire that."
19027,GEORGE,103, (surprise) Huh. I never heard you say you admire me for 
19028,JERRY,103," No, I told you I admire your hearing."
19029,JERRY,103," No, don't slough that off, you have great hearing."
19030,GEORGE/JERRY/ELAINE/WENDY,103, Hey/Hi/Hello (etc.)
19031,ELAINE,103," (to Wendy) Wendy, George. (to George) Wendy."
19032,GEORGE,103," You're uh, physical therapist, right?"
19033,WENDY,103, Yes.
19034,GEORGE,103," You know, I got this little swelling right here. (rolls up his 
      "
19035,ELAINE,103, (warning) George.
19036,WENDY,103, Have you tried heat and ice on it?
19037,GEORGE,103," (reluctant) Oh that uh, that seems like a lotta trouble."
19038,WENDY,103," Well, you could come by my office later, I could work on it for 
      "
19039,GEORGE,103, (happy) Oh! Okay.
19040,WENDY,103, Let me give you my card.
19041,GEORGE,103," Oh, thank you."
19042,WENDY,103," Well, I'll see you guys later. (to George) Nice meeting you. Bye 
      "
19043,ELAINE,103, Bye Wendy. I'm sorry.
19044,WENDY,103, Bye Jerry.
19045,JERRY,103, Bye.
19046,ELAINE,103, (slapping George on the arm) What did you do that for?
19047,GEORGE,103, What?
19048,ELAINE,103, (pinching George's arm) Ask about your arm.
19049,GEORGE,103, I still don't see why I can't ask her about my arm.
19050,ELAINE,103," She's a physical therapist. She doesn't want to have to deal 
      "
19051,GEORGE,103, Why not?
19052,ELAINE,103," Because, it is what she does."
19053,GEORGE,103," I love these people, you can't ask 'em questions. (getting "
19054,ELAINE,103," George, you got a little something, right here."
19055,GEORGE,103, (wiping the area with a hand) People think they're so 
19056,JERRY,103," (adamant) Well, I'm going on record right now that that was my 
      "
19057,ELAINE,103, Why?
19058,JERRY,103," Well, you know, frankly, outside of a sexual relationship, I "
19059,GEORGE,103, (regarding the menu) What're you getting?
19060,JERRY,103," (to Elaine) And what's with that hairdo, by the way?"
19061,ELAINE,103," Huh, yeah, I know. It's not very flattering."
19062,JERRY,103," She looks like something out of an old high school yearbook. You 

"
19063,ELAINE,103," Oh, I could never say anything to her about that."
19064,JERRY,103, Yeah. Kramer's the only person who could say something like 
19065,ELAINE,103, Yeah. Hah.
19066,GEORGE,103," Well, just tell Kramer to tell her."
19067,ELAINE,103," No. If you tell him to do it, he'll never do it."
19068,JERRY,103," What you have to do is introduce him, and then he'll just come 
      "
19069,ELAINE,103," (sharp intake of breath) Hoh. Yes, yes, you're right. That's 
      "
19070,ELAINE,103, (to Kramer) ...Kramer.
19071,KRAMER,103," Hello, boys and girls."
19072,JERRY,103, Speak of the devil.
19073,KRAMER,103," Yeah. Hey listen, I uh, I need a picture of you, buddy."
19074,JERRY,103, What for?
19075,KRAMER,103," Well, I'm uh, I'm putting everybody's picture up in the lobby 
      "
19076,JERRY,103, Why?
19077,KRAMER,103," So everyone will know everybody's name. See, people are gonna 
      "
19078,JERRY,103," (reluctant) I, I don't want my picture plastered up in the "
19079,KRAMER,103," Imagine walking by someone on the floor, and you say ""Hey, 
      "
19080,JERRY,103," (still reluctant) Kramer, I don't wanna stop and talk with "
19081,KRAMER,103," (to Elaine) You know your eyeliner's smudged a little. Why do 
      "
19082,ELAINE,103," (to Jerry, indicating Kramer) Yeah. This is gonna work out just 
      "
19083,LEO,103, Ma! Again with the ketchup? Don't they have 'em in the plastic 
19084,LEO,103, (traditional greeting) Jerry! Hello!
19085,JERRY,103," Hello, uncle Leo!"
19086,LEO,103, What're you doing here?
19087,JERRY,103, Nana called me to open the ketchup bottle.
19088,LEO,103," Yeah, me too."
19089,NANA,103, Hello Jerry.
19090,JERRY,103, Hi Nana.
19091,LEO,103, Aren't you gonna kiss her hello?
19092,JERRY,103, Yes. (kisses Nana) Yes of course.
19093,NANA,103," Ha, well, here's the bottle."
19094,LEO,103, (grabbing the bottle) I'll do it.
19095,JERRY,103," (also grabbing) What're you doing, I got it."
19096,LEO,103, Give it to me.
19097,JERRY,103, Will you stop it.
19098,LEO,103," Jerry, will you give me the bottle?"
19099,JERRY,103, Uncle Leo! (releasing his grip) Alright! Take it!
19100,NANA,103, You should let Buddy open it.
19101,LEO,103, Buddy? He lived next door to us forty-five years ago.
19102,NANA,103," Leo, did you give Helen the fifty dollars?"
19103,LEO,103, What fifty dollars?
19104,NANA,103," Your father won a thousand dollars at the track last week, and 
        he "
19105,LEO,103," Ma, dad died in nineteen-sixty-two."
19106,LEO,103, (laughing off Nana's confusion) Believe me. I don't owe your 
19107,JERRY,103, I'm just not getting any hot water.
19108,JULIO,103," Hey, believe me, I know there's nothing worse than when your "
19109,JERRY,103," Thanks, Julio."
19110,JULIO,103, Awright.
19111,JERRY,103, Huh?
19112,KRAMER,103," (surprised) Hey, hey hey hey. Hello!"
19113,JERRY,103, What's going on here?
19114,KRAMER,103," (evasive) Ohh, nothing, nothing."
19115,JERRY,103," (suspicious) Well, then what're you doing?"
19116,KRAMER,103," Oh, I, I need a pen."
19117,JERRY,103, What for?
19118,KRAMER,103," Well, I'm making out my will. Oh, I got a big slice of dough 
      "
19119,JERRY,103," (accusingly) You're looking for a picture of me, aren't you?"
19120,KRAMER,103, You got that straight.
19121,JERRY,103," I told you, forget it."
19122,KRAMER,103," Oh, come on, Jerry. If everybody knew everybody, we wouldn't 
      "
19123,JERRY,103, You're robbing me.
19124,KRAMER,103," Well, I'm gonna get your picture, and you're gonna participate 
      "
19125,ELAINE,103, Wha... W.. Are you going home?
19126,KRAMER,103, Yeah.
19127,ELAINE,103," Uh, could you come back in about five minutes?"
19128,KRAMER,103, Why?
19129,ELAINE,103, No reason. (big smile) Just wanna see you again.
19130,JERRY,103, (removing his coat) So? Are you sure Wendy's coming?
19131,ELAINE,103," Yeah, she'll be here any second."
19132,JERRY,103," Well, this'll be a very interesting experiment to see if Kramer 
      "
19133,ELAINE,103," Listen, Jerry. She never dates, and I know it's because of her 
      "
19134,JERRY,103," Hello. Oh, hi mom. Yeah, I was at Nana's yesterday. I had to "
19135,MORTY,103, Do you know what the interest on that fifty dollars comes to 
19136,HELEN,103," Oh, Morty, please."
19137,MORTY,103," Six hundred and sixty-three dollars and forty-five cents. And 
      "
19138,HELEN,103," Morty, will you stop it!"
19139,MORTY,103," (determined) Well, he's not getting away with this!"
19140,JERRY,103, Yeah?
19141,WENDY (O.C.),103, Wendy.
19142,JERRY,103, Come on up.
19143,ELAINE,103," Well, this is it. Shall I go get Kramer?"
19144,JERRY,103," No no, he'll come in. Well, this is gonna be my first "
19145,ELAINE,103, What is the big deal about putting your lips on somebody's 
19146,JERRY,103," It's the obligation, you know? As soon as this person comes in, 
      "
19147,ELAINE,103, How 'bout an intercourse hello? How would that be?
19148,JERRY,103," Elaine, now you're being ridiculous."
19149,ELAINE,103, (indicating) That's her. That's her.
19150,ELAINE/WENDY,103, Hi/Hey.
19151,JERRY,103, (muffled) Hi Wendy.
19152,WENDY,103," Oh, hi Jerry."
19153,JERRY,103, (muffled) Would you like something to drink?
19154,WENDY,103, Sure.
19155,JERRY,103, (muffled) There you go.
19156,WENDY,103, (taking the bottle) Ah.
19157,JERRY,103," Oh, look at that. I'm almost outta Klondike bars."
19158,JERRY,103," So, how's everything going?"
19159,WENDY,103," Oh, okay. Oh, your friend George came by the office the other 
      "
19160,JERRY,103," Oh, yeah, he had to take his mother to the chiropodist."
19161,ELAINE,103," Oh, you hear that? That must be Kramer."
19162,KRAMER,103, Hey! Jerry!
19163,JERRY,103," C'mon, that's not fair!"
19164,KRAMER,103, I told you I was gonna get it.
19165,JERRY,103," No, c'mon Kramer. (crossing to Kramer) Gimme that picture."
19166,KRAMER,103, (holding the picture away from Jerry) Aagh. No no no no no.
19167,JERRY,103," (throws up his hands) Alright, fine. Put my picture up. What do 
      "
19168,ELAINE,103," Uh, Kramer. Kramer, I'd like you to meet my friend Wendy."
19169,KRAMER,103," Oh, hello."
19170,WENDY,103, (holds out her hand) Hi.
19171,KRAMER,103, (shaking hands) Yeah.
19172,KRAMER,103," (points) You know, I really like that hairdo."
19173,WENDY,103," (flattered) Oh. Thank you. I actually was thinking it might be 
      "
19174,ELAINE,103," (hopeful) Oh, you were?"
19175,WENDY,103," Well, I..."
19176,KRAMER,103," (interrupting) Oh, no no no. You don't wanna do that. No no. 
      "
19177,ELAINE,103," Kramer, if she wants to change her hair..."
19178,KRAMER,103," No, no. you'd be a damn fool to change it. It's very becoming."
19179,WENDY,103," Oh, well."
19180,WENDY,103," (laughs, flattered) Oh, ho."
19181,WENDY,103," So, who's that friend of yours? That guy that came in."
19182,ELAINE,103," Oh, Kramer."
19183,WENDY,103, Yeah. Does he have a girlfriend?
19184,ELAINE,103, You wanna go out with him?
19185,WENDY,103," Well, why not?"
19186,ELAINE,103," Well, it's just that... uh, I don't..."
19187,WENDY,103," What, is there anything wrong with him?"
19188,WENDY,103, Elaine?
19189,ELAINE,103, I'm just thinking about the question.
19190,GEORGE,103," You know, my arm feels a lot better. That Wendy really knows 
      "
19191,RECEPTIONIST,103, (perky) She is super. Same time tomorrow.

19193,RECEPTIONIST,103," Oh. Ah, you owe a hundred and fifty."

19196,GEORGE,103," (agitated) Well, I, I couldn't come. I, I had to drive my "
19197,WENDY,103, What's the problem?
19198,GEORGE,103, (harassed) Are you aware that I'm being charged for Tuesday's
19199,WENDY,103," Well, I'm sorry, that's our policy."

      "
19201,RECEPTIONIST,103, So. Will you be here tomorrow?
19202,GEORGE,103," Well, it's less than twenty-four hours, so I guess I have to!"
19203,KRAMER,103, Hey! (indicating photos) So what d'you think? You like it?
19204,JERRY,103," Oh my god! Look at that picture, it's terrible..."
19205,JERRY,103, ...You can't put that picture up.
19206,KRAMER,103," Well, it's not a beauty contest. It's just a way for people to 
      "
19207,STEVE,103, Hey Cosmo.
19208,KRAMER,103, Hey...
19209,KRAMER,103," ...Steve. (to Jerry) Ah, you see?"
19210,ELAINE,103," Hey Kramer, my friend Wendy wants to go out with you."
19211,KRAMER,103," (interested) Well, how do you do?"
19212,MARY,103," Hello, (finds the right photo) Jerry."
19213,JERRY,103," Oh. Hello, uh (looks for and finds the photo) Mary."
19214,MARY,103," You know, I've seen you so many times and now we can finally talk 
      "
19215,KRAMER,103, (keen) What was I telling you? Isn't this nice?
19216,JERRY,103, (not really) Yeah.
19217,MARY,103," Jerry. You know, could you help me with a package?"
19218,JERRY,103," Oh, sure, yeah."
19219,MARY,103, Thank you.
19220,JERRY,103," Oh, no!"
19221,JERRY,103, You see? That's just what I need. More kissing!
19222,ELAINE,103," (laughs) Hee, hee, hee. Hee hee hee..."
19223,JERRY,103, What is so funny?
19224,ELAINE,103," Nothing, nothing. (laughs out loud)"
19225,JERRY,103," Hello. Oh, hi mom. (listens) What? Oh my... He didn't?! He "
19226,JERRY,103, (aghast) Uncle Leo put Nana in a home!
19227,ELAINE,103, Why?
19228,JERRY,103, (suspicious) I don't know. Maybe to keep her quiet.
19229,JOAN,103, Hi Jerry. (she kisses Jerry) Mmmwah.
19230,JERRY,103, (not as eager) Hi Joan.
19231,JOAN,103, How you doing?
19232,JERRY,103, Pretty good.
19233,JOAN,103, Just pretty good? Not great?

20025,Kramer,107," [whistles]. He's good. He's *very* good. He worked on this 
              kid"
20026,George,107," Hey, Kramer, what are you doing Tuesday?"
20027,Kramer,107, Tuesday? Uh...
20028,George,107," Why doesn't *he* pick you up after the operation. He's 
              got the car"
20029,Estelle,107," Oh, I don't care."
20030,Kramer,107," Yeah, I know, but I can't drive anybody anywhere until 
              I go down to"
20031,George,107," Well, giddy-up!"
20032,Kramer,107," Yeah, I'm here to pick up my new plates. My name is Kramer. 
              Cosmo"
20033,Clerk,107, Kramer.... [checks computer] All right...
20034,Kramer,107, All righty...
20035,Clerk,107," Sign right here, please. [hands over clipboard]"
20036,Kramer,107," [signs it] Okay. [The clerk hands him a manila envelope]. 
              Thanks."
20037,Clerk,107, What's your name again?
20038,Kramer,107, Cosmo Kramer.
20039,Clerk,107, [checks computer again] Cosmo Kramer. You *are* the Assman.
20040,Kramer,107, No! I'm not the Assman.
20041,Clerk,107," Well, as far as the state of New York is concerned, you 
              are."
20042,David,107, How do you feel?
20043,Elaine,107, Fine.
20044,David,107, Something the matter?
20045,Elaine,107, No.
20046,David,107, Then what is it?
20047,Elaine,107," No, nothing."
20048,Jerry,107, Hi.
20049,Elaine,107, I was with David *Putty* last night. 
20050,Jerry,107," Yeah, so."
20051,Elaine,107, He did the move.
20052,Jerry,107, What move?
20053,Elaine,107, You know...*the* move.
20054,Jerry,107, Wait a second. *My* move?
20055,Jerry,107, David Putty used *my* move?
20056,Elaine,107," Yes, yes."
20057,Jerry,107, Are you sure?
20058,Elaine,107," Jerry! There is no confusing *that* move with any other 
              move."
20059,Jerry,107, I can't believe it. He *stole* my move.
20060,Elaine,107," What else did you tell [reaches over to slap Jerry] him. 
              [does it"
20061,Jerry,107," Oh, it wasn't like that! I didn't even mention you. You 
              know, we"
20062,Elaine,107, Because of all the pistons and the lube jobs?
20063,Jerry,107," Well, I'm going down to that garage and telling him to stop 
              doing it."
20064,Elaine,107," Well, wait---wait a second."
20065,Jerry,107, What?
20066,Elaine,107, Isn't that a little...rash?
20067,Jerry,107, No! He stole my move!
20068,Elaine,107," Yeah, but...*I* like the move."
20069,Jerry,107," Yeah, but it's like another comedian stealing my material."
20070,Elaine,107," Well, he doesn't even do it exactly the same. He--he--he 
              uses a"
20071,Jerry,107," Oh, yeah. The pinch. *I've* done the pinch. That's not new."
20072,Elaine,107," You know, it's strange, because he's such an honest mechanic."
20073,Jerry,107," I know, he's probably the only honest mechanic in New York."
20074,Jerry,107, ...so he stole my move and he's using it on Elaine.
20075,George,107," You told David Putty your move and you didn't tell *me*? 
              I *need* a"
20076,Jerry,107, Can I just get it opened first?
20077,George,107," I can't believe you're hoarding sex moves. I'm out there 
              rubbing"
20078,Jerry,107," All right, all right. Here. [hands George a piece of the 
              candy"
20079,George,107," [takes a bite] Oh, that's good. That's very good."
20080,Jerry,107, You feel better?
20081,George,107," Yeah, much better. All right, so what's the move, because 
              I need"
20082,Jerry,107, Nancy Klopper?
20083,George,107," Yeah. Never seen anyone so bored. I'm working like a dog 
              here."
20084,Jerry,107," All right, George. I'm gonna tell you. But I just wanna 
              make sure,"
20085,George,107," Yeah, yeah, yeah. It's in the vault. I'm putting it in 
              the vault."
20086,Jerry,107," It's not even a question of that. The point is when something 
              like"
20087,George,107, You're gonna tell me...or not.
20088,Jerry,107," All right. On your bed. You got a headboard? You'll need 
              a"
20089,George,107, I got a headboard.
20090,Jerry,107, Is it padded?
20091,George,107, No.
20092,Jerry,107, Good. How tall is she?
20093,George,107, Five-foot four. Why?
20094,Jerry,107," You can't have more than a one-foot differential in your 
              heights."
20095,George,107, I can't tell ya how much I appreciate this.
20096,Jerry,107," George, if you could master this, you'll never be alone 
              again."
20097,[Back at Jerry's apartment,107," Jerry and George have just walked in, 
              still"
20098,Jerry,107," Now, the ending is kind of an option. I use the swirl. I 
              like the"
20099,George,107, Is it a clockwise swirl?
20100,Jerry,107," I prefer clockwise, but it's not written in stone."
20101,Kramer,107," Here you go, buddy. [shows it to Jerry]."
20102,Jerry,107, What is it?
20103,Kramer,107," *Fusilli* Jerry! It's made from Fusilli pasta. See the 
              microphone?"
20104,Jerry,107, When did you do this?
20105,Kramer,107," In my spare time. [turns to George]. You know, I'm working 
              on one"
20106,Jerry,107, Oh... Why Fusilli?
20107,Kramer,107, Because *you're* silly. Get it? [hands the Fusilli to Jerry]
20108,Jerry,107," Well, thank you very much."
20109,George,107," So, did you get your new plates?"
20110,Kramer,107," Oh...yeah. I got my new plates. But they mixed them up. 
              Somebody"
20111,George,107, What do they say?
20112,Kramer,107, Assman.
20113,Jerry,107, Assman?
20114,Kramer,107," Yeah. Assman, Jerry. I'm Cosmo Kramer, the Assman!"
20115,Jerry,107," Who would order a license plate that says ""Assman""?"
20116,George,107, Maybe they're Wilt Chamberlain's.
20117,Jerry,107," It doesn't have to be someone who gets a lot of women. It 
              could be"
20118,Kramer,107," Yeah, or it could be a proctologist."
20119,Jerry,107, Yeah. Proctologist.
20120,George,107, Come on! No doctor would put that on his car.
20121,Kramer,107," Have you ever *met* a proctologist? Well, they usually 
              have a very"
20122,the same way,107," ""It was a million to one shot, Doc. Million 
              to one."""
20123,Kramer,107, Oh! There's my phone. [He leaves]
20124,George,107," So, where you gonna stick this [points to the Fusilli Jerry]"
20125,Jerry,107, I'll tell you where I'd like to stick it.
20126,Jerry,107," Hey, David."
20127,David,107," Oh, hi, Jerry."
20128,Jerry,107," Hey, what's the story? I hear you're doing my move."
20129,David,107, What move?
20130,Jerry,107," What move? *My* move. The one I told you about. You used 
              it on"
20131,David,107," You're move? What, are you kidding? I was doing that before 
              I knew"
20132,Jerry,107," The ending is the whole thing. Without the ending, it's 
              nothing."
20133,David,107," Oh, that ending was *so* obvious. I would have figured it 
              out"
20134,Jerry,107, Swirl.
20135,David,107, Whatever. I don't even do it.
20136,Jerry,107," Oh, yeah, I know. You do the *pinch*."
20137,David,107," Yeah, that's right."
20138,Jerry,107," You can't come up with your own stuff , so you *steal* other 
              peoples?"
20139,David,107," Are you through, 'cuz, uh, I gotta get back to work."
20140,Jerry,107," Well, I'll tell you what I'll do, you know. If you wanna 
              do it out"
20141,David,107," All right, how about the next time your car breaks down, 
              you take"
20142,Jerry,107, Fine.
20143,David,107, Good!
20144,Nancy,107," Ow, George! [crawls out from beneath the covers] What are 
              you"
20145,George,107," [pops his head out of the covers, looking a bit confused] 
              Uh...you"
20146,Nancy,107," Well, stop it!"
20147,George,107, You don't like the move?
20148,Nancy,107, No. I don't.
20149,George,107, You're kidding.
20150,Nancy,107," No, I'm not. It feels like aliens poking at my body."
20151,George,107, Sorry. I'll just go back to my usual routine.
20152,Elaine,107," Oh, god! Oh, god, Dave! Oh, yes! Yes!"
20153,David,107," No, I'm sorry."
20154,Elaine,107, What?!!
20155,David,107, I can't do the move.
20156,Elaine,107, What?
20157,David,107," Oh, he's ruined it for me."
20158,Elaine,107," Oh, oh, come on, please?"
20159,David,107," No, he called me a hack. I'm just not into doing it anymore."
20160,Elaine,107," Oh, so---so that's it?"
20161,David,107, I'll come up with some new stuff.
20162,Kramer,107," ""Call me. Thirty-six, twenty-four, forty-six. I think 
              I have what"
20163,Dr. Bakersoll,107," I must caution you about one thing. You can't cry 
              for at"
20164,Estelle,107," Oh, okay."
20165,Dr. Bakersoll,107," Now, is someone coming to pick you up?"
20166,Estelle,107," Yes, my son's friend should be here any minute."
20167,Security Guard,107, Can I help you?
20168,Kramer,107," Ah, yeah. Doctor Cosmo Kramer. [points to plate] Proctology."
20169,Security Guard,107," Oh, oh, okay. Sure..."
20170,Kramer,107, Thanks. Have a good day.
20171,Kramer,107, I just can't get over how fantastic you look.
20172,Estelle,107," Oh, really?"
20173,Kramer,107," Oh, yeah. This takes twenty years off."
20174,Estelle,107, And it was all done by laser. I don't even need bandages.
20175,Estelle,107," Did he say ""Assman""?"
20176,Kramer,107," Oh, yeah."
20177,Estelle,107, Oh my goodness.
20178,[Another car passes,107," ""Hey, the Assman's in town!""]"
20179,Kramer,107, You got that straight!
20180,Estelle,107, Boy. I never dreamed it could make such a difference.
20181,Jerry,107," You must have done *something* wrong. You probably screwed 
              up the"
20182,George,107, Supposed to close with the swirl?
20183,Jerry,107," Oh my god. Yes, you close with the swirl. There's a progression"
20184,George,107," Yeah, yeah, should've written it down."
20185,Jerry,107, Yeah?
20186,Buzzer,107, Elaine.
20187,Jerry,107," C'mon up. [turns to George] You know what? Do me a favor. 
              Don't"
20188,Jerry,107," Hello? Yeah, this is Jerry Seinfeld. What? Twenty-eight 
              hundred"
20189,George,107," What's to think about? If Putty says it's what it is, it's 
              what it"
20190,Jerry,107, Except that it's not Putty.
20191,George,107, What happened to Putty?
20192,Jerry,107," Eh, we had a little fight about the move. I took her to 
              this other"
20193,George,107," Well, of course they're trying to screw you. What do you 
              think?"
20194,Jerry,107," Hey, Elaine."
20195,Elaine,107," Yeah, yeah, hello."
20196,Jerry,107, Is it something I said?
20197,Elaine,107," Yes! As a matter of fact! David Putty won't do the move 
              anymore."
20198,Jerry,107, Really?
20199,Elaine,107," Oh, he's come up with some other move. You should see this 
              thing."
20200,Jerry,107, What is it?
20201,Elaine,107," Oh, it's a lot of just fancy-shmancy stuff. You know what 
              it's"
20202,Jerry,107, Huh.
20203,Elaine,107," I mean, this move is no good, Jerry. It's just taking up 
              a lot of"
20204,George,107, Let me ask you a question. This new move. Is there a knuckle
20205,Elaine,107," Yes. As a matter of fact, there is."
20206,George,107, I think that's mine.
20207,Elaine,107, I'm not surprised.
20208,Jerry,107," Listen. I need you to do me a favor. When's the next time 
              you're"
20209,Elaine,107, Why?
20210,Jerry,107," You gotta get an estimate on my car from him. I think this 
              garage is"
20211,Elaine,107, An estimate? How am I supposed to do that?
20212,Jerry,107," Well, look. Here's the work order with everything that broke. 
              Just"
20213,Elaine,107," [takes the work order and points to the Fusilli Jerry sitting 
              on the"
20214,Jerry,107," That's, uh, Fusilli Jerry."
20215,Elaine,107, Fusilli Jerry?
20216,Jerry,107, Yeah. Kramer made it.
20217,George,107," All right, listen, I'll see you guys later."
20218,Jerry,107," Hey, Assman!"
20219,Kramer,107," Hey, well, this is Sally."
20220,Sally,107, Hello.
20221,Jerry,107, Hi.
20222,Elaine,107, Hi.
20223,Kramer,107, Shall we go?
20224,Sally,107," Okay. [turns around and walks out with an exaggerated swing 
              of her"
20225,Estelle,107, You can't face the fact that I'm improving myself.
20226,Frank,107," You're not the only one improving yourself. I worked out 
              with a"
20227,Estelle,107, Just take your mail and go home. I have things to do.
20228,Frank,107," I got things to do, too."
20229,Estelle,107, Don't upset me! I can't cry!
20230,Frank,107," Getting an eye job like some Manhattanite, huh?"
20231,Estelle,107," Well, it's already working. Kramer made a pass at me."
20232,Frank,107, Kramer made a pass at you? You're crazy.
20233,Estelle,107, I'm not crazy. He stopped short and made a grab.
20234,Frank,107, He stopped short? That's my move. I'm gonna kill him!
20235,Elaine,107," Hey, let me ask you a question."
20236,David,107, Sure.
20237,Elaine,107, What do you charge for blown shocks?
20238,David,107, What?
20239,Elaine,107," Two, three hundred?"
20240,David,107, I don't know. Maybe five hundred.
20241,Elaine,107, Ah. 
20242,Elaine,107, What about a bad gasket?
20243,David,107, Bad gasket?
20244,Elaine,107, Yeah. Like a terrible gasket.
20245,David,107, What is all this?
20246,Elaine,107," Nothing, nothing. I'm just taking an interest in what you...do."
20247,David,107, What kind of car is it?
20248,Elaine,107, Oh...any kind of---of a Swedish car.
20249,David,107," All together, that could run about sixteen hundred."
20250,Elaine,107, Oh.
20251,Elaine,107, Is that with the parts and labor?
20252,David,107, Uh-huh.
20253,Elaine,107, Hmm.
20254,Elaine,107," Oh, no. No, David. No, please. Not the knuckle...."
20255,Nancy,107, Wow. That was...*great*. I mean...*wow*.
20256,George,107, It just came to me.
20257,Nancy,107, I---I've never in my life have---have I---. What was that?
20258,George,107, You mean in the end?
20259,Nancy,107, Uh-huh.
20260,George,107, A counter-clockwise swirl.
20261,Nancy,107, What's that?
20262,George,107, What?
20263,Nancy,107, On---on your hand? Let me see what's on your hand.
20264,George,107, Nothing. I don't know...just a little dirt.
20265,Nancy,107," Give me that. [grabs his hand] I wanna see what's on your 
              hand."
20266,Nancy,107," Number one. Take her leg.... Oh, my god! Crib notes? You've 
              got"
20267,George,107, It's a very complicated move! I couldn't remember it all.
20268,Nancy,107," Oh, my god, you're sick. [gets out of bed]"
20269,George,107," You know, it's not the S.A.T.s!"
20270,Frank,107," Assman? I'll get him, Assman!"
20271,Jerry,107," Sixteen hundred dollars? That's all? *Ooh*, they are ripping 
              me"
20272,Elaine,107, So what are you going to do?
20273,Jerry,107," Well, that's it. I'm going back to Putty. No move is worth 
              this."
20274,Elaine,107," Oh! You mean you don't care if he does the move anymore? 
            "
20275,Jerry,107," Are you kidding? He can do every move I've ever done! Do 
              you know"
20276,Jerry,107," Hi, Mr. Constanza. What's uh...?"
20277,Frank,107, Where's your friend Kramer?
20278,Jerry,107, I don't know. Why?
20279,Frank,107, Because I'm looking for him. That's why. He stopped short.
20280,Jerry,107, What do you mean?
20281,Frank,107," In a car, with my wife. He stopped short. You think I don't 
              know"
20282,Jerry,107," Really, stopping short. That's a good move."
20283,Frank,107, You're not kidding it's a good move!
20284,Kramer,107, Hey.
20285,Jerry,107, Hey.
20286,Kramer,107," Hey, Frank."
20287,Frank,107," Don't Frank me! I know what you did. How dare you stop short 
              with"
20288,Kramer,107," C'mon, Frank, relax. I don't even know what you're talking 
              about. "
20289,Frank,107," You think I don't know, Assman?!! To think I almost split 
              the"
20290,Kramer,107, Bro.
20291,Frank,107, Manssierre!
20292,Kramer,107, Bro!
20293,Frank,107, Manssierre! You...!
20294,Frank,107, Aah!!!
20295,Jerry,107," Oh, my god!"
20296,Jerry,107," If I wasn't there, I wouldn't have believed it."
20297,Elaine,107, Me either.
20298,George,107, They say this guy's the best.
20299,Jerry,107, He had to use cork-screw pasta.
20300,Kramer,107," Jerry. Jerry, come here. Take a look at this."
20301,Kramer,107, The name on the boat. Look at it.
20302,Jerry,107, Assman!
20303,Kramer,107," Yeah [points towards the doctor's office], he's the Assman! 
              Jerry,"
20304,Doctor,107, Which one is the son?
20305,George,107, [stands up] I am.
20306,Doctor,107," Ah. I'm Doctor Cooperman. I just want you to know that 
              this won't"
20307,Kramer,107," Yeah, excuse me, uh... You didn't by any chance recently 
              get the"
20308,Dr. Cooperman,107," Yes. I'm still waiting for the motor vehicle bureau 
              to"
20309,Kramer,107, So...you're the Assman.
20310,Frank,107," It was a million to one shot, Doc. Million to one."
20311,Estelle,107," Where have you been?!! You were supposed to fix the stove! 
              I've"
20312,Frank,107, I fell on some Fusilli.
20313,Estelle,107, Fusilli?
20314,Frank,107," You know, the corkscrew pasta. It was a Fusilli Jerry. It 
              got stuck"
20315,Estelle,107, The proctologist? Are you okay?
20316,Frank,107, Yeah.
20317,Estelle,107," Oh, I was so worried. [grabs a couple of tissues from 
              the box]"
20318,George,107," Ma, don't cry!"
20319,Estelle,107," Oh, I can't help it!"
20320,George,107," Ma, your eyes!"
20321,Estelle,107, Oh!
20322,Cast,108,
20323,Jerry,108," What time does your flight get in? Six? All right, that 
              gives us six hours. Then I'll meet you at the diplomat's club. I'll 
              be the one without the big red sash. Okay, see you tonight. (Hangs 
              up)"
20324,Elaine,108, Is that the supermodel?
20325,Jerry,108," Yep, she's not gonna be back for a month, but I got six 
              hours."
20326,Elaine,108, I thought you had a show in Ithaca.
20327,Jerry,108," I do, but it's three o'clock and then I'm flying right back 
              and meeting Bridget at the Diplomat's Club in the airport."
20328,Elaine,108," Well, guess what I'm doing. I'm going to Mr. Pitt's, and 
              I am telling him that I am quitting."
20329,Jerry,108, So that's it? You know I never even met the guy. 
20330,Elaine,108, I've had enough. I am marchin' in.
20331,Jerry,108, You're marchin' in.
20332,Elaine,108, I'm marchin'. (Enter George)
20333,George,108, Hey.
20334,Jerry,108, Hey. Elaine's quitting.
20335,George,108, Really?
20336,Elaine,108, I'm marchin' in.
20337,George,108, I've done the march in. Best feeling in the world.
20338,Jerry,108, How 'bout the march out?
20339,George,108," Not as good. That's when you realize all the money you're 
              losing."
20340,Elaine,108, This is it. Wish me luck.
20341,Jerry,108, Get a march goin'! March it! (She exits)
20342,George,108," Jerry, I need to borrow your camera."
20343,Jerry,108, Why?
20344,George,108," Well, I wanna put a picture of me and my boss Mr. Morgan 
              up at the office."
20345,Jerry,108, What for?
20346,George,108," They're reorganizing the staff, and I'm on thin ice with 
              this guy as it is. "
20347,Jerry,108, Isn't putting this guy's picture on your desk a little transparent?
20348,George,108, It better be.
20349,Elaine,108," Mr. Pitt, I have something to tell you."
20350,Pitt,108, One second Elaine.
20351,Elaine,108, Mr. Pitt...
20352,Pitt,108," Elaine, you know what I just did? I just amended my will 
              to include you as a beneficiary."
20353,Elaine,108, What?
20354,Pitt,108," Well, I think of you as part of my family. You've come to 
              be like a daughter to me and I want to make sure you're taken care 
              of after I'm gone."
20355,Elaine,108, (Flattered) Mr. Pitt...
20356,Pitt,108," (Sneezes) Elaine, I feel a cold coming on. Could you get 
              me a cold pill from the medicine cabinet?"
20357,Elaine,108," Oh no no, Mr. Pitt, you mustn't. You have to check with 
              the pharmacy before you combine anything with your heart medicine,"
20358,Pitt,108," Yes, yes, I'll check with the pharmacist."
20359,Elaine,108," We don't want anything to happen to you Mr. Pitt. We want 
              you to live a long, long time."
20360,George,108," (Holding camera) Look at this, I only have one picture 
              left... How 'bout a shot of me and Mr. Morgan?"
20361,Morgan,108, Why?
20362,George,108," Why? Because we're a team! C'mon! Would you take this for 
              us, dear? Thank you very much. Here we go... (To Morgan) Anyone 
              ever tell you you look a lot like Sugar Ray Leonard? Yeah, you must 
              get that all the time."
20363,Morgan,108," I suppose we all look alike to you, right Costanza?"
20364,George,108," No, not a racial thing, there really is a resemblance... 
            "
20365,Jerry,108, Maybe he looks a little like Sugar Ray Leonard.
20366,George,108, A little? Come on.
20367,Jerry,108," Well, you still shouldn't have said it."
20368,George,108, You think Morgan thinks I have a racial bias?
20369,Jerry,108, Maybe.
20370,George,108," Boy, that is so unfair. I would've marched on Selma if it was
              in Long Island."
20371,Jerry,108, You'd have marched on Great Neck?
20372,George,108," Absolutely. I still might. I always hated those girls. They
              would never date me."
20373,Kramer,108, Hey.
20374,Jerry,108," Hey, there you are."
20375,Kramer,108, So you ready?
20376,George,108, For what?
20377,Jerry,108, He's taking me to the airport. But we've got a few minutes.
20378,Kramer,108," Oh, yeah. What? You got no luggage?"
20379,Jerry,108," This is it. I'm only going for the day. I just gotta drop by the
              drugstore and pick up a toothbrush."
20380,Kramer,108, Okay.
20381,George,108," Hey, Kramer. Who does that look like?"
20382,Kramer,108, I don't know.
20383,George,108, No. Sugar Ray Leonard.
20384,Kramer,108," Oh, no way."
20385,George,108," All right, I'll tell you what. I'll bet you the next three people I
              ask... two of them will say Sugar Ray."
20386,Kramer,108, How much? $ 100? $200? $ 1000?
20387,Jerry,108," Hey wait a second, what are you doing? You're not betting.You
              know he's not supposed to bet."
20388,Kramer,108," Come on, Jerry, it's a lock."
20389,Jerry,108," Kramer, you've had this thing under control for almost three
              years now. Don't start again."
20390,Kramer,108," But it's a lock, Jerry!"
20391,Jerry,108, No!
20392,Jerry,108, What're you doing about Morgan?
20393,George,108," You know what would be great? If he could see me with
              some of my black friends."
20394,Jerry,108," Yeah except you don't really have any black friends. Outside of
              us, you don't have any white friends either."
20395,Joe,108, Yes?
20396,George,108," Hello, Joe?"
20397,Joe,108, Who is this?
20398,George,108, It's me. George Costanza.
20399,Joe,108, Who?
20400,George,108," Remember I was here a while back? Breakfast at Tiffany's
              together?"
20401,Joe,108, What do you want?
20402,George,108," Well, I've rented another video, Joe. And there's some
              popcorn. I thought we could do it again."
20403,Joe,108, Go away.
20404,George,108, Remy. Hi.
20405,Remy,108, You?!? What are you doing here?
20406,George,108," Well, I got another Audrey Hepburn movie."
20407,Joe,108," Remy, is that you?"
20408,Remy,108," Daddy, that man is here again."
20409,Joe,108," Remy, I want you up here instantly."
20410,George,108," You know, Remy, I was thinking. Last time we were
              together, you..."
20411,Jerry,108, That's great. You know what? Leave it. Just pull the car around
20412,Kramer,108, You sure?
20413,Jerry,108," Yeah. I'll take care of it. Just throw that in there, would you?"
20414,Mr. Pitt,108," Excuse me. I take heart medication. What would you
              recommend for a runny nose?"
20415,Jerry,108, Take an antihistamine.They're over there.
20416,Mr. Pitt,108, It's all right to take?
20417,Jerry,108," Yeah, they're great."
20418,Mr. Pitt,108, What about appetite suppressants?
20419,Jerry,108," I just saw them. Oh, here. Here you go."
20420,Mr. Pitt,108," Thank you, young man."
20421,Jerry,108," Have a good day, sir."
20422,Kramer,108, This is your swanky Diplomat's Club.
20423,Jerry,108, I don't see Katie anywhere.
20424,Kramer,108," What's this, a fellow club member?"
20425,Jerry,108," No, she's this woman who's booking me on these college
              tours. She thinks I'm some big celebrity that has to be pampered and
              explained every little thing."
20426,Kramer,108, Yeah. I'm gonna get some snacks before my flight.
20427,Katie,108, Jerry.
20428,Jerry,108," Oh, hi, Katie."
20429,Katie,108, You found the airport all right?
20430,Jerry,108," Yes, I followed the planes."
20431,Katie,108," I see you're having coffee. Just so you know, they also have
              decaf as well. Along with a selection of cocktails and soft..."
20432,Jerry,108, Thanks. Thanks for telling me.
20433,Elaine,108, What's going on?
20434,Women,108," I'm Lenore Walker, Mr. Pitt's estate lawyer. I arrived
              to discuss his will and found Justin had collapsed on the floor."
20435,Elaine,108, Oh my God.
20436,Woman,108, Who are you?
20437,Pitt,108, This is the girl I want to put in my will. Elaine...
20438,Man,108," Please, rest Mr. Pitt."
20439,Woman,108, You're the assistant? Why weren't you taking care of him?
20440,Elaine,108," Well, he gave me the morning off, I was doing a little... 
              shopping. How did this happen?"
20441,Elaine,108," Mr. Pitt, you were s'posed to talk with the pharmacist."
20442,Pitt,108, I spoke to someone who worked there.
20443,Elaine,108, I'm gonna go and call that pharmacist. (She exits)
20444,Woman,108, How well do you know her?
20445,Katie,108," Jerry, listen, just so you know, before we take off they're 
              gonna tell us what to do in the vent of a crash-"
20446,Jerry,108," Yes, I know. I've flown before."
20447,Katie,108," Oh good. I just didn't want you to freak out... The chance 
              of a crash is very slim. Do you have to go to the bathroom?"
20448,Jerry,108, No.
20449,Katie,108," (Pause) Because even if you have (Jerry gets up to go) to 
              go a little you'd better go now because you won't get another chance 
              until way after take off."
20450,Kramer,108," Hey, how you doin'?"
20451,Earl,108, Pretty good.
20452,Kramer,108, Name's Kramer.
20453,Earl,108," Earl Hafler, nice to meet you. I'm headed to Houston, where 
              you headed?"
20454,Kramer,108," Oh I'm happy right here. Isn't this place amazing? Planes 
              flying in from all corners of the world, and they know the minute 
              they're arriving."
20455,Earl,108," Ah they don't know a darn thing. That's why my flight the 
              Houston's been delayed. They're all morons. Matter of fact, I'll 
              bet you that that flight to Pittsburgh takes off before my flight 
              to Houston."
20456,Kramer,108," Bet? Um, not betting."
20457,Earl,108, Friendly wager.
20458,Kramer,108," I haven't made a bet in three years, I-"
20459,Earl,108," Ah c'mon. Keep things interesting, pass the time."
20460,Kramer,108," Okay, how much?"
20461,Earl,108, How 'bout 200?
20462,Kramer,108," You're on, cowboy!"
20463,George,108, How ya doin'?
20464,Man,108, Okay.
20465,George,108, Nice day today.
20466,Man,108, What?
20467,George,108," I'm George. George Costanza, you live around here?"
20468,Intercom,108, Now arriving at gate 12...
20469,Earl,108, This could be Mexico City.
20470,Kramer,108," C'mon Seattle, let's go."
20471,Earl,108," Come on, Mexico City!"
20472,Kramer,108," Seattle, yeah!"
20473,Intercom,108, ...flight 42 from Mexico City.
20474,Kramer,108," All right, c'mon, let's go again."
20475,Elaine,108," Mr. Pitt, do you need anything?"
20476,Pitt,108, No.
20477,Elaine,108, You need something to sit up. Why don't I get you a pillow?
20478,Pitt,108, Okay.
20479,Katie,108," It's a pretty full house, the lighting guy's name is Lew, 
              he's got a birthday next week."
20480,Jerry,108, I don't care.
20481,Katie,108," By the way, Jerry, I don't want you to freak out, but the 
              pilot is going to be in the audience."
20482,Jerry,108, Who?
20483,Katie,108," Remember the plane we took here? The pilot is gonna be sitting 
              out there watching the show."
20484,Jerry,108," I don't care, why are you telling me this?"
20485,Katie,108, I just didn't want you to freak out when you saw him.
20486,Jerry,108, Why would I freak out? (To himself) Pilot...
20487,Off stage,108," Ladies and gentlemen, a big hand for Mr. Jerry Seinfeld! 
              (Clapping)"
20488,Jerry,108," Hey, all right. Good afternoon Ithaca. Welcome, good to 
              see you here... Boy, I'll tell you, there's an awful lot of those 
              orange cones you have on the throughway... (Sees pilot) on the way... 
              up here... um... I.."
20489,Katie,108," It didn't go very well, did it?"
20490,Jerry,108," No, it didn't. And you know why? Seeing the pilot in the 
              audience really freaked me out."
20491,Katie,108, I knew it.
20492,Jerry,108," If you hadn't mentioned anything, I would have been fine. 
              I became obsessed with him."
20493,Katie,108," Why did we invite him? Stupid, stupid. when he asked for 
              a ticket, I should have said no. I'm gonna go chew him out."
20494,Jerry,108," Oh, it doesn't matter now."
20495,Katie,108," Don't worry, Jerry. I'm on top of this."
20496,Jerry,108," Yeah, you're on top of it, and I'm on the bottom!"
20497,Earl,108," Well, Mr. Kramer, looks like you're in the hole $3200... 
              Will that be cash or check?"
20498,Kramer,108," All right, look, one more bet. Double or nothing. C'mon."
20499,Earl,108," All right, but I wanna see some cash on the table."
20500,Kramer,108," All right, let me call my bank. You stay here. (He calls)"
20501,N,108, Hello? 
20502,Kramer,108," Yeah, it's, uh, me."
20503,N,108," Hey, what's up?"
20504,Kramer,108," All right, listen. I need some cash."
20505,N,108, What for?
20506,Kramer,108," I just need it, that's all."
20507,N,108," Oh no. Don't tell me. You're gambling again, aren't you? Oh 
              you weak, weak man. Where are you?"
20508,Kramer,108, I'm at the airport.
20509,N,108, The airport?
20510,Kramer,108," We've been betting on arrivals and departures. (Newman 
              rolls eyes) But I'm down $3200 , so you've gotta get me some cash."
20511,N,108, I don't have that kinda dough.
20512,Kramer,108, Sure you do.
20513,N,108," Oh no, no, not the bag!"
20514,Kramer,108," Oh help me man, I'm desperate!"
20515,N,108," All right, all right."
20516,Intercom,108," Sorry for the delay, folks, there is a slight complication 
              that we're taking care of, and then we'll be on our way to La Guardia..."
20517,Jerry,108, (To Katie) What is the complication?
20518,Flisht Attendant,108, Mr. Seinfeld?
20519,Jerry,108, Yes?
20520,FA,108," I'm sorry, but the pilot has asked that you leave this plane."
20521,Jerry,108, What?
20522,FA,108," Apparently, he has some sort of problem with you."
20523,Katie,108," I'm not surprised. I really let him have it, Jerry. He has 
              no business being in your audience if you didn't want him there."
20524,Jerry,108, I didn't care.
20525,FA,108," Well, now the pilot doesn't want you on his plane."
20526,Jerry,108, He can't just throw me off the plane!
20527,FA,108," Yes he can, if he has cause to believe a passenger will be 
              a disturbance."
20528,Jerry,108, But I'm not a disturbance!
20529,FA,108," Well, apparently you are disturbing him, sir."
20530,Jerry,108, But someone is waiting for me!
20531,Katie,108," Jerry, I don't want you to freak out."
20532,Jerry,108, I'm freakin' out! I am freakin' out!
20533,Katie,108," There's a flight leaving at eight, and another one at eight-thirty, 
              which one do you want?"
20534,Jerry,108, Which one do you think I want?
20535,Katie,108, The eight will get you in a little earlier.
20536,Jerry,108, Then we'll make it the eight.
20537,Katie,108," I'll book a hotel, do you want a standard room or mini suite?]"
20538,Jerry,108, Hotel?
20539,Katie,108," Yeah, it's eight in the morning."
20540,Jerry,108," No, no, no. I have to get home tonight. Bridget's gonna 
              be waiting for me at the Diplomat's Club. Rent a car."
20541,Katie,108," Mid-size, luxury, or sports model, what's your preference?"
20542,Jerry,108," I don't have a preference, okay! Just make a decision yourself! 
              Stop bothering me with every minor little detail, please?"
20543,Katie,108," Okay, you're a big celebrity. (She exits)"
20544,George,108, Yo.
20545,Jerry,108, George.
20546,George,108," Hey, Jerry, how was Ithaca?"
20547,Jerry,108," I'm still here. Listen, you gotta go down to the Diplomat's 
              Club..."
20548,George,108," Hey, Jerry, what was the name of the exterminator who fumigated 
              your apartment when you had fleas?"
20549,Jerry,108," Carl, I think."
20550,George,108," Carl... Yeah, he was a nice guy."
20551,Jerry,108," Yeah, he was nice."
20552,George,108, What company was it?
20553,Jerry,108, Defent.
20554,George,108," Yeah, you know we spoke for a little bit..."
20555,Jerry,108, You need an exterminator?
20556,George,108," No, not really."
20557,Jerry,108," Oh, don't tell me. 'Cause he's black?"
20558,George,108, Gotta go.
20559,Jerry,108," George, George!"
20560,Jerry,108," Hello, this is Jerry Seinfeld. Is Elaine there?"
20561,Woman,108," Hold on... Elaine, there's a Jerry Seinfeld on the phone 
              for you."
20562,Elaine,108, Hello?
20563,Jerry,108," Elaine, I need you to do me a big favor. I need you to go 
              down to the Diplomat's Club and meet Bridget for me. I'm going to 
              be late."
20564,Elaine,108," That's at the airport, right?"
20565,Jerry,108," Right, I don't want Bridget to think I stood her up. I'll 
              never get another date with her. She'll freak out."
20566,Elaine,108," All right, all right. You sound a little freaked out yourself."
20567,Jerry,108, I am a little freaked out!
20568,Elaine,108," Calm down, I'll take care of it. (Ms. Walker looks suspicious 
              of Elaine)"
20569,Jerry,108," All right, but you have to go now."
20570,Elaine,108, I said I'll take care of it!
20571,N,108, Kramer.
20572,Kramer,108, Hey.
20573,N,108," Okay, here it is."
20574,Kramer,108, Good. (To Earl) Here's my collateral.
20575,Earl,108," So it's a mailbag, so what?"
20576,N,108, So what? Do you know whose mailbag that is?
20577,Earl,108, (Reading) David Berkowitz.
20578,N,108, Son of Sam. The worst mass murderer the post office ever produced.
20579,Earl,108, Where did you get this? 
20580,N,108," I took over his route. And boy, were there a lot of dogs on 
              that route."
20581,Earl,108, Any of 'em talk to you?
20582,N,108, Just to tell me to keep off the snacks!
20583,Earl,108, (To Kramer) Your buddy's a helluva guy.
20584,Kramer,108," Yeah, don't I know it."
20585,Earl,108," Okay, Cosmo, we're back in business. Let's check out the 
              board. Now, who do you like?"
20586,Kramer,108," All right, how 'bout Ithaca vs. Boston?"
20587,Earl,108," All right, I'll give you a sportin' chance. I'll take Ithaca."
20588,Kramer,108, Double or nothin'.
20589,Earl,108, Double or nothin'.
20590,N,108," I hope you know what you're doing... (Kramer gives Newman a 
              look of lack of confidence)"
20591,Jerry,108, (Wakes up) Where are we?
20592,Katie,108, I'm not sure.
20593,Jerry,108, Is this even a road?
20594,Katie,108, Oh we lost the road a half hour ago.
20595,Jerry,108, What? Why didn't you wake me up?
20596,Katie,108, You told me not to bother you with minor details.
20597,Jerry,108," No, road is a major detail!"
20598,Katie,108," Okay, now I know. Should I keep going or turn around, do 
              you have a preference?"
20599,Jerry,108, (Pointing ahead) Look out!
20600,George,108, May I help you?
20601,Carl,108, I'm the exterminator.
20602,George,108," Oh, yes of course, come in."
20603,Carl,108, Why didn't you want me to bring my equipment or wear my uniform?
20604,George,108," Yes, well, if the other people in the office saw that I 
              called an exterminator, they would just panic. Besides, this is 
              sort of a friendly visit. Carl, right?"
20605,Carl,108, Do I know you?
20606,George,108," Yeah, sure, we met at Jerry Seinfeld's apartment. When 
              you fumigated for fleas over there."
20607,Carl,108," Seinfeld... Oh yeah, funny white guy, right?"
20608,George,108," Jerry? Yes, I suppose he is white. You know, I never really 
              thought about it. I don't see people in terms of color. You know, 
              there's someone I'd like you to meet. Hand on... (To phone) Is Mr. 
              Morgan in?"
20609,Phone,108, Mr. Morgan left for dinner.
20610,George,108," He left... huh... Carl, you hungry?"
20611,Jerry,108, That's it! No more questions! I don't care!
20612,Pitt,108," That's him! That's the man who gave me the pills in the drug 
              store! He's no pharmacist."
20613,Woman,108," Jerry Seinfeld... I know that name. He called here earlier 
              for Elaine. (She looks at Mr. Pitt)"
20614,Carl,108, I'm the exterminator. (Morgan confused)
20615,George,108," That's... what we used to call him in high school, the 
              exterminator. He's a linebacker. Oh, did we have some wild times."
20616,Earl,108," Well, that Newman was your good luck charm."
20617,Kramer,108," Yeah, he was."
20618,Earl,108," I should have quitted at double or nothin'. Travelers checks 
              acceptable?"
20619,Kramer,108, Oh I accept.
20620,N,108," (Talking to another man) ...yeah he worked in the cubicle right 
              next to me. We once double dated."
20621,Kramer,108," Yeah, it's a pleasure doin' business with a gentleman like 
              yourself. (Elaine enters)"
20622,Elaine,108, Kramer.
20623,Kramer,108, Oh hi Elaine. What are you doing here?
20624,Elaine,108," Jerry asked me to meet his girlfriend here. Did you here 
              about his plane in Ithaca?"
20625,Earl,108, What about the plane in Ithaca?
20626,Elaine,108," Oh, our stupid friend freaked out the pilot. Single handedly 
              delayed the plane a whole hour. Can you believe that?"
20627,Kramer,108, Boy...
20628,Earl,108, Your friend caused the delay?
20629,Elaine,108, Uh huh.
20630,Earl,108, You're a cheat! Nobody hustles Earl Hafler.
20631,Kramer,108, C'mon!
20632,Earl,108," See you around, Cosmo."
20633,Kramer,108, What?
20634,Elaine,108," Poison you? Jerry Seinfeld tried to poison you? Wha? Mr. 
              Pitt, what are you, delirious? He's never even met you!"
20635,Pitt,108," You're fired, Elaine. Goodbye."
20636,Elaine,108, Goodbye? (Elaine thinks of memories with Mr. Pitt)
20637,Jerry,108, Bridget!
20638,Bridget,108," Jerry, what happened?"
20639,Jerry,108," Oh, I'm so sorry. I got stuck out of town. I missed our 
              whole time together."
20640,Bridget,108," Well, my plane doesn't leave for another half hour."
20641,Jerry,108," Really? (They start to make out, Jerry sees the pilot on 
              the plane) Oh my God, that's him! That's the pilot!"
20642,George,108," I love this place. You know, Carl and I come here all the 
              time."
20643,Morgan,108, Is that right?
20644,Carl,108," Yeah, I come here all the time. You wouldn't believe the 
              rat problems in the kitchen."
20645,Morgan,108," (George spits out food) I thought so. You really are an 
              exterminator. This time, George, you've sunk to a new low. (He leaves)"
20646,George,108," Check, please."
20647,Waiter,108," Hey, Sugar Ray Leonard can eat here on the house."
20648,George,108, Mr. Morgan! Did you hear that? Mr. Morgan!

20650,Gennice,110, [Crying] (sob sob)
20651,Jerry,110," [To himself] Now what am I supposed to do here? Shall I go over 
        there? It's not like somebody died. It's ""Beaches"" for god's 
        sake. If she was sitting next to me I'd put my arm around her. I can't 
        be making a big move like going all the way over there. I can't. I won't. 
      "
20652,Jerry,110," She calls me this morning and tells me she's upset I didn't console 
        her. I mean it was ""Beaches"" for god's sake. What, what do you 
        do in a situation like that? "
20653,George,110, Where were you?
20654,Jerry,110, I was sitting on the chair. She was over here on the couch. 
20655,George,110," Well you know, if you were sitting right next to her you'd have 
        to console her no matter what. "
20656,Jerry,110, Of course.
20657,George,110," When you're talking about a movie like ""Beaches"", moving 
        from the chair to the couch , . . . that's quite a voyage."
20658,Jerry,110," yeah, "
20659,Kramer,110, Hey.
20660,George,110, Hey. I gotta go.
20661,Kramer,110, Where you going? 
20662,Jerry,110," The Improv is playing ""Rochelle Rochelle"" The musical."
20663,Kramer,110," Really? What is Bette Midler playing? Is she going to be there? 
      "
20664,Jerry,110, She might be. She's the star of the show. 
20665,Kramer,110," Bette Midler is going to be in the park today? Yeeee. Jerry, 
        don't tease me. "
20666,George,110, I didn't know you were such a Bette Midler fan.
20667,Kramer,110," So maybe I'll go down there and watch, uh? She'll be there, ,maybe."
20668,George,110, Gennice palying today?
20669,Jerry,110," Yeah, maybe."
20670,Kramer,110, Who's Gennice?
20671,Jerry,110, That's the understudy. I'm dating her.
20672,Kramer,110," Oh, uh, is this uh, Bette Midler's understudy?"
20673,Jerry,110, Yeah.
20674,Kramer,110," Oh, understudies are a very shifty bunch. The substitute teachers 
        of the theater world."
20675,Jerry,110," I'm glad she's an understudy. I don't have to avoid going back 
        stage and having to think of something to say."
20676,George,110," Going backstage is the worst. Especially when they stink. You 
        know that's a real problem."
20677,Jerry,110," Just once I would like to tell someone they stink. You know what? 
        I doidn't like the show. I didn't like you. It just really stunk. The 
        whole thingreal bad. Stinkaroo. Thanks for the tickets though. "
20678,Ruby,110, You late.
20679,Elaine,110," I know I know. I didn't have change for the bus and they don't 
        give change in this city. So they threw me off the bus "
20680,Ruby,110," ""That's a shame"". You'll have to wait for Lotus now."
20681,Elaine,110," How long do you think this will take. I have a millllioooon things 
        to do."
20682,Ruby,110," ""Mustn't keep the princess waiting. Princess in a big hurry."" 
        ""No change for bus"" ""Poor princess."""
20683,Elaine,110," What?, uh?"
20684,Ruby,110," Nothing, won't be long."
20685,Lotus,110," ""Princess wants a manicure."""
20686,Sunny,110," ""Oh lucky me."""
20687,Lotus,110," ""Oh, you got the princess."""
20688,Elaine,110, What is so funny?
20689,Ruby,110, tell knock-knock joke.
20690,Elaine,110," The Korean women were talking about me. I think they were calling 
        me a dog."
20691,Jerry,110, How would you know? You don't speak Korean.
20692,Elaine,110," Because this woman came in with a dog and Ruby called the dog 
        the same word they used when they were pointing at mege ge ge "
20693,Kramer,110," You know, maybe in Korean ""dog"" isn't an insult. Could 
        be like the word ""fox"" to us. Oh, she's a DOG! "
20694,Jerry,110," What you need is a translator to go in the shop with you and tell 
        you what they're saying."
20695,Elaine,110," Yeah, who speaks Korean?"
20696,Jerry,110, George's father.
20697,Elaine,110, You gotta' be kidding me. How does he speak Korean?
20698,Jerry,110, He used to go there a lot on business.
20699,Elaine,110, What did he do?
20700,Jerry,110," He sold religious articles the statues of Jesus, the virgin Mary, 
        that were manufactured in Korea."
20701,Elaine,110," Uh, "
20702,Jerry,110," George, does your father speak Korean?"
20703,George,110," Yeah, he once bumped into reverend Yung Sun Moon. "
20704,Jerry,110," Oh, hi Gennice."
20705,Gennice,110, Hi Jerry.
20706,Jerry,110," This is George, this is Kramer."
20707,Gennice,110, Nice to meet you.
20708,Jerry,110, Playing today?
20709,Gennice,110, No. I'm on the bench today.
20710,Jerry,110, They really stick to that understudy rule.
20711,Kramer,110, So she's coming?
20712,Gennice,110," Oh, yeah, she'll be here. . . .(DROPS HOT DOG) Oh no, my frankfurter, 
        my frankfurter fell (sob sob sob sob) . It was really good. I can't believe 
        that I dropped it. (sob sob sob sob)"
20713,Jerry,110," It's okayit's just a hot dog, (still sobbing) everything 
        is going to be okay."
20714,Gennice,110, No it (sob) was really good.
20715,Kramer,110," Look it's Bette It's Bette! Ah, Ah, AH, . . . Bette, psst, hi."
20716,Bette,110, Hi.
20717,Kramer,110," Uh, I just want to say I think you're wonderful."
20718,Bette,110," Uh, thank you."
20719,Kramer,110," Yeah, I've seen you in everything you've done."
20720,Bette,110, Really?
20721,Kramer,110, Anything I can get you? Water? They got ice over here.
20722,Bette,110, What flavours do they have?
20723,Kramer,110," Chocolate, Lemon, and uh, Cherry."
20724,Bette,110, How about Pineapple?
20725,Kramer,110," Pineapple, sure, alright, I'll be right back."
20726,Ice Cream Vendor #1,110," No pineapple. Just Cherry, Lemon and Tutti-Frutti"
20727,Kramer,110," Oh, uh, uh. [Leaves]"
20728,Elaine,110," Anyway, Mr. Costanza, what I want you to do is to come to the 
        shop with me and tell me what they are saying. You do speak Korean?"
20729,Frank,110," I once talked to the reverend Yung Son Moon. He bought two Jesus 
        statues from me. He's a hell of a nice guy. "
20730,Elaine,110," uh, ha."
20731,Frank,110, Ever see that face on him? Like a Biiig apple pie.
20732,Elaine,110," Yeah, yeah. Uh, uh listen Mr. Costanza, if uh, if you do this 
        for me I'll get you a manicure, I'll pay for it. Or you can get a pedicure 
        if you want."
20733,Frank,110," No one is touching my feet. Between you and me, Elaine, I think 
        I've got a foot odour problem. "
20734,George,110," I watched ""Beaches"" on cable last night. (wings?) 
         Give me a break."
20735,Bette,110, Get some talent then you can mouth off. 
20736,Umpire,110, Strike three.
20737,Bette,110, What? Are you blind?
20738,Frank,110, I had an affair with a Korean woman. 
20739,Elaine,110," Uh, Mr. Costanza, I "
20740,Frank,110," No, I feel I need to unburden myself. I loved her very deeply. 
        But the clash of cultures was too much. Her family would not accept me. 
      "
20741,Elaine,110," Mr. Costanza, I, "
20742,Frank,110," Maybe it was because I refused to take off my shoes. Again, the 
        foot odour problem. Her father would look at me and say, "" eno enoa 
        juang "". Which means, ""this guy - this is not my kind of guy""."
20743,Ice Cream Vendor #2,110, Sure I got Pineapple.
20744,Bette,110," Move it in. Move in everybody. Get your shrimp here. Shrimp on 
        special today!"
20745,Jerry,110," Come on George, just loosen up."
20746,Jerry,110, Come on George.
20747,Jerry,110, [to George] Keep going.
20748,George,110, Aaaaaah
20749,Umpire,110, SAFE!
20750,George,110, come on it's just a game.
20751,Kramer,110," (holding bette) Don't worry Kramer is going to take care of everything. 
        See,, I got you Pineapple. I saw Beaches last night for the fourth time 
        (sings) ""You are the wind"""
20752,TV,110," the show will go on but not Bette Midler. While playing softball 
        in the park Ms. Midler was injured when another player thoughtlessly rammed 
        her at home plate. All captured on amateur video tape. She will be out 
        for two weeks from her Broadway show; Rochelle Rochelle - The Musical."
20753,Gennice,110, . . . Thank you. (hugs Jerry and George)
20754,Jerry,110, Well we
20755,Gennice,110," No, please. This is the first time in my life (sobs) that anyone 
        has ever done anything like this for me. I've always had to struggle so 
        hard for everything I ever got. (sobbing) and I know this is going to 
        be my big break. (sobbing)"
20756,Jerry,110," [with no emotion] It's okay. Everything is going to be all right. 
      "
20757,Kramer,110," Come on Jerry, open up. I KNOW YOU'RE IN THERE! "
20758,Jerry,110, Come back another time.
20759,Kramer,110," SO...you're all in here together. How convenient. I hope you're 
        all proud of yourselves."
20760,Kramer,110," So my dear you think you can get to Broadway. Well, let me tell 
        you something. Broadway has no room for people like you. Not the Broadway 
        I know. My Broadway takes people like you and eats them up and spits them 
        out. My Broadway is the Broadway of Merman, and Martin, and Fontaine, 
        and if you think you can build yourself up by knocking other people down... 
        ...GOOD LUCK... (exits)"
20761,Elaine,110," Hi everyone. Um, this is my friend, Frank."
20762,Ruby,110," What would you like today? Manicure, Pedicure?"
20763,Frank,110, I'll take a manicure. I don't take my shoes off for anyone.
20764,Ruby,110," ""That's the least of his problems."""
20765,Frank,110, What was that?
20766,Elaine,110, What'd they say? What'd they say?
20767,Frank,110, They made a derogatory comment about me.
20768,Ruby,110," ""She's with a man twice her age."" ""He doesn't look 
        like he's got much money either."""
20769,Lotus,110," ""Check out that sweater"". (all laughing)"
20770,Ruby,110," ""I think I saw a moth fly out of a pocket."""
20771,Lotus,110," ""What happened to his tail?"""
20772,Frank,110," Okay, THAT'S IT! ""oki on awa"" Where's my tail? I heard 
        every word you said. You got some nerve. "
20773,Kim,110," That voice? It sounds so familiar. It reminds me of when I was ayoung 
        girl in Korea and I met an American businessman. He was a very unusual 
        man. Quick temperd with a strange halting way of speaking. We fell in 
        love but when I brought him home to meet my father? He refused to take 
        his shoes off. And there was a terrible fight. "
20774,Lotus,110, That man also refuses to take his shoes off. 
20775,Frank,110, [from other room] I never seen people treated like this!
20776,Ruby,110, You brought in a spy! . . . Get Out! 
20777,Kim,110, Frank?
20778,Frank,110, Kim?
20779,Kramer,110," [on phone] A turkey sandwich. A side of slaw,  you want 
        whit e meat or dark? "
20780,Bette,110, White meat.
20781,Kramer,110," Yeah, white meat. And if I see one piece of dark meat on there. 
        It's your ass buster."
20782,Bette,110, Get me one of those Black and White cookies.
20783,Kramer,110," yeah, all right, yeah. [hangs up] They don't have any. 
        But don't worry I'm going to get you one somewhere."
20784,Bette,110," Good. Because if I don't get a Black and White cookie I'm not 
        going to be very pleasant to be around."
20785,Kramer,110, Now that's impossible.
20786,Elaine,110," (sob sob) (bumps into man with an umbrella)  I don't even 
        know where I'm going."
20787,Peterman,110, That's the best way to get someplace you've never been. 
20788,Elaine,110," yes, (sob) I suppose, "
20789,Peterman,110, Have you been crying?
20790,Elaine,110," Yes, (sob) you see this (sob) woman, this manicurist,"
20791,Peterman,110," Oh no, that doesnt matter now. That's a very nice jacket."
20792,Elaine,110," Uh, (sob) thanks."
20793,Peterman,110," Very soft, huge button flaps, cargo pockets, draw string waist, 
        deep biswing vents in the back perfect for jumping into a gondola. "
20794,Elaine,110, How do you know all that?
20795,Peterman,110, That's my coat.
20796,Elaine,110, You mean..?
20797,Peterman,110," Yes, I'm J. Peterman."
20798,Elaine,110, Oh!
20799,Jerry,110," I don't know why I have to go to the hospital. I didn't do anything 
        to Bette Midler. Driver can you stop over here, we're picking somebody 
        up. "
20800,Gennice,110," Hey, I didn't do anything. I was never informed.  YOU 
        CAN ALL GO STRAIGHT TO HELL. You see that? You see what I am going 
        through? "
20801,George,110," So what? Somebody dropped an egg on my head as I went into my 
        building last night."
20802,Jerry,110," Hey, I'm being heckled on stage. People are yelling out Galloogy. 
      "
20803,Gennice,110," I'm having a little trouble with all this. I mean all I ever 
        wanted to do is sing. Now I'm the focus of this big media frenzy. (sob) 
        Nobody in the show will even talk to me."
20804,Jerry,110, Stop your crying will ya?
20805,Gennice,110, What?
20806,George,110, You heard him.
20807,Gennice,110," Oh, don't you you're the reason this whole thing happened."
20808,George,110," Oh, yeah. I read what you said to the papers yesterday. You weren't 
        in on the planing. What planning? YOU THINK WE PLANED THIS? Uh? "
20809,Cabbie,110," Wait. Wait. I know you. You knocked Bette Midler out of Rochelle 
        Rochelle the Musical. I want you creeps out of my cab."
20810,Jerry,110," Hey, I had nothing to do with it."
20811,Cabbie,110," Get out of my cab. You should go to prison. You should be in 
        prison for the rest of your life. Get out, each of you. Each and every 
        one of you get out of my cab."
20812,Peterman,110," Then in the distance I heard the bulls. I began running as 
        fast as I could. Fortunately I was wearing my Italian Captoe Oxfords. 
        Sophisticated yet different; nothing to make a huge fuss about. Rich dark 
        brown calfskin leather. Matching leather vent. Men's whole and half sizes 
        7 through 13. Price $135.00."
20813,Peterman,110, That shirt. Where did you get it?
20814,Elaine,110," Oh, this innocent looking shirt has something which isn't innocent 
        at all. Touchability! Heavy, silky Italian cotton, with a fine almost 
        terrycloth like feeling. Five button placket, relaxed fit, innocence and 
        mayhem at once. "
20815,Peterman,110, That's NOT bad!
20816,Kim,110," Oh, Frank. So many years. If only you had taken your shoes off."
20817,Frank,110, I couldn't because I had a potential foot problem. 
20818,Kim,110, I thought maybe you had a hole in your socks.
20819,Frank,110," I wiped them for two minutes on the mat. I don't know why your 
        father had to make a federal case out of it."
20820,Kim,110," Anyway that is all in the past. We have our whole future ahead of 
        us. "
20821,Frank,110," Between you and me I think your country is placing a lot of importance 
        on shoe removal."
20822,Kim,110," You short stop me? We don't do that in Korea! Take me home. Inever 
        want to see you again. "
20823,Kramer,110," Hi, here. I made this for your. [gives her a pasta statue]"
20824,Bette,110,  What is it?
20825,Kramer,110, It's macaroni Midler. 
20826,Bette,110, Macaroni Midler?
20827,Kramer,110," Yeah, see how you're singing?"
20828,Bette,110,"  yeah ha ha. Well you made a long journey from Milan 
        to Minsk."
20829,Kramer,110," oh, what's that from?"
20830,Kramer,110, Oh You are so freaking talented.
20831,Kramer,110," Oh, so look who's here. What do you want."
20832,Jerry,110," We just want to talk to her. We want to apologize and tell her 
        the whole thing was an accident. "
20833,Kramer,110," No, no. I'm sorry it's out of the question."
20834,George,110, Who are you to decide?
20835,Kramer,110," I'm calling the shots around here so there won't be anymore ACCIDENTS! 
      "
20836,George,110," Hey, look, Kramer,"
20837,Kramer,110, AH! I don't want her disturbed. 
20838,Ruby,110," hello, Elaine."
20839,Elaine,110, Hello
20840,Lotus,110, We're so excited.
20841,Elaine,110, You're welcome.
20842,Ruby,110, We'll see you inside.
20843,Jerry,110, What happened?
20844,Elaine,110," Well I felt bad about the spying, so you know, ,I got them tickets 
        to the show."
20845,Jerry,110," Oh,, that's nice. Alright, I'll see you later."
20846,Elaine,110," Wait, wait. I didn't get to tell you about my new job."
20847,Jerry,110, Where? 
20848,Elaine,110, Writing for the J. Peterman catalogue.
20849,Jerry,110, [pushing her] How did you get that?
20850,Elaine,110, I met him.
20851,Jerry,110, You met J. Peterman?
20852,Elaine,110, yeah.
20853,Jerry,110, What is he like?
20854,Elaine,110," He wore a classic courtman's duster. beige corduroy collar, 100% 
        cotton canvas, high waist, nine pockets, six on the outside, great for 
        running along side a train, [Jerry walking away] waving last goodbyes, 
        posing on a veranda, Men's sizes ..."
20855,Jerry,110," Well, break a leg tonight."
20856,Gennice,110, I'm really nervous.
20857,Stagehand,110," Here you got a telegram. Well, look who's here."
20858,Jerry,110," Listen buddy,"
20859,Stagehand,110," What are you going to do? Break my legs? You don't scare me. 
        You or your goons."
20860,Gennice,110, My grandmother died.
20861,Jerry,110," Oh, I'm so sorry."
20862,Gennice,110," Oh, it's okay, "
20863,Jerry,110," So you don't cry when your grandmother dies? But a hotdog makes 
        you lose control?"
20864,Voice,110, [Off camera] Places everyone.
20865,Gennice,110, I gotta go.
20866,Jerry,110, Good luck.
20867,Announcer,110," ladies and gentlemen for this evening's performance the part 
        of Rochelle will be played by Gennice Grant."
20868,Lotus,110, Gennice Glant? 
20869,Ruby,110, What happened to Bette Midler? 
20870,Elaine,110," Oh, she got hurt."
20871,Ruby,110, No Bette Midler? [they talk Korean and all three leave]
20872,Elaine,110," I, uh, wait,"
20873,Gennice,110," [singing and dancing] ""It's a long journey from Milan to

20878, George,111, I don't think we should see each other any more.
20879, At Elaine,111,'s. She's trying to get some rest. [dogs barking]
20880, Elaine,111, Shut up! Shut up! You stupid mutt.
20881, Jerry,111," And you broke up with her 'cuz she beat you at chess? That's 
        pretty sick."
20882, George,111," I don't see how I could perform sexually in a situation after 
        something like that. I was completely emasculated. Anyway, it's not the 
        only reason."
20883, Jerry,111," Yeah, what else?"
20884, George,111," All right. You wanna know what one of her favorite expressions 
        is? Happy, Pappy?"
20885, Jerry,111," Happy, Pappy? What does that mean?"
20886, George,111," Like if she wants to know if I'm pleased with something, she'll 
        say, ""Happy, Pappy?"""
20887, Jerry,111," Oh, you're ""Pappy""."
20888, George,111," I'm ""Pappy""."
20889, Jerry,111," Oh, I get it. Why don't you just say it?"
20890, Jerry,111," Hey, I got a real thing about ""shushing""!"
20891, George,111," What is this? Did you ever get the feeling like you've had a 
        haircut but you didn't have one? I'm all itchy back here."
20892, Jerry,111, Ahh.
20893, George,111, What?
20894, Jerry,111, What is this? What are we doing? What in god's name are we doing?
20895, George,111, What?
20896, Jerry,111," OUR LIVES!! . What kind of lives are these? We're like children. 
        We're not men."
20897, George,111," No, we're not. We're not men."
20898, Jerry,111," We come up with all these stupid reasons to break up with these 
        women."
20899, George,111, I know. I know. That's what I do. That's what I do.
20900, Jerry,111, Are we going to be sitting here when we're sixty like two idiots?
20901, George,111, . We should be having dinner with our sons when we're sixty.
20902, Jerry,111, We're pathetic you know that?
20903, George,111," Yeah, Like I don't know that I'm pathetic."
20904, Jerry,111, Why can't I be normal?
20905, George,111," Yes. Me, too. I wanna be normal. Normal."
20906, Jerry,111, It would be nice to care about someone.
20907, Jerry,111, Hmm. I thought she became a lesbian.
20908, George,111, No. It didn't take.
20909, Jerry,111, Oh.
20910, George,111," Did I tell you I ran into her last week? Ho-ho, she looked great."
20911, Jerry,111, Hmm.
20912, George,111," You thought she was good looking, right?"
20913, Jerry,111," See, there you go again. What is the difference what I think?"
20914, George,111, I was just curious.
20915, George,111, Yes. Changes.
20916, Jerry,111, I'm serious about it.
20917, George,111, Think I'M not?
20918, Jerry,111, I'm not kidding.
20919, George,111," Me, too."
20920, [At Jerry,111,'s. He's on the phone]
20921, Jerry,111," Melanie, you can shush me at every opportunity. 5? 3? Oh, it 
        was just an expression. All right, well, that's very sweet of you. Okay, 
        I'll call you later. All right, bye. Hey!"
20922, Kramer,111, What? 
20923, Kramer,111, Really?
20924, Jerry,111," We were talking about our lives and we both kind of realized 
        we're kids. We're not men."
20925, Kramer,111," So, then you asked yourselves, ""Isn't there something more 
        to life?"""
20926, Jerry,111, Yes. We did.
20927, Kramer,111," Yeah, well, let me clue you in on something. There isn't."
20928, Jerry,111, There isn't?
20929, Jerry,111, Well...
20930, Kramer,111," They're prisons. Man made prisons. You're doing time. You get 
        up in the morning. She's there. You go to sleep at night. She's there. 
        It's like you gotta ask permission to use the bathroom. Is it all right 
        if I use the bathroom now?"
20931, Jerry,111, Really?
20932, Kramer,111," Yeah, and you can forget about watching TV while you're eating."
20933, Jerry,111, I can?
20934, Kramer,111," Oh, yeah. You know why? Because it's dinner time. And you know 
        what you do at dinner?"
20935, Jerry,111, What?
20936, Kramer,111," You talk about your day. How was your day today? Did you have 
        a good day today or a bad day today? Well, what kind of day was it? Well, 
        I don't know. How about you? How was your day?"
20937, Jerry,111, Boy.
20938, Kramer,111," It's sad , Jerry. It's a sad state of affairs.."
20939, Jerry,111, I'm glad we had this talk.
20940, Kramer,111," Oh, you have no idea."
20941, George,111, La-la-la...
20942, Kramer,111, Hey.
20943, Jerry,111, Hey.
20944, Elaine,111," Three hours of sleep again last night.. Three hours of sleep 
        because of that dog."
20945, Kramer,111, What dog?
20946, Kramer,111, Yeah. What dog?
20947, Elaine,111," This dog in the courtyard across from my bedroom window that 
        never never stops barking.."
20948, Kramer,111, Don't...
20949, Elaine,111," I lost my voice screaming at this thing. I can't sleep. I can't 
        work. I mean, I just moved. I can't move again. What am I gonna do? What? 
        What am I gonna do?"
20950, Kramer,111," Well, there is something you can do."
20951, Kramer,111," Well, what if there should be an unfortunate accident?"
20952, Jerry,111, You're going to rub out the dog?
20953, Kramer,111," No, no. Not me. I just happen to know someone who specializes 
        in exactely these kinds of sticky situations."
20954, Elaine,111, Uh-huh.
20955, Jerry,111," What, you're considering this?"
20956, Kramer,111," Look, just meet with him. ?????."
20957, Elaine,111," I don't really know why I'm here. Kramer talked me into coming 
        up here. But, obviously, I could never really do anything."
20958, Newman,111, Of course. Obviously.
20959, Elaine,111," Uh, so, anyway, I'm sorry for wasting your time."
20960, Newman,111, What kind of dog did you say it was?
20961, Elaine,111," Um, I don't know. I've never really seen it."
20962, Newman,111," I see many dogs on my mail route. I'll bet there's not one type 
        of mutt or mongrel I haven't run across. "
20963, Newman,111," If you ask me, they have no business living amongst us. Vile, 
        USELESS BEASTS . . . "
20964, Newman,111, Anyway.
20965, Elaine,111," Yeah. Well um, I was just curious if I were interested in availing 
        myself of your services, um, what exactly would you do?"
20966, Elaine,111," No, I'm sorry. I can't hurt a dog. I can't hurt a dog. I can't."
20967, Kramer,111," I got it. We'll kidnap him . and we'll drop him off Upstate 
        and this way he won't bother you anymore and he won't get hurt."
20968, Newman,111," Yeah, I suppose."
20969, Kramer,111, Huh?
20970, Elaine,111," I'd have to think about it. I doubt it, though. I doubt it. 
        I'll let you know."
20971, Newman,111, Of course. Take your time. I be here.
20972, [George,111, is still at the pier. His thoughts shift somewhat.]
20973, Elaine,111, All right. Let's do it.
20974, Newman,111, Excellent. Excellent.
20975, Jerry,111, How come you're eating your peas one at a time?
20976, Susan,111, Who is it?
20977, George,111, Will you marry me?
20978, George,111," Ma, guess what!"
20979, Mrs. C,111," Oh, my god!"
20980, George,111," No, it's nothing bad. I'm getting married."
20981, Mrs. C,111, You're what?
20982, George,111, I'm getting married?
20983, Mrs. C,111," Oh, my god! You're getting married?"
20984, George,111, Yes!
20985, Mrs. C,111," Oh, I can't believe it. Frank, come here."
20986, Frank,111, You come here.
20987, Mrs. C,111, Georgie's getting married.
20988, Frank,111, What?
20989, Mrs. C,111, Georgie's getting married.
20990, Mrs. C,111, Of course to a woman. What's she look like?
20991, Frank,111, I'm sure she's pretty gorgeous.
20992, George,111, What difference does it make what she looks like?
20993, Mrs. C,111, Is she pretty?
20994, George,111," Yes, she's pretty. What difference does it make?"
20995, Mrs. C,111," Oh, I'm just curious."
20996, Frank,111, She's not pretty?
20997, Mrs. C,111, Let me talk to her.
20998, George,111, She wants to talk to you.
20999, Mrs. C,111, Congratulations!
21000, Mrs. C,111, You do?
21001, Mrs. C,111, May I ask why?
21002, Mrs. C,111, Will you stop. I'm on the telephone.
21003, Frank ,111,"Can I talk to her, please?"
21004, Jerry,111, Hey!
21005, Kramer,111, Hey!
21006, Jerry,111, What are you up to?
21007, Kramer,111, Nothing.
21008, Jerry,111, What's the rope for?
21009, Kramer,111," Oh! Well, How do you like that. I got rope. Um, I gotta go."
21010, Jerry,111, The dog. You're getting the dog.
21011, Kramer,111, Out.
21012, Jerry,111, Did what?
21013, Jerry,111, You're getting married?
21014, George,111, Yes!
21015, Jerry,111," Oh, my god!"
21016, Jerry,111, I'm blown away.
21017, George,111, You're blown?
21018, Jerry,111, Wow!
21019, George,111, You like that?
21020, Jerry,111," And she said ""Yes""?"
21021, George,111," It took a couple of hours of convincing. I was just like those 
        guys in the movies. And it worked! She said ""Yes""! I can't believe 
        my luck that she was still available . A beautiful woman like that. You 
        think she's good looking, right?"
21022, Jerry,111, You're gonna have gorgeous kids.
21023, George,111, Yes. She's got great skin - a rosy glow..
21024, Jerry,111, Pinkish hue?
21025, George,111," Oh, she's got the hue. So, what's going on with you and Melanie? 
        I mean, I know you're not getting married, but uh, things are happening?"
21026, Jerry,111," Well...actually, we kind of broke up."
21027, George,111, You what?
21028, Jerry,111," Well, you know, we were having dinner the other night, and she's 
        got this strangest habit. She eats her peas one at a time. You've never 
        seen anything like it. It takes her an hour to finish them. I mean, we've 
        had dinner other times. I've seen her eat Corn Niblets. 4But she scooped 
        them."
21029, George,111, . . . she scooped her niblets?
21030, Jerry,111, Yes. That's what was so vexing.
21031, George,111, Uh-huh. Uh-huh. What about the pact?
21032, Jerry,111, What?
21033, George,111," What happened to the pact? We were both gonna change. We shook 
        hands on a pact. 9Did you not shake my hand on it uh?"
21034, Jerry,111," You stuck your hand out, so I shook it. I don't know about a 
        pact. Anyway, you should be happy you're engaged. You're getting married."
21035, George,111," Well, it's not that. I just, you know, I thought that we were 
        both uh..."
21036, Jerry,111, You thought I was gonna get married?
21037, George,111," Well, maybe not married, but..."
21038, George,111, Yeah.
21039, Jerry,111, You want to spend the rest of your life with her
21040, George,111, . . . . . . Yeah.
21041, Jerry,111, So?
21042, George,111, Yeah. It doesn't make any difference.
21043, Jerry,111," No. So, we're still on to see uh, Firestorm tonight?"
21044, George,111, Yeah.
21045, Jerry,111, I'll pick you up at your apartment. We'll go to the Eight.
21046, George,111, Yeah.
21047, Jerry,111," Hey, wait a second. Wait a second. ! How about some champagne?"
21048, George,111, Champagne?
21049, Jerry,111," Yes, come on! How often do you get engaged? Come on!"
21050, George,111, Okay! Alright!
21051, Jerry,111, You know what? No champagne. . . . I'll see you later.
21052, George,111, Yeah.
21053, Elaine,111, That's it. That's it. Stop right here. 
21054, Newman,111," All right, give me the rope."
21055, Elaine,111, What? What do you need a rope for?
21056, Newman,111," Look, I don't have time to explain every little thing to you."
21057, Elaine,111," I don't know. Now, I'm thinking maybe we shouldn't do this."
21058, Newman,111, I knew you'd back out.
21059, Kramer,111," Well, Look at it this way. We drop the dog off in front of somebody's 
        house in the country. They find it and adopt it. Now the dog is prancing 
        in the fields. Dancing and prancing. Fresh air. . Dandelions. We're doing 
        this dog a real favor. "
21060, Elaine,111, Yeah. That's him.
21061, Newman,111, All right. I'm going in. Keep the motor running.
21062, [George,111,'s.]
21063, Jerry,111, Ready?
21064, George,111," Um, I don't uh, really think I can go."
21065, Jerry,111," Oh, how come?"
21066, Jerry,111," Well, she could come."
21067, George,111," Well, she doesn't really want to see Firestorm."
21068, Jerry,111, Oh.
21069, George,111," She um, she wants to see The Muted Heart."
21070, Jerry,111," Oh, The Muted Heart. Glen Close. Sally Field. Well, that should 
        be good."
21071, George,111, Yeah. see you later.
21072, Jerry,111," Hey, wait a second. You know, we could share a cab. They're playing 
        at the same Cineplex."
21073, Susan,111," George, better get read "
21074, George,111, I am ready.
21075, Susan,111, You wearing that shirt?.
21076, George,111," Okay, I guess I'll see you down there."
21077, Jerry,111, Yeah.
21078, George,111, Okay.
21079, Elaine,111, What time you got?
21080, Kramer,111," Oh, no. I don't wear a watch."
21081, Elaine,111, What do you do?
21082, Kramer,111," Well, I tell time by the sun."
21083, Elaine,111, How close do you get?
21084, Kramer,111," Well, I can guess within an hour."
21085, Elaine,111," Tsk. Well, I can guess within the hour, and I don't even have 
        to look at the sun."
21086, Kramer,111, Yeah.
21087, Elaine,111," Well, what about at night? What do you do then?"
21088, Kramer,111," Well, night's tougher but it's only a couple of hours."
21089, Newman,111, Let's go. Let's go. Move!
21090, Kramer,111, You got it?
21091, Newman,111, What do you think? Drive. Drive.
21092, Elaine,111, Where is it? Where is it? This? This is the dog?
21093, Newman,111, Yep.
21094, Elaine,111, But he's so small.
21095, Newman,111," Yeah, but he's a fighter."
21096, Elaine,111, That can't be the dog. Are you sure you got the right one?
21097, Newman,111," Look, you said the one in the second courtyard. He was in the 
        second courtyard."
21098, Elaine,111, How could that be the dog?
21099, Kramer,111," Well, get him to bark."
21100, Elaine,111, Yeah. Yeah. I'll know if he barks.
21101, Newman,111, All right. Bark.
21102, Elaine,111, Bark.
21103, Newman,111, Bark.
21104, Susan,111, Did you like it?
21105, George,111," Yes, it was very, very good."
21106, Susan,111," Oh, do you think he'll ever find her again?"
21107, George,111," Oh, I sure hope so."
21108, Jerry,111," How about when Harrison Ford jumped out of that plane, and he 
        was shooting back at them as he was falling?"
21109, Friend,111, What about that underwater escape?
21110, Jerry,111," Oh, man!"
21111, Kramer,111, Let's turn the radio on. Maybe there's a news report about it.
21112, Newman,111, ???????
21113, Elaine,111, You think we're far enough.
21114, Newman,111, We're practically to Monticello.
21115, Kramer,111," Yeah. This looks right. All right. Give me the dog. Okay, boy. 
        This is it. This is your new home. Let go of my shirt. Come on. Let go 
        of my shirt. This shirt is from Rudy's."
21116, Jerry,111,"'s on the phone with his newly imprisoned buddy, Georgie."
21117, George,111, Hello?
21118, Jerry,111," Hey, ??? is rerunning the Yankee game. You watching this?"
21119, George,111, They are?
21120, George,111," Uh, yeah, I'll be there in a minute."
21121, Jerry,111, What was that?
21122, George,111," Uh, nothing. I got to go."
21123, Jerry,111," Oh, Mattingly just sinled ."
21124, George,111," You know, it was really wrong of you to back out on that deal."
21125, Jerry,111, I didn't make a deal. I just shook your hand.
21126, George,111," Yeah, Well that's a deal where I come from."
21127, Jerry,111, We come from the same place.
21128, George,111, I got to go.
21129, Elaine,111, No! No! It's impossible. It's impossible.
21130, [At Jerry,111,'s. ]
21131, Elaine,111," I don't know. I don't know how it happened. We were practically 
        in Monticello. I mean, how could that thing have found its way back? There's 
        no way."
21132, Jerry,111, Very strange.
21133, Elaine,111, I know.
21134, Jerry,111," So, tell me anyway. Who was the BIG mastermind?"
21135, Jerry,111, All right. But then I can't tell you the BIG news.
21136, Elaine,111, News? What news?
21137, Jerry,111, Sorry!
21138, Elaine,111, What? What?
21139, Jerry,111," All right, Elaine but this is beyond news. This is like Pearl 
        Harbor. Or the Kennedy assassination. It's like not even news. It's total 
        shock."
21140, Jerry,111, George Costanza...
21141, Elaine,111, Yeah?
21142, Jerry,111, Is getting married!
21143, Elaine,111, Get out!
21144, Kramer,111, Hi.
21145, Kramer,111," Uh, yes. Yeah."
21146, Cop,111, You recognize this piece of fabric?
21147, Kramer,111," Oh, yeah, that's..."
21148, Cop,111, What?
21149, Kramer,111, What?
21150, Cop,111, You're under arrest.
21151, Kramer,111, Arrest?
21152, Cop,111," I have a receipt for a rental car with your signature. Including 
        a report with some damage to the rear seat. It seems the spring was so 
        compressed it completely collapsed the right side.."
21153, [Cop at Newman,111, 's door]
21154, Newman,111, What took you so long?
21155, Kramer,111," Hey, what do you think they'll do to us?"
21156, Newman,111," Ah, don't worry about a thing. In twenty minutes that place'll 
        be swarming with mailmen. We'll be back on the street by lunch."
21157, Elaine,111," I gotta make some changes. I'm not a woman. I'm a child. What 
        kind of life is this?"
21158,[George and Susan,111, in bed - MAY music]
21159,Elaine,112," Hey, good news. My dog problem has been solved."
21160,Jerry,112, Really? What happened?
21161,Elaine,112," Well, there's this rabbi in my building. You've met him. Very 
        nice man. "
21162,Jerry,112, Isn't he the one with the show on cable?
21163,Elaine,112," Yea, yeah, yeah,. So I spoke to him about the dog. He went down. 
        Talked to the owner. She agr4eed to keep the dog inside from now on. "
21164,Jerry,112, That's great. 
21165,Elaine,112, I know.
21166,Jerry,112, That looks pretty good.
21167,Kramer,112," Hey, hey."
21168,George,112," You are a good friend. You know what? Even if you killed somebody 
        I wouldn't turn you in."
21169,Jerry,112, Is that so?
21170,Jerry,112," Hey, Kramer if I killed somebody would you turn me in?"
21171,Kramer,112, Definitely.
21172,Jerry,112, You're kidding?
21173,Kramer,112," No, no, I would turn you in."
21174,Jerry,112, You would turn me in?
21175,Kramer,112," Phwap, I wouldn't even think about it."
21176,Jerry,112, I can't believe your a friend of mine.
21177,Kramer,112, What kind of person are you going around killing people?
21178,Jerry,112," Well, I am sure I had a good reason."
21179,Kramer,112," Well,, if you'll kill this person, who's to say I wouldn't be 
        next?"
21180,Jerry,112, But you know me!
21181,Kramer,112, I thought I DID!
21182,Elaine,112," I'm not a very religious person but I do feel as if I'm in need 
        of some guidance here."
21183,Rabbi,112," Would you care for a snack of some kind? I have the Snackwells 
        which are very popular but I think that sometimes with the so called fat 
        free cookies people may overindulge forgetting they may be high in calories 
      "
21184,Elaine,112," Thank you I am not very hungry. Anyway, um, this friend of mine, 
        George, got engaged ."
21185,Rabbi,112, How wonderful.
21186,Elaine,112," Yeah, yeah, well, for some reason, um, I just find myself just 
        overcome with feelings of jealousy and resentment."
21187,Rabbi,112," Doesn't it give you any joy to see your friend enter into this 
        holiest of unions?"
21188,Elaine,112," No, no, no it doesn't. No joy no joy whatsoever. Just the whole 
        think makes me . . sick."
21189,Rabbi,112," You know, Elaine, very often we cannot see the forest for the 
        trees."
21190,Elaine,112," Yeah, I don't know what that means."
21191,Rabbi,112," Well, for example, say there's a forest, . . . "
21192,Elaine,112," You see the thing is we It should have been me. You know, I'm 
        smart. I'm attractive."
21193,Rabbi,112, You know my temple has many single functions.
21194,Elaine,112," No, no, it's okay."
21195,Rabbi,112, My nephew Alex is someone who is also looking perhaps 
21196,Elaine,112, I don't think so.
21197,Rabbi,112, He owns a flower store. Very successful. 
21198,Jerry,112, So you're nothing but a stoolie. Admit it.
21199,Kramer,112," Hey, don't do the crime if you can't do the time."
21200,Jerry,112, Another Caf Latte?
21201,Kramer,112, You better believe it.
21202,Kramer,112, Since when are you so trendy?
21203,Jerry,112," Hey, baby. I set the trends. Who do you think started this whole 
        Caf Latte?"
21204,Jerry,112, I don't recall you drinking Caf Latte.
21205,Kramer,112," I've been drinking Caf Latte since the fifth grade and I haven't 
        looked back. "
21206,Jerry,112," Hey, Planet 9 From Outer Space is playing tomorrow night. One 
        show only."
21207,Kramer,112, I've always wanted to see this.
21208,Jerry,112," You know I was supposed to see this five years ago. I was in a 
        Chinese restaurant with George and Elaine and got all screwed up trying 
        to get a table and I missed it."
21209,Kramer,112," Well, yeah, lets do it uh?"
21210,Jerry,112," Look at this Jerry, dropping paper on the ground. That's littering. 
      "
21211,Jerry,112, Maybe you better call the cops and turn me in.
21212,Kramer,112, Maybe I will. 
21213,George,112," Hi, "
21214,Susan,112, How was your day?
21215,George,112," Good, good day. How was your day? "
21216,Susan,112, Mine was okay. So what's goin' on?
21217,George,112," Oh, nothin' much. I went over to jerry's, uh, talked to Jerry."
21218,Susan,112," Oh, the Lowers want to get together with us on Friday night."
21219,George,112," The Lowers, really?"
21220,Susan,112, So what did Jerry have to say?
21221,George,112," Oh, nothin' much, . . . talkin'. . . . Oh, oh, oh, did I have 
        an unbelievable idea today! "
21222,Susan,112," Oh, yeah, the toilets. You told me."
21223,George,112," Yeah, ha ha, It's not the toilets, it's not the toilets. It's 
        something else. Are you ready for this?"
21224,Susan,112, Yeah.
21225,George,112," Okay, how about this? All right, we get married March 21st, the 
        first day of Spring."
21226,Susan,112, What do you mean? You want to postpone the wedding?
21227,George,112," No, no no it's not about postponing. I just think the first day 
        of Spring is the perfect day to get married. You know, Spring! Rejuvenation! 
        Rebirth! Everything is blooming all the "
21228,Susan,112," If you don't want to marry me, George, just say so. [crying] Say 
        so."
21229,George,112," Still marry , still marry."
21230,Susan,112, You don't love me.
21231,George,112, Sstill love. Still love.
21232,Susan,112," My parents told me you were too neurotic and that I was making 
        a mistake."
21233,George,112," No no no, no mistake, no mistake. No, no , listen, we're going 
        to get married over Christmas, I It doesn't make any difference 
        to me. It's fine. Really."
21234,Susan,112, Are you sure?
21235,George,112," Yeah, yeah, sure, Christmas. Snow. Santa. All that stuff."
21236,Jerry,112, Let me take a guess. She cried and you caved.
21237,George,112, How did you know that?
21238,Jerry,112, I live and breathe my friend. . . . I live and breathe.
21239,George,112," I got to tell you I felt terrible. I really thought she was going 
        to collapse and kill herself."
21240,Jerry,112," tes, it's very difficult. Few men have the constitution for it. 
        That's why breakups take two or three tries. You gotta build up your immunity. 
      "
21241,George,112," You see those tears streaming down you don't know what to do. 
        It was like she was on fire and I was trying to put her out. "
21242,Jerry,112," Well, at least you probably had some, uh, pretty good make-up 
        sex after."
21243,George,112, I didn't have any sex.
21244,Jerry,112," You didn't have make-up sex? How could you not have make-up sex? 
        I mean that's the best feature of the heavy relationship."
21245,George,112, I didn't have make-up sex.
21246,Jerry,112," In your situation the only sex you're going to have better than 
        make-up sex is if you're dent to prison and you have a conjugal visit."
21247,George,112," Yeah, conjugal visit sex. That is happening! "
21248,Woman,112, [crying]
21249,Man,112, I can tell you're very upset but I'm sorry I'm not goin'
21250,George,112, Did you here that? I can't believe this he's eating his sandwich.
21251,Man,112, Are you going to eat thoise fries?
21252,George,112," This is amazing. [George gets up to leave and shake's man's hand] 
        Thank you. Thank you very much. . . . I'm going back in! . . . You'll 
        feel better [to woman]"
21253,Jerry,112, . . . Poor bastard.
21254,Jerry,112," Good evening, Rabbi."
21255,Rabbi,112, Good evening. And how does this evening find you?
21256,Jerry,112," Well, Rabbi, well."
21257,Rabbi,112," I trust you are here to see your friend, Elaine."
21258,Jerry,112," Yeah, that's right."
21259,Rabbi,112, I hope she's feeling better.
21260,Jerry,112, What do you mean?
21261,Rabbi,112, She didn't tell you?
21262,Jerry,112, No.
21263,Rabbi,112," Well it seems the engagement of her ffriend George has left her 
        feeling bitter and hostile."
21264,Jerry,112, is that so? 
21265,Rabbi,112," Yes, in fact she told me that she wishes she was the one getting 
        married."
21266,Jerry,112, Really?
21267,Rabbi,112, She came off as pretty desperate.
21268,Jerry,112, I didn't know any of this.
21269,Rabbi,112," Apparently she doesn't think much of this George fellow either. 
        I recall the word loser peppered throughout her conversation. "
21270,Jerry,112," Hum, well it all comes as news to me. "
21271,G,112, [enters] Hi.
21272,Susan,112," Hi, how was your day?"
21273,George,112," Good, good day. How was your day?"
21274,Susan,112," Ah, it was okay. What's going on? "
21275,George,112," Oh, nothing much. You know, I went over to Jerry's. Talked to 
        Jerry. Um, could I talk to you for a minute? "
21276,Susan,112," Yeah, sure."
21277,George,112," You see this is the thing. . . . [crying] I just feel . . . mumble, 
        cry, mumble, . . . I'm scared. You and I together, [cry] "
21278,Susan,112," George, of course, of course it can wait until march if that is 
        what you want."
21279,George,112, Yeah?
21280,Susan,112," Oh, don't worry your head. Of course."
21281,George,112, All right. [smiles behind her back]
21282,Elaine,112, I've got that magazine article for you.
21283,Jerry,112, You iknow I talked to the rabbi outside.
21284,Elaine,112, Are you
21285,Jerry,112, Understand you had a little talk with him too.
21286,Elaine,112," Yeah, talked earlier."
21287,Jerry,112," Yes I know, I know. "
21288,Elaine,112,. . . What does that mean?
21289,Jerry,112," Nothing, nothing. "
21290,Elaine,112, He didn't mention . . . 
21291,Jerry,112, Yes he did.
21292,Elaine,112, He told you about our conversation?
21293,Jerry,112, We had quite a little chat.
21294,Elaine,112, He told you about . . .
21295,Jerry,112," Yes, about how you're very jealous of George. How you wished it 
        was you who were getting married instead of him. "
21296,Elaine,112, He told you all that? How could he?
21297,Jerry,112," It didn't take much prodding either, I must say."
21298,Elaine,112, Can he do that? 
21299,Jerry,112, He did it.
21300,Elaine,112, But he's a Rabbi! How can a Rabbi have such a big mouth? 
21301,Jerry,112, That's what's so fascinating. 
21302,Jerry,112," You better finish your little caf latte there. They won't let 
        you in with it."
21303,Kramer,112, Why not?
21304,Jerry,112, Because they don't allow outside drinks into the movie.
21305,Kramer,112, Well that's stupid 
21306,Jerry,112, That's the rule.
21307,Kramer,112," Well, we'll just see if we can't get around that. "
21308,Rabbi,112," Oh, Elaine. Come in. Come in. So nice to see you again."
21309,E,112, Yeah
21310,Rabbi,112, Can I offere you some Kasha Varnishkas? 
21311,Elaine,112," No, no. Listen, Rabbi, I'd like to ask you a question. Why, why 
        did you tell my friend Jerry what I talked to you about? "
21312,Elaine,112, Mrs. Winston?
21313,Rabbi,112," Yes, we were waiting for our mail to arrive and I happened to 
        mention to her how you felt that it was never going ""to happen"" 
        for you."
21314,Elaine,112," What about Don Ramsey? You didn't mention anything to him did 
        you?"
21315,Rabbi,112, Don Ramsey?
21316,Elaine,112," You know that tall really good looking guy, he lives on the fifth 
        floor."
21317,Rabbi,112," Oh him! Well this morning I found myself in the elevator with 
        him"

21324,Kramer,112, I don't have anything. Ask him.
21325,Usher,112," All right, come on Coffee Boy, bring it out."
21326,Kramer,112, What?! 
21327,Usher,112, Here you go.
21328,Kramer,112, Ow
21329,Jerry,112," Elaine, if I could say a word here about Jewish people. That man 
        in no way represents our ability to take in a nice piece of juicy gossip 
        and keep it to ourselves."
21330,Elaine,112," You didn't say this to George, did you?"
21331,Jerry,112," No, . . . about how you wish it was YOU who was getting married 
        instead of him? Feelings of resentment, hostility?"
21332,Elaine,112," Yeah that! So, . . ."
21333,George,112, Hey oh. 
21334,Elaine,112," GEORGIE! CONGRATULATIONS! Oh, my god. I haven't seen you since 
        it happened. I'm so happy for you."
21335,George,112," Alright, thanks a lot. "

              for them. "

              take?"

21578,JERRY,113, Why not you call him Maestro.
21579,ELAINE,113, He is a Maestro.
21580,JERRY,113," Well, I'm great."
21581,ELAINE,113, So you say.
21582,JERRY,113," What about his house in Tuscany, he mention that?"
21583,ELAINE,113, Yeah. (bragging) I'm invited.
21584,JERRY,113," You know when I told him it was beautiful there, out of 
              the clear blue sky"
21585,ELAINE,113, Why?
21586,JERRY,113, I don't know. Maybe he's embarrassed by Americans.
21587,ELAINE,113," Yeah, well maybe there aren't any houses to rent there."
21588,JERRY,113, In all of Tuscany? I wonder.
21589,[Setting,113, Office of a Java World building] 
21590,MR STAR,113," I say we offer him $50,000 that's it, take it or leave 
              it."
21591,MR BURNS,113," How do we know how severe the burns are? Why don't we 
              have him "
21592,MS. JORDAN,113," Listen, the faster we dispose of this the better. This 
              thing gets into"
21593,MR STAR,113," All right, we'll start at 50,000 and free coffee at all 
              of our stores."
21594,MR STAR,113, (Answering secretary) Yes?
21595,SECRETARY,113, Mr. Chiles and Mr. Kramer are here.
21596,MR STAR,113, Send them in.
21597,MR STAR,113, Gentleman.
21598,MR STAR,113," Gentleman come in. Now we don't want to take up much of 
              your time. Let's"
21599,KRAMER,113, (Interrupting) I'LL TAKE IT!!
21600,[Setting,113, Jackie and Kramer in the back of a cab]
21601,JACKIE,113," I'll take it? Who told you to take it? Did I tell you to 
              take it? "
21602,KRAMER,113, No.
21603,JACKIE,113," I know the Maestro didn't tell you to take it, he wasn't 
              there. "
21604,KRAMER,113, Well I thought we were lucky to get anything.
21605,JACKIE,113, Free coffee?
21606,KRAMER,113, Yeah.
21607,JACKIE,113," I don't want free coffee. It's not hard to get coffee. 
              I can get my own"
21608,KRAMER,113, Well I didn't hear any Plus.
21609,JACKIE,113," 20 years practicing law I've never experienced anything 
              like this."
21610,KRAMER,113," Look, Java World. (To cabbie) Hey listen I'm gonna get 
              out here. I'm "

21613,MAESTRO,113, Beethoven's 7th.
21614,ELAINE,113, Yeah.
21615,JERRY,113, Hey you know we were just talking about you.
21616,MAESTRO,113, Oh yeah?
21617,JERRY,113," Yeah, ya know the other day how you mentioned that there 
              were no houses "
21618,MAESTRO,113," You didn't find one, did you?"
21619,JERRY,113, No. I'm not really looking.
21620,MAESTRO,113, Nor should you.
21621,JERRY,113," So are you telling me there's not one house to rent in all 
              of Tuscany?"
21622,MAESTRO,113," The houses are passed down from generation to generation, 
              it's very hard."
21623,JERRY,113," I can't get a sublet, a guest room, a cot, nothing?"
21624,MAESTRO,113, It's booked solid!
21625,ELAINE,113, It's BOOKED Jerry!
21626,JERRY,113, How'd you get yours?
21627,MAESTRO,113," Got lucky. Come on, Elaine, let's take a ride, I was about 
              to pop in some"
21628,JERRY,113, Maybe I'll check out France.
21629,JERRY,113," Hey George, do you believe this guy?"
21630,GEORGE,113, Who?
21631,JERRY,113, Bob Cobb.
21632,GEORGE,113, Bob Cobb?
21633,JERRY,113," You know, the Maestro."
21634,GEORGE,113, Oh I missed the Maestro?
21635,JERRY,113," Yeah, get this, he tells me there are no houses any where 
              in Tuscany to rent."
21636,GEORGE,113, Huh. Your renting a house in Tuscany?
21637,JERRY,113, No.
21638,GEORGE,113, So what do you care?
21639,[Setting,113, Monk's cafe. George and Jerry are sitting at the booth]
21640,JERRY,113," I just wish I could figure out if this guy is trying to 
              keep me out of "
21641,GEORGE,113," Of course he is. There's got to be houses for rent in Tuscany. 
              Do you "
21642,JERRY,113, I have no idea.
21643,GEORGE,113, It it's huge. It's probably like North Dakota.
21644,JERRY,113," Oh, no way it's that big."
21645,GEORGE,113, It's a big region.
21646,JERRY,113, Do you know how big North Dakota is stupid?
21647,GEORGE,113, I don't know why I bother even talking to you.
21648,JERRY,113," Hey, no one's got a gun to your head."
21649,GEORGE,113, All right.
21650,GEORGE,113, So I spoke to the security guard.
21651,JERRY,113, Yeah and?
21652,GEORGE,113," Well it's tough to get a good read but I think if I brought 
              him a chair,"
21653,JERRY,113, So are you gonna get him a chair?
21654,GEORGE,113," Yup. It's really just a question of what kind. Thinking 
              about a bar stool."
21655,JERRY,113," Yeah, that would give him some height, be able to check 
              things out. With a"
21656,GEORGE,113, Oh I think I'd go for the back.
21657,JERRY,113, Swivel?
21658,GEORGE,113," I suppose he could swivel. Hey maybe one of those director's 
              chairs. What"
21659,JERRY,113," I thinks it's kind of a pompous look. You know my parents 
              used to have a "
21660,GEORGE,113, You mean one of those vinyl things?
21661,JERRY,113, Yes.
21662,GEORGE,113," Vinyl yeah, maybe."
21663,JERRY,113," How can I figure out if there's any places to rent in Tuscany? 
              Wait a "
21664,GEORGE,113," Yeah, good luck. Hey I'll meet you outside."

21667,JERRY,113," Poppy told me to talk to his cousin, he lives down in Little 
              Italy."
21668,GEORGE,113, What do you think about a rocking chair?
21669,KRAMER,113," (Speaking very fast and fidgety) You can't put a limit 
              on my cafe lattes,"
21670,JERRY,113," Hey hey hey, slow down Eddie. What what's the matter?"
21671,KRAMER,113," Awe there making faces at me cause I've had a couple of 
              cafe lattes. But I'm"
21672,JERRY,113, That's it?

              you. No problem."
21674,JERRY,113, You've got to stop it. Your your all hopped up on the caffein.
21675,KRAMER,113," Well I feel like I'm talking fast but it's very hard to 
              tell."
21676,JERRY,113, You're racing!
21677,KRAMER,113, Well well I've got things to do. I'll see you later. Bye.

21682,CLERK,113," (Noticing George with the rocking chair) Excuse me. Can 
              I help you?"
21683,GEOGE,113," Nope. Just a, giving a chair to the security guard."
21684,CLERK,113, Did Mr. Ross tell you to do this?
21685,GEORGE,113, What's your name?
21686,CLERK,113, Evan Fayne.
21687,GEORGE,113," I'm engaged to Mr. Ross' niece. I'm probably gonna be taking 
              over this "
21688,CLERK,113," I'm terribly sorry, I didn't know."
21689,GEORGE,113, Innocent mistake.
21690,GEORGE,113," Well, here you go. What do you think?"
21691,GUARD,113, Mr. Ross says this is O.K.?
21692,GEORGE,113," Hey, I'm his nephew, all right? Don't worry about it. Go 
              ahead. Check it out."

21727,ELAINE,114, Hello
21728,ELAINE,114," Oh, god. OH, I could use a few more hours sleep."
21729,JAMES,114, Hot date last night?
21730,ELAINE,114, I wish.
21731,JAMES,114," A woman with a sexy voice like yours its hard to believe your 
        waking up alone."
21732,ELAINE,114," Really? Thank you., wake up service . . . person."
21733,JAMES,114, Call me James.
21734,ELAINE,114," Oh, all right, James. He he he"
21735,GEORGE,114, Your wake up guy asked you out?
21736,ELAINE,114," Yeah, I've never seen him but I feel like we have this weirdly 
        intimate relationship. I mean, I'm lying in bed, I'm wearing my nightie, 
      "
21737,JERRY,114, I don't know. Blind date?
21738,ELAINE,114," What? You're going to go out with my cousin Holly. You've never 
        met her."
21739,JERRY,114," Yeah, but I've seen pictures of her."
21740,ELAINE,114, At least I've spoken to my guy. You're going out on a deaf date.
21741,JERRY,114," I think I'd rather go out on a deaf date than a blind date. The 
        question is whether you'd rather date the blind or the deaf."
21742,ELAINE,114," Ah, . . . "
21743,GEORGE,114, Now you're off on a topic.
21744,JERRY,114," You know, I think, I would rather date the deaf."
21745,ELAINE,114, Uh hu.
21746,JERRY,114," Because I think the blind would probably be a little messier around 
        the house. And lets face it they're not going to get all the crumbs. I'd 
        possibly be walking around with a sponge."
21747,GEORGE,114," You see I disagree. I'd rather be dating the blind. You know 
        you could let the house go. You could let yourself go. A good looking 
        blind woman doesn't even know you're not good enough for her. "
21748,ELAINE,114, I think she'd figure it out. 
21749,ELAINE,114, What? What is this?
21750,JERRY,114, Veggie sandwich and a grapefruit.
21751,ELAINE,114, Veggie sandwich and a grapefruit? What are you turning into?
21752,JERRY,114, A healthy person. 
21753,GEORGE,114," [ rubbing his eye] Ow, Ow you squirted me."
21754,JERRY,114," Oh, sorry"
21755,GEORGE,114," Boy, it stings."
21756,WILHELM,114," George, have you seen Morgan?"
21757,GEORGE,114, No.
21758,WILHELM,114, He's been coming in late all week. Is there something wrong?
21759,GEORGE,114," No, not that I know of. (winks)"
21760,WILHELM,114," Really? Make sure he signs this. Oh, look George, if there's 
        a problem with Morgan you can tell me."
21761,GEORGE,114, Morgan? No. He's doing a great job. (winks)
21762,WILHELM,114, I understand.
21763,JERRY,114," I still can't believe, you're going out on a blind date."
21764,ELAINE,114, I'm not worried. It sounds like he's really good looking.
21765,JERRY,114, You're going by sound? What are we? Whales?
21766,ELAINE,114, I think I can tell.
21767,JERRY,114," Elaine, what percentage of people would you say are good looking?"
21768,ELAINE,114, Twenty-five percent.
21769,JERRY,114," Twenty-five percent, you say? No way! It's like 4 to 6 percent. 
        It's a twenty to one shot."
21770,ELAINE,114, You're way off. 
21771,JERRY,114," Way off? Have you been to the motor vehicle bureau? It's like 
        a leper colony down there."
21772,ELAINE,114," So what you are saying is that 90 to 95 percent of the population 
        is undateable?"
21773,JERRY,114, UNDATEABLE! 
21774,ELAINE,114, Then how are all these people getting together?
21775,JERRY,114, Alcohol. 
21776,ELAINE,114, (to George who is winking) What is your problem?
21777,GEORGE,114, No problem here.
21778,ELAINE,114, You keep winking at me. That's really obnoxious.
21779,GEORGE,114, I had no idea.
21780,ELAINE,114, Right there. Right there. You just did it again.
21781,GEORGE,114," Wait a minute. Wait a minute. It's from that grapefruit that 
        Jerry squirted at me."
21782,ELAINE,114, You're eye still hurts?
21783,GEORGE,114," Yeah, yeah. You must have squirted a piece of pulp in it too."
21784,JERRY,114, Pulp couldn't make it across the table.
21785,GEORGE,114," Pulp can move, Baby! Why didn't you eat a real breakfast?"
21786,JERRY,114," Hey, I eat healthy. If I have to take out an eye, that's the breaks."
21787,GEORGE,114," Wait a minute. I must have been winking down at the office. That's 
        why Mr. Wilhelm was acting so mysteriouso."
21788,ELAINE,114," What did he think, you were flirtin' with him?"
21789,GEORGE,114," Hu, oh. No he thought I was hiding something from him about Morgan. 
      "
21790,KRAMER,114, Hi guys.
21791,JERRY,114," Hi, "
21792,KRAMER,114," Hello Archie, Veronica, Mr. Weatherbee. . . . Is this Don Matingly's 
        signature? "
21793,GEORGE,114, Yeah.
21794,KRAMER,114, And Buck Showalter's?
21795,GEORGE,114," It's an inter-office envelope. It get passed around all over 
        the office."
21796,KRAMER,114," Um, can I show this to my buddy Stubbs . He runs a sports memorabilia 
        store. He pays top dollar for pro autographs. "
21797,GEORGE,114," Yeah, like I'm going to risk my job with the New York Yankees 
        to make a few extra bucks. (winks)"
21798,KRAMER,114," No, of course not. (winks back)"
21799,KRAMER,114," You know, you see Don Matingly signed this envelope then he sent 
        it to room 318, where it was received and signed for by manager Buck Showalter."
21800,STEINBRENNER,114, I don't know. An envelope doesn't really cut it.
21801,GEORGE,114, Is that the lovely Mrs. Morgan? 
21802,MM,114, Hello.
21803,MORGAN,114," Oh, by the way, have you got that birthday card? "
21804,GEORGE,114, Birthday card?
21805,MORGAN,114," Mr. Steinbrenner's birthday card. Wilhem said you had it for 
        me to sign."
21806,GEORGE,114," Oh ah, I uh, will have that for you by after lunch."
21807,MORGAN,114, Fine. I'll be back after my massage.
21808,GEORGE,114, Of course. Your massage. (winks) Enjoy your massage. (winks)
21809,ELAINE,114, Hello.
21810,James,114, Elaine?
21811,ELAINE,114," James! Ah, ha, Hello! Phew!"
21812,HOLLY,114, I can't believe you've never taken anybody here before.
21813,JERRY,114," Well, I'm not really that much of a meat eater."
21814,HOLLY,114, . . . You don't eat meat? Are you one of those. . .
21815,JERRY,114," Well, no, I'm not one of those."
21816,HOLLY,114," When we were little girls Grandma Memma would take us to a matinee 
        and then dinner here."
21817,JERRY,114, Grandma Memma? 
21818,HOLLY,114, Elaine must have mentioned Grandma Memma.
21819,JERRY,114," No, I think I would have remembered Memma."
21820,HOLLY,114," Oh well, that's typical. Elaine never liked Grandma Memma."
21821,WAITER,114, Ready? 
21822,HOLLY,114," I'll have the porterhouse medium rare, baked potato with sour 
        cream, "
21823,JERRY,114, What do you recommend besides the steak?
21824,WAITER,114, The lamb chops are good.
21825,JERRY,114, Anything lighter? How do you prepare the chicken?
21826,WAITER,114," It's a full bird. Stuffed with ham, topped with gorganzola."
21827,JERRY,114, You know what? I think I'll just have the salad.
21828,WAITER,114, . . . Thank you.
21829,JERRY,114, (mind's voice) Just a salad? Just a salad? Just a salad?
21830,JAMES,114," Hey you, hey you."
21831,ELAINE,114," Oh, uh, ha, you've got dogs?"
21832,JAMES,114," Yeah, you know, when you live alone, you're dogs are all you have. 
        Do you like dogs?"
21833,ELAINE,114," (mind's voice from -  ) SHUT UP! YOU STUPID LITTLE MUT 
        !"
21834,ELAINE,114, Dogs. Oh I love dogs.
21835,JAMES,114," Boys, this is Elaine. . . . Sorry, they're usually very friendly. 
        Hey! "
21836,GEORGE,114," Hey, Mr. Morgan how was your massage?"
21837,MORGAN,114," I had to cancel it. For some reason my wife got it into her head 
        that it was more than just a massage."
21838,GEORGE,114, Really?
21839,MORGAN,114," Yeah, we had this big fight at lunch it looks like tonight I 
        will be sleeping on the couch."
21840,GEORGE,114," Hey, listen don't oversleep. You can't afford to be late again."
21841,MORGAN,114," I know. Somebody around here has been giving Wilhelm the impression 
        that I have been slacking off. "
21842,GEORGE,114," Geez, Hey you know something, you should try my friend's wake 
        up service. She swears by this thing."
21843,MORGAN,114," Costanza, you may be my only friend around here. By the way, 
        you got that birthday card?"
21844,GEORGE,114," Ah, not yet. "
21845,MORGAN,114, Just make sure Steinbrenner doesn't get it until I sign it.
21846,GEORGE,114, Yes sir!
21847,ELAINE,114," I just don't understand it as soon as I met these dogs they started 
        growling at me."
21848,JERRY,114," Maybe his dogs heard about how you tried to kidnap that other 
        dog. These muts like to gossip. So have you talked too Holly? "
21849,ELAINE,114, Huh huh.
21850,JERRY,114, Did she mention anything about our lunch?
21851,ELAINE,114," Uh, kind of."
21852,JERRY,114," What do you mean, ""kind of.""?"
21853,ELAINE,114," I mean, she thought it was kind of strange to just order a salad. 
        . . . You know. . . . For a man."
21854,JERRY,114," What are you saying? . . . Salad! What was I thinking? Women don't 
        respect salad eaters."
21855,ELAINE,114, You got that right.
21856,JERRY,114," But you're going over there for dinner tonight, right?"
21857,ELAINE,114, Um uh.
21858,JERRY,114, What is she making?
21859,ELAINE,114," I don't know. But I'm sure it had, . . . parents. Call her up. 
        She won't mind if you come."
21860,JERRY,114," Oh, don't worry. I'll be there and I'll be packing an artery. 
      "
21861,KRAMER,114," Ah, Mr. Weatherbee. "
21862,GEORGE,114, You got the Yankee envelope?
21863,KRAMER,114, Sure do.
21864,GEORGE,114," oh, "
21865,KRAMER,114, Here you go.
21866,GEORGE,114," Hey, he, "
21867,KRAMER,114, You'll be pleased to see what's inside.
21868,GEORGE,114, What is this?
21869,KRAMER,114," You're cut of the loot. Stubs gave me 200 dollars for the autographed 
        birthday card that was inside."
21870,GEORGE,114, Who told you to sell the card?
21871,KRAMER,114, You did.
21872,GEORGE,114, No I didn't! 
21873,KRAMER,114," No, not in so many words but I believe we had an understanding. 
        (winks)"
21874,GEORGE,114," I was not winking you idiot. That was the grapefruit. It's like 
        acid. I need that card back. It's Mr. Steinbrenner's. I was responsible."
21875,KRAMER,114," Well Stubs has already sold it to some guy who's kid's in the 
        hospital ."
21876,GEORGE,114, Well get it back! It's very important. (winks)
21877,KRAMER,114," Look, do you want me to get it back or not?"
21878,GEORGE,114, (holds eyes wide open) Get it back!
21879,ELAINE,114," Such a lovely table setting. Oh, wear did you get these napkins?"
21880,HOLLY,114, They're grandma Memma's.
21881,ELAINE,114," Oh, I don't remember them."
21882,HOLLY,114," Oh, you wouldn't. She only used them on special occasions."
21883,ELAINE,114, Special occassions? It wasn't special when my family visited?
21884,HOLLY,114, Everybody like mutton?
21885,JERRY,114," Um, mutton! Hope you didn't cut the fat off."
21886,KRAMER,114, That you Bobby?
21887,BOBBY,114, Sure do. Mister.
21888,KRAMER,114," Oh, that's it, yeah. Boy, Stubs sure went to town with this thing 
        huh? Yeah, well, Bobby, uh, what if I told you a very important person 
        at the New York Yankees needed this card back. "
21889,BOBBY,114," Oh, no. I'd never part with this card for anything in the world."
21890,KRAMER,114," Well, uh, Bobby, uh, who's your favorite Yankee."
21891,BOBBY,114, Paul O'Neill. 
21892,KRAMER,114," All right. What if I tell Paul O'Neill to hit a home run tomorrow, 
        just for you."
21893,BOBBY,114, Would he? Paul O'Neill would do that?
21894,KRAMER,114, For you he would.
21895,BOBBY,114, Would he hit two home runs?
21896,KRAMER,114," Two? Sure kid, yeah. But then you gotta promise you'll do something 
        for me."
21897,BOBBY,114, I know. Get out of this bed one day and walk again.
21898,KRAMER,114," Yeah, that would be nice. But I really just need this card."
21899,ELAINE,114, What about this candelabra?
21900,HOLLY,114," Yeah, that was grandma Memma's also. She bought it on her trip 
        to Europe in 1936. Jerry, I'm thrilled you like my mutton. I was afrais 
        you only ate . . . salad."
21901,JERRY,114," Hey, salad's got nothin' on this mutton."
21902,HOLLY,114, That is so funny. Did you just make that up?
21903,JERRY,114," I wish I could take credit for it. It's actually the line my butcher 
        uses when we're chewing the fat. How about that beautiful desk over there? 
        (hides meat in napkin in jacket)"
21904,HOLLY,114, That was in Grandma's study.
21905,ELAINE,114," What did you do, ransack the place after she died?"
21906,JERRY,114, This is some FINE mutton.
21907,ELAINE,114, I'm getting out of here. Can I borrow your jacket?
21908,JERRY,114," Uh, well, uh the thing is that . . . (Jerry grabs jacket back)"
21909,ELAINE,114," It's cold out, and I didn't bring my own. Jerry! God forbid I 
        should borrow one from Holly. It might have belonged to grandma Memma. 
        Thanks for mutton."
21910,ELAINE,114," Down boy, nice doggy . I'm a nice person. Don't believe what 
        you hear."
21911,HOLLY,114, Where are the napkins?
21912,JERRY,114, I don't know about that. Have you got any floss?
21913,HOLLY,114," You heard her. She coveted them. I bet she took them just to spite 
        me. She's probably having a good laugh about it right now. "
21914,ELAINE,114, Down doggy . oh oh a a a a a 
21915,JERRY,114," Elaine, what are you doing in this neighborhood?"
21916,ELAINE,114, Did you do with the dogs?
21917,JERRY,114," Yeah, they're in the kitchen. . . . okay, quite! What's going 
        on?"
21918,ELAINE,114," These dogs were chasing me. And no cab would stop and I had to 
        get off the street. Then I remembered that you lived here."
21919,JERRY,114, Why were dogs chasing you?
21920,ELAINE,114," They just don't like me. It's a long story. I can tell you one 
        day but I can't tell you right now. "
21921,JERRY,114," I would askk you to stay tonight but I only have the sofa bed 
        and it's where I sleep. "
21922,ELAINE,114, We'll have to sleep head to toe. 
21923,JERRY,114, Head to toe?
21924,ELAINE,114, Head to toe.
21925,JERRY,114," I'm sorry I didn't get any sleep you kept kicking me in the face. 
      "
21926,ELAINE,114, You're a wake up guy. Don't you have calls to make?
21927,JERRY,114, I'll make them later. Uh.
21928,WILHELM,114, Have you seen Morgan?
21929,GEORGE,114, He's not here?
21930,WILHELM,114," No, He's late."
21931,GEORGE,114, It's impossible. I got him a wake up service.
21932,WILHELM,114," Now, George, you don't have to cover for him any more. He's 
        going to be gone soon and I'm going to recommend you for his job."
21933,GEORGE,114, . . . gone?
21934,JERRY,114, It sounds like all the winking got you a promotion.
21935,GEORGE,114," I don't want Morgan's job. He's got a lot of work to do. Hey, 
        Elaine, your friend never woke up Mr. Morgan."
21936,ELAINE,114," Nah, he was tired. He had some feet in his face. My cousin Holly 
        is completely insane. She keeps calling and accusing me of stealing her 
        napkins. "
21937,GEORGE,114, Napkins?
21938,ELAINE,114," I mean, why? Why would I take her stupid napkins. "
21939,JERRY,114, Because they were in the pockets of my jacket. 
21940,ELAINE,114, They were?
21941,JERRY,114, Yes. I was using them to spit out the mutton. 
21942,ELAINE,114," Spit it out? I had dogs chasing me for that mutton. I was almost 
        mauled because of that mutton. "
21943,GEORGE,114, What exactly is mutton?
21944,JERRY,114," I don't know and I didn't want to find out. So where is my jacket? 
      "
21945,ELAINE,114," Oh, I must have left it at Jame's "
21946,JERRY,114, You spent the night at James's? Did we?
21947,ELAINE,114, Yeah but we reversed positions so there was no funny business.
21948,JERRY,114, Reversed positions? 
21949,ELAINE,114," Yeah, you know, head to toe."
21950,JERRY,114, So what your genitals are still lined up. 
21951,ELAINE,114," No, because I slept with my back to him. "
21952,KRAMER,114, Mr. O'Neill?
21953,O'NEILL,114, Yeah.
21954,KRAMER,114," Yeah, uh, look, you don't know me."
21955,O'NEILL,114," I can give you an autograph there, but my pen's kind of screwed 
        up. You'd only like half a ""P"" or something."
21956,KRAMER,114," No, it's uh, not that see,. It's about a little boy in a hospital. 
        I was wondering if you could do something to lift his spirits. "
21957,O'NEILL,114," Sure, I could help you there. "
21958,KRAMER,114," Sure, well I promised you would hit him two home runs."
21959,O'NEILL,114, Say what?
21960,KRAMER,114," You know, Klick!. A couple of dingers."
21961,O'NEILL,114," You promised a kid in the hospital that I would hit two home 
        runs?"
21962,KRAMER,114," Yeah, well, no good?"
21963,O'NEILL,114," Yeah. That's no good. It's terrible. You don't hit home runs 
        like that. It's hard to hit home runs. And where the heck did you get 
        two from?"
21964,KRAMER,114, Two is better than one.
21965,O'NEILL,114," That, that's ridiculous. I'm not a home run hitter."
21966,KRAMER,114," Well, Babe Ruth did it."
21967,O'NEILL,114, He did not.
21968,KRAMER,114," Oh, do you say that Babe Ruth is a liar? "
21969,O'NEILL,114," I'm not calling him a liar but he was not stupid enough to promise 
        two."
21970,KRAMER,114," Well, maybe I did overextend myself."
21971,O'NEILL,114, How the heck did you get in here anyway?
21972,TV,114, The Yankees take the field on a beautiful afternoon.
21973,KRAMER,114," It's hot in here. Hey, Bobby, can I have some of your juice?"
21974,BOBBY,114, After Paul O'Neill hits his first home run.
21975,HOLLY,114, (from buzzer) It's Holly.
21976,JERRY,114, Yeah. Come on up.
21977,TV,114," And the two and one pitch to O'Neill. A towering shot back to deep 
        right field and it's gone."
21978,KRAMER,114, Yeah.
21979,TV,114, A home run for Paul O'Neill. The Yanks lead one nothing.
21980,KRAMER,114, OH YEAH! ALL RIGHT!
21981,BOBBY,114, One more to go.
21982,JERRY,114, Hey. What's all this?
21983,HOLLY,114, I decided I was going to make you dinner.
21984,JERRY,114, I thought we were going out.
21985,HOLLY,114," Well, after you scarfed up my mutton I had the irresistible urge 
        to make pork chops for you. I said hello to Franco for you. "
21986,JERRY,114, Franco?
21987,HOLLY,114," Your butcher, down the street."
21988,JERRY,114, I bet he acted aloof like he didn't know me.
21989,HOLLY,114, A little.
21990,JERRY,114, That is so Franco.
21991,TV,114," Bottom of the eighth, score tied at one apiece. Two and one to Paul 
        O'Neill."
21992,KRAMER,114," You know Bobby, it's very very hard to hit two home runs in one 
        game. Even for Paul O'Neill."
21993,KRAMER,114," He can do it, Mr. Kramer. I know he can. He'll do it for me."
21994,TV,114," ""Klick! Long fly ball into deep left field over Bell's head 
        . . . O'Neill's rounding second O'Neill going for third, O'Neill rounding 
        . . . "
21995,KRAMER,114, Come on Come on!
21996,TV,114, . . . third being waived in.
21997,KRAMER,114, GO! GO!!
21998,TV,114," . . . Martinez throws it over Alomar's head. O'Neill is safe at home. 
        And the Yankees take the lead."
21999,KRAMER,114, An In The Park Home Run!
22000,BOBBY,114, Yeay!
22001,KRAMER,114," All Right! Yeah, well, I guess I'll be on my way (grabs framed 
        card)"
22002,TV,114," That's being scored a triple for Paul O'Neill with a throwing error 
        charged to Martinez."
22003,BOBBY,114," Hey,  "
22004,KRAMER,114, Huh? 
22005,BOBBY,114,  that's not a home run. (grabs frame)
22006,KRAMER,114," Yeah, maybe not technically, but "
22007,BOBBY,114, You said he'd hit two home runs.
22008,KRAMER,114," Oh, come on. Bobby, Bobby! That's just as good!"
22009,BOBBY,114," Well, you're not taking that card."
22010,KRAMER,114," Now, Bobby, Bobby, we had a deal . . . gimme that  "
22011,HOLLY,114," So, is the chop the way you like it?"
22012,JERRY,114, I usually like mine with an angioplasty.
22013,ELAINE,114," You know something really stinks to high h Holly! What 
        are you doing here?"
22014,JERRY,114, What everyone does here. - Cooking pork chops.
22015,ELAINE,114," I'm uh, I'm meeting James here. He's bringing over your jacket."
22016,HOLLY,114, What about the napkins?
22017,ELAINE,114, I didn't take your napkins.
22018,HOLLY,114, Then who did?
22019,ELAINE,114, Ask Jerry.
22020,JERRY,114," We could argue all night over who took the napkins. The point 
        is in today's modern world it just doesn't seem relevant."
22021,WILHELM,114," I still want to know what happened to that birthday card? Now, 
        Morgan, did you ever sign it? "
22022,MORGAN,114," No sir, George never gave it to me."
22023,GEORGE,114," No, that's right, I didn't. I take full responsibility for the 
        card not being here. I, uh, . . . "
22024,KRAMER,114," Hi, "
22025,KRAMER,114," (to George) Oh, by the way, tomorrow night, Paull O'Neill has 
        to catch a fly ball in his hat."
22026,WILHELM,114," George, this is beautiful. Why didn't you tell me you were going 
        to have it mounted like this?"
22027,KRAMER,114, And you were probably just going to stick it in an envelope.
22028,WILHELM,114," Ha ha ha ha ha, George, keep up the good work."
22029,MORGAN,114," Ha ha, uh, well you screwed me again, Costanza. How am I supposed 
        to sign the card now when it's already under glass?"
22030,ELAINE,114," Uh, this is,"
22031,HOLLY,114, Excuse me. What are those dogs wearing?
22032,JAMES,114," Oh, bandanas, aren't they cute?"
22033,HOLLY,114, You gave Memma's napkins to some dogs?!
22034,JERRY,114," Hey, what happened to my jacket?"
22035,JAMES,114," Oh, the dogs did that but it wasn't their fault, somebody stuffed 
        some strange meat in the pocket."
22036,HOLLY,114, Was it mutton?
22037,JAMES,114, Could have been.
22038,HOLLY,114, Do you always stuff meat in your pocket?
22039,JERRY,114," Uh, sometimes I use the sofa."
22040,GEORGE,114," You wanted to see me, Mr. Steinbrenner?"
22041,STEINBRENNER,114," Yes, George, please, come in, come in."
22042,STEINBRENNER,114," Thanks for the card. I loved it. Gosh it made me feel good. 
        You know, word has it that you were the brains behind the whole thing."
22043,GEORGE,114," Oh, no, not just me, the whole organization. Especially Mr. Morgan. 
      "
22044,STEINBRENNER,114," Morgan, Morgan, you know his name is conspicuously absent 
        from this card. Almost like he went out of his way not to sign it."
22045,GEORGE,114," Oh no, Morgan is a good man sir."
22046,STEINBRENNER,114," You can stop kowtowing to Morgan. Congratulations, you 
        got his job. "
22047,GEORGE,114," Wa, uh, thank you sir, you know I am not quite sure I'm right 
        for it."
22048,STEINBRENNER,114," Stop it George, he's out, you're in."
22049,STEINBRENNER,114, A lot more work you know.
22050,GEORGE,114, I know.
22051,STEINBRENNER,114, A lot more responsibility. Long long hours.
22052,GEORGE,114, I know.
22053,STEINBRENNER,114," Not much more money. But you'll finally get the recognition 
        you deserve."
22054,GEORGE,114," That's what I'm afraid of. You know Mr. Steinbrenner, . . . "
22055,STEINBRENNER,114," You know as painfull as it is I had to let a few people 
        go over the years. Yogi Berra, Lou Pinella, Bucky Dent, Billy Martin, 
        Dallas Green, Dick Houser, Bill Virdon, Billy Martin, Scott Marrow, Billy 
        Martin, Bob Lemmon, Billy Martin, Gene Michael, Buck Showalter,  
        uh, tut!, . . .George, you didn't hear that from me. [George exits] . 
        . . George!"
22056,"How do you live with that the rest of your life? People are gonna 
              keep asking",115, 
22057,Jerry,115," (to Elaine) I can't believe you write for this J.Peterman 
              catalog."
22058,(to George) Get this one,115," ""I packed my rod and reel. 30 hours 
              later, lost in the fiord, a"
22059,George,115, This catalog is all about how to score in a foreign country.
22060,Elaine,115, Yeah. What do you do all day?
22061,George,115, Not that much.
22062,Elaine,115, uh-uh.
22063,Jerry,115," I thought that new promotion was supposed to be a lot more 
              work."
22064,George,115," Yeah, when the season starts. Right now, I sit around pretending 
              that I'm busy."
22065,Jerry,115, How do you pull that off?
22066,George,115," I always look annoyed. Yeah, when you look annoyed all 
              the time, people think that you're"
22067,Elaine,115," Yeah, you do! He looks very busy!"
22068,Jerry,115," Yeah, he looks busy! Yeah!"
22069,George,115," I know what I'm doin'. In fact Mr. Wilhelm gave me one 
              of those little stress dolls."
22070,Elaine,115, (laughs)
22071,Jerry,115," So did you come up with a little stupid story for the Himalayan 
              walking shoe yet?"
22072,Elaine,115," No. I'm completely blocked! In fact, I'm gonna work on 
              it tonight. Oh. Oh no! Oh, I can't!"
22073,Jerry,115, What marathon runner?
22074,Elaine,115," You know, this guy Jean-Paul, Jean-Paul... I met him when 
              I was working at Pendant,"
22075,Jerry,115," Oh, wait! Jean-Paul, Jean-Paul! Isn't he the guy who overslept 
              at the Olympics 4 years ago"
22076,Elaine,115," Yeah, that's him."
22077,Jerry,115," He's from uh...Trinidad and Tobago, right?"
22078,Elaine,115," Yeah, he's Trinidadian and...Tobagan. (laughs)"
22079,Jerry,115, How do you oversleep at the Olympics...?
22080,Elaine,115," Ah, I know. I know...!"
22081,Jerry,115," I mean, it's like the biggest event of your life! You'd 
              think you'd have, like, 6 alarm"
22082,Elaine,115," Yeah, well, he was pretty devastated. This is his first 
              race in 3 years."
22083,Jerry,115, Ah...that's a big responsability on your hands.
22084,Elaine,115, What responsibility? I don't have any responsibility.
22085,Jerry,115, You gotta wake him up!
22086,Elaine,115, Eh...he'll get up...
22087,Elaine,115," Hi, Judy."
22088,Judy,115," Hi, Elaine. How are you?"
22089,Elaine,115, Fine. (laughs)
22090,Jerry,115, I've seen her in your building.
22091,Elaine,115, Yeah.
22092,Jerry,115, I didn't know she was married.
22093,Elaine,115," (whispering) She's not... and the guy just took off. (makes 
              a sad face)"
22094,Jerry,115, Whom I gonna tell?
22095,Elaine,115," I know, it's just something you have to say..."
22096,Wilhelm,115," George, we just got the final budget numbers. We went 
              over budget on some of the items,"
22097,Jerry,115, He overslept and missed the whole race. Isn't that amazing?
22098,George,115, I'll tell you what happened. I bet he got the AM/PM mixed-up.
22099,Jerry,115," My money's on the snooze. I bet he hit the snooze for an 
              extra 5 and it never came back"
22100,Kramer,115, Alarm clocks? I never use 'em. Don't trust 'em.
22101,Jerry,115, What do you do?
22102,Kramer,115," I have a uh...mental alarm. I set my head for... quarter 
              to seven and..."
22103,Jerry,115, Always works?
22104,Kramer,115," It never fails. See, it's based on your body clock. See, 
              your body has an internal"
22105,George,115, uh-uh. What's with the bucket?
22106,Kramer,115," Lomez, he sold me his hot tub."
22107,Jerry,115, Hot tub?
22108,Kramer,115," Yeah yeah, it's in my living room. I just gotta fill it. 
              (points to bucket)"
22109,George,115, You put a hot tub... in your living room?
22110,Kramer,115," Oh, it's a beauty! It's got these high-volume aqua-sage 
              jets oscillating and pulsating, "
22111,George,115, Is that tolerable?
22112,Kramer,115, Oh...it's tolerable...! (happy)
22113,Jerry,115," Isn't that the same temperature the coffee that scalded 
              you?"
22114,Kramer,115," Oh, I think it's a little cooler than that... (smiles and 
              leaves)"
22115,George,115, He uh...doesn't have any running water?
22116,Jerry,115, I don't ask those kind of questions anymore.
22117,Elaine,115," Jerry. Jerry, this is Jean-Paul."
22118,Jerry,115," Ah, hi Jean-Paul. Nice to meet you."
22119,Jean-Paul,115, Nice to meet you.
22120,Jerry,115, Sorry about the Olympics.
22121,Jean-Paul,115, Me too. (disappointed)
22122,Elaine,115," Listen, listen I'm gonna go call work to see if I can get 
              my deadline extended."
22123,Jerry,115, Ah...catalog writer's block?
22124,Elaine,115," Yeah, that's funny. (annoyed)"
22125,Jerry,115," (pause) So what happened? The snooze alarm, wasn't it?"
22126,Jean-Paul,115," Man, it wasn't the snooze. Most people think it was 
              the snooze, but no, no snooze."
22127,Jerry,115, AM/PM.
22128,Jean-Paul,115," Man, it wasn't the AM/PM. It was the volume."
22129,Jerry,115, Ah...the volume.
22130,Jean-Paul,115," Yes, the volume. There was a separate knob for the radio 
              alarm."
22131,Jerry,115," Ah, separate knob."
22132,Jean-Paul,115," Yes, separate knob. Why separate knob?! Why separate 

              knob?! (frustrated)"
22133,Jerry,115," Some people like to have the radio alarm a little louder 
              than the radio. "
22134,Jean-Paul,115," Oh, please, man, please!"
22135,Jerry,115," Don't worry, it's not gonna happen again. Not if I have 
              anything to say about it."
22136,Jerry,115," Elaine, what's the alarm clock situation in your house?"
22137,Elaine,115, Jerry...
22138,Jerry,115, It's a simple question...
22139,Elaine,115," I've got an alarm, ok?"
22140,Jerry,115," That old one? Didn't I once miss a flight to Cleveland because 
              of that alarm clock?"
22141,Jean-Paul,115, Flight to Cleveland?
22142,Elaine,115, It works.
22143,Jerry,115, Elaine...
22144,Elaine,115, It... works!
22145,George,115," Eh...come oooon...(starts stabbing the paper with the pen. 
              Mr. Wilhelm comes in)"
22146,Wilhelm,115, George...I think you may be taking work a little too seriously.
22147,George,115, Well...I've got a lot to do!
22148,Wilhelm,115," George, I'll tell you what I'd like you to do. I, I'd 
              like you to drop everything."
22149,Wilhelm,115," I have this... fun little assignment I think you'll enjoy. 
              There's some reps in from"
22150,Elaine,115, Hey. Sorry I'm late.
22151,Jerry,115, You're 40 minutes late. What happened?
22152,Elaine,115, I got held up. Do you mind if I heat this muffin up?
22153,Jerry,115, No.
22154,Elaine,115," What? (Elaine puts her muffin in the microwave and sets 
              the timer) What is the problem?"
22155,Jerry,115," Well, you said you were gonna be here at a certain time, 
              and you weren't."
22156,Elaine,115, uh-uh. uh-uh. And this all means uh...what?
22157,Jerry,115," Well, means that a man has come from very far away to compete 
              in a very difficult race,"
22158,Elaine,115, Oh are you?!
22159,Jerry,115, Yes I am.
22160,Elaine,115," Hey, I'm not running in the marathon! He is!"
22161,Jerry,115," Yeah, I know that!"
22162,Elaine,115," Yeah, I got enough to think about just tryin' to come up 
              with some load o'crap for that"
22163,Jerry,115," I'm not talking about upside down. (Jean-Paul and Kramer 
              come in) I'm talking about waking"
22164,Elaine,115," Hey, Jean-Paul."
22165,Jerry,115," Hey, Jean-Paul. How was your soak? Was a good soak?"
22166,Jean-Paul,115," Ah, man, very good soak. The soak o'the year!"
22167,Kramer,115, (smelling) What's burning?
22168,Elaine,115," Oh! (rushing to the microwave) My muffin! (opens microwave 
              door) Oh, shoot! (slams it)"
22169,Jerry,115, What happened?
22170,Elaine,115, Oh I don't know. I set this thing for 20 seconds.
22171,Kramer,115, This was set for 2 minutes. See?
22172,Elaine,115, (pointing at Jerry) Don't say anything! Don't..say..anything!
22173,Jean-Paul,115, You miss-set the timer...
22174,Elaine,115," (leaning against the refrigerator) Jean-Paul, it's not 
              my microwave, ok? Ok? All right,"
22175,Jean-Paul,115, Ok.
22176,Elaine,115," (to Jerry) All right. We'll see you at the race, ok?"
22177,Jerry,115, Yeah. I hope so ?!
22178,Elaine,115, Oh that's cute! (closes door and exits with Jean-Paul)
22179,Jerry,115," Kramer, I'm tellin' you, Elaine doesn't know whatta hell 
              she's doin'! I gotta take over"
22180,Kramer,115," Jerry, look how tense you are... You need to take a soak."
22181,Jerry,115," I'm not taking a soak in that human bacteria frat you got 
              goin' there."
22182,Kramer,115," Come on, I'm tellin' you, it's great. I opened up all the 
              windows... the air is cold, the"
22183,Kramer,115," (relaxing) ...oooohhh yeeaaah... aaahhh... (he is really 
              enjoying this) "
22184,George,115," (smiling) Well, we're certainly glad that you could make 
              it."
22185,Gardner,115," I like your organization, George. We've been talkin' to 
              a really friendly son of a bitch"
22186,George,115," Oh yes, Mr.Wilhelm, yeah..."
22187,Gardner,115," He told us that George Costanza was gonna be takin' us 
              bastards out on the town."
22188,(the 3 men laugh again) I said,115," ""that son of a bitch doesn't 
              know what he's got in store"
22189,Zeke,115, Finish your drink?
22190,George,115," Oh yeah, al-almost. Almost."
22191,Zeke,115," Let's get that bastard bring us another round! (waves to 
              bartender)"
22192,Clayton,115," You a big drinker, George?"
22193,George,115," Well...maybe not as much as this bastard... (points at 
              Zeke, they all laugh) I can"
22194,Jerry,115," Jean-Paul, I asked you down here this morning because I'm 
              concerned. Concerned that"
22195,Jean-Paul,115, What are you saying?
22196,Jerry,115," I'm saying ""get the hell outta there""! Let me 
              put you in a hotel. You'll be comfortable, "
22197,Jean-Paul,115, Wake-up call...
22198,Jerry,115," These people never fail. They sit in a room with a big clock 
              all night long, just waitin'"
22199,Jean-Paul,115," No, I will stay with Elaine. It would be rude."
22200,George,115," Hey, you bastards."
22201,Jerry,115," Hey, how was the meeting?"
22202,George,115, I really like those sons of bitches.
22203,Jerry,115, Sons of bitches?
22204,George,115," Yeah! That's how they talk. You know, everyone's either 
              a bastard or a son of a bitch."
22205,Jean-Paul,115, Really?!
22206,George,115," Yeah, yeah. That's how they talk in the major league. (laughs)"
22207,Kramer,115, Heeeeey...
22208,Jerry,115, How many sweaters you got on?
22209,Kramer,115," Oh...four. (to waitress) Yeah, could I have a cup o'tea? 
              Boiling hot."
22210,George,115, What's goin'on?
22211,Kramer,115," I fell asleep in the hot tub and the heat pump broke. Water 
              went down to 58 degrees."
22212,Jerry,115, Your core temperature?
22213,Kramer,115," (to Jean-Paul) Here, feel my hand. (takes off glove) Yeah, 
              feel."
22214,Jean-Paul,115, Phew... this son of a bitch is ice-cold. (smiles)
22215,George,115, Hello?
22216,Clayton,115," uh...is that you, George? "
22217,George,115," (laughs) Yeah, it's me. Is this Clayton?"
22218,Clayton,115," Well listen, you son of a bitch! You know where we are? 
              30 000 feet above your head, you"
22219,George,115," What are they doin' lettin' you bastards on an airplane? 
              Don't they know that's against"
22220,Clayton,115," (to the other 2 men) Hey, hush up, now! I can't hear him!"
22221,George,115," Listen. I want you guys to send along those agreements 
              the minute you land. Our boys"
22222,Zeke,115, (to Clayton) When's that bastard comin' to Houston?
22223,Clayton,115," Hey, Zeke wants to know when you Yankee bastards are comin' 
              to Houston!"
22224,George,115," You tell that son of a bitch no Yankee is ever comin' to 
              Houston. Not as long as you "
22225,Clayton,115," Hey, uh, speak up, George, I can't hear ya!"
22226,George,115," (Mr.Wilhelm comes in and hears George yelling) You tell 
              that son of a bitch no Yankee is"
22227,Wilhelm,115," George! George, get a hold of yourself!"
22228,George,115, Mr.Wilhelm...
22229,Wilhelm,115, What's the matter with you?! 
22230,George,115, Well I-I...
22231,Elaine,115," (thinking and typing) It was a cold winter's night in Timbuktu... 
            "
22232,Jean-Paul,115, Hello.
22233,Judy,115, Hello.
22234,Jean-Paul,115, I'm a friend of Elaine's.
22235,Judy,115," Oh, hi."
22236,Jean-Paul,115," (looks at the baby) oooooh...look at the cute little 
              bastard... (the building manager"
22237,Manager,115, Whatta hell are you doin' harassing my tenants?
22238,Jean-Paul,115," (smiling) Oh come on, you son of a bitch. I'm just trying 
              to be friendly."
22239,Manager,115," All right, that's it! (grabs Jean-Paul and gets him out) 
              Let's go!"
22240,Jean-Paul,115, What...but I got a race tomorrow!
22241,George,115, Whoa...it's like a furnace in here!
22242,Jerry,115, Oh whatta hell is goin'on?!
22243,Kramer,115," Yeah, I turned up the heat."
22244,Jerry,115, Turn up the heat in your apartment! (opens a window)
22245,Kramer,115," I'm freezin'! I just need to get my hot tub running. I'm 
              waiting for my new heat pump. "
22246,George,115, Well what's in this giant box out in the hall?
22247,Kramer,115, Uh? Oh that must be it.
22248,George,115, It's huge!
22249,Kramer,115," Yeah, yeah, I got the biggest one they had. It's industrial 
              strength. 16000 BTU's."
22250,Jerry,115," Hello?...yeah, I can be there in 10 minutes...you can count 
              on me! (hangs up)"
22251,George,115, (Jerry is going to his bedroom) What?
22252,Jerry,115, I got the call...!
22253,George,115, Jean-Paul?
22254,Jerry,115, (stops walking) Jean-Paul! (George acts like he scored)
22255,Jerry,115," Pretty lucky to find this hotel, Jean-Paul. "
22256,Jean-Paul,115," Man, I just want to get some sleep. (gets into bed)"
22257,Jean-Paul,115," Man, whatever! (annoyed)"
22258,Jerry,115, How about adult contemporary?
22259,Jean-Paul,115," Fine, adult contemporary. Just pick one! (irritated)"
22260,Jerry,115," All right...we're going with adult contempo... (puts alarm 
              away, gets phone) now..."
22261,Jean-Paul,115," Yes, yes, the wake-up guy."
22262,Man,115, (on the phone) Front desk...?
22263,Man,115, Yes sir.
22264,Man,115," Yes, I got it sir. You only had to say it once."
22265,Jerry,115," I know, but it's a very important wake-up call... and I 
              don't wanna take any chances."
22266,Man,115," Every wake-up call I make is important. You're no more important 
              than any of our guests."
22267,Jerry,115," Well, I just...don't wanna get into a whole thing with you 
              here..."
22268,Man,115, Are you through? (annoyed)
22269,Jerry,115," ...Yeah I am, but I just...(man hangs-up)"
22270,Jerry,115, humm...
22271,Jean-Paul,115, What is it...?
22272,Jerry,115, I think I offended the wake-up guy...! (worried)
22273,Jean-Paul,115," No, no."
22274,Jerry,115," (gets up) No, no, I did. I think he's got it in for me!"
22275,Jean-Paul,115," Man, he doesn't got ""in"" for you."
22276,Jerry,115, What if he doesn't call now out of spite?
22277,Jean-Paul,115, It is his job!
22278,Jerry,115, (pause) Not comfortable... (gets up again)
22279,Jean-Paul,115, For God's sake...! (gets up and they start packing)
22280,Elaine,115," Jean-Paul? (searching everywhere) Hey Jean-Paul? Jean-Paul? 
              (worried) Jean-Paul?!"
22281,Jerry's Machine,115," I'm not here, leave a message."
22282,Elaine,115," Jerry, Jerry, Jean-Paul's missing! He's alone in the city! 
              Call me back. (hangs up)"
22283,Elaine,115," Judy, hi, listen..."
22284,Judy,115," You have got some nerve, Elaine! I told you about that baby 
              in confidence!"
22285,Elaine,115, Oh I didn't tell anyone.
22286,Judy,115," Well your friend certainly seemed to know all about it. (shuts 
              the door)"
22287,Elaine,115, ... Jerry! (runs angry to her apartment)
22288,Jerry,115," Feel much better here at my home base, Jean-Paul. It's a 
              controlled environment."
22289,Jean-Paul,115," It's a marathon, you know. 26 miles! I need to get some 
              sleep! (lies on the sofa)"
22290,Jerry,115," Hey, believe me, if I'd been with you there in Barcelona...you'd 
              be polishing that medal"
22291,Jean-Paul,115, Left a comfortable hotel bedroom for this!
22292,Jerry,115," That wake-up guy was trouble! All right, I'll be right back. 
              (goes knocking on Kramer's)"
22293,Jerry,115, (shouting) Man that thing is noisy!
22294,Kramer,115," (shouting) Yeah yeah, we're cracking along pretty good! 
              We're almost up to 80 degrees!"
22295,Kramer,115," Yeah, ok. Wait. (concentrates and makes the ""pop!"" 
              sound) Done! (Jerry stares, confused)"
22296,Jerry,115, He's put his faith in you. He's put his faith in you.
22297,Jean-Paul,115," I trust Elaine, she is my friend. I trust Elaine, she 
              is my friend."
22298,Jerry,115," Frankly, I'm a little concerned."
22299,Elaine,115," Ohhh, I'm exhausted. I've been on this street a thousand 
              times! It's never looked so"

              which stopped at 4",115,02)
22303,We gotta go! It's 8,115,47!
22304,Jerry,115," Come on, just put your clothes on! You'll get dressed in 
              the car!"
22305,Jean-Paul,115, Idiot! I trusted you!
22306,Jerry,115," Kramer, what happened to the building?! The electricity 
              went out!"
22307,Kramer,115," Yeah, the heat pump blew all the fuses! "
22308,Jerry,115, What happened to your mental alarm?!
22309,Kramer,115," I guess I hit the snooze... (Jerry runs by Kramer and Kramer 
              falls down)"
22310,Jerry,115," Make way! I've got-I've got a runner here! Get outta the 
              way! Make way! Make way!"
22311,Guard,115," Hey, hold it!"
22312,Jean-Paul,115," I'm late, man, I'm in the race!"
22313,Guard,115, Go ahead.
22314,Jean-Paul,115," Thank you Jerry, you're a wonderful driver. Fantastic 
              route, man!"
22315,Jerry,115," All right, go, it's a race! Come on!"
22316,George,115," You wanted to see me, Mr.Steinbrenner?"
22317,Steinbrenner,115," Yes, George, come in, come in. George, word up's 
              you've been cracking under the "
22318,George,115," Oh no, Mr.Steinbrenner, I can explain..."
22319,Steinbrenner,115," Oh we all get a little cuckoo sometimes George, I 
              used to be like you. Rating"
22320,"I've got two words to say to you, George",115," hot tub. (George looks 
              at him, puzzled) "
22321,Jerry,115," I'm tellin'you, I never told anyone about that baby. I never 
              even went near your building! "
22322,Elaine,115," Then how did she find out, Jerry?!"
22323,Jerry,115, Maybe you should check with the rabbi.
22324,Kramer,115, (to Elaine) You want some hot tea?
22325,Elaine,115," Oh no, thank you."
22326,Kramer,115, Oh. There's some runners. Here they come!
22327,Elaine,115," There's Jean-Paul! He's up front! He's leading! (jumping) 
              Go Jean-Paul!(starts screaming)"
22328,Kramer,115, Oh yeah! Yeah! Come on! (starts howling)
22329,Jerry,115," Come on, let's go Jean-Paul!"
22330,Elaine,115, Go Jean-Paaaaaul!
22331,Steinbrenner,115," How're you enjoying it, George? Melts that tension 
              away, doesn't it? You gotta get"
22332,George,115," (bored to death) Well, I-I just recently uh..."
22333,Steinbrenner,115," I'll tell you, if you wanna get something wild goin'on 
              in your life, you get a girl"
22334,GEORGE,116," All right. So, what theatre you wanna go to tonight? We 
              got 61st "
22335,JERRY,116, Which one you wanna go to shmoopy?
22336,SHEILA,116, You called me shmoppy. You're a shmoopy.

22338,SHEILA,116, You're a shmoopy!
22339,JERRY,116, You're a shmoopy! 
22340,GEORGE,116," All right, shmoopies...what's it gonna be? Pick a theater."
22341,JERRY,116," Uh,..we'll go to 3rd Avenue. So, can you come with us for 
              lunch to"

              for the"
22343,GEORGE,116, Hey.
22344,ELAINE,116, Hey. 
22345,SHEILA,116, Hi Elaine.
22346,ELAINE,116, Hi Sheila.
22347,JERRY,116," All right, then. I'll see you later."
22348,SHEILA,116, Bye shmoopy.
22349,JERRY,116, Bye shmoopy.
22350,ELAINE,116, Okay. We ready to go?
22351,GEORGE,116," Yes. Please. Please, let's go."
22352,ELAINE,116," Boy, I'm in the mood for a cheeseburger."
22353,JERRY,116, No. We gotta go to the soup place. 
22354,ELAINE,116, What soup place?
22355,GEORGE,116," Oh, there's a soup stand, Kramer's been going there."
22356,JERRY,116," He's always raving. I finally got a chance to go there the 
              other"
22357,ELAINE,116, Stunned by soup?
22358,JERRY,116," You can't eat this soup standing up, your knees buckle."
22359,ELAINE,116, Huh. All right. Come on.
22360,JERRY,116," There's only one caveat -- the guy who runs the place is 
              a little"
22361,ELAINE,116, Why? What happens if you don't order right?
22362,JERRY,116, He yells and you don't get your soup.
22363,ELAINE,116, What?
22364,JERRY,116, Just follow the ordering procedure and you will be fine.
22365,GEORGE,116," All right. All right. Let's - let's go over that again. 
            "
22366,JERRY,116," All right. As you walk in the place move immediately to 
              your right. "
22367,ELAINE,116, What?
22368,JERRY,116, The main thing is to keep the line moving.
22369,GEORGE,116," All right. So, you hold out your money, speak your soup 
              in a loud,"
22370,JERRY,116," Right. It's very important not to embellish on your order. 
              No"
22371,ELAINE,116," Oh, boy, I'm really scared!"
22372,JERRY,116, Elaine.
22373,ELAINE,116," All right. Jerry, that's enough now about the Soup Nazi. 
              Whoa! Wow!"
22374,JERRY,116, Ar-moire.
22375,ELAINE,116, How much is this?
22376,FURNITURE GUY,116," I was asking 250, but you got a nice face. 2 even."
22377,ELAINE,116," Huh? Ha. 200. You know, I've always wanted one of these 
              things. "
22378,JERRY,116, He gave you the nice face discount.
22379,ELAINE,116, Yeah. All right. You guys go ahead.
22380,JERRY,116, What about the soup?
22381,ELAINE,116," I'm getting an armoire, Jerry. "
22382,JERRY,116, [in French accent] Pardon.
22383,GEORGE,116, This line is huge.
22384,JERRY,116, It's like this all the time.
22385,GEORGE,116, Isn't that that Bania guy?
22386,JERRY,116," Oh, no. It is. Just be still."
22387,GEORGE,116, Whoop! Too late. I think he picked up the scent.
22388,BANIA,116," Hey, Jerry! I didn't know you liked soup."
22389,JERRY,116, Hard to believe.
22390,BANIA,116," This guy makes the best soup in the city, Jerry. The best. 
              You know"
22391,JERRY,116," Shhhhh! All right, Bania, I - I'm not letting you cut in 
              line."
22392,BANIA,116, Why not?
22393,JERRY,116," Because if he catches us, we'll never be able to get soup 
              again."
22394,BANIA,116, Okay. Okay.
22395,GEORGE,116, Medium turkey chili. 
22396,JERRY,116, Medium crab bisque. 
22397,GEORGE,116, I didn't get any bread.
22398,JERRY,116, Just forget it. Let it go.
22399,GEORGE,116," Um, excuse me, I - I think you forgot my bread."
22400,SOUP NAZI,116, Bread -- $2 extra.
22401,GEORGE,116, $2? But everyone in front of me got free bread.
22402,SOUP NAZI,116, You want bread? 
22403,GEORGE,116," Yes, please."
22404,SOUP NAZI,116, $3!
22405,GEORGE,116, What?
22406,SOUP NAZI,116, No soup for you! [snaps fingers]
22407,ELAINE,116, What do you mean I can't bring in here? I live here.
22408,SUPER,116," Its Sunday, Elaine. There's no moving on Sunday. That's 
              the rule."
22409,ELAINE,116," But I didn't know, Tom. I g -- can't you just make an exception?"
22410,SUPER,116," Tomorrow, okay? You can move it in tommorrow. I'll even 
              give you a"
22411,ELAINE,116," Ohh! Well, you're just gonna have to hold this for me. 
            "
22412,FURNITURE GUY,116, I'm a guy on the sidewalk. I don't have layaway.
22413,ELAINE,116," Oh, no...please don't go. Please - please don't walk away."
22414,JERRY,116," Oh, man. Ohh! This is fantastic. How does he do it?"
22415,GEORGE,116," You know, I don't see how you can sit there eating that 
              and not"
22416,JERRY,116, I gave you a taste. What do you want?
22417,GEORGE,116, Why can't we share?
22418,JERRY,116," I told you not to say anything. You can't go in there, brazenly"
22419,GEORGE,116, Do you hear yourself?
22420,JERRY,116, I'm sorry. This is what comes from living under a Nazi regime.
22421,GEORGE,116," Well, I gotta go back there and try again. Hi Sheila."
22422,SHEILA,116, Hi. Hi shmoopy.
22423,JERRY,116, Hi shmoopy.
22424,SHEILA,116," No, you're a shmoopy!"
22425,JERRY,116, You're a shmoopy!
22426,GEORGE,116, I'm going.
22427,JERRY,116," Hey, listen, so we'll meet you and Susan at the movie tonight?"
22428,GEORGE,116," You know what? I changed my mind. I, uh, I don't think 
              so."
22429,JERRY,116, Why?
22430,GEORGE,116, I just don't feel like it anymore.
22431,JERRY,116, Just like that?
22432,GEORGE,116, Just like that.
22433,SHEILA,116," Boy, he's a weird guy, isn't he?"
22434,KRAMER,116, Hey.
22435,JERRY,116, Hey.
22436,KRAMER,116, [taking Jerry's couch cushion] Yeah.
22437,JERRY,116, Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey. Wha -- what are you doing?
22438,KRAMER,116," Yeah. Elaine, she has to leave her armoire on the street 
              all"
22439,JERRY,116," Well, sit on one of your couch cushions."
22440,KRAMER,116," Yeah, but this is so nice and thick. Ahoy there!"
22441,ELAINE,116," Oh, Kramer! Thank God. I really appreciate you doing this."
22442,KRAMER,116," Yeah. Well, you ask for it, you got it."
22443,ELAINE,116, Do you need anything?
22444,KRAMER,116," Well, a bowl of muligatawny would hit the spot."
22445,ELAINE,116, Mulligatawny?
22446,KRAMER,116," Yeah. It's an Indian soup. It's simmered to perfection 
              by one of"
22447,ELAINE,116, Oh! Who? The Soup Nazi?
22448,KRAMER,116," He's not a Nazi. He just happens to be a little eccentric. 
              Most"
22449,ELAINE,116, All right. I'll be back.
22450,KRAMER,116, Wait a second. You don't even know how to order.
22451,ELAINE,116," Oh, no. No. No. No. I got it."
22452,KRAMER,116," No. No, Elaine!"
22453,ELAINE,116," Hey, I got it. Hey. Didn't you already get soup?"
22454,GEORGE,116, No. I didn't get it.
22455,ELAINE,116, Why? What happened?
22456,GEORGE,116, I made a mistake.
22457,ELAINE,116, [laughing]
22458,GEORGE,116," All right. Well, we'll see what happens to you."
22459,ELAINE,116," Yeah. No. Listen, George, I am quite certain I'm walking 
              out of"
22460,GEORGE,116," Yeah. Hey, let ask you something. Is it just me, or - or 
              do you"
22461,ELAINE,116," Oh, I know! It is awful!"
22462,GEORGE,116, Why do they have to do that in front of people?
22463,ELAINE,116, I don't know.
22464,GEORGE,116, What is that with the shmoopy? 
22465,ELAINE,116, Ohh!
22466,GEORGE,116," The shmoopy, shmoopy, shmoopy, shmmopy, shmoopy!"
22467,ELAINE,116, Ohh! Stop it! I know.
22468,GEORGE,116," I had to listen to a five minute discussion on which one 
              is"
22469,ELAINE,116, Ugh!
22470,GEORGE,116, And I cancelled plans to go to the movies with them tonight.
22471,ELAINE,116," You know, we should say something."
22472,GEORGE,116," You know, we absolutely should."
22473,ELAINE,116," I mean, why does he do that? Doesn't he know what a huge 
              turnoff"
22474,GEORGE,116, I don't know. He can be so weird sometimes. 
22475,ELAINE,116, Yeah.
22476,GEORGE,116, I still haven't figured him out.
22477,ELAINE,116, No. Me neither.
22478,GEORGE,116, All right. Shh! I gotta focus. I'm shifting into soup mode.
22479,ELAINE,116," Oh, God!"
22480,GEORGE,116, Good afternoon. One large crab bisque to go. Bread. Beautiful.
22481,SOUP NAZI,116, You're pushing your luck little man.
22482,GEORGE,116, Sorry. Thank you.
22483,ELAINE,116," Hi there. Um, uh -- [drumming on countertop] Oh! Oh! Oh! 
              One"
22484,SOUP NAZI,116, Yes.
22485,ELAINE,116," Never been a big fan. [coughing] Um..you know what? Has 
              anyone ever"
22486,SOUP NAZI,116, Very good. Very good.
22487,ELAINE,116," Well, I --"
22488,SOUP NAZI,116, You know something? 
22489,ELAINE,116, Hmmm?
22490,SOUP NAZI,116, No soup for you! 
22491,ELAINE,116, What?
22492,SOUP NAZI,116, Come back one year! Next!
22493,RAY,116, Look at this. 
22494,BOB,116, It's an antique.
22495,RAY,116, It's all hand made and I love the in-lay.
22496,BOB,116," Yes. Yes. me, too. Ay, it's gorgeous. Completely. Pick it 
              up. No. No."
22497,KRAMER,116, Wait. Wait. Wait. Wait. What are you doing?
22498,BOB,116, What does it look like we're doing? We're taking this.
22499,KRAMER,116, You can't take this. This belongs to a friend of mine.
22500,BOB,116," Look, you wanna get hurt? "
22501,KRAMER,116, Huh?
22502,BOB,116," I don't think you wanna get hurt. Because if you wanna get 
              hurt I can"
22503,RAY,116, Bob.
22504,BOB,116, Just pick it up.
22505,KRAMER,116," What is this, huh?"
22506,BOB,116, You have some kind of problem here? What is it you not understanding?
22507,ELAINE,116," I mean, is he allowed to do this? It's discrimination! 
              I'm gonna"
22508,GEORGE,116," Oh, this is fabulous. My God Elaine, you have to taste 
              this."
22509,ELAINE,116," All right. All right. Give me a tsate. Mmm! Oh God, I gotta 
              sit"
22510,KRAMER,116," Well, b -- it was stolen."
22511,ELAINE,116, Wha--?
22512,KRAMER,116," These street toughs, they robbed me."
22513,ELAINE,116, Street toughs took my armoire?
22514,KRAMER,116," Yeah. It was very frightening. My life was in danger. You 
              should've"
22515,ELAINE,116, I can't believe this!
22516,KRAMER,116," Well, where's the soup?"
22517,ELAINE,116, Wha -- the Soup Nazi threw me out.
22518,KRAMER,116, Oh...yeah!
22519,JERRY,116, What are you gonna get?
22520,SHEILA,116, I'll decide at the last minute.
22521,JERRY,116," You better decide, sister. You're on deck. Sheila!"
22522,JERRY,116, Uh-oh.
22523,SOUP NAZI,116," Hey, what is this? You're kissing in my line? Nobody 
              kisses in"
22524,SHEILA,116, I can kiss anywhere I want to.
22525,SOUP NAZI,116, You just cost yourself a soup!
22526,SHEILA,116," How dare you? Come on, Jerry, we're leaving. Jerry?"
22527,JERRY,116, Do I know you?
22528,ELAINE,116," So, essentially, you chose soup over a woman?"
22529,JERRY,116, It was a bisque.
22530,ELAINE,116," Yeah. You know what I just realized? Suddenly, George has 
              become"
22531,JERRY,116, Really?
22532,ELAINE,116," Yeah. Come on. I mean, think about it. He's engaged to 
              be married."
22533,JERRY,116, Have you tastes the soup?
22534,ELAINE,116, Yeah. All right. You made the right decision. 
22535,JERRY,116," See, the way I figure it, it's much easier to patch things 
              up with"
22536,JERRY,116, Hey.
22537,KRAMER,116, Yeah. 
22538,ELAINE,116, Hey.
22539,KRAMER,116, Yeah.
22540,JERRY,116," Oh, thanks."
22541,ELAINE,116, There he is. 
22542,KRAMER,116," Elaine, I'm really sorry about the armoire."
22543,ELAINE,116," Yeah. I know. Me, too."
22544,JERRY,116," So, did these thieves want any money?"
22545,KRAMER,116, No.
22546,JERRY,116, They just wanted the armoire?
22547,KRAMER,116, Yeah. They were..quite taken with it.
22548,JERRY,116, Yeah?
22549,GEORGE,116, Hup! Hup!
22550,JERRY,116," Hey, have you noticed George is acting a little strange 
              lately?"
22551,ELAINE,116, No. In what way?
22552,JERRY,116," I don't know. A lot of attitude, like he's better than me, 
              or"
22553,ELAINE,116," I don't think George has ever thought he's better than 
              anybody."
22554,GEORGE,116, Hello.
22555,JERRY,116, Hello.
22556,KRAMER,116, Hey.
22557,GEORGE,116, Hello.

22559,GEORGE,116, Were you just talking about me? What's going on? 
22560,JERRY,116, Absolutely not.
22561,GEORGE,116, Something's going on here.
22562,KRAMER,116," All right, [claps hands] I'm gonna go get some soup."
22563,ELAINE,116, One of these days that guy is gonna get his. 
22564,GEORGE,116," So, how was the movie?"
22565,JERRY,116," Aw, we didn't go. Sheila and I are kind of on the outs."
22566,GEORGE,116," Oh, yeah?"
22567,JERRY,116," Yeah. Wha - wha - what are you, happy?"
22568,GEORGE,116, Happy? Why should I be happy?
22569,JERRY,116," I don't know, but you look like you're happy. "
22570,GEORGE,116, Why should I care?
22571,JERRY,116," You can't fool me. Don't insult me, George because I know 
              when"
22572,GEORGE,116," All right. I am happy, and I'll tell ya why -- because 
              the two of"
22573,JERRY,116, Is that so?
22574,GEORGE,116," Yeah. Yeah. With all that kissing and the shmoopy, shmoopy,"
22575,JERRY,116, Disgusting?
22576,GEORGE,116, People who do that should be arrested.
22577,JERRY,116," Well, I guess I have all the more reason to get back with 
              her."
22578,GEORGE,116," Ye - yeah. And we had a pact, you know. "
22579,JERRY,116, What?
22580,GEORGE,116, You shook my hand in that coffee shop.
22581,JERRY,116, You're still with the pact?
22582,GEORGE,116, Mmm-hmm. You reneged.
22583,JERRY,116, All I did was shake your hand.
22584,GEORGE,116, Ah-ha!
22585,KRAMER,116," And then they just ran off with the armoire, just like 
              that."
22586,SOUP NAZI,116, Ohh! This city.
22587,NEWMAN,116," One large jambalaya, please."
22588,SOUP NAZI,116," So, continue."
22589,KRAMER,116," Well, my friend is awful disappointed is all. You know, 
              she's very"
22590,NEWMAN,116, Thank you. [inhaling deeply] Jambalaya!
22591,SOUP NAZI,116," All right, now listen to me. You have been a good friend. 
              I have"
22592,KRAMER,116, How can I possibly thank you?
22593,SOUP NAZI,116, You are the only one who understands me.
22594,KRAMER,116, You suffer for your soup.
22595,SOUP NAZI,116, Yes. That is right.
22596,KRAMER,116," You demand perfection from yourself, from your soup."
22597,SOUP NAZI,116, How can I tolerate any less from my customer?
22598,CUSTOMER,116," Uh, gazpacho, por favor."
22599,SOUP NAZI,116, Por favor?
22600,CUSTOMER,116," Um, I'm part Spanish."
22601,SOUP NAZI,116, Adios muchacho!
22602,KRAMER,116, Git.
22603,JERRY,116, It was stupid of me.
22604,SHEILA,116," Well, it was very insulting."
22605,JERRY,116, No. I know. I - I was really sort of half-kidding.
22606,SHEILA,116," Well, behind every joke there's some truth."
22607,JERRY,116," What about that Bavarian cream pie joke I told you? There's 
              no truth"
22608,SHEILA,116," Well, I guess you're right."
22609,JERRY,116," So, am I forgiven, shmoopy?"
22610,SHEILA,116," Yes, shmoopy."
22611,JERRY,116, Aw!
22612,SUSAN,116," Hey, Jerry!"
22613,JERRY,116," Oh, hi Susan, George. You remember Sheila."
22614,GEORGE,116," Oh, yes. Hello."
22615,SHEILA,116, Hello. Won't you join us?
22616,GEORGE,116," No, thanks."
22617,SUSAN,116, Of course.
22618,GEORGE,116," Yes. Well -- So, uh, sit on the same side at a booth, huh?"
22619,JERRY,116, Yeah. That's right. You got a problem?
22620,GEORGE,116," I, uh, just think it's a little unusual. Two people to 
              sit on one"
22621,JERRY,116," Well, we're changing the rules."
22622,GEORGE,116, Ahh. Good for you.
22623,SUSAN,116," Aw, what are you getting George?"
22624,GEORGE,116," I don't know, honey. What do you want to get? [in babying 
              voice] I"
22625,SUSAN,116," Oh, George, you're so sweet."
22626,GEORGE,116," Well, I could be a little sweetie tweetie weetie weetie."
22627,SUSAN,116, Aww!
22628,JERRY,116," What about you, shmoopy? How 'bout a little tuna? You want 
              a little"
22629,SHEILA,116, Yeah.

22637,ELAINE,116, The K Man did it!
22638,KRAMER,116, Yeah!
22639,ELAINE,116, [laughing] How much did you pay for this thing?
22640,KRAMER,116, How 'bout zero?
22641,ELAINE,116, What?
22642,KRAMER,116, Yeah. 
22643,ELAINE,116, What? Who's was it? Where'd you get it?
22644,KRAMER,116," I'll tell ya where I got it. I got it from the guy you 
              so callously"
22645,ELAINE,116, Get out!
22646,ELAINE,116, The Soup Nazi gave it to you?
22647,KRAMER,116, Yeah.
22648,ELAINE,116, Why?
22649,KRAMER,116," Well, I told him the whole story and he just let me have 
              it. Wha --"

              him. I"
22653,KRAMER,116," Yeah. Well, he's a dear."
22654,GEORGE,116, How much tip do you leave on $8.15?
22655,SUSAN,116," You know sweetie, I just want you to know that I was so 
              proud of you"
22656,GEORGE,116, Huh?
22657,SUSAN,116," [in babying voice] Because you love your little kiki don't 
              you?"
22658,CUSTOMER,116, How is he today?
22659,BANIA,116, I think he's in a good mood.
22660,ELAINE,116," Hi. You know, Kramer gave me the armoire and it is so beautiful."
22661,SOUP NAZI,116," You? If I knew it was for you, I never would have given 
              it to"
22662,JERRY,116, I'm heading over to Elaine's.
22663,KRAMER,116," Oh. Jerry, those are the guys that mugged me for the armoire."

22667,KRAMER,116, Yeah. That's them.

              that one."
22674,RAY,116," Oh, not in blue. Blue does not go with all."
22675,BOB,116," Oh, please. Do you know what you're talking about? Because 
              I don't"
22676,KRAMER,116, Excuse me.

22678,KRAMER,116," Uh, well, uh, we --"
22679,RAY,116," I said, are you talking to me?"

22689,JERRY,116," Elaine, I don't want you causing any trouble down at that 
              soup"
22690,ELAINE,116," Get out of my way, Jerry."
22691,JERRY,116," Elaine, let the man make his soup!"
22692,ELAINE,116," Don't make me hurt you, Jerry."

22699,JERRY,116," Oh, really?"
22700,SUSAN,116, Mmm-hmm.
22701,JERRY,116, Because we're kind of not seeing each other anymore.
22702,SUSAN,116," Oh, no! That's too bad."
22703,JERRY,116," Yeah. Well, she was very affectionate - which I love. You 
              know I"

              chopped Porcine"
22716,SOUP NAZI,116, That is my recipe for wild mushroom.

22786,Jerry,117," What is 
              that?"
22787,Jerry,117," Yeah, those 
              civil servants who risk their lives really got it made."

              was a kid, all I ever dreamed of was steering the back of that"

              is my code so important?"

              it's part of our relationship, it's an indication of trust. "

              sure you have secrets from me. I don't know anything about"

22821,Jerry (to himself),117," 
              My foot's asleep again!"
22822,Leapin' Larry,117," 
              When I lost my leg in the boating accident, I got so depressed"
22823,Jerry,117," You know 
              what? I'll be with you in a minute."
22824,Employee,117," That 
              is a great impression!"
22825,Jerry,117," Larry, 
              wait, you don't understand!"
22826,Kramer,117," I just 
              came from Leapin' Larry's. Making fun of crippled people, is"
22827,Jerry,117," I didn't 
              do it on purpose, my foot fell asleep."
22828,Kramer,117," Oh, oh 
              your foot fell asleep."
22829,Jerry,117," Ya know, 
              the guy has one leg and he still calls himself Leapin' Larry,"
22830,Kramer,117," Well, 
              you just joked yourself right out of that commercial, didn't you,"
22831,Jerry,117, Yup.
22832,Voice,117, Hup.
22833,Kramer,117," Boy, look 
              at that. Se that's that fire I was listening to yesterday."
22834,Jerry,117," Wow, the 
              whole building burned down."
22835,Kramer,117," They just 
              don't know what street to take. You remember that time I got"
22836,Jerry,117, Of course.
22837,Kramer,117," It's all 
              up here, Jerry. All up here. It's innate."
22838,Jerry,117," The amazing 
              thing is you never have any place to go."
22839,George,117," Where 
              we gonna eat?"
22840,Jerry,117," We're gonna 
              meet Elaine and Peterman at the Chinese place."
22841,George,117," Peterman? 
              Nobody mentioned anything about Peterman."
22842,Jerry,117," Of course 
              not, if I did would you have gone?"
22843,George,117, No way.
22844,Jerry,117," There you 
              go."
22845,George,117," I don't 
              even know Peterman. How the hell am I gonna relax? I'm gonna"
22846,Jerry,117," Trust me, 
              you're off."
22847,Elaine,117," Oh, hi 
              Fred."
22848,Fred,117," Um, hello?"
22849,Elaine,117, It's Elaine.
22850,Fred,117," Oh yeah,

22851,Elaine,117," How ya 
              doin'?"
22852,Fred,117," I'm depressed. 
              I got this new shirt, the button fell off. Once the"
22853,Elaine,117," Yeah, 
              that's too bad."
22854,Fred,117," Yeah, I'm 
              gonna get some vitamins, I feel depleted."
22855,Elaine,117," Hmm. I 
              never take them."
22856,Fred,117," Cause they 
              make you nauseous, right?"
22857,Elaine,117," Yeah! 
              Yeah, that's right, you remembered!"
22858,Fred,117," Do you wanna 
              have dinner tonight?"
22859,Elaine,117, Hmm. Tonight.
22860,Fred,117," What, you 
              have other plans?"
22861,Elaine,117," No, no 
              no no, none that I can, um, remember."
22862,Jerry,117," ...Alright, 
              you're locked up in a prison in Turkey, I have your wallet. "
22863,George,117," Call the 
              Embassy."
22864,Jerry,117," They're 
              closed."
22865,George,117, Why?
22866,Jerry,117, Bomb threat.
22867,George,117," We're 
              in Turkey?"
22868,Jerry,117," Midnight 
              Express, my friend."
22869,George,117," My card 
              won't work there; they're not on the Plus system."
22870,Peterman,117," You 
              must be Jerry Seinfeld."
22871,Jerry,117," Yes, hi, 
              Mr. Peterman. This is, uh, George Costanza."
22872,Peterman,117, J. Peterman.

              lapels)",117, J. Crew.
22874,Jerry,117," Well, is 
              Elaine here?"
22875,Peterman,117," Oh, 
              Elaine just called, she won't be joining us. Not to worry, I'll"
22876,George,117," What's 
              going on? He still wants to have dinner with us?"
22877,Jerry,117," Without 
              Elaine? What for?"
22878,George,117," What, 
              is he crazy?"
22879,Jerry,117," We gotta 
              get out of here. Come on; weave your web, liar man."
22880,George,117," I've got 
              nothing, I-I-I-I'm blank."
22881,Jerry,117," George, 
              what's the matter with you?"
22882,George,117, I'm choking!
22883,Peterman,117," Ah, 
              Fong has been most accommodating. Shall we?"
22884,Jerry,117," Actually, 
              you know I just remembered I promised this comedy club that"
22885,Peterman,117," I understand, 
              no hard feelings. George and I will miss your company. "
22886,Elaine (to herself),117," 
              I can't believe this, is this guy standing me up?"
22887,Peterman,117," ...And 
              there, tucked into the river's bend was the object of my"
22888,George,117," Howbout 
              sports? Do you follow sports?"
22889,TV announcer,117," 
              It's fourth and inches and the Giants are going for it! You"
22890,George,117," You know, 
              this is very nice, but I really could take a cab. Really."
22891,Peterman,117," Ha ha, 
              nonsense, George. Besides it gives me a chance to tell you"
22892,Peterman,117," Peterman 
              here. What? Oh no. Alright, I'll be right there. (To"
22893,Jerry,117," I can't 
              believe you blew us off; we were doing you the favor."
22894,Elaine,117," Well, 
              Fred asked me out."
22895,Jerry,117, Fred?
22896,Elaine,117," Yeah, 
              and then he stood me up. I don't get this guy."
22897,Jerry,117," You see 
              what's going on here? You're attracted to him because he can't"
22898,Elaine,117," I am? 
              But that's so sick."
22899,Jerry,117," That's 
              God's plan. He doesn't really want anyone to get together."
22900,Elaine,117," Anyway, 
              so how was the dinner?"
22901,Jerry,117," Well, when 
              I heard you weren't coming I made up and excuse and got the"
22902,Elaine,117," What about 
              Georgie?"
22903,Jerry,117," Nah, he 
              didn't make it."
22904,Peterman,117," Doctor, 
              how is she?"
22905,Doctor,117," She's 
              too weak to talk but she'll be happy to hear your voice."
22906,Peterman,117," Mama, 
              it's me. Jacopo. I'm here for you, mama."
22907,George,117," I'm, uh, 
              George Costanza. I was having dinner with your son."
22908,Peterman,117," Shake 
              off the dew, my friend."
22909,George,117," Yeah. 
              What time is it?"
22910,Peterman,117," It's 
              morning. Thanks for seeing me through the night. I'll make us"
22911,George,117, Who?
22912,Peterman,117," Momma. 
              Just talk to her, George. The doctor seems to think it"
22913,George,117," Hi. I-I 
              really should be getting back to my fianc, you know, we, uh,"
22914,Mrs. Peterman,117," 
              Bosco. Bosco."
22915,George,117," Oh, shhh."

22919,George,117," Shut up! 
              Shut up!"
22920,Peterman,117," Momma! 
              What are you trying to say?"
22921,Mrs. Peterman,117," 
              Bosco."
22922,Peterman,117," She's 
              gone. Bosco?"
22923,George,117," You know 
              this whole thing never would have happened if you hadn't"
22924,Jerry,117," I did not 
              bail out on you. "
22925,George,117," Well why 
              couldn't you include me in your excuse?"
22926,Jerry,117," Why didn't 
              you come up with your own?"
22927,George,117," I froze. 
              I think I'm losing it."
22928,Jerry,117," Ah, c'mon. 
              Maybe you're just in a slump?"
22929,George,117," No, no. 
              I reached down and there was *nothing* there."
22930,George,117," Now Peterman 
              wants me to go to the funeral."
22931,Jerry,117," Oh, come 
              on, just tell me your code already. What is it?"
22932,George,117," I am not 
              giving you my code."
22933,Kramer,117," I'll bet 
              I can guess it."
22934,George,117," Pssh. 
              Yeah. Right."
22935,Kramer,117," Oh, alright. 
              Yeah. Uh, let's see. Um, well, we can throw out"
22936,George,117, Huh?
22937,Kramer,117," You're 
              a portly fellow, a bit long in the waistband. So what's your"
22938,George,117," Get out 
              of here."
22939,Kramer,117," Oh you 
              may stray, but you'll always return to your dark master, the"
22940,George,117, I'm leaving.
22941,"Kramer (building 
              up steam as George bolts for the door)",117," No, and only the"
22942,George,117," I gotta 
              go."
22943,Kramer,117," If you 
              could you'd guzzle it by the gallon! Ovaltine! Hershey's!"
22944,George,117, Shut up!
22945,Kramer,117," Nestl's 
              Quik!"
22946,George,117, Shut up!
22947,George,117," What was 
              that?"
22948,Elaine,117, What?
22949,George,117," You just 
              checked your watch. Are you thinking of bailing on him?"
22950,Elaine,117," I got 
              a date."
22951,Elaine,117," Oh, Mr. 
              Peterman."
22952,Peterman,117," Oh, 
              Elaine. George, when momma said 'Bosco' she must have been"
22953,George,117," Mothers 
              say things. My mother goes babbling on and on like a crazy"
22954,Elaine,117," Mr. Peterman, 
              you have my deepest sympathies. Unfortunately, I've"
22955,Peterman,117," You 
              do?"
22956,George,117," Uh, yes, 
              actually we-we both do."
22957,Elaine,117," I have 
              a personal commitment."
22958,George,117," Well, 
              personal, I mean, we both uh..."
22959,Peterman,117," What 
              is it?"
22960,Elaine,117," I'm speaking 
              at a women's' rights conference."
22961,George,117," Yes, and 
              I'm speaking at a men's' conference."
22962,Peterman,117," I don't 
              believe that for a minute. Well, Elaine, it was good of you"
22963,Elaine,117, My pleasure.
22964,Peterman,117," Fortunately, 
              I still have George here to help me through this."
22965,Peterman,117," You 
              know George, growing up as a boy in Costa Rica, I heard a rumor"
22966,Kramer,117," Hey, you 
              wanna come down the fire station with me?"
22967,Jerry,117, Fire station?
22968,Kramer,117," Yeah, 
              I made a map of my shortcuts. I'm gonna rock their world! "
22969,Jerry,117," Nah, I 
              gotta go down to Leapin' Larry's."
22970,Kramer,117," Oh, so 
              he took you back."
22971,Jerry,117," Yeah, we 
              straightened it out, all is forgiven."
22972,Kramer,117," Well, 
              you know the important thing is that you learned something."
22973,Jerry,117, No I didn't.
22974,Captain,117," Well, 
              Mr. Kramer, your list of short cuts is most impressive."
22975,Kramer,117," Yeah, 
              and this is just the Upper West Side. Wait until I get to the"
22976,Captain,117," Mr. Kramer,

              out of this, Kramer."

              ok, cowboy? Where do you need to go?"

              the other night but my mother called, she couldn't find her"

              this?"
22998,Kramer,117, It's Kramer!
22999,Captain,117," Kramer?! 
              What the hell are you doing back there?"
23000,Kramer,117," DeSoto's 
              down, but Cosmo's got the caboose."

              this start?"
23002,Jerry,117, Beats me.

              Try the scanner, see if you can pick up anything."
23008,Captain,117," What 
              are you doing, Kramer?! You're all over the road!"

              me your code!"
23021,George,117," What?! 
              Why?"
23022,Man,117," The machine 
              won't open without the code!"
23023,Peterman,117," George, 
              give him your code!"
23024,George,117, But I-I-I-
23025,Peterman,117," George, 
              there's no time! Tell him your code! Shout out your code,"
23026,Man,117," The code!! 
              The code!!"
23027,Susan,117," Hi. Here's 
              your cash, George. "
23028,George,117, Hm. Thanks.
23029,Susan,117," And here's 
              your card back. Anyone for Bosco?"
23030,Jerry,117," Oh my god. 
              Look at this."
23031,George,117, Hm?
23032,Perry,117," It's the 
              new J. Peterman catalog. Look."
23033,George,117," The Rogue's 
              Wallet. That's where he kept his card, his dirty little"

23036,Jerry's stand-up,119," I have a friend, wears eye glasses, no prescription 
        in the glasses because he thinks it makes him look more intelligent, now 
        why? Why do we think that glasses makes us look more intelligent? Is it 
        from the endless hours of reading and studying and researching that this 
        person supposedly blew out their eyeballs, and that's why they need the 
        glasses? It's just a corrective device. If you see someone with a hearing 
        aid, you don't think, 'Oh, they must have been listening real good...yeah, 
        to a lot of important stuff...' No, they are deaf. They can't hear."
23037,KRAMER,119," Hey, boys and girls. I need you both to sponsor me in the AIDS 
        walk."
23038,ELAINE,119, Is that tomorrow?
23039,KRAMER,119," Yeah, yeah, so...git-git...<gestures to Elaine to sign the 
        form.>"
23040,ELAINE (signing),119," Well, I admire you for joining the fight against AIDS."
23041,KRAMER,119," Well, if I didn't do something I wouldn't be able to live with 
        myself."
23042,JERRY (signing),119, It's hard enough living next door.
23043,KRAMER,119," I tell ya, there's some people, they just wear a ribbon and they 
        think they're doin' something? Not me. I talk the talk, and I walk the 
        walk, baby. <gets up> I'll be right back."
23044,ELAINE,119, New jeans?
23045,JERRY,119, Yeah.
23046,ELAINE,119, Still a 31 waist?
23047,JERRY,119," Yep. Since college. <Looks at Kramer's AIDS walk list.> 
        Hey, Lena Small's on this list."
23048,ELAINE,119, Lena Small?
23049,JERRY,119," Yeah, that girl I was gonna call for a date, she was unlisted...and 
        now here's her number."
23050,ELAINE,119," Oh, you're not gonna cop a girl's phone number off an AIDS charity 
        list!"
23051,JERRY (copying down the number),119," Elaine, you should admire me...I'm aspiring 
        to date a giving person."
23052,ELAINE,119, You're a taking person.
23053,JERRY,119," That's why I should date a giving person. If I date a taking person, 
        everyone's taking, taking, taking, no one's giving - it's bedlam."
23054,ELAINE (warns),119, She's gonna ask how you got her number.
23055,JERRY,119," Oh, I'll tell her I met some guy who knew her and he gave it to 
        me."
23056,ELAINE,119, What's he look like?
23057,JERRY,119," I really didn't pay much attention, I'd just come from buying 
        a speedboat."
23058,ELAINE,119, You're buying a speedboat?
23059,JERRY,119," See, we're already off the subject of how I got her number. <Elaine 
        laughs.> All I gotta do is get past the first phone call and I'm home 
        free."
23060,ELAINE,119, I don't know about that.
23061,JERRY,119," So if Billy had gotten your number off the AIDS walk list, you 
        wouldn't have gone out with him?"
23062,ELAINE,119, Well...
23063,JERRY,119, Yeah. So you really like this guy.
23064,ELAINE,119, Very much.
23065,JERRY,119, How's the...sexual chemistry?
23066,ELAINE,119," Haven't been in the lab yet. But I am birth control shopping 
        today. <Kramer overhears as he returns to the booth.>"
23067,KRAMER,119, Are you still on the pill?
23068,ELAINE,119," Uh, Kramer..."
23069,KRAMER,119," I'll tell ya, I think birth control should be discussed in an 
        open forum. "
23070,ELAINE,119," The sponge, o.k.? The Today sponge."
23071,KRAMER,119, But wasn't that taken off the market?
23072,ELAINE,119," Off the market? The sponge? No, no...no way. Everybody loves 
        the sponge."
23073,KRAMER,119," I read it in Wall Street Week...Louis, uh, Rukeyser."
23074,JERRY,119," Hello, Lena? Hi, it's Jerry Seinfeld. How did I get your number? 
        I met a guy that knows you, he gave it to me...I don't remember his name. 
        Think it began with a W, maybe a Q. I wasn't paying that much attention, 
        I'd just come from shopping for a speedboat..."
23075,SUSAN,119," You know, I really like those new jeans Jerry was wearing. He's 
        really thin."
23076,GEORGE,119, Not as thin as you think.
23077,SUSAN,119, Why? He's a 31. I saw the tag on the back.
23078,GEORGE,119," The tag, huh?"
23079,SUSAN,119, Mmm-hmm.
23080,GEORGE,119," Let me tell you something about that tag. It's no 31, and uh...let's 
        just leave it at that."
23081,SUSAN,119, What are you talking about?
23082,GEORGE,119, He scratches off a 32 and he puts in 31.
23083,SUSAN,119," Oh, how could he be so vain?"
23084,GEORGE,119," Well, this is the Jerry Seinfeld that only I know. I can't believe 
        I just told you that."
23085,SUSAN (laughing),119, Why not?
23086,GEORGE,119," Well, Jerry doesn't want anyone to know."
23087,SUSAN,119," Well, it's alright, I'm your fiance. Everyone assumes you'll tell 
        me everything."
23088,GEORGE,119, Where did you get that from?
23089,SUSAN,119," Well, we're a couple. It's understood."
23090,GEORGE,119, I never heard of that.
23091,SUSAN,119," Well, you've never been a couple."
23092,GEORGE,119, I've coupled! I've coupled! 
23093,SUSAN,119, Keeping secrets! This is just like your secret bank code.
23094,GEORGE,119," This is totally different! That was my secret, this is Jerry's 
        secret! There's...there's attorney-client priveleges here! If I play it 
        by your rule, no one'll ever confide in me again, I'll be cut out of the 
        loop!"
23095,GEORGE,119, Hey.
23096,JERRY,119, Hey. What's the matter?
23097,GEORGE,119, I had a fight with Susan.
23098,JERRY,119, What about?
23099,GEORGE,119," Oh...<is about to tell Jerry, but reconsiders> ...clothing, 
        something, I dunno. So, uh, what are you doing today?"
23100,JERRY,119," I got a date with that girl, Lena."
23101,GEORGE,119," Lena, how'd you meet her?"
23102,JERRY,119," I actually met her a few weeks ago, but... <Jerry stops, and 
        mentally visualizes George telling Susan about how Jerry got Lena's number 
        from the AIDS list...then Susan passing the information along to Monica 
        on the phone at work.>"
23103,GEORGE,119," You met her a few weeks ago, but...?"
23104,JERRY (slowly),119, I didn't call her till today.
23105,GEORGE,119," So, uh...wanna double?"
23106,JERRY,119, What?
23107,GEORGE,119," Well, I just had a fight - I need a group dynamic."
23108,JERRY,119, I dunno. <Elaine enters.> Hey.
23109,ELAINE,119," Well, Kramer was right. My friend Kim told me the sponge is off 
        the market."
23110,JERRY,119, So what are you gonna do?
23111,ELAINE,119," I'll tell you what I'm gonna do - I'm gonna do a hard-target 
        search. Of every drug store, general store, health store and grocery store 
        in a 25-block radius."
23112,GEORGE,119, Just for these sponges?
23113,ELAINE,119," Hey man, women are really loyal to their birth control methods. 
        What does Susan use?"
23114,GEORGE,119, I dunno.
23115,ELAINE,119, You don't know?
23116,GEORGE,119," I, uh...figure it's something. <Kramer enters.>"
23117,JERRY,119, What are you all out of breath from?
23118,KRAMER (panting),119, The elevator just broke. I had to walk up five flights.
23119,JERRY,119," And you got the AIDS walk tomorrow. You're never gonna make it, 
        you're in horrible shape."
23120,KRAMER,119," Hey, I'm in tip-top shape. Better than you!"
23121,JERRY,119," I got a 31 waist, mister!"
23122,KRAMER,119," Yeah, well I'm walking for charity, what are you doing?"
23123,JERRY (proudly),119," What am I doing? I'm...dating a woman who happens to 
        be sponsoring one of these walkers."
23124,PHARMACIST,119, Can I help you?
23125,ELAINE (with little hope),119," Yeah, do you have any Today sponges? I know 
        they're off the market, but..."
23126,PHARMACIST,119," Actually, we have a case left."
23127,ELAINE (excited),119," A case! A case of sponges? I mean, uh...a case. Huh. 
        Uh...how many come in a case?"
23128,PHARMACIST,119, Sixty.
23129,ELAINE,119," Sixty?! Uh...well, I'll take three."
23130,PHARMACIST,119, Three. 
23131,ELAINE,119, Make it ten.
23132,PHARMACIST,119, Ten?
23133,ELAINE,119, Twenty sponges should be plenty.
23134,PHARMACIST,119, Did you say twenty?
23135,ELAINE,119," Yeah, twenty-five sponges is just fine."
23136,PHARMACIST,119," Right. So, you're set with twenty-five."
23137,ELAINE,119, Yeah. Just give me the whole case and I'll be on my way.
23138,JERRY,119," Hey, I have found the best-smelling detergent. Lena, smell my 
        shirt."
23139,LENA (smells Jerry's arm),119, Mmm! Very nice.
23140,JERRY,119, It's All-Tempa-Cheer.
23141,LENA,119, I use Planet. It's bio-degradable and doesn't pollute the oceans.
23142,GEORGE,119," Yeah, the oceans really are getting very sudsy."
23143,LENA (to waiter),119," Can you wrap up all the left-overs on the table, please? 
        I always take the left-overs. I work in a soup kitchen every morning at 
        6 a.m. "
23144,JERRY,119, They serve soup at 6 a.m.? 
23145,LENA,119, Yeah. That's all they have.
23146,JERRY,119," Do the bums ever complain? ""Soup again?"""
23147,GEORGE,119, I'd get tired of it.
23148,JERRY,119, How could you not?
23149,LENA,119, Guess who volunteered last week? 
23150,GEORGE,119, Mick Jagger.
23151,LENA,119, No. Maya Angelou.
23152,SUSAN,119," Oh, the poet!"
23153,JERRY (to Lena),119," So, let me ask you something - these people eat soup 
        three times a day? "
23154,LENA,119, I don't know.
23155,SUSAN (to Lena),119," So, did you get to talk to her?"
23156,LENA,119, Talk to who?
23157,JERRY,119, Is it a lot of cream soups?
23158,SUSAN,119," Maya Angelou, the poet."
23159,LENA,119," No, I didn't get the chance."
23160,GEORGE,119," Oh, well, I'm sure you can reach her...she's a poet. What does 
        a poet need an unlisted number for?"
23161,SUSAN,119, I'm going to the ladies room.
23162,LENA,119, I'll go with you. <They leave.>
23163,GEORGE,119, What are you looking at me like that for?
23164,JERRY,119, Why'd you have to mention 'unlisted number'?
23165,GEORGE,119, What are you talking about?
23166,JERRY,119," Alright, I gotta tell you something, but you cannot tell Susan."
23167,SUSAN,119," Jerry got her phone number off of an AIDS walk list? Oh, that's 
        awful!"
23168,GEORGE,119," I know, but don't say anything to anyone. He told me not to tell 
        you."
23169,SUSAN,119, But you told me anyway?
23170,GEORGE,119," Well, you know, I was thinking about what you said before, and...you're 
        right, I've never really been a couple, so...if that's the rule, then 
        I'm gonna go by the rule."
23171,SUSAN,119," Thank you, honey."
23172,GEORGE,119," So, you wanna go home and...make up, officially?"
23173,SUSAN,119, Can we stop by a drug store first?
23174,GEORGE,119, What for?
23175,SUSAN,119, I'm out of birth control stuff.
23176,GEORGE,119," Oh, o.k., yeah. Where am I gonna park here...? <Pulls over.>"
23177,SUSAN,119," Oh, don't park. I'll just sit in the car, you can run in."
23178,GEORGE,119, Me run in? Why don't you run in?
23179,SUSAN,119," You don't know what I use for birth control, do you?"
23180,GEORGE,119, Of course I do.
23181,SUSAN,119, You do? What?
23182,GEORGE,119," You know. You use the, uh...<mutters something unintelligible 
        under his breath.>"
23183,SUSAN,119, The what?
23184,GEORGE,119," You know, the uh...<mutters it again.>"
23185,SUSAN,119," Just get me some sponges, please."
23186,GEORGE,119," Wait, wait a minute...they don't have them anymore. I just found 
        out, they just took them off the market."
23187,SUSAN,119, Off the market? The sponge?
23188,GEORGE,119," Yeah, so you gotta use something else."
23189,SUSAN,119, I can't! I love the sponge! I need the sponge!
23190,GEORGE,119, O.k....<thinks> I think I know where we can get one.
23191,JERRY,119," Kramer, what the hell is going on in there?"
23192,KRAMER,119," It's a poker game...<yells to the crowd> And I'm kickin' 
        some serious butt!"
23193,JERRY,119, Are you out of your mind? You got the AIDS walk tomorrow!
23194,VOICE FROM POKER GAME,119," Hey, Kramer - are you in?"
23195,KRAMER,119," Oh, you gotta be kiddin'! You see those two ladies I got showin'? 
        Do they look scared?! "
23196,JERRY,119, You're never gonna make it!
23197,BILLY,119," You, uh...you wanna go in the bedroom?"
23198,ELAINE,119," O.k. Hold on just a second. <Gets up and heads to the bathroom. 
        George knocks at the door.>"
23199,GEORGE,119," Elaine? It's me, George. <Elaine opens the door.> Hey, 
        sorry to bother you so late. <To Billy> Hey! How ya doin.' <To 
        Elaine> Uh, did you get any of those sponges?"
23200,ELAINE,119, Yeah. Cleaned out the whole west side. Why?
23201,GEORGE,119, Well...Susan.
23202,ELAINE,119," Ah, Susan uses the sponge."
23203,GEORGE,119, Susan loves the sponge.
23204,ELAINE,119," Yeah, I'm sorry, George. I can't help you out."
23205,GEORGE,119, What?
23206,ELAINE,119," I can't do it. No way, there's no how. <Tries to push George 
        out the door. George resists.>"
23207,GEORGE,119," Elaine...let me just explain something to you. See, this is not 
        just a weekend routine...I'm on the verge of make-up sex here. You know 
        about make-up sex?"
23208,ELAINE,119," Oh yeah, I know all about make-up sex, and I'm really sorry. 
        <Shoves George into the hallway and closes the door. George blocks 
        the door with his foot.>"
23209,GEORGE,119," Elaine, can I just explain something to you very privately here? 
        Susan and I have been together many, many times now, and just between 
        you and me, there's really no big surprises here, so...make-up sex is 
        all that I have left."
23210,ELAINE,119," I'm sure you'll have another fight, George. <Stamps 
        on George's foot and closes the door.> (To Billy) Hold that thought! 
      "
23211,SUSAN,119," So, listen to this. But don't tell anyone - Jerry Seinfeld? He 
        got a woman's number off an AIDS walk list."
23212,MONICA,119, He got her number off an AIDS walk list?
23213,LENA,119, He what?
23214,JERRY,119, How'd you find out?
23215,LENA,119, A friend of a friend of a friend of Susan's.
23216,JERRY,119, George!
23217,LENA,119, Pardon?
23218,JERRY,119," Nothing. Listen, I'm sorry, I just - "
23219,LENA,119, It's o.k.! There's nothing to be sorry about. I don't mind.
23220,JERRY,119, You don't mind that I got your number off the AIDS walk list?
23221,LENA,119," No, not at all. No problem. <Jerry looks at Lena suspiciously. 
        Lena leaves with all of Kramer's poker buddies, who are filing out of 
        Kramer's apartment.>"
23222,KRAMER,119," Ah, you're lucky you're walkin' out of here with a pair of pants 
        on!"
23223,JERRY,119, You went all night?
23224,KRAMER (shows Jerry his winnings),119," Jerry, ah? Breakfast on me, huh?"
23225,JERRY,119," Kramer, are you out of your mind? You got the AIDS walk in like, 
        three hours! You're never gonna make it!"
23226,KRAMER,119, AIDS walk! That's a cake walk. <George enters.> Hey!
23227,JERRY,119," So, George, guess what? Lena found out how I got her number."
23228,GEORGE,119, Really? How'd she do that?
23229,JERRY,119, A friend of a friend of Susan's.
23230,GEORGE,119, My Susan?
23231,JERRY,119, Why'd you tell her?!
23232,GEORGE,119," Because, Jerry, it's a couple rule! We have to tell each other 
        everything!"
23233,JERRY,119," Well you know what this means, don't you? "
23234,GEORGE,119, What?
23235,JERRY,119," You're cut off, you're out of the loop!"
23236,GEORGE,119," You're cutting me off? No, no, no Jerry, don't cut me off!"
23237,JERRY,119, You leave me no choice! You're the media now as far as I'm concerned!
23238,GEORGE,119," C'mon Jerry, please! It won't happen again."
23239,JERRY,119," If you were in the mafia, would you tell her every time you killed 
        someone?"
23240,GEORGE,119," Hey, a ""hit"" is a totally different story."
23241,JERRY,119," I don't know, George."
23242,GEORGE,119," So, Lena was upset, huh?"
23243,JERRY,119, You know what? That was the amazing thing. 
23244,GEORGE,119," What, it didn't bother her?"
23245,JERRY,119," No, she said it was fine. There's something very strange about 
        this girl."
23246,GEORGE,119, What?
23247,JERRY,119, She's too good.
23248,GEORGE,119, Too good...
23249,JERRY,119," I mean, she's giving and caring and genuinely concerned about 
        the welfare of others - I can't be with someone like that!"
23250,GEORGE,119, I see what you mean.
23251,JERRY,119," I mean, I admire the hell out of her. You can't have sex with 
        someone you admire."
23252,GEORGE,119, Where's the depravity?
23253,JERRY,119," No depravity! I mean, I look at her, I can't imagine she even 
        has sex. "
23254,JERRY (using Elaine as an example),119, On the other hand...
23255,ELAINE,119, What?
23256,GEORGE (to Elaine),119, Thanks again for last night!
23257,ELAINE,119," Hey, I didn't even use one. "
23258,JERRY,119, I thought you said it was imminent.
23259,ELAINE,119," Yeah, it was, but then I just couldn't decide if he was really 
        sponge-worthy."
23260,JERRY,119, Sponge-worthy?
23261,ELAINE,119," Yeah, Jerry, I have to conserve these sponges."
23262,JERRY,119," But you like this guy, isn't that what the sponges are for?"
23263,ELAINE,119," Yes, yes - before they went off the market. I mean, now I've 
        got to re-evaluate my whole screening process. I can't afford to waste 
        any of 'em."
23264,GEORGE,119," You know, you're nuts with these sponges. George is gettin' frustrated!"
23265,KRAMER (to organizer at desk),119," Uh, Cosmo Kramer?"
23266,ORGANIZER,119," Uh...o.k., you're checked in. Here's your AIDS ribbon."
23267,KRAMER,119," Uh, no thanks."
23268,ORGANIZER,119, You don't want to wear an AIDS ribbon?
23269,KRAMER,119, No.
23270,ORGANIZER,119, But you have to wear an AIDS ribbon.
23271,KRAMER,119, I have to?
23272,ORGANIZER,119, Yes.
23273,KRAMER,119," See, that's why I don't want to. "
23274,ORGANIZER,119, But everyone wears the ribbon. You must wear the ribbon!
23275,KRAMER,119, You know what you are? You're a ribbon bully. <Walks away.>
23276,ORGANIZER,119, Hey you! Come back here! Come back here and put this on!
23277,GEORGE,119," Elaine and her sponges...she's got like, a war chest full of 
        them."
23278,SUSAN,119," Well, I don't see why you just can't use condoms."
23279,GEORGE,119," Oh, no, no...condoms are for single men. The day that we got 
        engaged, I said goodbye to the condom forever."
23280,SUSAN,119, Just once...for the make-up sex.
23281,GEORGE,119," Make-up sex? You have to have that right after the fight, we're 
        way past that."
23282,SUSAN,119," Come on, just once?"
23283,GEORGE,119," No, no...I hate the condom."
23284,SUSAN,119, Why?
23285,GEORGE,119, I can never get the package open in time.
23286,SUSAN,119," Well, you just tear it open."
23287,GEORGE,119," It's not that easy. It's like ""Beat The Clock,"" there's 
        a lot of pressure there."
23288,WALKER #1,119," Hey, where's your ribbon?"
23289,KRAMER,119," Oh, I don't wear the ribbon."
23290,WALKER #2,119," Oh, you don't wear the ribbon? Aren't you against AIDS?"
23291,KRAMER,119," Yeah, I'm against AIDS. I mean, I'm walking, aren't I? I just 
        don't wear the ribbon."
23292,WALKER #3,119, Who do you think you are?
23293,WALKER #1,119, Put the ribbon on!
23294,WALKER #2,119," Hey, Cedric! Bob! This guy won't wear a ribbon! <Cedric 
        and Bob turn around and glare at Kramer.>"
23295,BOB,119, Who? Who does not want to wear the ribbon? <Kramer is frightened.>
23296,ELAINE,119," So, you think you're sponge-worthy?"
23297,BILLY,119," Yes, I think I'm sponge-worthy. I think I'm very sponge-worthy."
23298,ELAINE,119, Run down your case for me again...?
23299,BILLY,119," Well, we've gone out several times, we obviously have a good rapport. 
        I own a very profitable electronics distributing firm. I eat well. I exercise. 
        Blood tests - immaculate. And if I can speak frankly, I'm actually quite 
        good at it."
23300,ELAINE,119, You going to do something about your sideburns?
23301,BILLY,119," Yeah, I told you...I'm going to trim my sideburns."
23302,ELAINE,119, And the bathroom in your apartment?
23303,BILLY,119, Cleaned it this morning.
23304,ELAINE,119," The sink, the tub, everything got cleaned?"
23305,BILLY,119," Everything, yeah. It's spotless."
23306,ELAINE,119," Alright, let's go. <They head for the bedroom.>"
23307,JERRY,119, Hi.
23308,LENA,119," Hi! Hey, look at this - I just got a citation in the mail for my 
        work with shut-ins."
23309,JERRY,119," Oh, the shut-ins, that's nice. You know, they're a very eccentric 
        group. Because they're shut in. Of course, they're not locked in, they're 
        free to go at anytime."
23310,LENA,119," Oh, by the way, I checked at the soup kitchen - they do have cream 
        soups."
23311,JERRY,119," Hey, that's dynamite. You know, Lena, I wanted to talk to you 
        about something...you know, because you're such a good person - "
23312,LENA,119," Oh, hang onto that thought - I'm rinsing a sweater, I left the 
        water running. <Goes into the bathroom.> Hey, Jerry, can you get 
        me a towel out of my bedroom closet?"
23313,JERRY,119," Oh, o.k. <Goes to the closet for the towel and finds dozens 
        of boxes of Today sponges.> "
23314,JERRY'S brain,119," Oh my god! Look what's goin' on here! She is depraved! 
        <Grabs a towel and brings it to Lena.> There you are."
23315,LENA,119," Thanks. So, you were saying...?"
23316,JERRY,119, What? Nothing.
23317,LENA,119," No, you said I was a good person..."
23318,JERRY,119, Oh...
23319,LENA,119, You seem like you want to tell me something.
23320,JERRY,119, Tell you something...I do.
23321,LENA,119," What is it, Jerry? You can tell me anything."
23322,JERRY,119," Oh, uh...you see these jeans I'm wearing? "
23323,LENA,119, Yeah.
23324,JERRY,119," I change the 32 waist on the label to a 31 on all my jeans. So, 
        you know. That's it. <Lena is puzzled.>"
23325,SUSAN,119," Come on, George, just tear it open."
23326,GEORGE,119," I'm trying, dammit. "
23327,SUSAN,119, Tear it.
23328,GEORGE,119," I tried to tear it from the side, you can't get a good grip here. 
        You gotta do it like a bag of chips."
23329,SUSAN,119, Here give it to me.
23330,GEORGE,119, Would you wait a second? Just wait? <They fight over it.>
23331,SUSAN,119, Give it to me. <She rips it open.> Come on. Come on!
23332,GEORGE (tosses the condom aside),119, It's too late.
23333,BOB,119, So! What's it going to be? Are you going to wear the ribbon?
23334,KRAMER (nervously),119, No! Never.
23335,BOB,119," But I am wearing the ribbon. He is wearing the ribbon. We are all 
        wearing the ribbon! So why aren't you going to wear the ribbon!?"
23336,KRAMER,119," This is America! I don't have to wear anything I don't want to 
        wear!"
23337,CEDRIC,119, What are we gonna do with him?
23338,BOB,119, I guess we are just going to have to teach him to wear the ribbon!
23339,JERRY,119, It completely turned her off.
23340,GEORGE,119," Well, I can see that. What do you have to do that for? Who cares 
        about your pants size?"
23341,JERRY,119, I don't wanna be a 32.
23342,GEORGE,119, I'd kill to be a 32.
23343,JERRY,119, She said I wasn't sponge-worthy. Wouldn't waste a sponge on me!
23344,GEORGE,119," That condom killed me. Why do they have to make the wrappers 
        on those things so hard to open?"
23345,JERRY,119, It's probably so the woman has one last chance to change her mind.
23346,GEORGE,119," You never run out, do you? <Jerry smiles.> Where's Kramer? 
        Everything's finished here."
23347,JERRY,119," Oh, I told him he'd never make it. He was up all night! Oh my 
        god...Kramer?"
23348,JERRY,119," Look at you. I told you. Up all night playing poker. Come on. 
        <Jerry and George are about to leave. George turn's back and looks 
        at Kramer.>"
23349,GEORGE,119," Hey, where's you AIDS ribbon?"
23350,ELAINE (smiling),119, Good morning.
23351,BILLY,119, How'd you sleep?
23352,ELAINE (stretches),119, Great. You?
23353,BILLY,119," Fine, fine. Everything o.k.?"
23354,ELAINE,119, Yep. 
23355,BILLY,119, No regrets?
23356,ELAINE,119, Nope. <Billy leans in to kiss her.> What are you doing?
23357,BILLY,119, What do you mean?
23358,ELAINE,119, Oh...I don't think so.
23359,BILLY,119, Why not? I thought you said everything was fine.
23360,ELAINE,119," I wish I could help you, but I can't afford two of 'em. <Pats 
        Billy on the shoulder and gets out of bed.>"

23497,KRAMER,120," Yeah, put these glasses on."
23498,JERRY,120," (taking them) Well, what's this for?"
23499,KRAMER,120," Yeah, well Lloyd, he's gonna be here any minute now."
23500,JERRY,120, So what?
23501,KRAMER,120," Well, he thinks you wear those."
23502,KRAMER,120, They're from the lost and found at the Alex.
23503,JERRY,120," Aw, c'mon Kramer, this is ridiculous. I'm not gonna put these 
        on."
23504,KRAMER,120," Oh. Okay. So he'll just think that the two of you didn't sit 
        with him on"
23505,GEORGE,120," 'scuse me. I uh, I was in here this morning and uh, I believe 
        I paid you"
23506,CASHIER,120, I don't think so.
23507,GEORGE,120," Oh, I think so, and I can prove it. You see, I was doodling on 
        the bill"
23508,CASHIER,120, Not unless you buy something.
23509,GEORGE,120," Fine, I'll buy a pack of gum."
23510,LLOYD,120, Hey George. Thought you didn't chew gum?
23511,GEORGE,120, I don't.
23512,CASHIER,120, Take a look.
23513,GEORGE,120, I know I gave it to you.
23514,LLOYD,120," George, would you mind. I'm kind of in a hurry."
23515,GEORGE,120," (frustrated) Fine. Fine. (to customer) Excuse me. (heading for 
        the door)"
23516,KRAMER,120," Hey, Jerry, look who's here."
23517,JERRY,120," Ah, Lloyd."
23518,LLOYD,120, Hi Jerry. Got some more of that gum.
23519,JERRY,120," (unenthusiastic) Oh, the gum."
23520,KRAMER,120," Yeah, let's all enjoy a chew, huh?"
23521,JERRY,120," (still not happy) Uh, alright. (he takes a piece)"
23522,KRAMER,120," Oh, boy."
23523,KRAMER,120," Now see, this is what the holidays are all about. Three buddies, 
        sitting"
23524,JERRY,120," Well, Lloyd's a very industrious fellow. I'm sure he can accomplish"
23525,LLOYD,120," Actually, the importer's right in Chinatown. I'll introduce you 
        to him,"
23526,JERRY,120, 's not necessary.

23528,JERRY,120," I know that, Kramer."
23529,LLOYD,120," Well, if you don't want to..."
23530,KRAMER,120," No, sure sure, he wants to. It's very kind of you. Yeah, Jerry, 
        he"
23531,JERRY,120," Yes I do, Kramer."
23532,LLOYD,120, So...
23533,KRAMER,120, Yeah?
23534,LLOYD,120," How about that Elaine today, huh?"
23535,KRAMER,120," Oh, baby, what was that all about, huh?"
23536,LLOYD,120," (to Jerry) She was practically undressing in front of me at the 
        theatre."
23537,JERRY,120, I didn't see anything.
23538,KRAMER,120," Yeah, you uh, really missed a show, buddy. Wooh, ba-boom,"
23539,DEENA,120, You're probably wondering why I wanted to see you again.
23540,GEORGE,120," Well, you know. (grins, snorts) It's understandable."
23541,DEENA,120," I'm glad you feel that way. Because since my father's breakdown 
        I uh,"
23542,GEORGE,120, Warning signs?
23543,DEENA,120," Nervousness, irritability, paranoia."
23544,GEORGE,120," (disbelief) What? (laugh) Wh... what're you talking about? I'm 
        not the"
23545,DEENA,120," Yet again, taking pleasure in the misfortunes of others."
23546,GEORGE,120, All my friends do that.
23547,DEENA,120," George, I'm only trying to help..."
23548,DEENA,120," I'm... I'm concerned. George? George, are you listening to me?"
23549,GEORGE,120, You see that woman on the horse? (points)
23550,GEORGE,120," She stole twenty dollars from me. (getting angry) Yeah, I might've"
23551,DEENA,120, So again it all comes back to Lloyd.
23552,GEORGE,120," (rising to his feet) Hey! Hey, you! (setting off after her) Come 
        back"
23553,JERRY,120, So you say she was on a horse?
23554,GEORGE,120," I'm telling you, that cashier is riding horses on my money."
23555,JERRY,120," Well, here's what I propose. Go down to the stables, snoop around. 
        See if"
23556,ELAINE,120, Hey.

23560,ELAINE,120," (laughing it away) Oh God. I lost a button, so my blouse was 
        wide open."
23561,JERRY,120, Maybe it's in the lost and found.
23562,ELAINE,120," Yeah, I know. I have to go check it out. It's a beautiful button 
        too,"
23563,JERRY,120," You know, the way you were wolfing down that popcorn, maybe you 
        ate it."

        back at"
23566,HAARWOOD,120," Well I, I'm in a bit of a quandary. I've misplaced my spectacles."
23567,KRAMER,120," Well, let's look in lost and found, shall we?"
23568,HAARWOOD,120, They're half-glasses.
23569,KRAMER,120, Brown?
23570,HAARWOOD,120," Mmm, yes, yes."
23571,KRAMER,120," Uh, yeah. Ah, well if they're not in the box, I'm sure they'll 
        turn up"
23572,HAARWOOD,120, Certainly.
23573,HAARWOOD,120, Oh my goodness. What a spanking button.

23584,GEORGE,120, Your hose! Where's your hose?!
23585,FLORIST,120, Cop made me disconnect it.
23586,KRAMER,120," Jeez! What happened to your car, buddy?"
23587,GEORGE,120, The Jon Voight car is no more.
23588,KRAMER,120," Wow. Well, don't you sweat it. You can use my car any time you 
        want to."
23589,GEORGE,120, No kidding?

23597,JERRY,120," Look, I'll go downtown to Chinatown with him, but that is it!"
23598,KRAMER,120," Listen, I'm gonna need those glasses."
23599,JERRY,120, Why?
23600,KRAMER,120, They're Geoffrey Haarwood's.

23607,KRAMER,120," Oh yeah, she called a little earlier. She's coming over to check 
        out"
23608,LLOYD,120," Maybe I'll stick around and see what she's wearing today. Or not 
        wearing,"
23609,JERRY,120, Absolutely. Let's just stick around.

              nice."
23765,GEORGE,121," My in-laws. Oh, my...."
23766,FRANK,121," So, what do you think? Your old man can look pretty good 
              when he wants "
23767,ESTELLE,121, I don't like that tie.
23768,FRANK,121, What's the matter with this tie? I've hardly worn it.
23769,ESTELLE,121, It's too thin. They're wearing wide now.
23770,FRANK,121, How do you know what kind of ties they wear?
23771,ESTELLE,121," Go to any office building on 7th Avenue and tell me if 
              there's "
23772,FRANK,121," Oh, get the hell outta here. 7th Avenue."
23773,ESTELLE,121," George, do you think he should wear a tie like that?"
23774,FRANK,121, Huh?
23775,GEORGE,121, I think he should wear whatever tie he wants.
23776,FRANK,121, We gotta stop off and pick up a marble rye from Schnitzer's.
23777,ESTELLE,121," It's out of our way. Why can't we pick up something at 
              Lord's? "
23778,FRANK,121," No! We have to go to Schnitzer's! I'll show these people 
              something "
23779,GEORGE,121, This is gonna be fun.
23780,JERRY,121," Hey, you'll never guess who I bumped into. This guy Clyde. 
              He's in "
23781,ELAINE,121, So what did he have to say?
23782,JERRY,121, Nothing. I told him you two were pretty hot and heavy.
23783,ELAINE,121, Hot and heavy? You said hot and heavy?
23784,JERRY,121, Yeah.
23785,ELAINE,121, What did you do that for?
23786,JERRY,121, What?
23787,ELAINE,121," What if he tells John? Then John's gonna think that I think 
              that "
23788,JERRY,121, Oh
23789,ELAINE,121," I'm trying to get a little squirrel to come over to me 
              here. I don't "
23790,JERRY,121," Well, Clyde might not tell him."
23791,ELAINE,121, How do you know that?
23792,JERRY,121, I should have helped Kramer with those packages.
23793,ELAINE,121, Ohh!
23794,DENNIS,121," Let me give you a hand. Hey, Kramer. I wonder, could you 
              do me a "
23795,KRAMER,121, Uh-huh.
23796,DENNIS,121," I wonder, could you pick up my mail?"
23797,KRAMER,121, Yeah. Sure. Sure.
23798,DENNIS,121," In fact, you know what, how would you like to take my hansom 
              cab for"
23799,KRAMER,121, Drive the horse?
23800,DENNIS,121," It'll just be sitting there. You can really clean up. 500 
              bucks a "
23801,KRAMER,121," Oh, giddyup. Yeah."
23802,GEORGE,121," This is delicious, Mrs. Ross."
23803,MRS. ROSS,121, Oh. 
23804,MR. ROSS,121," What are you complimenting her for? She didn't make it 
              Rowenna did. "
23805,FRANK,121, What is this thing anyway?
23806,MRS. ROSS,121, It's Cornish gamehen.
23807,FRANK,121," What is that, like a little chicken?"
23808,GEORGE,121," It's, uh, it's not a little chicken. [laughing] Little 

              chicken. It's "
23809,FRANK,121, Gamebird?
23810,GEORGE,121, Yeah.
23811,FRANK,121," What do you mean? Like, you - you hunt it?"
23812,MR. ROSS,121, Yes.
23813,FRANK,121, How hard could it be to kill this thing?
23814,ESTELLE,121," I couldn't help but notice that you have quite a library 
              in there."
23815,MRS. ROSS,121," If I had a dime for every book he's actually read, [laughing] 
              I'd "
23816,SUSAN,121, More wine anyone? 
23817,FRANK,121, Yeah. I'll take some.
23818,SUSAN,121, Hmmm?
23819,FRANK,121, Thank you.
23820,SUSAN,121, How do you like the Merlot?
23821,ESTELLE,121, Merlot? I never heard of it. Did they just invent it?
23822,MRS. ROSS,121," Oh, mother."
23823,GEORGE,121," She's, uh, she's heard of Merlot. "
23824,FRANK,121," Let me understand, you got the hen, the chicken and the 
              rooster. The "
23825,GEORGE,121, Why don't we talk about it another time.
23826,FRANK,121," But you see my point here? You only hear of a hen, a rooster 
              and a "
23827,MRS. ROSS,121, Something's missing all right.
23828,MR. ROSS,121," They're all chickens. The rooster has sex with all of 
              them."
23829,FRANK,121, That's perverse.
23830,GEORGE,121, Did anybody see Firestorm?
23831,MR. ROSS,121," Firestorm, that's a hell of a picture."
23832,GEORGE,121, Yeah.
23833,MR. ROSS,121," Remember when they had the helicopter land on top of 
              that car --"
23834,FRANK,121, Hey! Hey! Come on! Come on! I haven't seen it yet.
23835,MR. ROSS,121, It doesn't have anything to do with the plot!
23836,FRANK,121, Still! Still! I like to go in fresh!
23837,GEORGE,121, Oh mother of God.
23838,KRAMER,121," Of course, uh, this is Central Park. Uh, this was designed 
              in 1850 by "
23839,JOHN,121," Thank you. Now, I'd like to play something th -- well, actually, 
              it's "
23840,GEORGE,121, Thank God that's over.
23841,ESTELLE,121," The mother seems to hit the sauce pretty hard. I didn't 
              like that."
23842,FRANK,121," And who doesn't serve cake after a meal? What kind of people? 
              Would it "
23843,GEORGE,121," So, they didn't give you a piece of cake? Big deal."
23844,ESTELLE,121," It is a big deal. You're supposed to serve cake after 
              a meal. I'm "
23845,FRANK,121," Not impolite...it's stupid, that's what it is. You gotta 
              be stupid to "
23846,ESTELLE,121," Your father's absolutely right. We're sitting there like 
              idiots "
23847,GEORGE,121, What is this? The marble rye?
23848,MRS. ROSS,121," Oh, dear. I forgot to put out that - that bread they 
              brought."
23849,ESTELLE,121, We forgot to bring it in.
23850,FRANK,121," No, I brought it in. They never put it out."
23851,MRS. ROSS,121, Where is it?
23852,SUSAN,121, I don't know. Where'd you put it?
23853,MRS. ROSS,121, Right over there.
23854,SUSAN,121," Well, it's gone."
23855,GEORGE,121, You stole the bread?
23856,FRANK,121," What do you mean stole? It's my bread. They didn't eat it. 
              Why should "
23857,GEORGE,121, Because we brought it for them!
23858,FRANK,121," Apparently, it wasn't good enough for them to serve."
23859,MRS. ROSS,121, Is it possible they took it back?
23860,SUSAN,121, Who would bring a bread and take it back?
23861,MR. ROSS,121," Those people, that's who. I think they're sick."
23862,ESTELLE,121, People take buses to get that rye.
23863,GEORGE,121, Maybe they forgot to put it out!
23864,FRANK,121," Aw, they didn't forget to put it out! It's deliberate! Deliberate, 
              I "
23865,JERRY,121, He stole back the rye?
23866,GEORGE,121, Yeah. 
23867,JERRY,121, Why?
23868,GEORGE,121, Why? Why? 'Cause he's off his rocker! That's why. 
23869,JERRY,121," So, do the Ross's know?"
23870,GEORGE,121, I don't know. They're all very suspicious.
23871,JERRY,121, Why wouldn't they be? A rye bread doesn't just disappear.
23872,GEORGE,121," Now, because of that stupid rye bread, I gotta keep them 
              all "
23873,JERRY,121, Bad situation. 
23874,GEORGE,121," I'll tell you what I'd like to do. I'd like to replace 
              that rye."
23875,JERRY,121, What do you mean replace it?
23876,GEORGE,121," You know, you go out, you get another rye. Of course, it 
              would have "
23877,JERRY,121," Well, there ya go. What's so hard about that?"
23878,GEORGE,121," What's so hard about that? How am I supposed to get it 
              in there? I"
23879,JERRY,121," All right. All right. Don't panic. Let's just think about 
              it. Get the "
23880,GEORGE,121, So?
23881,JERRY,121," Well, Kramer'll take them around for a while."
23882,GEORGE,121," And it's their anniversary Friday night. I could send them 
              for a"
23883,JERRY,121," Are you kidding? People love it. There's something about 
              the clip clop, "
23884,GEORGE,121," So, they go off for the ride, by the time they come back 
              the bread is "
23885,JERRY,121, What about Susan?
23886,GEORGE,121," She's working late that night. We're - were supposed to 
              have dinner "
23887,JERRY,121, Beautiful!
23888,GEORGE,121, You think Kramer'll do it?
23889,KRAMER,121," Of course I'll do it. I'd be happy to. So, all I gotta 
              do is be there "
23890,GEORGE,121," Yeah. Just take 'em out and ride 'em around for about..half 
              an hour."
23891,KRAMER,121, Hey.
23892,JERRY,121, What the hell are you doing there?
23893,KRAMER,121, It's Beef-A-Reeno..and I got fifty cans. You want some?
23894,JERRY,121, No. No thanks.
23895,KRAMER,121," Jerry, I think I bought too much at that price club. I 
              don't have any "
23896,GEORGE,121," Hold on. Hold on. Wait a minute. How am I gonna get the 
              rye bread "
23897,JERRY,121, Just put it under your shirt.
23898,GEORGE,121, Have you ever seen a Schnitzer's rye? It - it's huge! 
23899,JERRY,121," I'll tell ya what, I'll bring it over. I'll stop by Schnitzer's, 
              I'll "
23900,GEORGE,121," Oh, this is all locking in now. It is all locking in! [laughing]"
23901,ELAINE,121, Hey. Is that your horse outside?
23902,KRAMER,121, Yeah. That's Rusty.
23903,GEORGE,121, What? He's outside?
23904,KRAMER,121, Uh-huh.
23905,GEORGE,121," Aw, come on. I wanna go see him."
23906,KRAMER,121, You wanna go see him?
23907,GEORGE,121, Yeah. Hey! Hey!
23908,KRAMER,121, I'll show ya Rusty.
23909,GEORGE,121," Hey, Lainey, wanna see the horsey?"
23910,ELAINE,121," Well, you really did me in this time, didn't ya? First 
              guy I like in"
23911,JERRY,121," So, you think Clyde told him?"
23912,ELAINE,121, He wrote a song about it!
23913,JERRY,121," Well, maybe it's a good thing."
23914,ELAINE,121," No! It's not a good thing! It's a bad thing! Do you know 
              what this is "
23915,JERRY,121," No, but I've read articles and I must say it, doesn't sound 
              very "
23916,ELAINE,121," You know, one of these days, something terrible is gonna 
              happen to you. "
23917,JERRY,121," No. I'm gonna be just fine, but as far as your situation, 
              you're "
23918,ELAINE,121," I can't! He's got a big showcase for record producers at 
              his late "
23919,MR. ROSS,121," Yeah George, I gotta tell ya, this is a very nice gesture.

              nervous "
23922,GEORGE,121," Oh, no. No. No. No. No. Nothing. I'm fine. Everything's 
              fine. Fine. "
23923,MRS. ROSS,121," We've got water. I don't think we have any bread, but 
              we've got"
23924,KRAMER,121, Yeah. There ya go. That's Beef-A-Reeno. 
23925,MR. ROSS,121," Nice night for a hansom cab ride, 'ay George?"
23926,MRS. ROSS,121," You know, George we haven't done anything romantic like 
              this in"
23927,KRAMER,121, Ah ha!
23928,GEORGE,121, There he is. Right on time as usual.
23929,COUNTER WOMAN,121, 53.
23930,MABEL,121," 53. I'd like a marble rye, no plastic, in a bag."
23931,COUNTER WOMAN,121, Ah! You're lucky. It's our last one.
23932,JERRY,121," Wait a second, that's your last marble rye? "
23933,COUNTER WOMAN,121, That's right.
23934,JERRY,121, There's none left?
23935,COUNTER WOMAN,121, That's what I said. Number 54.
23936,JERRY,121," Uh, excuse me. I know this is gonna sound crazy but I - 
              I have to have "
23937,MABEL,121," Well, I'm sorry, but you should have got here earlier."
23938,JERRY,121," Yes. Well, be that as it may, if you could just find it 
              in yourself to "
23939,MABEL,121, You're not getting this rye --
23940,JERRY,121," All right. All right. I'll tell ya what I'm gonna do, I 
              will give you "
23941,MABEL,121, You're in my way!

              and let me "
23945,JERRY,121," All right. Look, I'll tell ya what, I'll give you $50. Now,

23949,JERRY,121," I want that rye, lady!"
23950,MABEL,121, Help! Someone help!
23951,JERRY,121," Shut up, you old bag!"
23952,MABEL,121, Stop thief! Stop him! He's got my marble rye!
23953,ELAINE,121," I'm sorry to just show up unexpectedly like this. I know 
              you've got "
23954,JOHN,121," Whoa. Hold on, Elaine I.....I'm kinda disappointed."
23955,ELAINE,121, Disappointed?
23956,JOHN,121," Yeah. I mean, I was excited when Clyde told me that."
23957,ELAINE,121, You were?
23958,JOHN,121, Absolutely.
23959,ELAINE,121, Ohh! Whew! I am so relieved!
23960,JOHN,121," Listen, uh, I've still got a couple of hours to kill before 
              the next "
23961,ELAINE,121, Really?
23962,JOHN,121, And you know what?
23963,ELAINE,121, What?
23964,JOHN,121," I've been thinking about what we do and I'm thinking..of...adding 
              a new "
23965,ELAINE,121, Ohh!
23966,KRAMER,121, Y'aah!
23967,MRS. ROSS,121, [sniffing] What is that?
23968,MR. ROSS,121, I think it's the horse.
23969,MRS. ROSS,121," Oh, God."
23970,KRAMER,121," Hey, how's everything? You..you need anything?"
23971,MRS. ROSS,121, This is - this is...horrible.
23972,MR. ROSS,121," Excuse me,...what do you feed this animal?"
23973,KRAMER,121," Oh, you know, oats and hay. You know, they like that stuff. 
            "
23974,MRS. ROSS,121, I can't take this. Let me out of this thing!
23975,MR. ROSS,121," Turn this thing around. We've had it. We can't breathe 
              back here!"
23976,KRAMER,121, Rusty! Rusty!
23977,GEORGE,121, [whistling]
23978,KRAMER,121, Whoa!
23979,GEORGE,121, Wha - what happened? What are you doing back so soon?
23980,MR. ROSS,121, Ask Rusty.
23981,KRAMER,121," I'm terribly sorry, Mr. Ross. One never knows how the "
23982,MRS. ROSS,121," Thanks for nothing! Come on, George. Let's go upstairs."
23983,GEORGE,121, What the hell happened?
23984,KRAMER,121, The horse is gassy. Must have been the Beef-A-Reeno.
23985,GEORGE,121, Beef-A-Reeno? You fed the horse Beef-A-Reeno?!
23986,KRAMER,121," Well, I overbought!"
23987,MR. ROSS,121, George.

23990,MANAGER,121, Uh...he'll be here soon.
23991,MUSIC GUY,121," I'll give him ten more minutes. I'm not gonna stay here 
              all night."
23992,JERRY,121, How much did you give him?
23993,KRAMER,121," Just a can. But he really liked it, though."
23994,GEORGE,121, Jerry! Up here!
23995,JERRY,121," Yeah. Hey, what do you want me to do with this?"
23996,GEORGE,121," I can't come out. They're standing right by the door. Throw 
              it up!"
23997,JERRY,121, Really?
23998,GEORGE,121," Yeah. Yeah. It's the only way. Come on. What are you, kidding 
              me?"
23999,JERRY,121," Will you get this horse outta here. He's killing me. I can't 
              get any "
24000,KRAMER,121, I don't wanna go back on there!

              don't have"

24013,ELAINE,123," (excited) Oh, cool! Look at that!"
24014,JERRY,123," (admiring Christie) Yeah, I'm right there with ya."
24015,ELAINE,123, (excited) That is a Schwinn Stingray! And it's the girl's 
24016,ELAINE,123, What d'you think Jerry? Jerry?
24017,JERRY,123, (tearing himself away from Christie) Huh?
24018,ELAINE,123, What d'you think?
24019,JERRY,123," Oh yeah, be great for your paper route."
24020,ELAINE,123, (laughs) I love it. I'm getting it.
24021,ELAINE,123," Can you help me get it down, Jer? Jerry."
24022,CHRISTIE,123, I think your friend needs some help over there.
24023,JERRY,123," You know, the only way to really help her is to just let her be."
24024,ELAINE,123, Hey!
24025,SUSAN,123, A little baby girl?
24026,KEN,123, Doctor says it could be any day now.
24027,GEORGE,123," (through mouthful of food) So, Carrie, you and Susan are "
24028,CARRIE,123, Doesn't make you anything.
24029,GEORGE,123," (jokingly) Well, so, legally, I could marry your daughter."
24030,SUSAN,123," So, have you picked out a name yet?"
24031,CARRIE,123," Well, we've narrowed it down to a few. We like Kimberley."
24032,SUSAN,123, Aww.
24033,GEORGE,123," (negative) Hu-ho, boy."
24034,KEN,123, You don't like Kimberley?
24035,GEORGE,123, Ech. What else you got?
24036,KEN,123, How about Joan?
24037,GEORGE,123," Aw c'mon, I'm eating here."
24038,SUSAN,123, (warning) George!
24039,CARRIE,123, Pamela?
24040,GEORGE,123," Pamela?! Awright, I tell you what. You look like nice people, 
      "
24041,KEN,123, What?
24042,GEORGE,123, Soda. S-O-D-A. Soda.
24043,CARRIE,123," I don't know, it sounds a little strange."
24044,GEORGE,123," All names sound strange the first time you hear 'em. What, you 
      "
24045,KEN,123," Yeah, but uh... Soda?"
24046,GEORGE,123," Yeah, that's right. It's working."
24047,CARRIE,123, We'll put it on the list.
24048,GEORGE,123, I solve problems. That's just what I do.
24049,KRAMER,123," (sniffing a slice of meat) Yeah, oh boy. Mmm, that's good."
24050,JERRY,123, You're really going to town with that turkey there.
24051,KRAMER,123," Oh yeah, I got a big appetite."
24052,KRAMER,123," Uhh, Jerry, you got no mustard, huh."
24053,JERRY,123, It's on the door.
24054,KRAMER,123," (examining a yellow squeeze bottle) What, this yellow stuff? 
      "
24055,KRAMER,123," Ah, 's no good."
24056,KRAMER,123, No. That's bush league.
24057,JERRY,123," Hey, hey. Wha... wait... what, you're gonna leave it there? "
24058,KRAMER,123," No, no, I can't eat that. You can't eat a sandwich without "
24059,JERRY,123," (sarcasm) Yeah, you're right. I really should keep more of your"
24060,KRAMER,123," Hey, hey, hey. I'm getting a vibe here. What, are you unhappy 
      "
24061,JERRY,123, What arrangement?
24062,KRAMER,123," Well, I was under the impression that I could take anything I 
      "
24063,JERRY,123," (sarcasm) Yeah, well, lemme know when you get something in there 
      "
24064,KRAMER,123," Oh, hey."
24065,ELAINE,123, Hey.
24066,JERRY,123, Hey. What's with your neck?
24067,ELAINE,123, Still killing me from having to get that bike off the wall. 
24068,JERRY,123," Well, if it's any consolation, I did get her number."
24069,ELAINE,123," (sitting) Ah, I think I really strained it. Ow."
24070,JERRY,123," Aw, I doubt you strained it. Maybe you pulled it."
24071,ELAINE,123," Ach, maybe."
24072,JERRY,123, Did you twist it? You coulda twisted it.
24073,ELAINE,123, I don't know.
24074,JERRY,123," Did you wrench it? Did you jam it? Maybe you squeezed it. Turned 
      "
24075,ELAINE,123," (patience exhausted) You know what, why don't you just shut the 

"
24076,JERRY,123, Awright.
24077,ELAINE,123," God. Man, this is killing me. Right now, I would give that bike 
      "
24078,KRAMER,123," Aw, you really hurting, huh?"
24079,ELAINE,123," Oh, Kramer, it's just awful."
24080,KRAMER,123," Uh hmm. Well, your arterioles have constricted."
24081,KRAMER,123," Alright, lean forward, relax."
24082,ELAINE,123, (worried) What? What?
24083,KRAMER,123, Encounter shiatsu.
24084,ELAINE,123," Wait a minute. Kramer, you know what you're doing here?"
24085,KRAMER,123," (continuing to work) Ohh yeah. A wise man once taught me the 
      "
24086,ELAINE,123, Ah hah.
24087,KRAMER,123, (to Jerry) He sells tee-shirts outside the World Trade Centre.
24088,ELAINE,123, (seriously worried) Wha...?
24089,KRAMER,123, He's a genius. Here we go...
24090,KRAMER,123," From pain, will come pleasure."
24091,KRAMER,123, Uh? Voila.
24092,ELAINE,123, (pleasantly surprised) Oh my god!
24093,KRAMER,123, Yeah.
24094,ELAINE,123, Wow! That is unbelievable. The pain is totally gone!
24095,JERRY,123, What's even more amazing is his formal training is in 
24096,KRAMER,123," Awright, my work is done here."
24097,ELAINE,123," (big smile) Oh man! Kramer, thank you!"
24098,KRAMER,123," (closing the door) Yeah, you can send that bike over any time."
24099,ELAINE,123," (after Kramer) What? (to Jerry) What, what is he talking about?"
24100,JERRY,123," I dunno. (realising) Oh, 'cos you said you'd give the bike to 
      "
24101,ELAINE,123, You really think he wants the bike?
24102,JERRY,123, Oh yeah.
24103,ELAINE,123, It took him like ten seconds!
24104,JERRY,123," Well, that's the most he's worked in the last four months."
24105,GEORGE,123, I think they really went for that Soda.
24106,SUSAN,123," What, are you crazy? They hated it. They were just humouring "
24107,GEORGE,123," Ah, alright. Believe me, that kid's gonna be called Soda."
24108,SUSAN,123," I can tell you, I would never name my child Soda."
24109,GEORGE,123," Oh, no no no. Course not. I got a great name for our kids. A 
      "
24110,SUSAN,123, Yeah.
24111,SUSAN,123, What is that? Sign language?
24112,GEORGE,123," No, Seven."
24113,SUSAN,123, Seven Costanza? You're serious?
24114,GEORGE,123, Yeah. It's a beautiful name for a boy or a girl...
24115,GEORGE,123, ...especially a girl. Or a boy.
24116,SUSAN,123, I don't think so.
24117,GEORGE,123," What, you don't like the name?"
24118,SUSAN,123, It's not a name. It's a number.
24119,GEORGE,123," I know. It's Mickey Mantle's number. So not only is it an all 
      "
24120,SUSAN,123, It's awful. I hate it!
24121,GEORGE,123," (angry) Well, that's the name!"
24122,SUSAN,123," (also angry) Oh no it is not! No child of mine is ever going to 
      "
24123,GEORGE,123," (yelling) Awright, let's just stay calm here! Don't get all "
24124,JERRY,123," Seven? Yeah, I guess I could see it. Seven. Seven periods of "
24125,GEORGE,123," (adamant) Yes I am. I defy you to come up with a better name 
      "
24126,JERRY,123," Awright, let's see. How about Mug? (picks up the mug) Mug "
24127,GEORGE,123," Alright, you having a good time there?"
24128,JERRY,123, I got fifty right here in the cupboard. How about Bisquik? 
24129,GEORGE,123," (shouts) Awright already!! This is a very key issue with me, 
      "
24130,JERRY,123," Oh, I forgot to call Christie."
24131,GEORGE,123, Christie? That's the one you met in the antique store?
24132,JERRY,123," Yeah, she had this great black and white dress, with a scoop "
24133,GEORGE,123," And you met her in an antique store! I don't know how you do 
      "
24134,JERRY,123, (smug) I'm not engaged.
24135,KRAMER,123," Ah, I got it."
24136,JERRY,123, Got what?
24137,KRAMER,123," (putting the items on the counter) Got the answer, Jerry. "
24138,JERRY,123," Oh, it's no problem. You can take whatever you want."
24139,KRAMER,123," Oh, I will. But now, I'm accountable. Alright, I take what I 
      "
24140,KRAMER,123," Here. I write it down. (he writes) ""One cupcake."" And 
        then I "
24141,JERRY,123, Sort of a mooching inventory.
24142,KRAMER,123," No, no. Not mooching. 'Cos at the end of the week, you add 'em 
      "
24143,JERRY,123, Alright.
24144,KRAMER,123," Alright, now look I gotta run some errands, so look. When "
24145,JERRY,123," Kramer, I don't know if you're getting that bike."
24146,KRAMER,123," Yes I am. We had a verbal contract. If we can't take each other 
      "
24147,KRAMER,123," (waving at the bowl) Oh yeah, yeah. Put that on my tab."
24148,JERRY,123," Well this is it. The food is atrocious, but the busboys are the 
      "
24149,MAITRE D',123," May I take your coat, miss?"
24150,CHRISTIE,123," Yes, thank you."
24151,GEORGE,123, The same outfit?
24152,JERRY,123, The exact same outfit.
24153,GEORGE,123, How many days was it between encounters.
24154,JERRY,123, Three.
24155,GEORGE,123," Three days. Well, maybe you caught her on the cusp of a new "
24156,JERRY,123," Possibly, but then shouldn't the outfit only reappear again at 
      "
24157,GEORGE,123, Maybe she moved it up in the rotation.
24158,JERRY,123," Why? It's our first date, she's already in reruns?"
24159,GEORGE,123, Very curious.
24160,JERRY,123, Indeed.
24161,GEORGE,123," You know, Einstein wore the exact same outfit every day."
24162,JERRY,123," Well, if she splits the atom, I'll let it slide."
24163,GEORGE,123," (picking up his coat) Awright, I'm heading home."
24164,JERRY,123," Hey, did Susan change her mind about the name?"
24165,GEORGE,123," (standing) Not yet, but she's weakening."
24166,JERRY,123," You know, George, just because your life is destroyed, don't "
24167,GEORGE,123," It's Mickey Mantle, Jerry. My idol."
24168,JERRY,123, How about 'Mickey'?
24169,GEORGE,123, 'Mickey'? (incredulous) 'Mickey'!
24170,KRAMER,123, Hey buddy.
24171,JERRY,123," (holding up a can) Hey, is this your half a can of soda in the 
      "
24172,KRAMER,123," No, that's yours. My half is gone."
24173,JERRY,123, What?
24174,KRAMER,123," Yeah, I put my half a can here on the tab. Why, what's your "
24175,JERRY,123, You cannot buy half a can of soda.
24176,KRAMER,123," Well, why not."
24177,JERRY,123," Well, I don't wanna get into the whole physics of carbonation 
      "
24178,KRAMER,123, Yeah.
24179,JERRY,123," That is the sound of you buying a whole can. And the same goes 
      "
24180,JERRY,123," ...When you pierce the skin of a piece of fruit, you've bought 
      "
24181,KRAMER,123, Alright.
24182,JERRY,123," ...You bite it, you bought it."
24183,KRAMER,123," Alright, alright. I'll make the necessary adjustments, alright."
24184,JERRY,123, Thank you.
24185,KRAMER,123, Yeah.
24186,ELAINE,123, Hey.
24187,KRAMER,123," Oh. (pointedly) So, how's the neck? Nice and loose?"
24188,ELAINE,123," Lookit, Kramer, you are not getting this bike. I don't even "
24189,KRAMER,123, (deadly serious) It's a verbal contract. We had a deal.
24190,ELAINE,123," No we didn't. You take these things too literally. It's like 
      "
24191,KRAMER,123," Well, my friend Jay Reimenschneider eats horse all the time. 
        He "
24192,ELAINE,123," This is not the point. (emphatic) The point is, you just can't 
      "
24193,KRAMER,123," Boy, I am really surprised at you. (opening the door) You are 
      "
24194,KRAMER,123, I always put you up here...
24195,KRAMER,123, ...They're over here. Now you're... aww-whawww.
24196,ELAINE,123, (grudging) Alright.
24197,KRAMER,123, (points) Digidi.
24198,GEORGE,123," Aw c'mon. It's a fantastic name. It's a real original, nobody 
      "
24199,SUSAN,123," Well, I dunno how original it's gonna be any more."
24200,GEORGE,123, Why not?
24201,SUSAN,123," Well I was telling Carrie about our argument, and when I told 
      "
24202,GEORGE,123," So, what're you saying?"
24203,SUSAN,123, They're gonna name their baby Seven.
24204,GEORGE,123," (disbelief) What?! They're stealing the name?! That's my name, 
      "
24205,SUSAN,123, I can't believe that they're using it.
24206,GEORGE,123," (anger) Well now it's not gonna be original! It's gonna lose 
      "
24207,SUSAN,123, I dunno how much cachet it had to begin with.
24208,GEORGE,123," (rage) Oh, it's got cachet, baby! It's got cachet up the "
24209,ELAINE,123," (in pain) Oh god! Oh, god. (bitter) Kramer!"
24210,MAN,123, Watch your step.
24211,ELAINE,123," (pain) Oh, ah. (bitter) Stupid Kramer."
24212,CHRISTIE,123, Excuse me. Elaine?
24213,ELAINE,123, Huh?
24214,CHRISTIE,123," Over here. I thought that was you. You're Jerry's friend, "
24215,ELAINE,123," Yeah, yeah. Uh, Christie?"
24216,CHRISTIE,123, Yes. How y'doing?
24217,ELAINE,123, (bearing up) I'm fine.
24218,CHRISTIE,123," Well, I gotta run. It was good to see you."
24219,ELAINE,123," (after Christie) Okay, oh, it was good to, good to see you."
24220,VOICE 1 (O.C.),123, Lookin' good.
24221,VOICE 2 (O.C.),123," Hey Cosmo, nice wheels."
24222,KRAMER,123, You got that right!
24223,KID,123," (scorn) Hey, you're riding a girl's bike."
24224,ELAINE,123, (shouting) Kramer! Kramer!
24225,KEN (O.C.),123, Hello.
24226,GEORGE,123," Hello, Ken. It's George Costanza. I think we need to talk."
24227,ELAINE (O.C.),123, (angry shout) Kramer!
24228,ELAINE,123, Kramer!!
24229,JERRY,123, Hey
24230,ELAINE,123, Ow! God! Is Kramer back from his little joyride yet?
24231,JERRY,123, Haven't seen him. How's the neck?
24232,ELAINE,123," His chiropractic job was a crock. It's even worse than it was 
      "
24233,JERRY,123," Boy, I'm surprised. (sarcasm) I would think Kramer would have 
        a "
24234,ELAINE,123," Hey, you know what, I think I ran into that girl from the "
24235,JERRY,123, You saw her? What was she wearing?
24236,ELAINE,123," I don't know. I couldn't see. I couldn't look down because of 
      "
24237,JERRY,123, Didn't you get a glimpse? An impression?
24238,ELAINE,123, What d'you care?
24239,JERRY,123, Both times I've seen her she's worn the same dress.
24240,ELAINE,123, Did you have a nice ride?
24241,KRAMER,123," Oh, great ride."
24242,ELAINE,123," Oh, that's good. 'Cos it was your last!"
24243,KRAMER,123, What're you talking about?! We had a deal!
24244,ELAINE,123," (anger) You better give me back that bike! (indicating neck) 
      "
24245,KRAMER,123," Bed? You should be sleeping on a wooden board for at least a 
      "
24246,ELAINE,123, What? You never told me that.
24247,KRAMER,123," Well, it's common sense."
24248,ELAINE,123," Jerry, what is he talking about? He's being ridiculous."
24249,KRAMER,123," Alright, look. Jerry, you know the whole story, you should "
24250,ELAINE,123, Yeah Jerry.
24251,JERRY,123," Well, I'm flattered that you would both appeal to my wisdom, but"
24252,ELAINE,123," Yeah, I'd go for that. Would you go for that?"
24253,KRAMER,123," Alright, I'm down."
24254,JERRY,123," Course, it would have to be someone who hasn't heard the story 
      "
24255,ELAINE,123," So, that's the situation."
24256,NEWMAN,123," Mmm. You present an interesting dilemma. Each of you seemingly 
      "
24257,KRAMER,123, Newman!
24258,NEWMAN,123," ...But, you must promise That you will abide by my decision, 
        no "
24259,KRAMER,123," Uh, yeah."
24260,ELAINE,123, Yeah.
24261,NEWMAN,123," Alright, let's begin."
24262,NEWMAN,123," (excited) Ooh, my cocoa!"
24263,KEN,123, Why can't we use Seven?
24264,GEORGE,123, It's my name. I made it up. You can't just steal it.
24265,CARRIE,123," Well, it's not as if Susan's pregnant. You've already postponed 
      "
24266,GEORGE,123," Hey, hey hey. Don't worry about me. I'm not a waffler. I don't 
      "
24267,KEN,123," Right, we're both big Mickey Mantle fans, and we love the name. 
      "
24268,GEORGE,123," (shouting) What happened to Soda?! I thought we all agreed on 
      "
24269,KEN,123," (emphatic) Well, we don't care for Soda."
24270,GEORGE,123, You don't care for Soda?!
24271,CARRIE,123," (worked up) No, no. We don't like Soda at all!"
24272,GEORGE,123," (shouting) How d'you not like Soda?! It's bubbly, it's "
24273,CARRIE,123, Oh!
24274,KEN,123, What is it?
24275,CARRIE,123, I felt something.
24276,KEN,123," Are you okay, honey?"
24277,CARRIE,123, I think I'm going into labour.
24278,KEN,123," Oh god, oh god. Okay, let's not panic. Let's just get to the "
24279,CARRIE,123, Okay.
24280,KEN,123," ...Alright? I got the suitcase packed, right here."
24281,GEORGE,123, What about Six?
24282,GEORGE,123, Nine. Thirt... thirteen's no good.
24283,GEORGE,123, Fourteen. (shouting after Ken) Fourteen!
24284,CHRISTIE,123," Are you okay, Jerry? You seem quiet."
24285,JERRY,123," No, I'm just a little uh, worn out."
24286,CHRISTIE,123, I know exactly what you mean.
24287,JERRY,123," Oh, I'm sure you do."
24288,JERRY (V.O.),123," What in god's name is going on here? Is she wearing the 
      "
24289,CHRISTIE,123, (horrified) Oh my god!
24290,JERRY,123, Oh.
24291,CHRISTIE,123," Ahh. I can't go to the movies like this. Do you mind if we 
        go "
24292,JERRY,123," Change? (thoughtful) Yes, I think that's a super idea."
24293,CARRIE,123, Are we almost there?
24294,KEN,123," Just keep breathing, okay."
24295,CARRIE,123," (deep breaths) Okay, okay."
24296,KEN,123, Okay.
24297,GEORGE,123," (to Carrie) You know, the thing is, I kinda promised the widow 
      "
24298,KEN,123," Now's not the best time, George!"
24299,GEORGE,123," (to Carrie) It's just that, I know her, and boy..."
24300,KEN,123, (firm) George! She's in labour!
24301,GEORGE,123, (angry shout) So am I!
24302,NEWMAN,123," Well, you've both presented very convincing arguments. On the 
      "
24303,NEWMAN,123," And, Kramer, you did provide a service in exchange for "

24306,ELAINE,123," Alright, fine. Fine. Go ahead. (standing) Cut the stupid thing 
      "
24307,KRAMER,123," No, no, no. Give it to her. I'd rather it belonged to another 
      "
24308,ELAINE,123," Yeah, yeah, y-yeah."
24309,NEWMAN,123," Not so fast, Elaine! Only the bike's true owner would rather

24310,ELAINE,123, What?!
24311,KRAMER,123," Sweet justice. Newman, you are wise."
24312,ELAINE,123," (frustration) But this isn't fair! Lookit, my neck is still "
24313,KRAMER,123," Well, tell it to the judge, honey. I'm going for a ride."
24314,CHRISTIE,123, Here we are.
24315,JERRY,123," (looking around) Ah, so this is the Fortress of Solitude."
24316,CHRISTIE,123," Well, I guess I'll go change."
24317,JERRY,123," Yes, change. By all means, change."

24319,JERRY (V.O.),123, There must be a secret stash around here somewhere.
24320,CHRISTIE,123, Ahem! Are you looking for something?
24321,JERRY,123, What're you doing? I thought you were changing.
24322,CHRISTIE,123," No, I, I'm thinking we should just call it a night."
24323,JERRY,123," No, no. C'mon, put something else on. It's early, let's go out."
24324,CHRISTIE,123," If it's all the same to you, I think I'm just gonna go to "
24325,JERRY,123," You know, I'm kinda tired myself. Maybe I'll just sleep here on

24326,CHRISTIE,123, (unequivocal) Jerry. I don't think so.
24327,JERRY,123, You wanna throw something on and walk me to a cab?
24328,CHRISTIE,123, (gesturing) Get out.
24329,JERRY,123," (pleading) Tell me what you're wearing tomorrow. I'll help you

24330,KEN,123," Okay, breathe, honey. Breathe."

24341,KRAMER,123, (does a double take) Yikes.
24342,JERRY,123, I know. Pretty steep.
24343,KRAMER,123," Well, I don't have this kind of cash."
24344,JERRY,123, Few do.
24345,KRAMER,123, I'm good for it.
24346,JERRY,123," Yeah, well, until this bill is paid..."

24403,JERRY,123, It's on the door.
24404,KRAMER,123," (examining a yellow squeeze bottle) What, this yellow stuff? 
      "
24405,KRAMER,123," Ah, 's no good."
24406,KRAMER,123, No. That's bush league.
24407,JERRY,123," Hey, hey. Wha... wait... what, you're gonna leave it there? "
24408,KRAMER,123," No, no, I can't eat that. You can't eat a sandwich without "

24414,KRAMER,123," Oh, hey."
24415,ELAINE,123, Hey.
24416,JERRY,123, Hey. What's with your neck?
24417,ELAINE,123, Still killing me from having to get that bike off the wall. 
24418,JERRY,123," Well, if it's any consolation, I did get her number."
24419,ELAINE,123," (sitting) Ah, I think I really strained it. Ow."
24420,JERRY,123," Aw, I doubt you strained it. Maybe you pulled it."
24421,ELAINE,123," Ach, maybe."
24422,JERRY,123, Did you twist it? You coulda twisted it.
24423,ELAINE,123, I don't know.
24424,JERRY,123," Did you wrench it? Did you jam it? Maybe you squeezed it. Turned

24425,ELAINE,123," (patience exhausted) You know what, why don't you just shut the 
      "
24426,JERRY,123, Awright.
24427,ELAINE,123," God. Man, this is killing me. Right now, I would give that bike 
      "
24428,KRAMER,123," Aw, you really hurting, huh?"
24429,ELAINE,123," Oh, Kramer, it's just awful."
24430,KRAMER,123," Uh hmm. Well, your arterioles have constricted."
24431,KRAMER,123," Alright, lean forward, relax."
24432,ELAINE,123, (worried) What? What?
24433,KRAMER,123, Encounter shiatsu.
24434,ELAINE,123," Wait a minute. Kramer, you know what you're doing here?"
24435,KRAMER,123," (continuing to work) Ohh yeah. A wise man once taught me the 
      "
24436,ELAINE,123, Ah hah.
24437,KRAMER,123, (to Jerry) He sells tee-shirts outside the World Trade Centre.
24438,ELAINE,123, (seriously worried) Wha...?
24439,KRAMER,123, He's a genius. Here we go...
24440,KRAMER,123," From pain, will come pleasure."
24441,KRAMER,123, Uh? Voila.
24442,ELAINE,123, (pleasantly surprised) Oh my god!
24443,KRAMER,123, Yeah.
24444,ELAINE,123, Wow! That is unbelievable. The pain is totally gone!
24445,JERRY,123, What's even more amazing is his formal training is in 
24446,KRAMER,123," Awright, my work is done here."
24447,ELAINE,123," (big smile) Oh man! Kramer, thank you!"
24448,KRAMER,123," (closing the door) Yeah, you can send that bike over any time."
24449,ELAINE,123," (after Kramer) What? (to Jerry) What, what is he talking about?"
24450,JERRY,123," I dunno. (realising) Oh, 'cos you said you'd give the bike to 
      "
24451,ELAINE,123, You really think he wants the bike?
24452,JERRY,123, Oh yeah.
24453,ELAINE,123, It took him like ten seconds!
24454,JERRY,123," Well, that's the most he's worked in the last four months."
24455,GEORGE,123, I think they really went for that Soda.
24456,SUSAN,123," What, are you crazy? They hated it. They were just humouring "
24457,GEORGE,123," Ah, alright. Believe me, that kid's gonna be called Soda."
24458,SUSAN,123," I can tell you, I would never name my child Soda."
24459,GEORGE,123," Oh, no no no. Course not. I got a great name for our kids. A 
      "
24460,SUSAN,123, Yeah.
24461,SUSAN,123, What is that? Sign language?
24462,GEORGE,123," No, Seven."
24463,SUSAN,123, Seven Costanza? You're serious?
24464,GEORGE,123, Yeah. It's a beautiful name for a boy or a girl...
24465,GEORGE,123, ...especially a girl. Or a boy.
24466,SUSAN,123, I don't think so.
24467,GEORGE,123," What, you don't like the name?"
24468,SUSAN,123, It's not a name. It's a number.
24469,GEORGE,123," I know. It's Mickey Mantle's number. So not only is it an all 
      "
24470,SUSAN,123, It's awful. I hate it!
24471,GEORGE,123," (angry) Well, that's the name!"
24472,SUSAN,123," (also angry) Oh no it is not! No child of mine is ever going to 
      "
24473,GEORGE,123," (yelling) Awright, let's just stay calm here! Don't get all "
24474,JERRY,123," Seven? Yeah, I guess I could see it. Seven. Seven periods of "
24475,GEORGE,123," (adamant) Yes I am. I defy you to come up with a better name 
      "
24476,JERRY,123," Awright, let's see. How about Mug? (picks up the mug) Mug "
24477,GEORGE,123," Alright, you having a good time there?"
24478,JERRY,123, I got fifty right here in the cupboard. How about Bisquik? 
24479,GEORGE,123," (shouts) Awright already!! This is a very key issue with me, 
      "
24480,JERRY,123," Oh, I forgot to call Christie."
24481,GEORGE,123, Christie? That's the one you met in the antique store?
24482,JERRY,123," Yeah, she had this great black and white dress, with a scoop "
24483,GEORGE,123," And you met her in an antique store! I don't know how you do 
      "
24484,JERRY,123, (smug) I'm not engaged.
24485,KRAMER,123," Ah, I got it."
24486,JERRY,123, Got what?
24487,KRAMER,123," (putting the items on the counter) Got the answer, Jerry. "
24488,JERRY,123," Oh, it's no problem. You can take whatever you want."
24489,KRAMER,123," Oh, I will. But now, I'm accountable. Alright, I take what I 
      "
24490,KRAMER,123," Here. I write it down. (he writes) ""One cupcake."" And 
        then I "
24491,JERRY,123, Sort of a mooching inventory.
24492,KRAMER,123," No, no. Not mooching. 'Cos at the end of the week, you add 'em 
      "
24493,JERRY,123, Alright.
24494,KRAMER,123," Alright, now look I gotta run some errands, so look. When "
24495,JERRY,123," Kramer, I don't know if you're getting that bike."
24496,KRAMER,123," Yes I am. We had a verbal contract. If we can't take each other 
      "
24497,KRAMER,123," (waving at the bowl) Oh yeah, yeah. Put that on my tab."
24498,JERRY,123," Well this is it. The food is atrocious, but the busboys are the 
      "
24499,MAITRE D',123," May I take your coat, miss?"
24500,CHRISTIE,123," Yes, thank you."
24501,GEORGE,123, The same outfit?
24502,JERRY,123, The exact same outfit.
24503,GEORGE,123, How many days was it between encounters.
24504,JERRY,123, Three.
24505,GEORGE,123," Three days. Well, maybe you caught her on the cusp of a new "
24506,JERRY,123," Possibly, but then shouldn't the outfit only reappear again at 
      "
24507,GEORGE,123, Maybe she moved it up in the rotation.
24508,JERRY,123," Why? It's our first date, she's already in reruns?"
24509,GEORGE,123, Very curious.
24510,JERRY,123, Indeed.
24511,GEORGE,123," You know, Einstein wore the exact same outfit every day."
24512,JERRY,123," Well, if she splits the atom, I'll let it slide."
24513,GEORGE,123," (picking up his coat) Awright, I'm heading home."
24514,JERRY,123," Hey, did Susan change her mind about the name?"
24515,GEORGE,123," (standing) Not yet, but she's weakening."
24516,JERRY,123," You know, George, just because your life is destroyed, don't "
24517,GEORGE,123," It's Mickey Mantle, Jerry. My idol."
24518,JERRY,123, How about 'Mickey'?
24519,GEORGE,123, 'Mickey'? (incredulous) 'Mickey'!
24520,KRAMER,123, Hey buddy.
24521,JERRY,123," (holding up a can) Hey, is this your half a can of soda in the 
      "
24522,KRAMER,123," No, that's yours. My half is gone."
24523,JERRY,123, What?
24524,KRAMER,123," Yeah, I put my half a can here on the tab. Why, what's your "
24525,JERRY,123, You cannot buy half a can of soda.
24526,KRAMER,123," Well, why not."
24527,JERRY,123," Well, I don't wanna get into the whole physics of carbonation 
      "
24528,KRAMER,123, Yeah.
24529,JERRY,123," That is the sound of you buying a whole can. And the same goes 
      "
24530,JERRY,123," ...When you pierce the skin of a piece of fruit, you've bought 
      "
24531,KRAMER,123, Alright.
24532,JERRY,123," ...You bite it, you bought it."
24533,KRAMER,123," Alright, alright. I'll make the necessary adjustments, alright."
24534,JERRY,123, Thank you.
24535,KRAMER,123, Yeah.
24536,ELAINE,123, Hey.
24537,KRAMER,123," Oh. (pointedly) So, how's the neck? Nice and loose?"
24538,ELAINE,123," Lookit, Kramer, you are not getting this bike. I don't even "
24539,KRAMER,123, (deadly serious) It's a verbal contract. We had a deal.
24540,ELAINE,123," No we didn't. You take these things too literally. It's like 
      "
24541,KRAMER,123," Well, my friend Jay Reimenschneider eats horse all the time. 
        He "
24542,ELAINE,123," This is not the point. (emphatic) The point is, you just can't

24543,KRAMER,123," Boy, I am really surprised at you. (opening the door) You are 
      "
24544,KRAMER,123, I always put you up here...

24548,GEORGE,123," Aw c'mon. It's a fantastic name. It's a real original, nobody 
      "
24549,SUSAN,123," Well, I dunno how original it's gonna be any more."
24550,GEORGE,123, Why not?
24551,SUSAN,123," Well I was telling Carrie about our argument, and when I told 
      "
24552,GEORGE,123," So, what're you saying?"
24553,SUSAN,123, They're gonna name their baby Seven.
24554,GEORGE,123," (disbelief) What?! They're stealing the name?! That's my name, 
      "
24555,SUSAN,123, I can't believe that they're using it.
24556,GEORGE,123," (anger) Well now it's not gonna be original! It's gonna lose 
      "
24557,SUSAN,123, I dunno how much cachet it had to begin with.
24558,GEORGE,123," (rage) Oh, it's got cachet, baby! It's got cachet up the "
24559,ELAINE,123," (in pain) Oh god! Oh, god. (bitter) Kramer!"

24580,ELAINE,123, Ow! God! Is Kramer back from his little joyride yet?
24581,JERRY,123, Haven't seen him. How's the neck?
24582,ELAINE,123," His chiropractic job was a crock. It's even worse than it was 
      "
24583,JERRY,123," Boy, I'm surprised. (sarcasm) I would think Kramer would have 
        a "
24584,ELAINE,123," Hey, you know what, I think I ran into that girl from the "
24585,JERRY,123, You saw her? What was she wearing?

24587,JERRY,123, Didn't you get a glimpse? An impression?
24588,ELAINE,123, What d'you care?
24589,JERRY,123, Both times I've seen her she's worn the same dress.
24590,ELAINE,123, Did you have a nice ride?
24591,KRAMER,123," Oh, great ride."
24592,ELAINE,123," Oh, that's good. 'Cos it was your last!"
24593,KRAMER,123, What're you talking about?! We had a deal!
24594,ELAINE,123," (anger) You better give me back that bike! (indicating neck)

24595,KRAMER,123," Bed? You should be sleeping on a wooden board for at least a 
      "
24596,ELAINE,123, What? You never told me that.
24597,KRAMER,123," Well, it's common sense."
24598,ELAINE,123," Jerry, what is he talking about? He's being ridiculous."
24599,KRAMER,123," Alright, look. Jerry, you know the whole story, you should "
24600,ELAINE,123, Yeah Jerry.
24601,JERRY,123," Well, I'm flattered that you would both appeal to my wisdom, but"
24602,ELAINE,123," Yeah, I'd go for that. Would you go for that?"
24603,KRAMER,123," Alright, I'm down."
24604,JERRY,123," Course, it would have to be someone who hasn't heard the story 
      "
24605,ELAINE,123," So, that's the situation."
24606,NEWMAN,123," Mmm. You present an interesting dilemma. Each of you seemingly

24769,ELAINE,123," (sitting) Ah, I think I really strained it. Ow."

24772,JERRY,123, Did you twist it? You coulda twisted it.
24773,ELAINE,123, I don't know.

24776,JERRY,123, Awright.
24777,ELAINE,123," God. Man, this is killing me. Right now, I would give that bike

24783,KRAMER,123, Encounter shiatsu.
24784,ELAINE,123," Wait a minute. Kramer, you know what you're doing here?"
24785,KRAMER,123," (continuing to work) Ohh yeah. A wise man once taught me the

24786,ELAINE,123, Ah hah.
24787,KRAMER,123, (to Jerry) He sells tee-shirts outside the World Trade Centre.
24788,ELAINE,123, (seriously worried) Wha...?
24789,KRAMER,123, He's a genius. Here we go...
24790,KRAMER,123," From pain, will come pleasure."
24791,KRAMER,123, Uh? Voila.
24792,ELAINE,123, (pleasantly surprised) Oh my god!
24793,KRAMER,123, Yeah.
24794,ELAINE,123, Wow! That is unbelievable. The pain is totally gone!
24795,JERRY,123, What's even more amazing is his formal training is in 
24796,KRAMER,123," Awright, my work is done here."
24797,ELAINE,123," (big smile) Oh man! Kramer, thank you!"
24798,KRAMER,123," (closing the door) Yeah, you can send that bike over any time."
24799,ELAINE,123," (after Kramer) What? (to Jerry) What, what is he talking about?"
24800,JERRY,123," I dunno. (realising) Oh, 'cos you said you'd give the bike to 
      "
24801,ELAINE,123, You really think he wants the bike?
24802,JERRY,123, Oh yeah.
24803,ELAINE,123, It took him like ten seconds!
24804,JERRY,123," Well, that's the most he's worked in the last four months."
24805,GEORGE,123, I think they really went for that Soda.
24806,SUSAN,123," What, are you crazy? They hated it. They were just humouring "
24807,GEORGE,123," Ah, alright. Believe me, that kid's gonna be called Soda."
24808,SUSAN,123," I can tell you, I would never name my child Soda."
24809,GEORGE,123," Oh, no no no. Course not. I got a great name for our kids. A 
      "
24810,SUSAN,123, Yeah.
24811,SUSAN,123, What is that? Sign language?
24812,GEORGE,123," No, Seven."
24813,SUSAN,123, Seven Costanza? You're serious?
24814,GEORGE,123, Yeah. It's a beautiful name for a boy or a girl...
24815,GEORGE,123, ...especially a girl. Or a boy.
24816,SUSAN,123, I don't think so.
24817,GEORGE,123," What, you don't like the name?"
24818,SUSAN,123, It's not a name. It's a number.
24819,GEORGE,123," I know. It's Mickey Mantle's number. So not only is it an all 
      "
24820,SUSAN,123, It's awful. I hate it!
24821,GEORGE,123," (angry) Well, that's the name!"
24822,SUSAN,123," (also angry) Oh no it is not! No child of mine is ever going to 
      "
24823,GEORGE,123," (yelling) Awright, let's just stay calm here! Don't get all "
24824,JERRY,123," Seven? Yeah, I guess I could see it. Seven. Seven periods of "
24825,GEORGE,123," (adamant) Yes I am. I defy you to come up with a better name 
      "
24826,JERRY,123," Awright, let's see. How about Mug? (picks up the mug) Mug "
24827,GEORGE,123," Alright, you having a good time there?"
24828,JERRY,123, I got fifty right here in the cupboard. How about Bisquik? 
24829,GEORGE,123," (shouts) Awright already!! This is a very key issue with me, 
      "
24830,JERRY,123," Oh, I forgot to call Christie."
24831,GEORGE,123, Christie? That's the one you met in the antique store?
24832,JERRY,123," Yeah, she had this great black and white dress, with a scoop "
24833,GEORGE,123," And you met her in an antique store! I don't know how you do 
      "
24834,JERRY,123, (smug) I'm not engaged.
24835,KRAMER,123," Ah, I got it."
24836,JERRY,123, Got what?
24837,KRAMER,123," (putting the items on the counter) Got the answer, Jerry. "
24838,JERRY,123," Oh, it's no problem. You can take whatever you want."
24839,KRAMER,123," Oh, I will. But now, I'm accountable. Alright, I take what I 
      "
24840,KRAMER,123," Here. I write it down. (he writes) ""One cupcake."" And 
        then I "
24841,JERRY,123, Sort of a mooching inventory.
24842,KRAMER,123," No, no. Not mooching. 'Cos at the end of the week, you add 'em 
      "
24843,JERRY,123, Alright.
24844,KRAMER,123," Alright, now look I gotta run some errands, so look. When "
24845,JERRY,123," Kramer, I don't know if you're getting that bike."
24846,KRAMER,123," Yes I am. We had a verbal contract. If we can't take each other 
      "
24847,KRAMER,123," (waving at the bowl) Oh yeah, yeah. Put that on my tab."
24848,JERRY,123," Well this is it. The food is atrocious, but the busboys are the 
      "
24849,MAITRE D',123," May I take your coat, miss?"
24850,CHRISTIE,123," Yes, thank you."
24851,GEORGE,123, The same outfit?
24852,JERRY,123, The exact same outfit.
24853,GEORGE,123, How many days was it between encounters.
24854,JERRY,123, Three.
24855,GEORGE,123," Three days. Well, maybe you caught her on the cusp of a new "
24856,JERRY,123," Possibly, but then shouldn't the outfit only reappear again at 
      "
24857,GEORGE,123, Maybe she moved it up in the rotation.
24858,JERRY,123," Why? It's our first date, she's already in reruns?"
24859,GEORGE,123, Very curious.
24860,JERRY,123, Indeed.
24861,GEORGE,123," You know, Einstein wore the exact same outfit every day."
24862,JERRY,123," Well, if she splits the atom, I'll let it slide."
24863,GEORGE,123," (picking up his coat) Awright, I'm heading home."
24864,JERRY,123," Hey, did Susan change her mind about the name?"

      "
24878,KRAMER,123, Yeah.
24879,JERRY,123," That is the sound of you buying a whole can. And the same goes 
      "
24880,JERRY,123," ...When you pierce the skin of a piece of fruit, you've bought 
      "
24881,KRAMER,123, Alright.

24889,KRAMER,123, (deadly serious) It's a verbal contract. We had a deal.
24890,ELAINE,123," No we didn't. You take these things too literally. It's like

24891,KRAMER,123," Well, my friend Jay Reimenschneider eats horse all the time. 
        He "
24892,ELAINE,123," This is not the point. (emphatic) The point is, you just can't

24899,SUSAN,123," Well, I dunno how original it's gonna be any more."
24900,GEORGE,123, Why not?
24901,SUSAN,123," Well I was telling Carrie about our argument, and when I told 
      "
24902,GEORGE,123," So, what're you saying?"
24903,SUSAN,123, They're gonna name their baby Seven.
24904,GEORGE,123," (disbelief) What?! They're stealing the name?! That's my name, 
      "
24905,SUSAN,123, I can't believe that they're using it.
24906,GEORGE,123," (anger) Well now it's not gonna be original! It's gonna lose

24929,JERRY,123, Hey
24930,ELAINE,123, Ow! God! Is Kramer back from his little joyride yet?
24931,JERRY,123, Haven't seen him. How's the neck?
24932,ELAINE,123," His chiropractic job was a crock. It's even worse than it was 
      "
24933,JERRY,123," Boy, I'm surprised. (sarcasm) I would think Kramer would have 
        a "
24934,ELAINE,123," Hey, you know what, I think I ran into that girl from the "
24935,JERRY,123, You saw her? What was she wearing?

      "
24937,JERRY,123, Didn't you get a glimpse? An impression?
24938,ELAINE,123, What d'you care?
24939,JERRY,123, Both times I've seen her she's worn the same dress.
24940,ELAINE,123, Did you have a nice ride?
24941,KRAMER,123," Oh, great ride."
24942,ELAINE,123," Oh, that's good. 'Cos it was your last!"
24943,KRAMER,123, What're you talking about?! We had a deal!
24944,ELAINE,123," (anger) You better give me back that bike! (indicating neck)

24945,KRAMER,123," Bed? You should be sleeping on a wooden board for at least a 
      "
24946,ELAINE,123, What? You never told me that.
24947,KRAMER,123," Well, it's common sense."
24948,ELAINE,123," Jerry, what is he talking about? He's being ridiculous."
24949,KRAMER,123," Alright, look. Jerry, you know the whole story, you should "
24950,ELAINE,123, Yeah Jerry.
24951,JERRY,123," Well, I'm flattered that you would both appeal to my wisdom, but"
24952,ELAINE,123," Yeah, I'd go for that. Would you go for that?"
24953,KRAMER,123," Alright, I'm down."
24954,JERRY,123," Course, it would have to be someone who hasn't heard the story 
      "
24955,ELAINE,123," So, that's the situation."
24956,NEWMAN,123," Mmm. You present an interesting dilemma. Each of you seemingly 
      "
24957,KRAMER,123, Newman!

24962,NEWMAN,123," (excited) Ooh, my cocoa!"
24963,KEN,123, Why can't we use Seven?
24964,GEORGE,123, It's my name. I made it up. You can't just steal it.
24965,CARRIE,123," Well, it's not as if Susan's pregnant. You've already postponed

24969,KEN,123," (emphatic) Well, we don't care for Soda."
24970,GEORGE,123, You don't care for Soda?!

25147,ELAINE,123," (big smile) Oh man! Kramer, thank you!"
25148,KRAMER,123," (closing the door) Yeah, you can send that bike over any time."
25149,ELAINE,123," (after Kramer) What? (to Jerry) What, what is he talking about?"
25150,JERRY,123," I dunno. (realising) Oh, 'cos you said you'd give the bike to 
      "
25151,ELAINE,123, You really think he wants the bike?
25152,JERRY,123, Oh yeah.
25153,ELAINE,123, It took him like ten seconds!
25154,JERRY,123," Well, that's the most he's worked in the last four months."
25155,GEORGE,123, I think they really went for that Soda.
25156,SUSAN,123," What, are you crazy? They hated it. They were just humouring "
25157,GEORGE,123," Ah, alright. Believe me, that kid's gonna be called Soda."
25158,SUSAN,123," I can tell you, I would never name my child Soda."
25159,GEORGE,123," Oh, no no no. Course not. I got a great name for our kids. A 
      "
25160,SUSAN,123, Yeah.
25161,SUSAN,123, What is that? Sign language?
25162,GEORGE,123," No, Seven."
25163,SUSAN,123, Seven Costanza? You're serious?
25164,GEORGE,123, Yeah. It's a beautiful name for a boy or a girl...
25165,GEORGE,123, ...especially a girl. Or a boy.
25166,SUSAN,123, I don't think so.
25167,GEORGE,123," What, you don't like the name?"
25168,SUSAN,123, It's not a name. It's a number.
25169,GEORGE,123," I know. It's Mickey Mantle's number. So not only is it an all 
      "
25170,SUSAN,123, It's awful. I hate it!
25171,GEORGE,123," (angry) Well, that's the name!"
25172,SUSAN,123," (also angry) Oh no it is not! No child of mine is ever going to 
      "
25173,GEORGE,123," (yelling) Awright, let's just stay calm here! Don't get all "
25174,JERRY,123," Seven? Yeah, I guess I could see it. Seven. Seven periods of "
25175,GEORGE,123," (adamant) Yes I am. I defy you to come up with a better name 
      "
25176,JERRY,123," Awright, let's see. How about Mug? (picks up the mug) Mug "
25177,GEORGE,123," Alright, you having a good time there?"
25178,JERRY,123, I got fifty right here in the cupboard. How about Bisquik? 
25179,GEORGE,123," (shouts) Awright already!! This is a very key issue with me, 
      "
25180,JERRY,123," Oh, I forgot to call Christie."
25181,GEORGE,123, Christie? That's the one you met in the antique store?
25182,JERRY,123," Yeah, she had this great black and white dress, with a scoop "
25183,GEORGE,123," And you met her in an antique store! I don't know how you do 
      "
25184,JERRY,123, (smug) I'm not engaged.
25185,KRAMER,123," Ah, I got it."
25186,JERRY,123, Got what?
25187,KRAMER,123," (putting the items on the counter) Got the answer, Jerry. "
25188,JERRY,123," Oh, it's no problem. You can take whatever you want."
25189,KRAMER,123," Oh, I will. But now, I'm accountable. Alright, I take what I

25190,KRAMER,123," Here. I write it down. (he writes) ""One cupcake."" And 
        then I "
25191,JERRY,123, Sort of a mooching inventory.
25192,KRAMER,123," No, no. Not mooching. 'Cos at the end of the week, you add 'em 
      "
25193,JERRY,123, Alright.
25194,KRAMER,123," Alright, now look I gotta run some errands, so look. When "
25195,JERRY,123," Kramer, I don't know if you're getting that bike."
25196,KRAMER,123," Yes I am. We had a verbal contract. If we can't take each other 
      "
25197,KRAMER,123," (waving at the bowl) Oh yeah, yeah. Put that on my tab."
25198,JERRY,123," Well this is it. The food is atrocious, but the busboys are the 
      "
25199,MAITRE D',123," May I take your coat, miss?"
25200,CHRISTIE,123," Yes, thank you."
25201,GEORGE,123, The same outfit?
25202,JERRY,123, The exact same outfit.
25203,GEORGE,123, How many days was it between encounters.
25204,JERRY,123, Three.
25205,GEORGE,123," Three days. Well, maybe you caught her on the cusp of a new "
25206,JERRY,123," Possibly, but then shouldn't the outfit only reappear again at 
      "
25207,GEORGE,123, Maybe she moved it up in the rotation.
25208,JERRY,123," Why? It's our first date, she's already in reruns?"
25209,GEORGE,123, Very curious.
25210,JERRY,123, Indeed.
25211,GEORGE,123," You know, Einstein wore the exact same outfit every day."
25212,JERRY,123," Well, if she splits the atom, I'll let it slide."
25213,GEORGE,123," (picking up his coat) Awright, I'm heading home."
25214,JERRY,123," Hey, did Susan change her mind about the name?"
25215,GEORGE,123," (standing) Not yet, but she's weakening."
25216,JERRY,123," You know, George, just because your life is destroyed, don't "
25217,GEORGE,123," It's Mickey Mantle, Jerry. My idol."
25218,JERRY,123, How about 'Mickey'?
25219,GEORGE,123, 'Mickey'? (incredulous) 'Mickey'!
25220,KRAMER,123, Hey buddy.
25221,JERRY,123," (holding up a can) Hey, is this your half a can of soda in the 
      "
25222,KRAMER,123," No, that's yours. My half is gone."
25223,JERRY,123, What?
25224,KRAMER,123," Yeah, I put my half a can here on the tab. Why, what's your "
25225,JERRY,123, You cannot buy half a can of soda.
25226,KRAMER,123," Well, why not."
25227,JERRY,123," Well, I don't wanna get into the whole physics of carbonation 
      "
25228,KRAMER,123, Yeah.
25229,JERRY,123," That is the sound of you buying a whole can. And the same goes 
      "
25230,JERRY,123," ...When you pierce the skin of a piece of fruit, you've bought 
      "
25231,KRAMER,123, Alright.
25232,JERRY,123," ...You bite it, you bought it."
25233,KRAMER,123," Alright, alright. I'll make the necessary adjustments, alright."
25234,JERRY,123, Thank you.
25235,KRAMER,123, Yeah.
25236,ELAINE,123, Hey.
25237,KRAMER,123," Oh. (pointedly) So, how's the neck? Nice and loose?"
25238,ELAINE,123," Lookit, Kramer, you are not getting this bike. I don't even "
25239,KRAMER,123, (deadly serious) It's a verbal contract. We had a deal.
25240,ELAINE,123," No we didn't. You take these things too literally. It's like 
      "
25241,KRAMER,123," Well, my friend Jay Reimenschneider eats horse all the time. 
        He "
25242,ELAINE,123," This is not the point. (emphatic) The point is, you just can't 
      "
25243,KRAMER,123," Boy, I am really surprised at you. (opening the door) You are 
      "
25244,KRAMER,123, I always put you up here...
25245,KRAMER,123, ...They're over here. Now you're... aww-whawww.
25246,ELAINE,123, (grudging) Alright.
25247,KRAMER,123, (points) Digidi.
25248,GEORGE,123," Aw c'mon. It's a fantastic name. It's a real original, nobody 
      "
25249,SUSAN,123," Well, I dunno how original it's gonna be any more."
25250,GEORGE,123, Why not?
25251,SUSAN,123," Well I was telling Carrie about our argument, and when I told 
      "
25252,GEORGE,123," So, what're you saying?"
25253,SUSAN,123, They're gonna name their baby Seven.
25254,GEORGE,123," (disbelief) What?! They're stealing the name?! That's my name, 
      "
25255,SUSAN,123, I can't believe that they're using it.
25256,GEORGE,123," (anger) Well now it's not gonna be original! It's gonna lose 
      "
25257,SUSAN,123, I dunno how much cachet it had to begin with.
25258,GEORGE,123," (rage) Oh, it's got cachet, baby! It's got cachet up the "
25259,ELAINE,123," (in pain) Oh god! Oh, god. (bitter) Kramer!"
25260,MAN,123, Watch your step.
25261,ELAINE,123," (pain) Oh, ah. (bitter) Stupid Kramer."
25262,CHRISTIE,123, Excuse me. Elaine?
25263,ELAINE,123, Huh?
25264,CHRISTIE,123," Over here. I thought that was you. You're Jerry's friend, "
25265,ELAINE,123," Yeah, yeah. Uh, Christie?"
25266,CHRISTIE,123, Yes. How y'doing?
25267,ELAINE,123, (bearing up) I'm fine.
25268,CHRISTIE,123," Well, I gotta run. It was good to see you."
25269,ELAINE,123," (after Christie) Okay, oh, it was good to, good to see you."
25270,VOICE 1 (O.C.),123, Lookin' good.
25271,VOICE 2 (O.C.),123," Hey Cosmo, nice wheels."
25272,KRAMER,123, You got that right!
25273,KID,123," (scorn) Hey, you're riding a girl's bike."
25274,ELAINE,123, (shouting) Kramer! Kramer!
25275,KEN (O.C.),123, Hello.
25276,GEORGE,123," Hello, Ken. It's George Costanza. I think we need to talk."
25277,ELAINE (O.C.),123, (angry shout) Kramer!
25278,ELAINE,123, Kramer!!
25279,JERRY,123, Hey
25280,ELAINE,123, Ow! God! Is Kramer back from his little joyride yet?
25281,JERRY,123, Haven't seen him. How's the neck?
25282,ELAINE,123," His chiropractic job was a crock. It's even worse than it was 
      "
25283,JERRY,123," Boy, I'm surprised. (sarcasm) I would think Kramer would have 
        a "
25284,ELAINE,123," Hey, you know what, I think I ran into that girl from the "
25285,JERRY,123, You saw her? What was she wearing?
25286,ELAINE,123," I don't know. I couldn't see. I couldn't look down because of 
      "
25287,JERRY,123, Didn't you get a glimpse? An impression?
25288,ELAINE,123, What d'you care?
25289,JERRY,123, Both times I've seen her she's worn the same dress.
25290,ELAINE,123, Did you have a nice ride?
25291,KRAMER,123," Oh, great ride."
25292,ELAINE,123," Oh, that's good. 'Cos it was your last!"
25293,KRAMER,123, What're you talking about?! We had a deal!
25294,ELAINE,123," (anger) You better give me back that bike! (indicating neck) 
      "
25295,KRAMER,123," Bed? You should be sleeping on a wooden board for at least a 
      "
25296,ELAINE,123, What? You never told me that.
25297,KRAMER,123," Well, it's common sense."
25298,ELAINE,123," Jerry, what is he talking about? He's being ridiculous."
25299,KRAMER,123," Alright, look. Jerry, you know the whole story, you should "
25300,ELAINE,123, Yeah Jerry.
25301,JERRY,123," Well, I'm flattered that you would both appeal to my wisdom, but"
25302,ELAINE,123," Yeah, I'd go for that. Would you go for that?"
25303,KRAMER,123," Alright, I'm down."
25304,JERRY,123," Course, it would have to be someone who hasn't heard the story 
      "
25305,ELAINE,123," So, that's the situation."
25306,NEWMAN,123," Mmm. You present an interesting dilemma. Each of you seemingly 
      "
25307,KRAMER,123, Newman!
25308,NEWMAN,123," ...But, you must promise That you will abide by my decision, 
        no "

25310,ELAINE,123, Yeah.
25311,NEWMAN,123," Alright, let's begin."
25312,NEWMAN,123," (excited) Ooh, my cocoa!"
25313,KEN,123, Why can't we use Seven?
25314,GEORGE,123, It's my name. I made it up. You can't just steal it.
25315,CARRIE,123," Well, it's not as if Susan's pregnant. You've already postponed 
      "
25316,GEORGE,123," Hey, hey hey. Don't worry about me. I'm not a waffler. I don't 
      "
25317,KEN,123," Right, we're both big Mickey Mantle fans, and we love the name. 
      "
25318,GEORGE,123," (shouting) What happened to Soda?! I thought we all agreed on 
      "
25319,KEN,123," (emphatic) Well, we don't care for Soda."
25320,GEORGE,123, You don't care for Soda?!
25321,CARRIE,123," (worked up) No, no. We don't like Soda at all!"
25322,GEORGE,123," (shouting) How d'you not like Soda?! It's bubbly, it's "
25323,CARRIE,123, Oh!

25325,CARRIE,123, I felt something.
25326,KEN,123," Are you okay, honey?"
25327,CARRIE,123, I think I'm going into labour.
25328,KEN,123," Oh god, oh god. Okay, let's not panic. Let's just get to the "
25329,CARRIE,123, Okay.
25330,KEN,123," ...Alright? I got the suitcase packed, right here."
25331,GEORGE,123, What about Six?
25332,GEORGE,123, Nine. Thirt... thirteen's no good.
25333,GEORGE,123, Fourteen. (shouting after Ken) Fourteen!
25334,CHRISTIE,123," Are you okay, Jerry? You seem quiet."
25335,JERRY,123," No, I'm just a little uh, worn out."
25336,CHRISTIE,123, I know exactly what you mean.
25337,JERRY,123," Oh, I'm sure you do."
25338,JERRY (V.O.),123," What in god's name is going on here? Is she wearing the 
      "
25339,CHRISTIE,123, (horrified) Oh my god!
25340,JERRY,123, Oh.
25341,CHRISTIE,123," Ahh. I can't go to the movies like this. Do you mind if we 
        go "
25342,JERRY,123," Change? (thoughtful) Yes, I think that's a super idea."
25343,CARRIE,123, Are we almost there?
25344,KEN,123," Just keep breathing, okay."
25345,CARRIE,123," (deep breaths) Okay, okay."
25346,KEN,123, Okay.
25347,GEORGE,123," (to Carrie) You know, the thing is, I kinda promised the widow 
      "
25348,KEN,123," Now's not the best time, George!"
25349,GEORGE,123," (to Carrie) It's just that, I know her, and boy..."
25350,KEN,123, (firm) George! She's in labour!
25351,GEORGE,123, (angry shout) So am I!
25352,NEWMAN,123," Well, you've both presented very convincing arguments. On the 
      "
25353,NEWMAN,123," And, Kramer, you did provide a service in exchange for "
25354,NEWMAN,123, ...But I have made a decision. (revelatory) We will cut the 
25355,ELAINE,123, (shout) What?! This is your solution?! To ruin the bike?!
25356,ELAINE,123," Alright, fine. Fine. Go ahead. (standing) Cut the stupid thing 
      "
25357,KRAMER,123," No, no, no. Give it to her. I'd rather it belonged to another 
      "
25358,ELAINE,123," Yeah, yeah, y-yeah."
25359,NEWMAN,123," Not so fast, Elaine! Only the bike's true owner would rather 
      "
25360,ELAINE,123, What?!
25361,KRAMER,123," Sweet justice. Newman, you are wise."
25362,ELAINE,123," (frustration) But this isn't fair! Lookit, my neck is still "
25363,KRAMER,123," Well, tell it to the judge, honey. I'm going for a ride."
25364,CHRISTIE,123, Here we are.
25365,JERRY,123," (looking around) Ah, so this is the Fortress of Solitude."
25366,CHRISTIE,123," Well, I guess I'll go change."
25367,JERRY,123," Yes, change. By all means, change."
25368,JERRY (V.O.),123," August seventeen, nineteen-ninety-two. The same dress! 
      "
25369,JERRY (V.O.),123, There must be a secret stash around here somewhere.
25370,CHRISTIE,123, Ahem! Are you looking for something?
25371,JERRY,123, What're you doing? I thought you were changing.
25372,CHRISTIE,123," No, I, I'm thinking we should just call it a night."
25373,JERRY,123," No, no. C'mon, put something else on. It's early, let's go out."
25374,CHRISTIE,123," If it's all the same to you, I think I'm just gonna go to "
25375,JERRY,123," You know, I'm kinda tired myself. Maybe I'll just sleep here on 
      "
25376,CHRISTIE,123, (unequivocal) Jerry. I don't think so.
25377,JERRY,123, You wanna throw something on and walk me to a cab?
25378,CHRISTIE,123, (gesturing) Get out.
25379,JERRY,123," (pleading) Tell me what you're wearing tomorrow. I'll help you

25426,Elaine,126, So what are your parents doing here in new York?
25427,Jerry,126," Well, they were humiliated. I mean after the impeachment, 
              my father"
25428,Elaine,126, So what are their plans?
25429,Jerry,126," Well, this is the problem. They're moving into this new 
              development. "
25430,Elaine,126, You mean the three of them in that tiny apartment?
25431,Jerry,126," No, Leo's not there. He's got a girlfriend, Lydia. In fact, 
              he moved"
25432,George,126, Uncle Leo's having regular sex?
25433,Jerry,126," Yeah, I know. It devalues the whole thing."
25434,Jerry (answering phone),126, Hello?
25435,Morty,126," Jerry, what time do we have to be at the the Tonight Show 
              on Thursday."
25436,Morty,126, How long they been doing this?
25437,Jerry,126, 30 years.
25438,Morty,126," Helen, did you know that they tape this thing in the afternoon?"
25439,Jerry,126," All right, I'll see you later."
25440,Elaine,126," Georgie, how come your parents never moved to Florida?"
25441,George,126," Yeah, that is odd, isn't it?"
25442,Jerry,126," Yeah, it is."
25443,George,126," I mean, they're retired."
25444,Jerry,126, No economic reason for them to be here.
25445,George,126, They have no friends.
25446,Jerry,126, No social reason for them to be here.
25447,Elaine,126, You're all grown up.
25448,George,126," Yeah, they're all through ruining my life. What the hell 
              are they"
25449,Jerry (answering phone again),126, Hello?
25450,Helen,126, Where can I buy some ice? Your father likes a lot of ice.
25451,Jerry,126," I don't know, maybe get an ice tray?"
25452,Helen,126, I can do that.
25453,Jerry,126, You know Dad just called me.
25454,Helen,126," Yeah, I know. His phlebitis is acting up."
25455,Jerry,126," Yeah, all right, well I got some people here."
25456,Helen,126, Ok.
25457,Elaine,126, Ahh.
25458,Jerry,126," I'm used to a 1200 mile buffer zone. I can't handle this. 
              Plus I got"
25459,Elaine,126, They have no idea when they're going back to Florida?
25460,Jerry,126," The only way out of this is if Leo breaks up with his girlfriend 
              and has"
25461,Elaine,126, How's that gonna happen?
25462,Uncle Leo,126," It's about time you called your uncle. We've got to 
              do this once a"
25463,Jerry (to himself),126, Once a week? So how's Lydia?
25464,Uncle Leo,126," Ah, she's a real tiger."
25465,Jerry,126, I don't know how you do it.
25466,Uncle Leo,126, What?
25467,Jerry,126," A man like you, limiting yourself to one woman, I don't 
              know. But it's"
25468,Uncle Leo,126, What are you talking about?
25469,Jerry,126, Well...
25470,Uncle Leo,126," Look at this, I told them medium rare, it's medium."
25471,Jerry,126," Hey, it happens."
25472,Uncle Leo,126, I bet that cook is an anti-Semite.
25473,Jerry,126, He has no idea who you are.
25474,Uncle Leo,126," They don't just overcook a hamburger, Jerry."
25475,Jerry,126," All right. Anyway, the point I was making before Goerbbles 
              made your"
25476,Uncle Leo,126," Believe me, I thought about it. But she is so perfect 
              in every way,"
25477,Jerry,126," Well, keep looking."
25478,Peterman,126," I'm afraid I have some bad news, Elaine. It appears you 
              will not be"
25479,Elaine,126, What? Why not?
25480,Peterman,126," I'm afraid it's your urine, Elaine. You tested positive 
              for opium."
25481,Elaine,126, Opium?
25482,Peterman,126," That's right, Elaine. White lotus. Yam-yam. Shanghai 
              Sally."
25483,Elaine,126," Ihat's impossible, I've never done a drug in my life. Dr. 
              Strugatz"
25484,Peterman,126," Not a chance. I'm afraid I'll just have to find someone 
              else to"
25485,Elaine,126," Obviously, Mr. Peterman, there's something wrong with this 
              test. I"
25486,Peterman,126," All right, Elaine."
25487,Elaine,126," Oh, thank you Mr. Peterman. (Drinks a glass of water) I'll 
              be ready"
25488,George,126," Whew! Boy, it's cold outside, huh? Oh, these New York winters, 
              huh. "
25489,Frank,126," I was out for five minutes before, I couldn't feel my extremities."
25490,Estelle,126, What extremities?
25491,George,126," You know what the temperature in Florida is today? Eh? 
              Seventy-nine. "
25492,Estelle,126," So George, why are you here?"
25493,George,126," What, I can't stop by and visit my parents? (Drops pamphlet 
              on coffee table)"
25494,Estelle,126, What's this.
25495,George,126," That's where the Seinfeld's are moving. They got a great 
              deal. Yep. "
25496,Estelle,126, I don't bet.
25497,George,126," What about the dolphins? You could swim with the dolphins 
              down there."
25498,Estelle,126, I don't swim.
25499,George,126," You could pet them. They come right out of the water onto 
              the"
25500,Estelle,126, Are you trying to get rid of us?
25501,George,126," Rid? Nah, c'mon, the word is 'care'. Care. I care about 
            your comfort, be it here in Queens or twelve-hundred miles away            "
25502,Elaine,126, No?
25503,Kramer,126, Jerry? Jerry!
25504,Kramer,126," Wha, you too?"
25505,Jerry,126, Yeah!
25506,Kramer,126," These showers are horrible. There's no pressure, I can't 
              get the"
25507,Jerry,126, Me either.
25508,Kramer,126," If I don't have a good shower I am not myself. I feel weak 
              and"
25509,Jerry,126," You? What about me? I got the Tonight Show tonight. I'm 
              gonna have to"
25510,Kramer (leaving),126, Aw.
25511,Jerry,126, Where are you going?
25512,Kramer,126, I gotta find another shower.
25513,Kramer,126, They got you too?
25514,Newman,126, This stuff is awful! I'm not Newman!
25515,Kramer,126," Oh, Elaine. Yeah."
25516,Elaine,126," Kramer, you look terrible."
25517,Kramer,126," Look, I need the keys to your apartment, I gotta take a 
              shower."
25518,Elaine,126, What's wrong with your shower?
25519,Kramer,126, There's no water pressure.
25520,Elaine,126, Why don't you just go see Jerry?
25521,Kramer,126," Jerry's got nothing. Newman's got nothing. You're the only 
              one I know"
25522,Peterman (busting in),126," Not on my watch! (Grabs Kramer by the collar) 
              I won't"
25523,Elaine,126, Mr Peterman! What are you doing?
25524,Peterman,126," Elaine, you're out of control. You need help."
25525,Elaine,126, Huh?
25526,Peterman,126," I know what you're going through. I too once fell under 
              the spell of"
25527,Elaine,126," Mr. Peterman, I don't know what's going on here. I am not 
              addicted to"
25528,Peterman,126," Oh, Elaine. The toll road of denial is a long and dangerous 
              one. "
25529,"The price? Your soul. Oh, and by the way, you have til' 5",126,"00 to 
              clear out your"
25530,Helen,126, All they serve is chicken?
25531,Jerry,126, There's more food down the hall.
25532,Morty,126," Wrap it up, we'll take it home."
25533,Jerry,126," Oh, hi."
25534,Estelle,126, Hello Seinfelds.
25535,Morty,126, Hello.
25536,Helen,126, Hi.
25537,Frank,126, This is your dressing room? They treat you like Toscanini.
25538,Estelle,126," Oh, Jerry. I don't know how you could do this. I'm so 
              nervous for"
25539,Jerry,126," Actually, I'm drunk."
25540,George,126," Hey, hey, how was Florida?"
25541,Morty,126," Well, we just bought a new place down there."
25542,Estelle,126," I know, we were looking at the brochure."
25543,Morty,126, What?
25544,Helen,126," Why, you thinking of moving?"
25545,Frank,126, Not really.
25546,Morty,126," Because if you are, you shouldn't. There's nothing available 
              in that"
25547,Frank,126," Are you telling me there's not one condo available in all 
              of Del Boca"
25548,Morty,126, That's right. They went like hotcakes.
25549,Frank,126, How'd you get yours?
25550,Morty,126, Got lucky.
25551,Frank,126, Are you trying to keep us out of Del Boca Vista?!
25552,Jerry,126," I know this doesn't seem like work to any of you, if you 
              could perhaps"
25553,Elaine,126," How could I have tested positive twice? Once I could understand,"
25554,Waitress,126," Yeah, it's hard to figure."
25555,Elaine,126," I mean I lost my job, I can't go to Africa. I was gonna 
              meet the"
25556,Waitress,126," Ah, the bushmen?"
25557,Elaine,126, And the bushwomen.
25558,Man (also seated at the counter),126," Excuse me. I couldn't help overhearing. 
              I"
25559,Elaine,126," Yeah, I eat these muffins all the time."
25560,Man,126," Well, you know what opium is made from..."
25561,Elaine (as though receiving a revelation),126, Poppies!
25562,Jay,126," Welcome back. Talking with Jerry Seinfeld. Jerry, lemme ask 
              you, I saw"
25563,Jerry,126," Yeah, I got some family backstage. Course my family's nuts; 
              they're"
25564,Jerry,126," Hey, listen to this, Uncle Leo broke up with his girlfriend 
              because of"
25565,Jerry,126," Hey Kramer, my parents are gonna have to move back to Florida, 
              isn't"
25566,Kramer (halfheartedly),126," Yeah, well I'm really happy for ya."
25567,Jerry,126," Hey, you're not giving it to me, man. What's wrong?"
25568,Kramer,126," I just took a bath, Jerry. A bath?"
25569,Jerry,126, No good?
25570,Kramer,126," It's disgusting. I'm sitting there in a tepid pool of my 
              own filth. "
25571,Jerry,126," Well, you used to sit in that hot tub?"
25572,Kramer,126," Jerry, that was superheated water, nothing could live in 
              that."
25573,Jerry (offering a plate),126, Chicken?
25574,Kramer,126," Oh, yeah."
25575,Elaine,126," Well, this you're not gonna believe. I found out why I 
              was testing"
25576,Jerry,126, Poppy seeds!
25577,Kramer,126," Well, that makes sense. (Offers plate to Elaine) Want some 
              chicken?"
25578,Elaine,126," Yeah. Thanks. So, I'm gonna get tested again later, hopefully 
              I'll"
25579,Jerry,126, Hello Newman.
25580,Newman,126," Hello Jerry. Well, I may have a solution to our little 
              problem. "
25581,Elaine,126," Oh c'mon, Newman."
25582,Newman,126," I have a private matter to discuss with my fellow tenants. 
              (Opens"
25583,Elaine,126, Jerry?
25584,Newman,126," Look, sister, go get yourself a cup of coffee, all right? 
              Beat it!"
25585,Jerry,126, Not from the footage I've seen.
25586,Newman,126," Nevertheless, sometime this afternoon, behind the Market 
              Diner, an"
25587,Kramer,126, I'm down.
25588,Newman,126, Jerry?
25589,Estelle,126," So, Georgie, we have some big news for you."
25590,George,126, Big news?
25591,Estelle,126, We're moving to Florida.
25592,George (ecstatic),126," What? You're moving to Florida!?! That's wonderful! 
              I'm"
25593,Frank,126," Has nothing to do with the weather, it's because of the 
              Seinfelds."
25594,George,126, What do you mean?
25595,Frank,126," They don't want us there, so we're going. We're moving right 
              into Del"
25596,George,126, So you're moving there for spite!
25597,Frank,126, Absolutely. No one tells Frank Costanza what to do!
25598,George,126," That's right, who the hell are they? How dare they?!"
25599,Estelle,126," So, Georgie, are you gonna come to visit us?"
25600,George,126," Oh, every chance I get."
25601,Estelle (warmly),126, Ohhh.
25602,George,126, Jerry? Jerry! I'm busting! I'm busting!
25603,Jerry,126, What's going on?
25604,George,126, My parents are moving to Florida!
25605,Jerry,126, Are you kidding?
25606,George,126," Can you believe it? It's happening! It's finally happening! 
              I'm"
25607,Jerry,126, Where are they moving to?
25608,George,126, Del Boca Vista!
25609,Jerry,126," Del Boca Vista, that's where my parents are gonna live!"
25610,George,126, I know!
25611,Jerry,126, We could visit together!
25612,George,126, Every five years!
25613,Jerry,126, That's incredible!
25614,George,126," I know, I know and you know *why* they're moving there?"
25615,Jerry,126, Why?
25616,George,126, To spite your parents!
25617,Jerry,126, To spite my parents?
25618,George,126, Yeah!
25619,Jerry,126, Your parents are crazy!
25620,George,126," I know, they're out of their minds! It's fantastic!"
25621,Jerry,126, My parents are moving back too!
25622,George,126, Beautiful!
25623,Morty,126," I'm sorry Leo's moving back here. I'm not ready to go back 
              to Florida."
25624,Helen,126," He was getting along so well with that woman, what happened?"
25625,Morty,126, Hello?
25626,Voice,126, This is Frank Costanza.
25627,Morty,126, What do you want?
25628,Frank,126," You think you could keep us out of Florida? We're moving 
              in lock, stock"
25629,Morty,126," I'm sorry, we can't go back to Florida."
25630,George,126, I can't believe I didn't push for this sooner.
25631,Jerry,126," You have no idea how your life is gonna improve as a result 
              of this. "
25632,Jerry,126, Hello.
25633,Morty,126," Hello, Jerry? It's your father."
25634,Jerry,126," Oh, hi dad."
25635,Morty,126," Listen, is it all right if we move in with you for a little 
              while?"
25636,Morty,126, What was that?
25637,Jerry,126," Nothing. A bottle broke. That's all. What do you mean, you're 
              gonna"
25638,Morty,126, Because the Costanzas are moving into Del Boca Vista.
25639,Jerry,126, But it's a big complex.
25640,Morty,126," You don't understand, you gotta have a buffer zone."
25641,Jerry,126," All right, fine. Come over here. (Hangs up phone)"
25642,Geoprge,126, What?
25643,Jerry,126, They're not going back to Florida. They're moving here.
25644,George,126, What? Why?
25645,Jerry,126," Because your parents are going down there. My buffer zone 
              just went"
25646,George,126," Hey, I'm sorry, you had your buffer zone for many years. 
              It's my turn"
25647,Jerry,126," You know what you're doing, don't you? You're killing Independent"
25648,Leo,126, Move back with Lydia?
25649,Jerry,126," C'mon, you're lucky to have anybody."
25650,Leo,126," Last week you told me I was in my prime, I should be swinging."
25651,Jerry,126," Swinging? What are you, out of your mind? Look at you, you're"
25652,Leo,126, But she's an anti-Semite.
25653,Jerry,126, Can you blame her?
25654,Helen,126," You don't think he minds us staying here, do you?"
25655,Morty,126, Why would he mind? We're his parents.
25656,Elaine,126, Oh.
25657,Helen,126, Hi Elaine.
25658,Elaine,126, Hello. Jerry's not here?
25659,Helen,126, No.
25660,Elaine,126, Huh. (pause) Oh my god.
25661,Helen,126, What?
25662,Elaine,126," A poppy seed! It must have been in the chicken. Oh, I'm 
              dead. I'm"
25663,Helen,126, Why?
25664,Elaine,126, It's a long story.
25665,Helen,126," Just a second, I have to go to the bathroom."
25666,Elaine,126, What are you gonna do in there?
25667,Helen,126, What am I gonna do in the bathroom?
25668,Elaine,126, You gotta do me a favor.
25669,Helen,126," Elaine, I really--"
25670,Elaine,126," Hold on a second. Mrs. Seinfeld, I need your sample."
25671,Helen,126, You want my urine?
25672,Elaine,126, I need a clean urine sample from a woman.
25673,Helen,126, I don't know.
25674,Elaine,126," Oh please, Mrs. Seinfeld, please?"
25675,Helen,126," Well, what am I gonna do it in?"
25676,Elaine,126," Well, one of those glasses."
25677,Helen,126, Jerry's glasses?
25678,Elaine,126," Yeah, he won't mind. C'mon, you're his mom."
25679,Elaine,126," Yeah, a coffee cup's fine."
25680,Helen,126, Or maybe a juice glass.
25681,Elaine,126," Yes, fine, fine, a juice glass is perfect."
25682,Helen,126, This one is kind of scratched.
25683,Elaine,126, It doesn't matter.
25684,Helen,126, Howbout A milk glass.
25685,Elaine,126," A milk glass, a juice glass, any glass, just pick a glass."
25686,Helen,126, Jerry doesn't wash these very well.
25687,Elaine,126," Mrs. Seinfeld, pick a glass! Pick a glass, Mrs. Seinfeld!"
25688,Salesman,126," All right, I got everything here. I got the Cyclone F 
              series, Hydra"
25689,Jerry,126, What do you recommend?
25690,Salesman,126, What are you looking for?
25691,Kramer,126," Power, man. Power."
25692,Newman,126, Like Silkwood.
25693,Kramer,126, That's for radiation.
25694,Newman,126, That's right.
25695,Kramer (pointing to the largest one),126," Now, what is this?"

              about thi-"
25697,Kramer,126," Well that's what we want, the Commando 450."
25698,Newman,126," We'll pay anything. We've got the (hands a wad of money 
              to Kramer) "
25699,Kramer,126," He couldn't handle that, he's delicate."
25700,Helen,126, It's nice being back at Leo's Jerry's place was too small.
25701,Morty,126," First Leo breaks up, then he goes back. What the hell's 
              going on?"
25702,Morty,126, Who is it?
25703,Super,126," It's the super. We're installing new low-flow showerheads 
              in all the"
25704,Morty,126, Low flow? I don't like the sound of that.

              reinstating you."
25706,Elaine,126, Oh! Yes! What a load off. So when are we going to Africa?
25707,Peterman,126, I'm afraid I can't take you.
25708,Elaine,126, What? Why not?
25709,Peterman,126," Elaine, according to your urine analysis, you're menopausal. 
              you"
25710,Elaine,126, But I wanted to see the bushmen.
25711,Peterman,126," Oh, and one more thing. You may have osteoporosis."
25712,Jerry,126," Well, it's been a great visit."
25713,Morty,126," Jerry, I'll tell ya. The first thing I'm gonna do when I 
              get back to"
25714,Jerry,126," Well, at least the Costanzas changed their mind and decided 
              not to move. "
25715,Helen,126, George must be happy about that.
25716,Jerry,126, You have no idea.
25717,Frank,126, Take my swim trunks. I won't need them.
25718,Estelle,126, What does he want with your swim trunks?
25719,Frank,126, Why should they go to waste?!?

        a red-headed woman runs up and hugs him - taking Jerry by surprise)"
25723,SALLY,127, Jerry!
25724,JERRY,127, (Trying to ward her off) Hey. Hey!
25725,SALLY,127," (Reminding him who she is) Sally Weaver! (Sees Jerry's expression 
        - he still has no clue who she is) Susan Ross' roommate from college.. 
        hello! (Laughs slightly)"
25726,JERRY,127," Right.. Oh, I'm sorry. Uh, oh, so you saw the show?"
25727,SALLY,127," Saw it? I loved it! And thank you for the free tickets. You are 
        so funny."
25728,JERRY,127," (Modest) Oh, thanks."
25729,SALLY,127," (Serious) No, no, I mean it. You're very funny."
25730,JERRY,127, (Blunt) I believe you.
25731,SALLY,127," Oh, anyway, let me show you Memphis. I am taking you (Points to 
        him) out to dinner."
25732,JERRY,127," (Grabbing his coat) Oh, I'm sorry, I can't - I'm going straight 
        to the airport."
25733,SALLY,127," Ohh.. that's too bad.. Susan thought we'd really get along - I 
        guess because we're both wacko! (Jerry laughs) You know what, um.. (Turns 
        around, picking up a large gift from a table) You have to give this to 
        them for me. Okay? Here. (Hands the box to Jerry, he struggles under the 
        size of it) It's a wedding present."
25734,JERRY,127, Oh?

        to Del Boca Vista, Florida."
25739,GEORGE,127, (Resenting the fact. Nodding) I am aware.
25740,FRANK,127," So, I was wondering, would it be okay if I turned your room into 
        a billiard parlor?"
25741,GEORGE,127, A billiard parlor?
25742,FRANK,127," Regulation table, the hi-fi, maybe even a bar.. Give it real authenticity.."
25743,GEORGE,127," Well, that's.. Elaine!"
25744,ELAINE,127," Oh, hi, Frank."
25745,GEORGE,127," (Sliding over to make room for her) Sit down. Join us, please."

        I gotta get to the.. uh.. thing."
25747,GEORGE,127," (Somewhat stern) Oh, the thing's cancelled. Sit down."
25748,ELAINE,127," (Giving up) Okay.. (Sits, George laughs) So.. (Trying to think 
        up something to talk about) Frank, did George ever show you that photo?"
25749,GEORGE,127, (Confused) What photo?
25750,ELAINE,127," You know, the photo I took in Tuscany of the little man in front 
        of the sign that said ""Costanza""?"
25751,FRANK,127," (Interested) There's a Costanza in Tuscany? (Elaine nods) Did 
        he look like me? Did you talk to him?"
25752,ELAINE,127," I didn't talk to anyone - I was just walking by, and I saw the 
        sign, and I thought George might get a kick out of it."
25753,FRANK,127," I gotta get that picture - it could be my cousin, Carlo."
25754,ELAINE,127, Who is that?
25755,GEORGE,127," (Muttering out, not really wanting to talk about his family) 
        When the Costanzas came here, one brother stayed behind."
25756,FRANK,127," I played with him every day until the age of four - and then we 
        separated."
25757,ELAINE,127," So, you weren't born here?"
25758,FRANK,127," No. That's why I can never be president.. It always irked me. 
        That's why, even at an early age, I had no interest in politics. I refuse 
        to vote. (Yelling out) They don't want me, I don't want them!"
25759,GEORGE,127," I don't know what you're getting all riled up about. There are 
        probably a million Costanzas-"
25760,FRANK,127," (Cutting him off) Don't bring me down. (To Elaine) Do you have 
        another copy of that photo?"

25762,FRANK,127, The Maestro? What Maestro?
25763,ELAINE,127," He's this guy that I went to Tuscany with. He's a great guy, 
        but I just wouldn't feel comfortable calling him."
25764,GEORGE,127, Really? Why?
25765,ELAINE,127," (Explaining) Because he hasn't called me since we got back.. 
        I spilled wine on his 8 by 10 photo of one of his favorite Italian opera 
        stars."
25766,GEORGE,127, Who?
25767,ELAINE,127, You know the Three Tenors?

25778,KRAMER,127, What?
25779,JERRY,127," I bought a bottle of BBQ sauce in Memphis. I think the stewardess 
        broke it when she tried to jam it into the overhead compartment because 
        of this (Gestures to Sally's present) stupid thing."
25780,KRAMER,127," Well, don't press the panic button. I'm sure that we can still 
        salvage some sauce.."
25781,JERRY,127," I don't care about the sauce. It came in this funny little bottle, 
        and there was a guy on the label that looked exactly like Charles Grodin."
25782,KRAMER,127, (Taking some of Jerry's clothing over to the kitchen) I see..
25783,JERRY,127," No, you don't see - because I'm going on the show this week, and 
        this was going to be my bit on the show."
25784,KRAMER,127," Well, why don't you do your material?"
25785,JERRY,127, I'm out.
25786,KRAMER,127," (Looking up, sighs) Well, you better get to work."
25787,JERRY,127, (Sarcastic) Thanks for the tip.
25788,GEORGE,127," Hey, buddies."

        roommate, Sally."
25790,GEORGE,127," Oh yeah.. (Starts to open it) Sally called Susan - said you guys 
        really hit it off."
25791,JERRY,127," (Annoyed at the thought) Nobody hit anything off. She just gave 
        me the box. (Looks over at Kramer. He is scraping the BBQ sauce off Jerry's 
        clothes with a knife, then dipping some bread into it) What the hell are 
        you doing?"
25792,KRAMER,127," (Looks up) I'm salvaging the sauce. What's the matter with you? 
        (Eats the bread)"
25793,JERRY,127," (Pleading) Hey, hey, hey. Come on, come on."
25794,KRAMER,127," (Moving out into the living room) Jerry, why don't you do a bit 
        on Styrofoam?"
25795,JERRY,127, Like what?
25796,KRAMER,127," Well, uh.. (Starts to impersonate Jerry's act) ""What is 
        this stuff? Why do we need this stuff?.. And why do they make it so small..?"""
25797,JERRY,127, (Confused) Where's the punchline?
25798,KRAMER,127, It's all attitude.. (Makes a humorous face - mocking Jerry's)
25799,GOERGE,127," (Taking out a mat from the huge box) Well, this is certainly 
        a crappy gift.."
25800,JERRY,127, A door mat? That's what she had me lug up from Memphis?!
25801,GEORGE,127," Pretty chintzy, huh? Considering the money she makes.. She's 
        a big executive for Federal Express."
25802,JERRY,127," Federal Express?! Is she out of her mind? Why didn't she just 
        ship it?!"
25803,KRAMER,127," Look, it's personalized. (Holds it up, reading) ""The Costanzas"""
25804,GEORGE,127," No, no. Forget it. I don't want it. Let's just get rid of it."
25805,KRAMER,127," Well, maybe your father would be interested in that."

        table in my old bedroom."

        spooky. (Takes off his glasses, rubbing his eye) It's freakin' me out 
        man. And now I got to go back out there and pick up this doormat."
25869,JERRY,127, I thought you didn't want the doormat.
25870,GEORGE,127, I don't. Susan wants to have it out when Sally comes tomorrow.

        York?"
25872,GEORGE,127," Yeah, (Smiling) Susan said you'd be excited."
25873,JERRY,127," Excited? I'm gonna kill her! She knew she was coming here and 
        she made me carry that box?!"
25874,ELAINE,127, Who's Sally?
25875,GEORGE,127, Susan's college roommate.
25876,JERRY,127," It's because of her that bottle got broke that I was going to 
        give to Charles Grodin on his show."
25877,GEORGE,127," So call her up and tell her to bring you another one. She'll 
        be delighted to talk to you."
25878,JERRY,127," (While opening a cereal box) I will - don't worry. (Plotting revenge) 
        In fact, I'll have her bring up a whole case of the stuff. It'll be really 
        heavy. Let's see if she likes sitting on a plane with a big box on her 
        lap!"
25879,ELAINE,127, That's sounds pretty juvenile.

        in a game of pool.. Yeah, Frank here - he's got his own billiard room."

        you call it, Kramer?"

        a near-by pair of pants) It's an old conductor's trick I learned from 
        Leonard Bernstein."

25903,GEORGE,127," I tried! I almost threw it down the incinerator, but I couldn't 
        do it. The guilt was too overwhelming. (Grabs the doll, opening the door 
        to leave) Susan's so attached to this thing."

        over the scare of the doll. She moves into the apartment) What's that?

25912,SALLY,127, A whole case.

        toothbrush I was telling you about?"

25918,ELAINE,127, I don't want it.
25919,JERRY,127," (Slightly confused by her behavior) I don't understand this. Why 
        wouldn't you want to get something that's better if I'm telling you it's 
        better? And it's not a little better - it's much better."
25920,ELAINE,127, (Not committing to the conversation) It doesn't matter to me.
25921,JERRY,127, Come in.
25922,SALLY,127," (Peppy) Well, here I am!"
25923,JERRY,127," Oh, hi. Elaine, this is Sally."
25924,ELAINE,127, Hi.
25925,JERRY,127, How was your flight? (Wishful thinking) Pretty uncomfortable?
25926,SALLY,127," (Setting the box down on his table) Actually, the seat next to 
        me was empty, so, there was no problem at all."
25927,JERRY,127," (Let down) Oh.. (Starts to open the box) Oh, wait.. (Holding up 
        one of the BBQ jars) This isn't the sauce that I asked for!"
25928,SALLY,127," That's right. It's a special gourmet sauce. ""The Pride of 
        Memphis!"""
25929,JERRY,127," (Complaining) No, no. I wanted the one in the little bottle with 
        that guy on it that looks like Charles Grodin!"
25930,SALLY,127," This is much better. And frankly, in Memphis, we think that other 
        sauce as (Whispering) kind of a joke."
25931,JERRY,127," I know it's a joke. It's supposed to be a joke! Now I'm going 
        on the Charles Grodin Show with nothing. (Sets the jar down angrily) Nothing!"
25932,SALLY,127, You could just do your material.
25933,JERRY,127, (Peeved) I don't have any material!
25934,ELAINE,127, (Yelling out) He's got nothin'!

25936,DOLL,127," Georgie! Don't eat with your hands! (George starts eating faster) 
        Why do you eat so fast?! You can't even taste it!"
25937,GEORGE,127, (Losing it) Don't tell me how to eat!
25938,DOLL,127," You're wearing that shirt? You've had it for five years already! 
        Why don't you get a new shirt?!"
25939,GEORGE,127," (Trying to keep it down) Because I like this one! (Notices people 
        staring at him, he quickly gets up, collecting the his coat and the tiny 
        replica) C'mon, let's go. Let's go! (On his way out, he stops in front 
        of a woman blocking his path) Oh, hi.. (Embarrassed about the doll, he 
        sheepishly walks out)"
25940,WOMAN,127," (To Ruthie, the cashier) That man should really be in a sanitarium. 
        (Ruthie nods, agreeing)"

25943,FRANK,127, It's him! (Standing up) It's Carlo Costanza!
25944,KRAMER,127, Come on. Are you sure?
25945,FRANK,127, I'd know him anywhere.
25946,MAESTRO,127," I've seen that man in Tuscany. Eccentric fellow. Reputation 
        of being kind of a village idiot."
25947,FRANK,127, I still say we're related.
25948,MAESTRO,127," (Recognizing the currently playing song) Ohh, I love this piece. 
        (Turns it up, then pantomimes that he is conducting the instruments)"
25949,KRAMER,127," Alright, come on Frank. It's your shot."
25950,FRANK,127, (Complaining) I can't make anything..
25951,KRAMER,127," (Like a professional) Well, that's because you don't know how 
        to follow through correctly."
25952,FRANK,127, Follow through? What do you mean?
25953,KRAMER,127," Right here, come on, I'll show you.. (Gets behind Frank, holding 
        the pool stick with him) Take hold of your stick.. alright, bring it back 
        slowly.."
25954,FRANK,127," It's a little unnatural, but I think I'm getting the hang of it."

25958,ELAINE,127," Well, have you ever considered writing new material?"
25959,JERRY,127," Well, maybe if I didn't have so many people in my apartment all 
        the time I'd be able to get some work done."
25960,ELAINE,127, (Getting the hint) Me? Are you talking about me?
25961,JERRY,127, (Deeply sarcastic) No. You're never here.
25962,ELAINE,127," (Reflecting) Boy, that doll was really freaky, wasn't it?"
25963,JERRY,127," Yeah. Really. (Forming and idea) Hey, you know what? Maybe I could 
        talk about that on the show."
25964,ELAINE,127, What?
25965,JERRY,127," Show the doll - show the picture of George's mother.. it's pretty 
        funny. (Moving toward the phone) I'm gonna call them."
25966,SALLY,127, Hello?
25967,JERRY,127," Hello, Susan? It's Jerry."
25968,SALLY,127," Hi Jerry, it's Sally!"
25969,JERRY,127, (Disappointed) Oh. Is George there?
25970,SALLY,127," No, but he should be home soon."
25971,JERRY,127," Uh, listen, this is important. Tell him to meet me at the TV studio 
        with a picture of his mother and that doll that looks like her."
25972,SALLY,127, Is this for your comedy routine?
25973,JERRY,127, (Obviously resents talking to her) Yes.

        as he draws back) See? This is no good.. (Looks around the room. His sights 
        fall on the Maestro's baton) Hey, the baton. (Chalks it up) I got a hunch, 
        fat man, I can't miss. (Measures up his shot) 13 in the side pocket. (Does 
        just that) Giddy-up. (Moves around to the other side of the board, judging 
        his next move) Six in the corner. (Hits it in) This table's mine. (A series 
        of Kramer's plays are displayed, and, on the last ball of the game..) 
        You know where it's going.."

25980,ELAINE,127, Is George here?
25981,JERRY,127," Not yet. (Points over to a man sitting in one of the room's chairs. 
        Whispers) The other guy."
25982,ELAINE,127," It's.. .. you! It's really you! Oh, I'm such a huge fan of yours. 
        Would you mind signing this poster for me?"
25983,CARRERAS,127, My pleasure. (Reaches for a pen as Elaine unravels her poster)
25984,ELAINE,127," (As he is signing) Oh, thank you so much. (He finishes. Elaine 
        gives out a happy gasp) Thank you so much, Mr.. (Tries to read his signature) 
        Camaro. (Carreras gives her a look as he is getting up) Mr. Casea? (He 
        walks off as Elaine rolls the picture back up. Jerry gives his ""That's 
        a shame"" face) Well, whatever. (To Jerry) I'm gonna take this to 
        the Maestro. He's, he's playing at the Queens Convalescent Center."
25985,JERRY,127," (Joking around) Well, that's one hell of a gig. (Turning around, 
        he picks up a box labeled ""Ori-dent"") Hey, look, I got something 
        for you. The Ori-dent!"
25986,ELAINE,127," (Mock joy) Ohh.. thank you. (Accepts the gift) Huh.. (Struggles 
        under the size) Wha-- why does a toothbrush come in such a big box?"
25987,JERRY,127," Well, it's a delicate mechanism - It, you know, needs lots of 
        packaging."
25988,ELAINE,127," (Still trying to get a grasp on the package) How am I supposed 
        to carry this thing? (She looks up to see Jerry taking his pants off) 
        What are you doing?"
25989,JERRY,127," Well, I want to sit down."
25990,ELAINE,127, So?
25991,JERRY,127," It's a trick I just learned from Kramer. It keeps a crease in 
        the pants. (Folds his pants over the head of a chair, then sits down in 
        another. When he sees Elaine's staring at him, he makes a ""Tada!"" 
        gesture with his hands. Elaine holds her hand up - as if to say ""I'll 
        see ya."", and while she's slowly walking out Jerry gives her a salute)"

        you have been an extremely gracious hostess. (Kisses her hand)"

        leaves)"
25995,FRANK,127," (Holding up a picture) Here, take a look at this."
25996,ESTELLE,127," (Looking at it) Yeah, what is it?"
25997,FRANK,127, It's Carlo. I found him!
25998,ESTELLE,127," (Handing the picture back) You've been cooped up in this room 
        too long."
25999,FRANK,127," (Yelling out) You never support me! Let's see what George says 
        about this.. Where're my pants? (Takes his pair off a rack and leaves)"

26003,JERRY,127," (Surprised to see her, he gets up) Where's George?"
26004,SALLY,127," Don't worry, I brought your doll.. (Pulls out an extremely different 
        doll - this one resembles a baker) Tada!"
26005,JERRY,127, (Complaining) No! That's the wrong doll!
26006,SALLY,127," Jerry, I saw the doll you were talking about - not funny! This 
        doll's much funnier. Look, it has a little bowtie, and a cute little hat.. 
        I think it's a riot!"
26007,JERRY,127, (Slow whispering) This is a nightmare.
26008,SALLY,127," Oh well, I'll be watching. (Sets the doll down, then crosses her 
        fingers) Don't screw up. (Leaves)"

26013,ELAINE,127," I know you're very busy, but I just wanted to come by and give 
        you this."
26014,MAESTRO,127," Ohh.. (Looking at the box) Ori-dent - that electric toothbrush 
        I've heard so much about.."
26015,ELAINE,127," No, no, no. Not the toothbrush.. (Holds out the poster) this."
26016,MAESTRO,127," Ohh, what a sweet gesture. And autographed poster of my favorite 
        tenor, with.. those two other guys. Oh, Elaine, this is magnifico!"
26017,ELAINE,127," Oh, well, I just felt so bad about what happened in Tuscany.."
26018,STAGEHAND,127," (Yelling from off-camera) Maestro, you're on!"
26019,MAESTRO,127," Oh, Elaine.. wait for me after the concert? We'll celebrate."
26020,ELAINE,127," Oh, ok! (Picking up the Ori-dent box, she knocks over a bottle 
        of wine. It spills all over the poster)"

26022,SUSAN,127, I want to know why you took my doll out of the house.
26023,GEORGE,127, I just wanted a second opinion.
26024,FRANK,127," (Holding up the picture) Take a look at this. Doesn't that look 
        like my flesh and blood? Of course, your mother- (His attention is drawn 
        over to Susan's doll. Like George did earlier, he starts to imagine that 
        the doll is scolding him as his wife would)"
26025,DOLL,127," Oh, stop bothering everybody with that picture. It's ridiculous!"
26026,FRANK,127," (Walking toward the doll) Ridiculous?! I'll show you ridiculous!

26027,SUSAN,127," (Pleading) No, Mr. Costanza! No, no!"
26028,FRANK,127," (Holding out the head in his hand, he addresses it) There! Now 
        what have you got to say for yourself?!"
26029,GEORGE,127, (To Susan) I told you it looked like her..

26031,FRANK,127," (Sets a gift he's brought down) Carlo! It's me, Frank! (Attempts 
        to hug the guy, but he resists - pushing Frank away. He scolds Frank in 
        another language) I'm your cousin, Frank! Aren't you Carlo?"
26032,MAN,127, Carlo? No. Mi nome e Giuseppe.
26033,FRANK,127," (Realizing) What do you know.. Alright. (Picking up his present) 
        I guess I was wrong. (Walks off)"

26923,ELAINE,131, You left them in the car? How could you leave them in the car?
26924,JERRY,131, I forgot.
26925,ELAINE,131," Oh, go down and get them."
26926,JERRY,131, I can't. The car's at the mechanics.
26927,ELAINE,131," Ah, this is great. Alright, well, where is the mechanic? I'll 
      "
26928,JERRY,131," No, no, you can't. He's working on the car right now. You can

26929,ELAINE,131," (resigned) Ugh, okay, alright, fine."
26930,JERRY,131," Hey, Tony."
26931,TONY,131," Thanks for coming in, Jerry."
26932,JERRY,131, Sure.
26933,TONY,131," I think I know what's goin' on here, and I just wanna hear it "
26934,JERRY,131," Well, I change it so often, I mean to come all the way down "
26935,TONY,131," Jerry, motor oil is the lifeblood of a car. Okay, you put in a 
      "
26936,JERRY,131, I really wanna...
26937,TONY,131," Here's what I wanna do. I wanna overhaul the entire engine. But 
      "
26938,JERRY,131, How much money is this gonna cost me?
26939,TONY,131," (contempt) Huh. I don't understand you. It's your own car we're 
      "
26940,JERRY,131, The washer fluid is fine.
26941,TONY,131, (angry) The washer fluid is not fine!
26942,JERRY,131," Alright, you know what, uhm... I just wanna take my car, and I'm 
      "
26943,TONY,131, What d'you mean?

26945,TONY,131," Well, the car's on a lift."

26957,JERRY,133, New hairdo?
26958,ELAINE,133, (Looking up from a menu) Yeah.
26959,JERRY,133, You look like Brenda Starr.
26960,ELAINE,133, Is that good?
26961,JERRY,133, It's better than Dondi.
26962,ELAINE,133," Hey, my God, look at that. (Jerry looks over at the table. 
              A man and a woman are dining) David and Beth Lookner. (Leaning in 
              for confidentiality) You"
26963,JERRY,133," (Interested, still looking at the couple) Really?"
26964,ELAINE,133, Mm-hmm.
26965,JERRY,133," You know, I have a little thing for Beth Lookner."
26966,ELAINE,133," Well, I have to admit, I've always thought David was kind 
              of sponge-worthy. (Winks, making a clicking sound with her tongue)"
26967,JERRY,133, Yeah.. I've been waitin' out their marriage for three years.
26968,ELAINE,133," Yeah, me too. Well, I've been waiting out two or three 
              marriages, but this is the one I really had my eye on."
26969,GEORGE,133," This car out there is taking up, like, three parking spaces."
26970,ELAINE,133," Oh, (Laughs at George's misfortune) that's mine."
26971,GEORGE,133, You have a car?
26972,ELAINE,133," Well, my friend, Alyse, lent it to me for the week. She's 
              out of town."
26973,JERRY,133," (Noting) You know, I've never seen you drive."
26974,GEORGE,133, Me either.
26975,BETH,133," (Unsure as to whether it's him or not) Jerry? Elaine, Hi!"
26976,ELAINE,133," (Overly generous) Hi, David!"
26977,JERRY,133," Hi, Beth!"
26978,BETH,133," Oh, uh, George, (Introducing to two) this is my husband, 
              David."
26979,GEORGE,133," Oh, hi.. (They shake hands)"
26980,DAVID,133," Hello. So, George, uh, you're the one who works for the 
              Yankees, right?"
26981,GEORGE,133," Yeah. Why, what do you do?"
26982,DAVID,133," Well, I sell insurance, but Beth used to be Don Mattingly's 
              doctor."
26983,GEORGE,133, Really?
26984,BETH,133, Mm-hm.
26985,DAVID,133, Yeah.
26986,GEORGE,133," (Laughs slightly) A physician married to a salesman. (Chuckles) 
              Well, I gotta tell you, Beth, you coulda done a lot better than 
              him."
26987,[Setting,133, Jerry's apartment]
26988,KRAMER,133, Hey!
26989,JERRY,133," Hey. Hey, Mickey. What's going on?"
26990,MICKEY,133," I'm very nervous. I'm auditioning to be in the Actor's 
              Studio tonight."
26991,JERRY,133, Really?
26992,KRAMER,133," It's a method, Jerry. It's intense. (Clicks his tongue)"
26993,MICKEY,133, Kramer's going to be my scene partner.
26994,JERRY,133, Kramer?
26995,MICKEY,133," He doesn't have to say anything, he just has to sit there. 
              I'm playing a detective."
26996,KRAMER,133," Yeah, and I'm playing a business man accused of murder."
26997,JERRY,133," Ohh boy. Well, I gotta meet Elaine and run some errands. 
              So.. (Goes for his coat)"
26998,KRAMER,133," (Fixing up his pants) Yeah.. look at this, Mickey. These 
              pants are fallin' apart, huh?"
26999,JERRY,133," (Fishing for his keys in a kitchen drawer) You know, when 
              I first met you, Kramer, you used to wear jeans all the time."
27000,KRAMER,133," (Looking over Mickey's shoulder at the script) Yeah, well, 
              I was a different man then."
27001,JERRY,133," (Jokingly playing off Kramer's statement) With a different 
              body."
27002,KRAMER,133," (Slightly offended) Hey, I got the body of a.. taught, 
              pre-teen, Swedish boy."
27003,JERRY,133," Ehh, I dunno.."
27004,KRAMER,133," Now, what are you thinkin'? (Getting upset) You think that 
              I'm not able to wear jeans anymore? Is that what you're sayin'? 
              Because if that's what you're"
27005,[Setting,133, Elaine's car]
27006,ELAINE,133," God, it is so great to drive again. I miss it so much! 
              (Suddenly swerves to the right, then yells out of her window) How 
              about a left turn signal, ya moron?!"
27007,JERRY,133, (His thoughts) I'm so nauseous. She's the worst driver.
27008,ELAINE,133," You know what? On my first road test, I hit a dog. (Jerry 
              nods, blinking) I think it was a golden retriever. No, no, no, it 
              was a - it was a yellow lab. (Picks"
27009,MAN,133, Hey!
27010,JERRY,133," (Once again, the audience hears his thoughts) I'm so car 
              sick. I'm gonna vomit!"
27011,ELAINE,133," Oh my God! Jerry! My friend, Kim called - David and Beth 
              got separated last night!"
27012,JERRY,133, (Out of it) Huh?
27013,ELAINE,133," They're gettin' divorced! (Quickly breaks, stopping traffic)"
27014,[Setting,133, Monk's coffee shop]
27015,ELAINE,133," So, now, what is our move? What do we do?"
27016,JERRY,133," I don't know, but we don't have much time."
27017,ELAINE,133, (Agreeing) Mm.
27018,JERRY,133," The city's probably teeming with people who've been waiting 
              out that marriage."
27019,ELAINE,133, Right.
27020,JERRY,133," It's like when someone dies in a rent controlled building 
              - you gotta take immediate action."
27021,ELAINE,133," Yeeah, but David and Beth are going to need their grieving 
              time."
27022,JERRY,133," Their grieving time is a luxury I can't afford. I'm calling 
              Beth tonight, and if you want a clean shot at David, I suggest you 
              do likewise."
27023,ELAINE,133," (Nodding) Yeah, yeah.."
27024,JERRY,133, But we gotta make it seem like we're not calling for dates.
27025,ELAINE,133, Then why are we calling?
27026,JERRY,133," Good question. (More to himself than to Elaine) Why are 
              we calling?"
27027,ELAINE,133," (Loud) Oh! (Jerry has a surprised look) I've got it! I've 
              got it! We're calling just to say, ""I'm there for you."""
27028,JERRY,133," (Nodding, trying it out) ""I'm there for you."""
27029,ELAINE,133," Then, after a period of being ""there for you"", 
              we slowly remove the two words ""for you"", and we're just 
              (Makes a ""ta-da!"" gesture) ""there""."
27030,[Setting,133, Jerry's apartment]
27031,ELAINE,133, Hey.
27032,JERRY,133," Hey, remember Beth and David from yesterday? They got separated."
27033,GEORGE,133," Really? (Realizes) Well, you don't think it had anything 
              to do with what I said, do you?"
27034,JERRY,133, What'd you say?
27035,GEORGE,133," You know, that, that thing about her being too good for 
              him. I mean, I was just bein' folksy. They could tell I was just 
              being folksy..?"
27036,ELAINE,133," Yeah, I thought you were being folksy."
27037,GEORGE,133, Totally folksy.
27038,JERRY,133," hey, uh.. (Kramer walks around a little) what'd you get 
              there?"
27039,KRAMER,133," Uh, yeah, I bought Dungarees."
27040,ELAINE,133," Kramer, they're painted on!"
27041,KRAMER,133," Well, they're slim-fit."
27042,JERRY,133, Slim-fit?
27043,KRAMER,133," (Talking fast) Yeah, they're streamlined."
27044,JERRY,133, You're walkin' like Frankenstein!
27045,KRAMER,133," (Making his way toward the door) What? They just gotta 
              be worked in a little bit, that's all. (Pulling the door shut behind 
              him) Alright, see you later."
27046,[Setting,133, Elaine's apartment]
27047,ELAINE,133," (Mock sympathy) Well.. David, it happens."
27048,JERRY,133," Sure, Beth, these things happen. (Brief pause) So, have 
              you told many.. people yet?"
27049,ELAINE,133, Because it's really nobody's business.
27050,JERRY,133," Anyway, I just called to tell you that, I'm there for you."
27051,ELAINE,133," ""There"" is, um.. anywhere you want me to be.."
27052,JERRY,133," Sure, dinner would be fine."
27053,ELAINE,133, And I could just be there. (Adding) For you.
27054,KRAMER,133," Jerry, you gotta help me!"
27055,JERRY,133, What's wrong?
27056,KRAMER,133," I can't get my pants off, and Mickey's audition is in twenty 
              minutes! You know, I'm supposed to be a business man, I gotta be 
              in costume!"
27057,JERRY,133," Alright, alright. Uh, undo them. I'll help you get them 
              off."
27058,KRAMER,133," (Bracing himself on a bar stool) Yeah, I already did it. 
              It won't come off. The zipper's suck.."

27062,Jerry,134," I think that if the wedding invitations were left up to 
              the men, we'd just"
27063,Outside Melody Stationeries,134, 
27064,Susan,134, Hi.
27065,Clerk,134, Hi.. May I help you?
27066,Susan,134," Yes, we'd like some wedding invitations."
27067,Clerk,134, Ohh! Well...Congratulations
27068,Susan,134, (happily) Thank you.
27069,George,134, (mildly embarrassed) yeah.. Thank you.
27070,Clerk,134, When 's the wedding?
27071,Susan,134, June
27072,George,134, late June.
27073,Clerk,134," Oh! Well, we have quite a few to pick from ( turns around 
              and picks up a huge binder) "
27074,George,134, He..hmmm. humm...What about this one.
27075,Clerk,134," Hmmm,..to tell you the truth they haven't manufactured that 
              one for a number of years."
27076,Susan,134, Oh! no. George that's so ugly we don't want that.
27077,George,134," What's the difference you just read it and mail it right 
              back. These we'll do."
27078,Susan,134, Why don't they make'em anymore?
27079,Clerk,134," Well.. For one thing the glue isn't very adhesive. It takes 
              a lot of moisture to make them stick."
27080,George,134, So we pick up some Elmers
27081,Susan,134, (disappointed)All right. You see what I do for you.
27082,George,134, Hey! Kramer.
27083,Kramer,134, Hey! George.....Lily..
27084,Susan,134, No. Susan.

27089,George,134," It's coming Jerry, it's coming."

              stop it now. Nothing. It's here! It's "
27094,Jerry,134," why don't you just break it off with her. tell her it's 
              over"
27095,George,134, I can't
27096,Jerry,134, Why not?
27097,Jerry,134," All right take it easy, just take it easy."
27098,George,134, What about a letter?
27099,Jerry,134, A letter.
27100,George,134," I...I...write a letter and then I..I go to China. I disappear 
              in a sea of people for like"
27101,Jerry,134, That's it?

27107,George,134," Yeah! Yeah!..Staten Island . What about my clothes ,how 
              do I get the rest of the clothes?"
27108,Jerry,134, Aagh! You come back for your clothes 
27109,George,134, I'm not going back in there.
27110,Jerry,134, So forget about your clothes.
27111,George,134, Well I'm not starting up a whole new wardrobe now!!!
27112,George,134, If she'd just take a plane somewhere.
27113,Jerry,134," And what, hope for a crash?"
27114,George,134, It happens.
27115,Jerry,134," You know what the odds are on a crash it's a million to 
              one."
27116,George,134, It's something . It's hope.
27117,Elaine,134," Hey!...( sees George) HEY!! Georgie. You know what I just 
              realized; the wedding is like a month"
27118,Jerry,134, Euhh...Elaine....
27119,Elaine,134," What?...Oh! by the way. What am I going to be in the wedding 
              party?"
27120,George,134, What do you mean?
27121,Elaine,134," Well Jerry's gonna be the best man and Kramer's gonna be 
              the usher so what am I gonna be?"
27122,George,134, I don't know. I don't think you're anything.
27123,Elaine,134," Wel...I have to be something. I 'm a close friend....What 
              about being a bridesmaid."
27124,George,134, Those are Susan's friends.
27125,Elaine,134, Well then...aaahh how about being an usher?
27126,George,134, Well...I'll ask Susan about it later.
27127,Elaine,134, You don't ask.. You tell.
27128,George,134," ( to Jerry) What about the letter, should I think about 
              the letter?"
27129,Jerry,134," Hey Elaine if a guy wanted to end a relationship with you 
              . What could he do?"
27130,Elaine,134, Start smoking.
27131,George,134, Smoking.
27132,Jerry,134, Does she hate cigarettes?
27133,George,134," Yes, she hates cigarettes."
27134,Jerry,134, But you don't smoke.
27135,George,134, Nooooooo......
27136,Jerry,134," You know, I think I'm getting a little depressed about George's 
              wedding."
27137,Elaine,134, Really?
27138,Jerry,134," Yeah. Well once he gets married that's it, she'll probably 
              get pregnant, they'll move to Westchester."
27139,Elaine,134, Yeah! You're probably right.
27140,Jerry,134," Then it'll just be me, you and Kramer."
27141,Elaine,134," No! Not me pal. I can't keep this up much longer. I'm sick 
              of being single."
27142,Jerry,134, So it's just gonna be me and Kramer.
27143,Elaine,134, Yep! just you and Kramer.
27144,Jerry,134, See you ... me and Kramer...
27145,Kramer,134," Hey!! Buddy. I thought of a great invention for driving. 
              A periscope in a car, so you can see"
27146,Jerry,134," (annoyed) How you gonna drive when looking through a periscope? 
              Besides it's not a submarine"
27147,Kramer,134, Huh! You make a higher roof.
27148,Jerry,134, They're not making higher roofs.
27149,Kramer,134, why can't you make a higher roof.
27150,Jerry,134," Because it's a stupid idea. No one's gonna go for it. Don't 
              you understand It's stupid ,stupid..."
27151,Jerry,134," .....Stupid , stupid."
27152,Jeannie,134," Hey! Hey! Look out. (she pulls him back saving his life.) 

              OK!, Are you okay?"
27153,Jerry,134, Yeah!.. Thanks.Oh! my god you saved my life.
27154,Jeannie,134, Shouldn't there be some kind of reward for that.
27155,Jerry,134, oh! thank you.
27156,Jeannie,134," You know you should be a lot more careful crossing the 
              street like that, otherwise you could die.."
27157,Jerry,134, Well I...
27158,Jeannie,134, You see..(points to his collar) To me this is a waste.
27159,Jerry,134, What?

              are so offended they back out of the marriage."
27238,George,134, They are?... Elaine?
27239,Elaine,134, I wouldn't sign one.

27439,Elaine,138," Oh sure. Hey guys, I wanna make a toast. Um... Here's to 
              us who wish us"
27440,George,138, Sweet Fancy Moses!
27441,Kramer,138, You get the tickets?
27442,Jerry,138, Who wants two? Special sneak preview of Death Blow.
27443,Jerry,138," Kramer, do you know what I had to go through to get these?"
27444,Kramer,138," Yeah, I know, but he's a big fan of the genre. You know 
              I'd consider it a"
27445,Jerry,138, Yeah I guess I do owe you.
27446,Kramer,138," Uh, listen, do you want me to stay here until George gets 
              up?"
27447,Jerry,138," No, I'm okay."
27448,Kramer,138," There's no problem, really."
27449,Jerry,138," I'm fine. (George enters, Kramer exits) How was the party?"
27450,George,138, Food was good.
27451,Jerry,138, So I didn't miss anything?
27452,George,138," Well, actually you did miss one nugget of entertainment. 
              (Pause) Have you"
27453,Jerry,138, Elaine danced?
27454,George,138, It was more like a full bodied dry heave set to music.
27455,Jerry,138, Did she do the little kicks and the thumbs?
27456,George,138," What, you mean you know about this?"
27457,Jerry,138," For some time. It was about five years ago. I never knew 
              what to say to her"
27458,George,138," Well, sometimes you can't help these people 'til they hit 
              rock bottom."
27459,Jerry,138, And by then you've lost interest.
27460,George,138," Hey, you gotta take a ride with me later. I borrowed my 
              father's car. '68"
27461,Jerry,138, What made him get that thing?
27462,George,138," During that period when my folks were separated he went 
              a little crazy."
27463,Jerry,138, Not a very long trip. (Enter Kramer)
27464,Kramer,138, Brody's in.
27465,Jerry,138, I don't even have the extra ticket yet.
27466,Kramer,138," Well, you better get on the horn."
27467,Elaine,138," I'm tellin' you Jerry I'm gettin' a vibe. If I didn't know 
              better, I'd say"
27468,Jerry,138, How could that be?
27469,Elaine,138," Jerry, it's like the feeling is palpable. You think it 
              could have something"
27470,Jerry,138," No, George was there, he said he had a great time."
27471,Elaine,138," Oh, it's George. I bet you this is somehow George related."
27472,Jerry,138," Oh, what are you talkin' about?"
27473,Elaine,138," He's like a virus. He attaches himself to a healthy host 
              company, and the"
27474,Jerry,138, Now you're talkin' crazy!
27475,Elaine,138," All right, Jerry, if that's not what it is, you tell me. 
              What is it?"
27476,Jerry,138," (Makes sound) Oh there's my call waiting, I gotta get goin'."
27477,Anna,138, You have a minute to approve some copy?
27478,Elaine,138," Oh yeah, sure, sure. So, did ya have a good time at the 
              party last night?"
27479,Anna,138, It was a real... kick.
27480,Elaine,138," Hey, did you happen to speak to my friend George?"
27481,Anna,138, As a matter of fact I did.
27482,Elaine,138," Ah hah. Well, listen. You would be wise to keep your distance 
              from him."
27483,Anna,138, Why? He seems harmless.
27484,Elaine,138, Oh he's not. He's very harmful.
27485,Anna,138, Really?
27486,Elaine,138," Oh trust me. He's a bad seed. He's a horrible seed. He's 
              one of the worst"
27487,Anna,138, And you two are friends?
27488,Elaine,138," Yeah, we're good friends."
27489,George,138, So this Anna called me from out of the blue.
27490,Jerry,138, Really? I thought you were rebuffed.
27491,George,138, With extreme prejudice.
27492,Jerry,138, Maybe Elaine put in a good word for you.
27493,George,138," No, no. That's just the thing. Anna told me that Elaine 
              said I was one of"
27494,Jerry,138," Interesting. She doesn't care for you, then a stern warning, 
              suddenly a"
27495,George,138, I'm the bad boy. I've never been the bad boy.
27496,Jerry,138," You've been the bad employee, the bad son, the bad friend..."
27497,George,138," Yes, yes..."
27498,Jerry,138," The bad fianc, the bad dinner guest, the bad credit 
              risk..."
27499,George,138," Okay, the point is made."
27500,Jerry,138," The bad date, the bad sport, the bad citizen... (looks at 
              table as George"
27501,Jerry,138, Half of show business is here.
27502,Kramer,138, There's Brody. Brody! Over here.
27503,Brody,138, Hey Kramer. And you must be Jerry. Thanks for the ticket.
27504,Jerry,138, That's quite a feed bag you're workin' on there.
27505,Brody,138, It's for all of us. Is there a problem?
27506,Kramer,138," Brody, c'mon. He's just kidding. He's a joke maker. Tell 
              him, Jerry."
27507,Jerry,138, I'm a joke maker.
27508,Kramer,138," All right, here we go, Death Blow. (Brody takes out video 
              camera)"
27509,Jerry,138," (To Kramer) Hey, hey, what the hell is he doing?"
27510,Kramer,138," Relax, he does that all the time."
27511,Jerry,138, Does what?
27512,Kramer,138," He's making a copy of the movie for sale on the street, 
              huh?"
27513,Jerry,138, May I see you outside for a moment please?
27514,Kramer,138, But I want to--
27515,Jerry,138, Outside!
27516,Elaine,138," Hey, have you seen Anna?"
27517,Worker,138," Uh, she just went to meet your friend George."
27518,Elaine,138, To meet George? I knew it. Where did they go?
27519,Worker,138," The park, why?"
27520,Elaine,138," Don't you see? George is in the bloodstream! You stay away 
              from him, too!"
27521,Jerry,138, What do you mean he's bootlegging the movie?
27522,Kramer,138," Well, it's a perfectly legitimate business."
27523,Jerry,138, It's not legitimate.
27524,Kramer,138, It's a business.
27525,Jerry,138, Where did you meet this guy?
27526,Kramer,138," He's a friend of a friend. You know Corky Ramarez up on 
              94th Street? One day he and I are playing Pinochle--"
27527,Jerry,138, Kramer. (boom sound)
27528,Kramer,138," Man, we're missin' the Death Blow!"
27529,Jerry,138, I don't believe this. (They run into theater)
27530,Anna,138, You know I'm not supposed to be talking to you.
27531,George,138," No one's putting a gun to your head. Do I, uh, scare you?"
27532,Anna,138, No... a little. Nice car.
27533,George,138," Yeah, she's a sweet ride."
27534,Anna,138, Is that your orthopedic back pillow?
27535,George,138, Maybe.
27536,Anna,138, Well is it or isn't it?
27537,George,138, Guess not.
27538,Elaine,138, (To George) Stay away from her.
27539,George,138, I didn't do nothin'.
27540,Elaine,138, (To Anna) Get in the car.
27541,Anna,138, But...
27542,Elaine,138," You heard me young lady, get in the car. (To George) And 
              you, you should know better. I don't want you infecting my staff."
27543,George,138, Lighten up.
27544,Kramer,138," Go get 'em, Death Blow! (To Brody) You okay?"
27545,Brody,138," Uh, I got a cramp."
27546,Kramer,138," Well, it's no wonder. You ate that entire bag of candy."
27547,Brody,138," Uh, there it goes again. Kramer, you gotta drive me home."
27548,Jerry,138," Hey, what is going on over there?"
27549,Brody,138," Jerry, finish shooting the movie for me."
27550,Jerry,138, Are you nuts? There's no way I'm holding that thing.
27551,Kramer,138," Jerry, if the man is in pain..."
27552,Jerry,138," Yeah well, maybe if he didn't lick his fingers before he 
              reached in the bag we would've eaten some. Serves him right."
27553,Brody,138, (pulls out a gun) What are you some kind of tough guy?
27554,Kramer,138," Okay. Let's everybody just relax. Jerry, take the camera."
27555,Jerry,138," All right, I'm takin' the camera."
27556,Kramer,138," (To Brody) C'mon, let's go."
27557,Jerry,138, Oh man...
27558,Kramer,138," Hey man, so how was the rest of Death Blow?"
27559,Jerry,138, How was the rest of Death Blow?
27560,Kramer,138," Yeah, who got the final Death Blow, 'cause I thought that 
              Hawaiian guy had it comin' to him!"
27561,Jerry,138," Kramer, you make me get a ticket for this friend of yours 
              and then the guy forces me to bootleg the movie at gun point!"
27562,Kramer,138," He's quite a character, isn't he?"
27563,Jerry,138," You know, he came by here at 3 o'clock in the morning to 
              pick up the tape. I was scared out of my mind!"
27564,Kramer,138, I got it. Yep.
27565,Brody,138, Brody.
27566,Kramer,138, Come on up. It's Brody.
27567,Jerry,138," What are you, crazy? I don't want to see this guy again."
27568,Kramer,138," Jerry, you did him a favor. He probably wants to come up 
              and thank you."
27569,Jerry,138, What if I didn't do it right?
27570,Kramer,138, It's your first time. He'll understand.
27571,Jerry,138," People with guns don't understand. That's why they get guns. 
              Too many"
27572,Kramer,138," Hey, Brody!"
27573,Jerry,138, Hi.
27574,Brody,138," Jerry, I have to talk to you about the tape."
27575,Jerry,138, Yeah.
27576,Brody,138," I've never seen such beautiful work. You're a genius. The 
              zoom-ins, the"
27577,Jerry,138," Well, I did the best I could."
27578,Brody,138," I got another project for you. It's a movie called Cry Cry 
              Again. I was gonna give it to one of my other guys, but it's an 
              arty movie and quite frankly, they don't have the sensibility."
27579,Brody,138, May I use your phone?
27580,Kramer,138, Uh yeah. It's under the couch.
27581,Kramer,138, Look at you! You've got another gig!
27582,Jerry,138, I don't want another gig! I'm not doin' this.
27583,Kramer,138," But you have a gift. Jerry, this is not your little comedy 
              act. We're"
27584,Jerry,138, We're talkin' federal crime here.
27585,Brody,138," (To Jerry) I'll expect that tape by three o'clock tomorrow. 
              (To Kramer) May I borrow this? (Holding baseball bat) "
27586,Kramer,138," Sure, do you need a glove?"
27587,Brody,138, Nah.
27588,Elaine,138, What?
27589,Anna,138," Sorry, I got hung up."
27590,Elaine,138, At Yankee Stadium?
27591,Anna,138, This? It's mine.
27592,Elaine,138," Oh really? 'Cause it looks a little big for you. It looks 
              like something a short, stocky, slow-witted, bald man might wear."
27593,Anna,138, He's not stocky.
27594,Elaine,138, Who did that? Who did that?!?
27595,Kramer,138," (laughing) The French guy fell off the bike. Oh man, that's 
              precious. (eats popcorn)"
27596,Jerry,138," No, no, no, no, no, no, no! What were you thinking when 
              you shot this?"
27597,Kramer,138, That's fine.
27598,Jerry,138, Do you even know what this scene is about?
27599,Kramer,138, It's about a guy buying a loaf of bread.
27600,Jerry,138," No, bread is his soul. He's trying to buy back a loaf of 
              his soul."
27601,Kramer,138, Wha? Where?
27602,Jerry,138," Kramer there is no way you're giving this tape to Brody 
              and telling him I shot it."
27603,Kramer,138," Nah, he's not going to know the difference."
27604,Jerry,138," I don't care about Brody. I was up on 96th Street today, 
              there was a kid couldn't have been more than ten years old. He was 
              asking a street vendor if he had any other bootlegs as good as Death 
              Blow. That's who I care about. The little kid who needs bootlegs, 
              because his parent or guardian won't let him see the excessive violence 
              and strong sexual content you and I take for granted."
27605,Kramer,138," So you'll do the movie? (Jerry watches the movie Kramer 
              shot)"
27606,Jerry,138," I have to. But I'm gonna need to storyboard this whole thing. 
              Where are my magic markers?"
27607,Kramer,138, Right here. (Elaine enters)
27608,Elaine,138," Well, I have lost complete control of my staff. Why did 
              I let George go to that party? I mean, we were having so much fun. 
              We were wining, we were dining, we were dancing. (She starts dancing, 
              Kramer flips out) What?"
27609,Kramer,138, (He shows her) This umpf thing.
27610,Elaine,138, It's dancing.
27611,Kramer,138," No, no. That ain't dancing, Sally."
27612,Elaine,138, I dance fine.
27613,Kramer,138, You stink. (He exits)
27614,Elaine,138," He doesn't know what he's talkin' about. (Jerry fake laughs) 
              Jer? Jerry, I'm a good dancer, right?"
27615,Jerry,138, I forgot to make my bed. (He tries to get away)
27616,Elaine,138," Jerry, do I stink?"
27617,Jerry,138," All right, you're beyond stink."
27618,Elaine,138, But I really enjoy dancing.
27619,Jerry,138," And that's not helpin' either. That's why you're havin' 
              trouble with your staff, not because of George."
27620,Elaine,138, It's that bad?
27621,Jerry,138," Have you ever seen yourself? (She starts dancing) Ah, ah, 
              please, please. Not in my home. I gotta go throw this stuff in the 
              laundry. I'll be right back."
27622,Voice,138, I have George Costanza still holding.
27623,Elaine,138," George, hi. I have Anna here. There's something I wanna 
              say to both of you."
27624,George,138," Yo, Anna."
27625,Anna,138," Hi, George. What're you up to?"
27626,George,138, (Ironing) You don't wanna know.
27627,Elaine,138," Uh, well, listen. I feel really horrible about trying to 
              keep you two apart and I just wanted to apologize."
27628,George,138, What're you talkin' about?
27629,Elaine,138," Well, George, I just want you to hear me say to Anna that 
              you're a good and decent person."
27630,George,138," Pick up the phone, Elaine. Pick it up!"
27631,Elaine,138, I never should have given Anna the impression--
27632,George,138," Pick it up, pick it up!"
27633,Elaine,138," --that you're a bad seed, I mean, you're a fine seed."
27634,George,138," Elaine, get off the speaker! (Elaine picks up phone)"
27635,Elaine,138, What?
27636,George,138, You are ruinin' everything.
27637,Elaine,138, I'm trying to help. Why are you being so difficult?
27638,George,138," Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. That's it. More of that, difficult. 
              I'm a"
27639,Elaine,138," George, I don't have time for this. Uh, Anna, do you wanna 
              talk to George?"
27640,Anna,138," Um, no, I don't think so."
27641,Elaine,138," No, she doesn't want to. Okay, bye, George. We'll see ya."
27642,George,138, I'm a bad man!
27643,Brody,138, So where's the tape?
27644,Jerry,138," No, I didn't shoot this one. I'm just scouting the location."
27645,Brody,138, I need the tape.
27646,Jerry,138," You'll get your tape. But here's what I'm gonna need. I'm 
              gonna need three cameras, two on the floor, one in the balcony. 
              And I want headsets for the guys runnin' 'em. I wanna be able to 
              talk to 'em."
27647,Brody,138, Are you out of your mind?
27648,Jerry,138, Kramer...
27649,Kramer,138," I know, Jerry. It's okay. (Jerry steps aside) Yeah, look, 
              Brody. Uh,"
27650,Brody,138, Just shoot the damn thing so I can get it out on the street!
27651,Jerry,138," All right. That's it, I can't work like this."
27652,Kramer,138, Jerry...
27653,Jerry,138, I'm off the project. (He exits)
27654,Kramer,138, Jerry!
27655,Brody,138, I want the tape.
27656,Kramer,138, Yeah.
27657,George,138," Well, I'm the good boy again. Can you believe that?"
27658,Jerry,138, They think they can get anyone to shoot these bootlegs.
27659,George,138, Anna actually has respect for me now. It's all over.
27660,Jerry,138," Eh, the whole business has changed. It's all about money 
              now. The sad thing"
27661,Kramer,138," Listen, man. You gotta shoot this movie for me. Brody, 
              he's a reasonable man, but he's insane!"
27662,Jerry,138," Kramer, I'm not doin' this anymore. I don't know what I 
              was thinking. It's illegal, it's dangerous..."
27663,George,138, Did you say dangerous?
27664,George,138, I'm a bootlegger.
27665,Anna,138, You're a what?
27666,George,138," I'm bootleggin' a movie, baby!"
27667,Anna,138, Isn't that illegal?
27668,George,138, I can do hard time for this one. And community service!
27669,Anna,138, Is this your FiberCon?
27670,George,138, (Takes it and throws it out window) Get outta my way!
27671,Kramer,138," Jerry, George got arrested."
27672,Jerry,138, What?
27673,Kramer,138," Yeah. He went at the   Beekman, he tried to land, but they 
              cheesed him."
27674,Jerry,138, Oh now I see. (Buzzer) Yeah.
27675,Brody,138," Brody, I'm comin' up."
27676,Jerry,138, What're we gonna do?
27677,Kramer,138," Well, I gotta give him something. Come on, where's that 
              tape I shot?"
27678,Jerry,138," I think that's it. (They play it and see Elaine dancing) 
              Sweet fancy Moses!"
27679,Kramer,138," Jerry, she taped over the whole ending! (Brody enters)"
27680,Brody,138, Where's the tape?
27681,Jerry,138," Uh, well. It, uh..."
27682,Brody,138, Is that it?
27683,Kramer,138," Uh, yeah, yeah. Here it is, Brody. One copy of Cry Cry 
              Again."
27684,Brody,138, How'd it turn out?
27685,Kramer + Jerry,138, Uh... great.
27686,Kramer,138, Although the whole story kinda comes apart at the end there.
27687,Jerry,138," Yeah, out of nowhere there's this lone dancer who appears 
              to be injured."
27688,Kramer,138," Yeah, it's a disturbing image."
27689,Jerry,138," Yeah, so you cry... and when you see the dancer, you cry 
              again."
27690,Anna,138," (George is crying) It's all right, George. You'll just pay 
              a fine and"
27691,George,138," Why did the policeman have to yell at me like that? (Elaine

27693,Anna,138," Oh, Elaine, thanks for picking me up. I can explain everything."
27694,Elaine,138," All right. Well, we'll talk about it tomorrow at the office. 
              (Mr. Costanza"
27695,Frank,138," Okay, where's my boy?"
27696,George,138, Oh my God.
27697,Frank,138," I'm sitting at home, reading a periodical, and this is the 
              call I get? My son is a bootlegger? (He hits George in the head)"
27698,George,138, Ow! Dad...
27699,Frank,138," Who put you up to this, was it her?"
27700,Elaine,138, All right. Wait a minute. I think you've got it backwards.
27701,Frank,138, My George isn't clever enough to hatch a scheme like this.
27702,Elaine,138, You got that right.
27703,Frank,138, What the hell does that mean?
27704,Elaine,138, It means whatever the hell you want it to mean.
27705,Frank,138, You sayin' you want a piece of me?
27706,Elaine,138, I could drop you like a bag of dirt.
27707,Frank,138, You wanna piece of me? You got it! (They begin to fight)
27708,Jerry,138," But he's an old man, Elaine."
27709,Elaine,138," Well, he wrote the check, and I cashed it."
27710,Jerry,138," (Seeing a street vendor) Hey, it's the bootlegged Death 
              Blow that I shot."
27711,Elaine,138," Oh, Cry Cry Again, I wanna see that."
27712,Jerry,138, No you don't.
27713,Man,138, You shot Death Blow?
27714,Jerry,138, Yeah.
27715,Man,138, That was brilliant.
27716,Jerry,138, Thank you. (They continue walking)
27717,Elaine,138, You were big.
27718,Jerry,138," I'm still big. It's the bootlegs that got small. So how 
              are things at the"
27719,Elaine,138," Yeah, pretty much. Although I still get the vibe every 
              once in a while."
27720,Jerry,138," I wouldn't worry about it. (People on sidewalk behind them 
              are doing her dance as they go)"

              I think I may "
28181,Heather,142, You didn't' leave a hat here. 
28182,George,142," I'm pretty sure I left it behind the cushion of the chair 
              ..."

28192,Seth,142, That's not going to be good for business. 
28193,Jerry,142, That's not going to be good for anybody. 
28194,Jerry,142," If I'm gonna live over there, you gotta take some of this 
              stuff out. "
28195,Kramer,142, Mr. Marbles? He's harmless.
28196,Jerry,142," And one other thing, I don't want Newman using my... "

28234,Elaine,142, I thought he was Kramer's friend. 
28235,Jerry,142," Well, he called last night about 3 a.m. we got to talking, 
              he sells"
28236,Elaine,142, fourty bucks? Are they Sable?
28237,Jerry,142," No, but the difference is unnoticeable. "
28238,Kramer,142," Oh yea, I like this idea. "
28239,Elaine,142," Alright, lets give it a shot, lets go. "
28240,Jerry,142, Giddee up!
28241,Newman,142," It's getting cold, it's getting cold."
28242,Kramer,142, That was a close one.
28243,Newman,142, Why do we have to keep this a secret from Jerry?
28244,Kramer,142," If Jerry finds out I'm hooked on Roger's chicken I'm back 
              there with "
28245,Ipswitch,142," Ms. Benes the hat you charged to the company was Sable, 
              this is "
28246,Elaine,142," Well, that's a kind of sable. "
28247,Ipswitch,142," No, its a kind of rat. "
28248,Elaine,142, That's a rat hat?
28249,Ipswitch,142," And a poorly made one, even by rat hat standards. I have 
              no choice "
28250,Elaine,142," But, but, he's in the Burmese jungle."
28251,Ipswitch,142," Yes, and quite mad from what I hear. "
28252,Elaine,142, Wait? Can I fire you?
28253,Ipswitch,142, No. 
28254,Kramer,142, So Heather called? 
28255,George,142," Yea, but get this, the message said 'call me if you have 
              the time'."
28256,Kramer,142," No, but this is all very exciting. "
28257,George,142," She knows that I have her clock, I know that she has my 
              hat, I think "
28258,Kramer,142," Of course there's the possibility that you've gone right 
              out of your"
28259,George,142," I've looked at that, seems unlikely. "
28260,Kramer,142," I'd look again. So, how come you didn't call Jerry about 
              all this? "
28261,George,142," I can't talk to Jerry anymore, even since he moved into 
              that "
28262,Kramer,142, That's a shame. 
28263,Jerry,142," Seth, you're the manager, can't you turn off the sign?"
28264,Seth,142," Jerry, I lied, I'm just he assistant manager. "
28265,Seth (On loud speaker),142," Number sixty seven, family feast."
28266,Newman,142," Number 67, right here, right here! "
28267,Jerry,142, Hello Newman. 
28268,Newman,142, Hello Jerry.
28269,Seth,142, And don't forget your steamed broccoli. 
28270,Jerry,142," Hold it, Newman, you wouldn't eat broccoli if it was deep 
              fried in "
28271,Newman,142," I love broccoli, its good for you. "
28272,Jerry,142, Really? Then maybe you'd like to have a piece?
28273,Newman,142, Gladly. 
28274,Newman,142, Vile weed! 
28275,Jerry,142," It's Kramer isn't it? The greasy door knob the constant 
              licking of "
28276,Newman,142," Yes, now please. Someone, honey mustard. "
28277,Kramer,142," Newman, what took you so long, oh hey buddy. "
28278,Jerry,142," Expecting Newman? That's funny because I happened to find 
              him at "
28279,Kramer,142," Kenny Roger's? Whew, boy, I hate that place. "
28280,Jerry,142," He was buying quite a load of chicken almost for two people, 
              as long "
28281,Kramer,142," Oh hey Elaine stopped by, yea dropped off that Bob Sacamano 
              hat, oh "
28282,Jerry,142, I sure do miss my apartment maybe I'll switch back.
28283,Kramer,142," Oh you don't want to think about that no sir. Otherwise 
              I'd have no"
28284,Jerry,142," I don't think you will. As a matter of fact I'll save you 
              the trouble, "
28285,Kramer,142," Yea, yea go ahead put the banner up doesn't matter to me. 
            "
28286,Jerry,142, Alright.
28287,Kramer,142," No Jerry! I need that chicken, I gotta have that chicken, 
              you leave "
28288,Jerry,142, You got a little problem. 
28289,Kramer,142, Oh I got a big problem Jerry! 
28290,Peterman,142, Elaine. 
28291,Elaine,142, Mr. Peterman. 
28292,Elaine,142, You speak Burmese?
28293,Peterman,142," No Elaine, that was gibberish. So did you have any trouble 
              finding"
28294,Elaine,142," No, you're the only white poet warlord in the neighborhood."
28295,Peterman,142, Are you an assassin?
28296,Elaine,142, I work for your mail order catalog. 
28297,Peterman,142," You're an errand girl, sent by grocery clerks, to collect 
              a bill. "
28298,Elaine,142," Well, actually I do have a bill here, if you could just 
              sign this "
28299,Peterman,142," I'd be happy to Elaine ... but I will have to see this 
              hat."
28300,George,142, So how do you want to do this?
28301,Heather,142," Alright George I'll be honest, the first time we went 
              out, I found"
28302,George,142, So you really don't have my hat?
28303,Heather,142, What?
28304,George,142, Oh. let's go do something.
28305,Heather,142, What's in bag?
28306,George,142, That's a sandwich. 
28307,George,142, Damn salami. 
28308,Heather,142," My clock, you stole it!"
28309,George,142," That damn deli that is last time they screw up one of my 
              orders. "
28310,Jerry,142," Hey Seth, man it is coming down hard out there. "
28311,Jerry,142," Oh, gross. That's not gonna be good for business. "
28312,Seth,142, That's not gonna be good for anybody. 
28313,Kramer,142, Kenny? ... Kenny?
28314,Kramer,142, Kenny....
28315,Jerry,142, Home at last. 
28316,Jerry,142, Is someone there? Mr. Marbles?
28317,Elaine,142," Its the Urban Sombrero, I put it in the last catalog. "
28318,Peterman,142, The horror...the horror. 
28319,George,143," Say you, me, and Kramer are, uh, flying over 
              the Andes."
28320,Jerry,143, Why are we flyin' over the Andes?
28321,George,143," We got a soccer game in Chile. Anyway, the 
              plane crashes. Who are you gonna eat to survive?"
28322,Jerry,143, Kramer.
28323,George,143, So fast? What about me?
28324,Jerry,143, No.
28325,George,143," Kramer's so stringy. I'm plump, juicy."
28326,Jerry,143," Kramer's got more muscle, higher protein content. 
              It's better for you."
28327,George,143, Well I would eat you.
28328,Jerry,143," That's very nice, I guess."
28329,George,143," I still don't see why you wouldn't eat me. 
              I'm your best friend."
28330,Jerry,143," Look, if other people are having some, I'll 
              try you."
28331,George,143, Thank you.
28332,Jerry,143, Can I have a piece of that?
28333,George,143, No.
28334,Louise,143," George, I can't have sex."
28335,George,143, With me or in general?
28336,Louise,143, I went to the doctor today. I have mono.
28337,George,143, Nucleosis.
28338,Louise,143, Oh I hope it's not a problem for you.
28339,George,143," No, no, pff..."
28340,Louise,143," How long is this not gonna be a problem for 
              me?"
28341,Jerry,143, Six weeks?
28342,George,143," Yeah, six weeks."
28343,Jerry,143," Well, so what? you've gone six weeks before."
28344,George,143," I can do six weeks standin' on my head. I'm 
              a sexual camel. That's not the point. At least there was the possibility."
28345,Jerry,143," Well, so, are you gonna break up with her?"
28346,George,143," I don't know. I don't wanna be one of those 
              guys."
28347,Jerry,143, What guys?
28348,George,143, Like us. (Elaine enters)
28349,Jerry,143, Yeah.
28350,George,143, So it's just mono.
28351,Elaine,143," Mono? Huh, well, if anyone needs any medical 
              advise, Elaine met a doctor. And he's unattached."
28352,Jerry,143," I thought the whole dream of dating a doctor 
              was debunked."
28353,Elaine,143," No, it's not debunked, it's totally bunk."
28354,Jerry,143," Isn't bunk bad? Like, that's a lot of bunk."
28355,George,143, No something is bunk and then you debunk it.
28356,Jerry,143, What?
28357,Elaine,143, Huh?
28358,George,143, I think. (Pause as they all look down)
28359,Elaine,143," Look it, I'm dating a doctor and I like it. 
              Let's just move on. (Phone rings)"
28360,Jerry,143, Hello?
28361,Katie,143, Jerry.
28362,Jerry,143," Oh hi, Katie."
28363,Katie,143," Listen, something just came up for Tuesday 
              at the Dayton Civic Center. That's Ohio, Jerry."
28364,Jerry,143," I've heard of Ohio, Katie. But Tuesday's no 
              good. I'm doin' career day at my old junior high."
28365,Katie,143," Okay, Jerry. that's fine. you're the boss. 
              Katie works for Jerry."
28366,Jerry,143," Yes, all right, Katie."
28367,Katie,143, Sorry for the late notice.
28368,Jerry,143," Yes, bye."
28369,Katie,143, You're the-- (He hangs up)
28370,George,143, They asked you to do career day?
28371,Jerry,143," Yeah, it's no big deal."
28372,George,143," Oh with all due respect, I went there too, 
              and I work for a team that just won the World Series."
28373,Jerry,143, And you were integral.
28374,Teacher,143," Jerry, it was so nice of you to come down 
              here."
28375,Jerry,143," I'm on next, right?"
28376,Teacher,143," Well, unfortunately, Mr. O'Meary from the 
              Bronx zoo..."
28377,Jerry,143, The guy with the lizard.
28378,Teacher,143," Yes. Well, he started feedin' it crickets, 
              and the children just love him. And we're outta time."
28379,Teacher,143, So can you come back tomorrow?
28380,Jerry,143," I'm getting bumped? You're bumping me from 
              career day?"
28381,Elaine,143," So do most doctors like ER or do you guys 
              just think it's fake?"
28382,Ben,143," I couldn't tell you. You know, I'm not really 
              a doctor."
28383,Elaine,143," Oh, yeah. And I'm not really attracted to 
              you."
28384,Ben,143," Well, I'm serious, Elaine. I went to medical 
              school, but I still have to pass my licensing exam."
28385,Elaine,143, When do you take this exam?
28386,Ben,143," I've taken it. Three times. I almost passed the 
              last one."
28387,Elaine,143," Well, you're basically a doctor. Right? I 
              mean, people do call you doctor."
28388,Ben,143," Well, um..."
28389,Elaine,143," Well, can I introduce you as doctor?"
28390,Ben,143, Yeah.
28391,Elaine,143," All right, that's all I wanted to know."
28392,Louise,143, Mono. (George removes hand)
28393,George,143," It was fantastic, Jerry. We wound up talking 
              all night."
28394,Jerry,143, So you're enjoying the not enjoying.
28395,George,143," you know, just by conversing, you can really 
              learn a lot about a person. "
28396,Jerry,143, I'm finding that out. (Kramer enters)
28397,Kramer,143," Hey, buddy. How was career day?"
28398,Jerry,143," Ah, I didn't get on. The lizard guy went long."
28399,George,143, You got bumped from career day?
28400,Jerry,143," It was a mix-up, I'm sure."
28401,Kramer,143, They're trying to screw with your head.
28402,Jerry,143," Now why would a junior high school want to 
              screw with my head?"
28403,Kramer,143," Why does Radio Shack ask for your phone number 
              when you buy batteries? I don't know."
28404,George,143," Hey, hey. Kramer, what are you doing? You 
              can't smoke in here."
28405,Kramer,143," No, come on. (Larry the cook comes over)"
28406,Larry,143, Take it outside.
28407,Kramer,143," Come on, Larry. You know me."
28408,Larry,143," It bothers people, and it's against the law."
28409,Jerry,143," You can make all the laws you want, he's still 
              gonna bother people."
28410,Kramer,143," What, did they kick you out too?"
28411,Man,143," Yeah, they kicked us all out."
28412,Teacher,143," Thanks so much for coming back, Jerry. Care 
              for a graham cracker?"
28413,Jerry,143," No, let's just do it. (Fire alarm goes off) 
              What? What is going on? What is that about?"
28414,Teacher,143, Fire drill. Sorry. Single file everyone!
28415,Jerry,143, But I was promised this slot.
28416,Teacher,143," Single file, Jerry. (Jerry joins the line)"
28417,Jerry,143," Fire drill, can you believe that?"
28418,George,143, What is Pericles?
28419,Alex Trebek,143, Pericles is correct.
28420,Jerry,143," Like fire in a school is such a big deal. (Kramer 
              enters)"
28421,Kramer,143," Hey, you got any matches?"
28422,Jerry,143, Middle drawer.
28423,George,143, Who is Sir Arthur Conan Doyle?
28424,Alex Trebek,143," We were looking for 'Who is Sir Arthur 
              Conan Doyle.'"
28425,Kramer,143," Thanks. (Kramer leaves, phone rings)"
28426,Jerry,143, Hello?
28427,Katie,143, Jerry.
28428,Jerry,143," Oh hi, Katie."
28429,Katie,143," I heard what happened to the junior high. They 
              can't bump you like that. That is so unprofessional."
28430,Jerry,143," Oh relax, Katie. It's not a problem."
28431,George,143, What is Borax?
28432,Alex Trebek,143," Yes, you're right."
28433,Katie,143," They bump you in junior high, the next thing 
              you know you're being bumped in high schools, colleges, trade schools. 
              Before you know it, Letterman's not returning your calls. (Kramer 
              enters)"
28434,Kramer,143, Ashtrays?
28435,Jerry,143," No, I don't have any ashtrays."
28436,Kramer,143," Ooh, cereal bowls."
28437,Katie,143," Jerry, now don't freak out, I'll take care 
              of it."
28438,Jerry,143," No, Katie, don't-- (He hangs up phone)"
28439,Kramer,143," All right, thanks. (Kramer leaves)"
28440,George,143, What is Tungsten or Wolfram?
28441,Alex Trebek,143," We were looking for 'What is Tungsten, 
              or Wolfram'."
28442,Jerry,143, Is this a repeat?
28443,George,143," No, no, no. Just lately, I've been thinking 
              a lot clearer. Like this afternoon, (To television) what is chicken 
              Kiev, (Back to Jerry) I really enjoyed watching a documentary with 
              Louise."
28444,Jerry,143," Louise! That's what's doin' it. You're no longer 
              pre-occupied with sex, so your mind is able to focus."
28445,George,143, You think?
28446,George,143," Oh my God. I just remembered where I left 
              my retainer in second grade. I'll see ya. (He throws finished Rubik's 
              cube to Jerry and he exits. Kramer enters)"
28447,Kramer,143, Need some more matches.
28448,Jerry,143, What is goin' on in there?
28449,Kramer,143," I met some people smoking on the street, so 
              I invited them up to my apartment to smoke."
28450,Jerry,143, Why?
28451,Kramer,143," Well somebody had to. You know, just because a person's a smoker, that doesn't mean he's not a human being."
28452,Jerry,143, It doesn't?
28453,Kramer,143," Jerry, these people aren't just going to let themselves be flicked into the ashbin of society."
28454,Jerry,143, why not? 
28455,Kramer,143," Well you can confine them, you can punish them, you can cram them into the corner, but they're not going away, Jerry."
28456,Jerry,143," All right.
            "
28457,Kramer,143, Yeah.
28458,Elaine,143," So when they're handing you those cadavers, 
              do you get to choose whether it's a man or a woman?"
28459,Ben,143," I dunno. Dead bodies really gross me out. (Sue 
              Ellen Mischke enters with a man)"
28460,Elaine,143, Oh my God. 
28461,Ben,143, What's wrong?
28462,Elaine,143," It's Sue Ellen Mischke, this old braless friend 
              I hate. (Elaine tries to cover her face)"
28463,Sue Ellen,143, Elaine? Hi.
28464,Elaine,143," Oh hi, Sue Ellen."
28465,Sue Ellen,143," Oh Rick, this is an old, old, friend of 
              mine, Elaine Benes. Rick is a periodontist. He does Giuliani's gums."
28466,Elaine,143," Well, this is my boyfriend, doctor Ben Gelfen."
28467,Ben,143," Well, I'm an intern."
28468,Elaine,143," Hey, stop kidding me. He's a doctor. He's 
              a very good doctor."
28469,Woman,143, Carlitto's just passed out. Can anyone help?
28470,Elaine,143," Well, there's a doctor right here."
28471,Ben,143, No there's not.
28472,Elaine,143, Can't you at least tell him what to do?
28473,Ben,143, Like what?
28474,Sue Ellen,143, Shouldn't he elevate his legs?
28475,Ben,143, Right. Elevate your legs!
28476,Elaine,143," I hope Carlitto feels better. Ben really wishes 
              he could've helped."
28477,Larry,143, I thought he was a doctor.
28478,Elaine,143," Oh he is. Kind of. I mean, I call him doctor. 
              (She walks away and sees George sitting down reading books) George. 
              (He holds up his hand to signal her to wait a second.)"
28479,George,143, Of course. Absolute zero!
28480,Elaine,143, What? What is with all these books?
28481,George,143, I stopped having sex.
28482,Kramer,143," All right, I'll see ya Bill. All right, I 
              got room for two, but the only thing I have is in the non-filter 
              section. (Jerry enters) Hey."
28483,Jerry,143," Hey. Wh-What'd you got, a smoker's lounge in 
              there?"
28484,Kramer,143," Oh yeah, people really seem to be enjoying 
              themselves. You know, they come in once, it's like they're addicted. 
              (Katie enters)"
28485,Katie,143," Jerry, oh there you are. You didn't answer 
              the phone."
28486,Jerry,143, I was out.
28487,Katie,143," Oh. Jerry, great news. I got you an assembly."
28488,Jerry,143, An assembly?
28489,Katie,143," Two hours in front of the entire junior high, 
              grades six through eight. That's six grade, seventh grade--"
28490,Jerry,143," I understand. But what am I gonna talk about 
              for two hours?"
28491,Katie,143," And, it is already in the school paper. They 
              cancelled Rick James."
28492,Jerry,143, Superfreak?
28493,Katie,143, Yes.
28494,Elaine,143, What is your answer to number 74?
28495,Ben,143, Medobolic acidosis.
28496,Elaine,143," No! Hypocalimia, not medibolic acidosis. Duh!"
28497,Ben,143," Man, I'm never gonna pass this thing."
28498,Elaine,143, Oh yes you are. We'll just stop having sex.
28499,George,143," Guys, hitting is not about muscle. It's simple 
              physics. Calculate the velocity, v, in relation to the trajectory, 
              t, in which g, gravity, of course remains a constant. (Hits a home 
              run) It's not complicated."
28500,Jeter,143, Now who are you again?
28501,George,143," George Costanza, assistant to the traveling 
              secretary."
28502,Williams,143," Are you the guy who put us in that Ramada 
              in Milwaukee?"
28503,George,143," Do you wanna talk about hotels, or do you 
              wanna win some ball games?"
28504,Jeter,143, We won the World Series.
28505,George,143, In six games.
28506,Jerry,143," ...so if you like to tell jokes, and love to 
              make people laugh, stand-up comedy may be the career for you."
28507,George,143, Nine minutes.
28508,Jerry,143, How am I gonna fill two hours?
28509,George,143," Hello? I can take an hour off your hands. 
              Give the kids a chance to see a real live Yankee."
28510,Jerry,143," And give you the chance to see some real disappointed 
              kids. (Waitress comes to table)"
28511,Waitress,143, More coffee?
28512,George,143," Excuse me, darling, do I detect a Portuguese 
              accent?"
28513,Waitress,143, Si
28514,George,143, Das kaffes un salat e grand por favor.
28515,Waitress,143, Mute pragalas senor
28516,George,143," Eh, don't mention it."
28517,Elaine,143, Portuguese?
28518,George,143," Yeah, my cleaning lady's Portuguese. I must've 
              picked it up."
28519,Elaine,143," How come he's gettin' so smart? I stopped 
              having sex with Ben three days ago and I don't know no Portuguese?"
28520,Jerry,143, Are you all right?
28521,Elaine,143," I don't know. It's just the last coupla days 
              my mind has been, not good."
28522,Jerry,143," Wait a second, I know what's happening. The 
              no sex thing is having a reverse effect on you."
28523,Elaine,143, What? What are you talking about?
28524,Jerry,143," To a woman, sex is like the garbage man. You 
              just take for granted the fact that any time you put some trash 
              out on the street, a guy in a jumpsuit's gonna come along and pick 
              it up. But now, it's like a garbage strike. The bags are piling 
              up in your head. The sidewalk is blocked. Nothing's getting through. 
              You're stupid."
28525,Elaine,143, I don't understand.
28526,Jerry,143, Exactly.
28527,Kramer,143, Hey buddy.
28528,Jerry,143, Hey.
28529,Kramer,143," Hey, you should come over. Tonight's pipe 
              night."
28530,Jerry,143," What? What happened to your face? It looks 
              like an old catcher's mitt."
28531,Kramer,143, What?
28532,Kramer,143," My face is all craggly, it's crinkly."
28533,Jerry,143," It's from all that smoke. You've experienced 
              a lifetime of smoking in 72 hours. What did you expect?"
28534,Kramer,143," Emphysema, birth defects, cancer. But not 
              this. Jerry, my face is my livelihood, my allure... my twinkle!   Everything I have I owe to 
              this face."
28535,Jerry,143," And your teeth, your teeth are all brown."
28536,Kramer,143," Look away, I'm hideous."
28537,Elaine,143," Hey, Ben. I need a four letter word. Winnie 
              the blank."
28538,B,143, Pooh!
28539,Elaine,143, Pooh...(laughing)
28540,B,143," No, it's Winnie the Pooh."
28541,Louise,143," So the hospital called, turns out some stupid 
              intern screwed up my test. I never had mono. So we can... you know."
28542,Jerry,143, So what did you do?
28543,George,143, I told her I would have to think about it.
28544,Jerry,143," But ultimately, you're gonna choose in favor 
              of sex, right?"
28545,George,143," I don't know. Perhaps I can better serve the 
              world this way."
28546,Jerry,143," You mean, not subjecting yourself to your sexual 
              advances."
28547,George,143, Simple joke from a simple man. 
28548,Jerry,143, So you're never gonna have sex again?
28549,George,143," Well, Jerry. There was a pretty good chance 
              I was never gonna have sex again anyway."
28550,Jerry,143," So you ready for the assembly tomorrow? You 
              know what you're gonna say about the Yankees?"
28551,George,143," Oh, sports are so pedestrian. I've prepared 
              some science experiments that will illuminate the mind and dazzle 
              the eye."
28552,Jerry,143," I wrote a 20 minute bit about how homework 
              stinks."
28553,Jackie,143," My vacation was restful, splendid, magnificent. 
              In fact, next time I'm plannin' on going to Kofu."
28554,Jackie,143, Oh no.
28555,Kramer,143, Jackie we gotta talk.
28556,Jackie,143," No way, Kramer. You've brought nothing but 
              a mountain of misfortune and humiliation. Now get out."
28557,Kramer,143, But Jackie--
28558,Jackie,143, I said out.
28559,Kramer,143," Jackie, I think I gotta case against the tobacco 
              companies."
28560,Jackie,143, The who?
28561,Kramer,143, The tobacco companies.
28562,Jackie,143, I've been wanting a piece of them for years.
28563,Jackie,143," Did that cigarette warning label mention anything 
              about damage to your appearance?"
28564,Kramer,143," No, it didn't say anything."
28565,Jackie,143," So you're a victim. Now your face is shallow, 
              unattractive, disgusting."
28566,Kramer,143," So Jackie, do you think we gotta case?"
28567,Jackie,143, Your face is my case.
28568,Jerry,143, How ya doin'?
28569,Elaine,143, Not good. I'm a moron.
28570,Jerry,143," Well, don't worry about it. Once he passes 
              the test, you'll have sex again, and you'll be fine."
28571,Elaine,143," Well, that kinda brings us to why I'm here. 
              You got eleven minutes?"
28572,Jerry,143, What for? Oh come on.
28573,Elaine,143," I just wanna clear my head. It has nothing 
              to do with you."
28574,Jerry,143, I think it has something to do with me.
28575,Elaine,143," You could read the paper through the whole 
              thing if you want."
28576,Jerry,143," (thinks about it for a second as to reconsider) 
              No, no, no. I'm sorry, it's too weird."
28577,Elaine,143," Oh, all right. Is Kramer home?"
28578,George,143," You know, Louise. I think you'll find this 
              amusing. In early Euclidean geometry--"
28579,Louise,143," George, I have to have sex."
28580,George,143," I used to share that same outlook. But now, 
              I have so many things to occupy my mind. For instance, the atom."
28581,Louise,143," Goodbye, George. I hate you. (She leaves)"
28582,George,143," What a fascinating turn of events. (Waitress 
              approaches)"
28583,Waitress,143, Mais Cafe?
28584,George,143," Ah. Sim, por favor."
28585,Jackie,143," Miss Wilkie, your tobacco company has turned 
              this beautiful specimen, into a horrible twisted freak."
28586,Kramer,143, Who could love me?
28587,Wilkie,143," I disagree. In fact, I feel Mr. Kramer projects 
              a rugged masculinity."
28588,Jackie,143," Rugged? The man's a goblin. He's only been 
              exposed to smoke for four days. By the time this case gets to trial, 
              he'll be nothing more than a shrunken head."
28589,Wilkie,143," All right, Mr. Chiles. You'll have our offer 
              by tomorrow. Good day, gentlemen. (She exits)"
28590,Kramer,143," Bye-bye. Jackie, you did it. We're rich."
28591,Jackie,143," You better believe it. Jackie's cashin' in 
              on your wretched disfigurement."
28592,Elaine,143, Congratulations! You passed!
28593,Ben,143," Elaine, Elaine. I don't think we should see each 
              other anymore."
28594,Elaine,143," What? you're breaking up with me? But I sacrificed 
              and supported you while you struggled. What about my dream of dating 
              a doctor?"
28595,Ben,143," I'm sorry, Elaine. I always knew that after I 
              became a doctor, I would dump whoever I was with and find someone 
              better. That's the dream of becoming a doctor."
28596,Elaine,143," Look it, are we going to have sex, or not?"
28597,Katie,143," Okay, Jerry, now when the glee club's finished 
              singing, George goes on, then you. (George enters)"
28598,George,143, Hey.
28599,Jerry,143," Where have you been? You know, you're on next."
28600,George,143, I got lost on the way over.
28601,Jerry,143," Got lost? We went to school here for three 
              years."
28602,George,143," What are these? (Holds test tubes to his head 
              like antennae) Take me to your leader."
28603,Jerry,143, Oh my God. You had sex. You had sex with Louise!
28604,George,143," No, the Portuguese waitress."
28605,Jerry,143, The Portuguese waitress?
28606,George,143," I calculated my odds of ever getting together 
              with a Portuguese waitress. Mathematically, I had to do it, Jerry."
28607,Katie,143," George, George, you're on."
28608,George,143," No, no. I'm not going on. "
28609,Jerry,143, Then what'd you come down here for?
28610,George,143, Tell you about the Portuguese waitress.
28611,Jerry,143, It's good to have you back.
28612,Katie,143, One of you has to go on.
28613,Jerry,143," All right, I'll do it. (Goes on stage) Hey 
              kids. What's the deal with homework? you're not working on your 
              home! (Audience boos)"
28614,Kramer,143," It was a great lunch, Jackie. Thanks."
28615,Jackie,143," It's a little puzzling we haven't gotten that 
              offer yet."
28616,Kramer,143," Mrs. Wilkie, from the tobacco company called 
              me. We had a little pow-wow."
28617,Jackie,143," A pow-wow? Who told you to have a pow-wow? 
              I didn't tell you to have pow-wow."
28618,Kramer,143, She made an offer. I took it.
28619,Jackie,143, How much?
28620,Kramer,143," No, no, no. There was no money."
28621,Jackie,143, No money? Then what'd we get?
28622,Kramer,143," Check it out. (They see a Marlboro man billboard 
              with Kramer on it)"
28623,Jackie,143, This is the most public yet of my many humiliations.
28624,Jerry,143," Cancelled? But I was supposed to be on tomorrow 
              night."
28625,Letterman,143," Yeah, but then, you know, some people were 
              telling me about that little flap out there at the junior high assembly. 
              And before that, you were bumped by a lizard?"
28626,Jerry,143," Actually, it was a ********."
28627,Letterman,143," those things, deadly dangerous. A long 
              time ago my uncle and a date are driving, like, through Mexico. 
              They see one on the road, drags him out of the road, and chews his 
              face off. Listen, we'll call you if anything opens up. Okay, Jimmy?"
28628,Jerry,143, Jerry.
28629,Letterman,143, Right. Jerry.

28636,JERRY,144, (Gets up) Get out!
28637,GEORGE,144," I'm out! Fantastic apartment right across 
              from mine, huh. I can't wait for you to see it."
28638,JERRY,144," (Looks around his apartment) Is it better than 
              mine?"
28639,GEORGE,144, (Definite) Oh yeah.
28640,JERRY,144," So, it's a two-bedroom-one-bath-make-your-friends-hate-ya?"
28641,GEORGE,144," You know what? it's better than Elaine's, 
              too. I gotta give her a call. (Moves tward the phone)"
28642,JERRY,144, She's out.
28643,GEORGE,144," (Stops) Oh right, the blind date."
28644,JERRY,144," Yeah, well, they like to call it a set-up now. 
              I guess the blind people don't like being associated with all those 
              losers."
28645,GEORGE,144," Come on. Come check out my new place. It'll 
              take you two minutes."
28646,JERRY,144, I can't. I'm meeting Kramer down at my mini-storage.
28647,GEORGE,144," (Gloating) Hey, you got any extra furniture 
              down there? I need some more stuff to fill that extra bedroom with 
              the walk-in closet. (Smiles)"
28648,JERRY,144," (Grabs his coat) Oh, this is really annoying."

              (Both exit)"
28650,[Setting,144, Manhattan Mini-storage]
28651,JERRY,144, (Disgusted) What is with that?!
28652,KRAMER,144," Well, it's coughing, Jerry. It expells the 
              diseased germs out of the body, into the air. (Makes a guesture 
              of germs being in the air)"
28653,JERRY,144," (Takes out his key to unlock the unit door) 
              Where is your key?"
28654,KRAMER,144," Yeah, well, uh, Newman. He's - he's got it."
28655,JERRY,144," You know, Kramer, I rented out half of my space 
              to you."
28656,KRAMER,144," Yeah, and I rented out half that space to 
              Newman. (Starts coughing again)"
28657,JERRY,144," (Picks one up) Mail bags? He's storing mail 
              in here?"
28658,KRAMER,144, (Looks at the bags on the floor) Evidently.

28660,RICARDI,144," Excuse me, George?"
28661,GEORGE,144," (Looks at her) Yeah, uh, no menus. (Waves 
              her off)"
28662,RICARDI,144," (Moves into the apartment, hand out) No, 
              I'm Mrs. Ricardi - president of the tenant's association."
28663,GEORGE,144," Oh, right! (Shakes her hand) Right! Hey, hey.. 
              I love the floors in here. It's like a gymnasium in here! Try and 
              guard me! (Dribbles an imaginary ball"
28664,RICARDI,144," No, no.. (Laughs nervously) Uh, George, unfortunately, 
              Clarance Eldridge in 8C has decided that he wants the apartment."
28665,GEORGE,144," (Let down) Yeah, but you - you promised it 
              to me."
28666,RICARDI,144," Yes, but, you see - Mister Eldridge is an 
              Andrea Doria survivor. And, in light of the terrible suffering that 
              he's already been through, we've decided to"
28667,GEORGE,144," (Depressed) Well,.. the Andrea Doria.. that 
              was quite a fire. (Moves to the door, leaving)"

28673,ELAINE,144, Yeah?

28675,ELAINE,144, (Shocked) Stabbed?!
28676,WAITER,144, More bread?
28677,[Setting,144, Jerry's apartment]
28678,JERRY,144, (Talking to Elaine) You ate more bread?
28679,ELAINE,144, That is not the point! The guy was stabbed!
28680,JERRY,144, Did you find out who stabbed him?
28681,ELAINE,144," Yeah, (Nodding) It turns out it was his ex-girlfriend."
28682,JERRY,144," (Like a father) Well, you're not going near 
              this hooligan anymore."
28683,ELAINE,144," Well, I don't know.. I mean, think about it, 
              Jerry. There must be something exciting about this guy if he can 
              arouse that kind of passion. (Obviously turned"
28684,JERRY,144," (Sarcastic) Yeah, too bad he didn't get shot. 
              He could have been the one."

              date on this.. (Opens it, then starts coughing directly onto the 
              food)"
28688,JERRY,144," There is now. Kramer, you should really get 
              that cough checked out by a doctor."
28689,KRAMER,144," (Shrugging it off) Nah, no, no, no. No doctors 
              for me. A bunch of lackeys and yes-men all towing the company line..

28693,JERRY,144, Hey. How's the new place?!
28694,GEORGE,144," Gone. (Moves over to a chair in the living 
              room. Kramer takes the carton of food to the table, and begins eating) 
              The tenant association made me give it"
28695,ELAINE,144," Andrea Doria? Isn't that the one they did 
              the song about?"
28696,JERRY,144, (Correcting her) Edmund Fitzgerald.
28697,ELIANE,144, I love Edmund Fitzgerald's voice.
28698,JERRY,144," (Gives Elaine a look) No, Gordon Lightfoot 
              was the singer. Edmund Fitzgerald was the ship."
28699,GEORGE,144," (Talking about his would-be apartment) You 
              could fit 15 people in that bathroom.."
28700,ELAINE,144, I think Gordon Lightfoot was the boat.
28701,JERRY,144," (Sarcastic) Yeah, and it was rammed by the 
              Cat Stevens."
28702,KRAMER,144," (Like a teacher) The Andrea Doria collided 
              with the Stockholm in dense fog 21 miles off the coast of Nantucket.

28704,KRAMER,144," it's in my book - ""Astonishing Tales 
              of the Sea"" 51 people died."
28705,GEORGE,144, 51 people?!
28706,KRAMER,144," That's it?! I thought it was, like, a thousand!"
28707,KRAMER,144," There were 1,650 survivors."
28708,GEORGE,144," That's no tragedy! How many people do you 
              lose on a normal cruse? 30? 40?! Kramer, can I take a look at that 
              book? (Starts walking tward the door."

              Attacks"""
28710,JERRY,144," Hey, uh, before you go, did you talk to Newman 
              about getting that mail outta there?"

28715,JERRY,144," Listen, I want you to get the mail outta my 
              storage unit."
28716,NEWMAN,144, Sometimes we don't get what we want.
28717,JERRY,144, (Confused) What are you talking about?
28718,NEWMAN,144, I didn't get my transfer.
28719,JERRY,144," ""Transfer""?"
28720,NEWMAN,144," To Hawaii. The most sought-after postal route 
              of them all. The air is so dewy-sweet you don't even have to like 
              the stamps.. But it's not to be - So, I'm"
28721,JERRY,144, You quit the post office?
28722,NEWMAN,144," Kind of. I'm still collecting checks, I'm 
              just not delivering mail."
28723,JERRY,144," Well, get it out of my storage. It's illegal."
28724,NEWMAN,144," And yet, it's perfectly legal to take a man's 
              soul and crush it out like a stale Pall Mall."

              happened there with the stabbing?"
28733,ALAN,144," Just.. one of those things, you know."
28734,ELAINE,144," What? Was she just so crazy in love with you 
              that she just couldn't take it anymore? Or..?"

              the one who set us up - I found out, he's a bad-breaker-upper."

28744,ELAINE,144," (Fast) Well, you know when you break up, how 
              you say things you don't mean? Well, he says the mean things you 
              don't mean, but he means them."
28745,JERRY,144, (Nods) I follow. So what are you gonna do?
28746,ELAINE,144," Dump him. I can't be with someone who doesn't 
              break up nicely. I mean, to me, that's one of the most important

28890,JERRY,144, What?
28891,NEWMAN,144," That was the Vice President of the post office. 
              I didn't get the transfer.. They knew it wasn't me doing my route!"
28892,JERRY,144, How did they know?!
28893,NEWMAN,144," (Stands up) Too many people go their mail! 
              Close to 80%. No body from the post office has ever cracked the 
              50% barrier! It's like the 3-minute mile!"
28894,JERRY,144, (Pleading) I tried my best!

28905,GEORGE,144, They're making their decision today.
28906,JERRY,144, What's the matter with you?

              I have to do is call him up, and sit with him, and show him that

28937,JERRY,145," So what happened to you yesterday? We were supposed to go to the 
        auto show, I waited for you, you never came."
28938,ELAINE,145," I'm sorry, I got really busy. How long did you wait?"
28939,JERRY,145, Five minutes. 
28940,ELAINE,145, Five minutes? That's it?
28941,JERRY,145, What's the difference? You never showed up.
28942,ELAINE,145," I could've! I mean, last week we waited for that friend of Kramer's 
        for like, forty minutes."
28943,JERRY,145," Well, we barely knew the guy."
28944,ELAINE,145," So, the longer you know someone, the shorter you wait for 'em."
28945,JERRY,145, That's the way it works.
28946,ELAINE,145, When did you tell George to be here?
28947,JERRY,145, I told him to meet us here in ten minutes. How long has it been?
28948,ELAINE,145, About five.
28949,JERRY,145, That's enough. <They leave. George comes around the corner.>
28950,GEORGE (looks at his watch),145, Early! Alright! <shivers.> Cold.
28951,KRAMER,145," So, I noticed you bounced a check at the bodega."
28952,JERRY,145, How did you know about that?
28953,KRAMER,145," Because Marcelino, he taped it up on his cash register with all 
        the other bad checks."
28954,JERRY,145, He can't do that.
28955,KRAMER (sternly),145," It's the only way you'll learn. (Tastes his eggs.) 
        Aw, these eggs are disgusting. This chicken should be ashamed of himself.

28956,GEORGE,145, Fantastic day! Fantastic!

28958,GEORGE,145," Well, first, I'm brushing my teeth and this piece of apple-skin, 
        that must have been lodged in there for days, comes loose."
28959,JERRY,145, Fantastic.
28960,GEORGE,145," Then, I'm at The Foundation..."
28961,JERRY,145, You're still doing that?
28962,GEORGE,145," Sometimes, once in a while."
28963,JERRY,145, When you feel guilty.
28964,GEORGE,145," No, occasionally I'll forget to let the machine pick up. Anyway, 
        they made this large donation to a women's prison, and I get to go down 
        there and check it out."
28965,KRAMER,145, That's caged heat.
28966,GEORGE,145, Yeah-hah!
28967,JERRY,145, What are you gonna do there?
28968,GEORGE,145," Nothing really, you know...just stroll around the cell blocks, 
        maybe take in a shower fight. (chuckles.) Hey, you know you got a bounced 
        check hanging up in the little market over on Columbus?"
28969,JERRY,145," Yes, I know, I know."
28970,GEORGE,145," I noticed you chose the ""clowns with balloons"" check 
        design."
28971,JERRY,145," It was a mistake, the bank sent me the wrong ones."

        me?"

28978,JERRY,145, Is he from the future?
28979,ELAINE,145," No, he just shaves his head. I think it's pretty gutsy."
28980,GEORGE,145," Listen, sweetheart, let me tell you a little something about 
        guts. <Points to his head.> This is guts."
28981,ELAINE,145, What? Clinging to some scraps?
28982,GEORGE,145," These are not ""scraps."" These are historic remains 
        of a once great society of hair."

        a clown check!"

        another twenty for your trouble."

28992,MARCELINO,145, Even I am not above the policy.

        fights?"
28995,BETSY,145," There's no fights here, Mr. Costanza. This is a minimum security 
        facility."
28996,GEORGE,145," Hmm. What about a hole? You ever put anybody in ""the box""?"
28997,BETSY,145, No.

        to your generous donation. This is Celia Morgan, our librarian."

        another person in the library dressed the same as Celia.> So uh, you 
        two shop at the same store?"
29007,CELIA,145," No, it's standard issue."
29008,GEORGE,145, Oh my God...you're in jail? <Celia nods.> That is so cool!

29010,GEORGE,145," Well...not ""out."" She's in prison."
29011,JERRY,145, How could you ask her out?
29012,GEORGE,145, Why not?
29013,JERRY,145," I remember when you wouldn't date that girl who lived in Queens 
        because you didn't want to go over the bridge!"
29014,GEORGE,145, That was different! 
29015,JERRY,145, I'll say.
29016,GEORGE,145," Jerry, I like being with her. Plus, I know where she is all the 
        time. I have relatively no competition. And you know how you live in fear 
        of the pop-in?"
29017,JERRY (shudders),145, The pop-in.
29018,GEORGE,145," Yeah, no pop-in, no ""in the neighborhood,"" no ""I 
        saw your light was on."" And the best part is, if things go really 
        well..."
29019,JERRY,145, Conjugal visit?
29020,GEORGE (giddy),145, Don't jinx it!
29021,KRAMER,145, Hey. What's up?
29022,JERRY,145, George is dating a convict.
29023,KRAMER,145, Oh? What's she in for?
29024,GEORGE,145, Embezzlement.
29025,KRAMER (approvingly),145," Sounds like a nice girl. Hey Jerry, is it all right 
        if I put some stuff in your fridge? 'Cause mine's full."
29026,JERRY,145," Yeah, sure. You don't even have a fridge, do you?"
29027,KRAMER,145," Well, not here. <Goes into the hallway, comes back in with 
        a huge bag of chicken feed.>"

29029,KRAMER,145," Well, it's chicken feed. <Slams the bag into Jerry's fridge.> 
      "
29030,JERRY,145, I sense something is afoot.
29031,KRAMER (closes fridge),145," Yeah, I bought a chicken."
29032,GEORGE,145, Allow me. Why?
29033,KRAMER,145," Cage-free, farm-fresh eggs."
29034,JERRY,145," Allow me. What are you, an idiot?"
29035,KURT,145," Hold it, hold it, I got it. Catch. <Tosses his wallet to Elaine, 
        she pays the delivery guy.>"
29036,ELAINE (looking at Kurt's driver's licence photo),145," Hey, driver's licence. 
        Oh...my God."
29037,KURT,145, What? 
29038,ELAINE,145," Your hair. It's so thick and lustrous. I mean, it...it was."
29039,KURT,145," Well, it still is. I shave my head for my swim team. I just liked 
        the way it looked, so I kept it."
29040,ELAINE,145," Are you saying that I could be dating this hair? With you under 
        it? <Kurt shrugs.>"
29041,JERRY,145," Is that your ""chicken"" making all that noise?"
29042,KRAMER,145," Oh, Jerry loves the morning."
29043,JERRY,145, Who?
29044,KRAMER,145, Little Jerry Seinfeld. I named my chicken after you.
29045,JERRY,145," Thanks, that's very sweet, but that is not a chicken."
29046,KRAMER,145, Of course it is. I picked it out myself.
29047,JERRY,145," Well, you picked out a rooster."
29048,KRAMER,145," Well, that would explain Little Jerry's poor egg production."
29049,CELIA,145, This was fun.
29050,GEORGE,145, Yeah. I had a great time.
29051,GUARD,145," Five minutes, Mr. Costanza."
29052,GEORGE,145, The whole hour just flew by. <Begins cleaning up the table.>
29053,GUARD,145, I'll get that.
29054,GEORGE,145," Oh, thanks, Bobby. (To Celia) Well, I guess I'll see you in four 
        days."
29055,CELIA,145," Go out and have a ball with the guys. I'll be waiting right here 
        for you."
29056,GEORGE,145, Of course you will. You're the best.
29057,JERRY,145, Hello?
29058,HELEN (in Florida with Morty),145," Jerry? Leo told us he saw your bounced 
        check. Are you having money problems?"
29059,JERRY,145, I'm not having money problems.
29060,HELEN,145," Enough with the comedy! You're very clever, you should look into 
        advertising."
29061,MORTY,145, He never even called Ed Roydlick. They were looking for someone!
29062,JERRY,145, I'm not calling Ed Roydlick. I'm doing fine! <George enters.>
29063,HELEN,145, That's it. I'm going to send you fifty dollars.
29064,JERRY,145, You are NOT sending me fifty dollars!
29065,HELEN,145," We're sending you fifty dollars! Morty, get me an envelope."
29066,JERRY (angrily),145," I swear to God, if you send me fifty dollars, you are 
        gonna be so sorry!"
29067,MORTY,145, I don't see envelopes!
29068,HELEN,145," They're right in front of you! Oh, for heaven's sakes... <She 
        puts the phone down on the couch and goes to help Morty.>"
29069,JERRY,145, Ma! Ma! MA! <Hangs up the phone in disgust.>
29070,GEORGE,145, How're the folks?
29071,JERRY,145, Good.
29072,GEORGE,145, So? Movie tonight?
29073,JERRY,145, I thought you were going out with Celia.
29074,GEORGE,145," I did. I'm back. I love this relationship, I feel so liberated!"
29075,JERRY,145, Having her in jail.
29076,GEORGE,145," The only thing that bothers me is that I'm just coming up with 
        this now."
29077,JERRY,145," Yeah, dating a convicted felon. I don't know how you missed it."
29078,ELAINE,145," Here. <Shows Kurt's driver's licence to Jerry.> Take a 
        look at that."
29079,JERRY,145, Huh. Kurt's an organ donor.
29080,ELAINE,145," No! He's not bald. Look! He's got a full head of hair. <George 
        overhears and stands up, concerned.>"
29081,JERRY,145, So he just shaves his head for no reason?
29082,GEORGE,145, That's like using a wheelchair for the fun of it!
29083,ELAINE,145," And he's growing it in just for me. (Happily) It's mine. It's 
        all mine."
29084,JERRY,145, It's just hair.
29085,ELAINE,145, It's not just hair! Look! <Shows Kurt's licence to Jerry again.>
29086,JERRY,145, It's brown.
29087,ELAINE,145, It's chestnut with auburn highlights!
29088,JERRY,145, So?
29089,ELAINE,145," You're not around women. You don't know how important a man's 
        hair is. <They both look at George, who is reading a newspaper and 
        struggling to keep his composure.> I'm sorry, George, but it's true."
29090,GEORGE (close to tears),145, I knew it.
29091,MARCELINO,145," Hey, Kramer. Nice rooster. What's his name?"
29092,KRAMER,145," Well, this is Little Jerry Seinfeld."
29093,MARCELINO,145, Little Jerry Seinfeld. Does he bounce checks? (laughs)
29094,KRAMER,145," Look, can't you take Jerry's check down?"
29095,MARCELINO,145," Sorry Kramer, can't help you."
29096,MARCELINO (impressed),145, I like the way he handles himself.
29097,ELAINE,145," Oh, it's coming in already! Wow, you have some very nice little 
        seedlings here. Huh..."
29098,KURT,145, What?
29099,ELAINE,145," Well, it doesn't seem to be coming in so good over here. Or here."
29100,KURT,145, What do you mean? <Goes into the bedroom to look in the mirror.>
29101,ELAINE,145," Well, I don't know...how long have you been shaving your head 
        for?"
29102,KURT (from the bedroom),145, About three years.
29103,ELAINE,145, Huh.
29104,KURT,145, Oh my God! <Steps into the doorway> I'm going bald! 
29105,CELIA,145, George! I'm so glad to see you!
29106,GEORGE,145," Hey, I brought you some cigarettes. You buy yourself something 
        nice."
29107,CELIA,145, Good news - I'm up for parole.
29108,GEORGE,145, Parole! <Feigning joy> That's dynamite!
29109,JERRY,145, So Marcelino's going to take down the check?
29110,KRAMER,145," Well, it comes down if Little Jerry Seinfeld wins the cockfight."
29111,JERRY,145, Great! <realizing> What?
29112,KRAMER,145," Well, Marcelino, he has cockfights in the back of his store."
29113,JERRY,145, Ah ha...
29114,KRAMER,145," So, he says if Little Jerry Seinfeld wins, the check comes down."
29115,JERRY,145," Kramer, cockfighting is illegal."
29116,KRAMER,145, Only in The United States.
29117,JERRY,145, It's inhumane!
29118,KRAMER,145," No, Jerry, it's not what you think it is."
29119,JERRY,145, It's two roosters peckin' at each other!
29120,KRAMER,145, What?
29121,JERRY,145, Yeah!
29122,KRAMER,145," Well, I thought they wore gloves and helmets, you know, like 
        ""American Gladiators."""
29123,JERRY,145," No Kramer, Little Jerry could get hurt."
29124,KRAMER,145," Well, I left him with Marcelino!"
29125,KRAMER,145, My Little Jerry! <Runs out.>
29126,JERRY,145," Hey, did you get Little Jerry, is he O.K.?"
29127,KRAMER,145," Well, he's more than O.K., he won!"
29128,JERRY,145, You let him fight?
29129,KRAMER,145," I couldn't get there in time to stop it, but you should have 
        seen Little Jerry, Jerry! Flappin' his wings and struttin' his stuff! 
        He was peckin' and weavin' and bobbin' and talkin' trash! He didn't even 
        have to touch him! The other rooster ran out of the ring. The whole fight 
        lasted two seconds."
29130,JERRY,145, How long do they usually last?
29131,KRAMER,145," Five seconds. And Marcelino says he's taking your check down 
        today."
29132,JERRY,145, Great!
29133,KRAMER,145, Hey.
29134,GEORGE,145, Celia's up for parole.
29135,KRAMER,145," Hey, Little Jerry won his cockfight."
29136,GEORGE,145, What?
29137,KRAMER,145, Who?
29138,JERRY,145, I'm too tired.
29139,KRAMER (to Jerry),145," O.K., listen, I want you to come by later, alright? 
        'Cause we're having a victory party for Little Jerry."
29140,JERRY,145, Alright. <Kramer leaves.>
29141,GEORGE (sadly),145," It's over, Jerry. She's gettin' out."
29142,JERRY,145," Ah, I'm so sorry."
29143,GEORGE,145," She's been locked up for two years. She's gonna want to make 
        up for lost time. Dinners. Movies. <Rubs his forehead.> Talking..."
29144,JERRY,145," In other words, a normal relationship."
29145,GEORGE,145," And that's no good. I've tried it straight, Jerry. We've all 
        seen the results. For me, sick is the only way to go."
29146,JERRY,145," Well, she'll still be an ex-con."
29147,GEORGE,145, It's not the same. 
29148,JERRY,145," Hey, if you two are meant to be together...I'm sure the cops'll 
        pick her up on something."
29149,ELAINE,145, Kurt? What's with the sweats? Aren't we going out?
29150,KURT,145, I don't care.
29151,ELAINE,145," You, uh...got a big stain on your shirt."
29152,KURT,145, Yeah...meatball...fell out of my sandwich.
29153,ELAINE,145, You already ate?
29154,KURT,145, It's from yesterday.
29155,MARCELINO,145, Jerry! You missed a hell of a cockfight last night.
29156,JERRY,145, Then what is my check still doing up? We had a deal!
29157,MARCELINO,145, Now we have a new deal.
29158,JERRY,145, New deal?
29159,MARCELINO,145," When Little Jerry Seinfeld is mine, the check will be yours."
29160,JERRY,145, This is outrageous! (To Marcelino) Pack of Juicy Fruit.
29161,MARCELINO (puts the gum on the counter),145, 85 cents.
29162,JERRY,145, 85 cents? That is outrageous!
29163,JERRY,145," Kramer, Marcelino wants us to sell him Little Jerry Seinfeld. 
      "
29164,KRAMER,145," Well, that's out of the question."
29165,JERRY,145," But Kramer, cockfighting is an illegal and immoral activity."
29166,KRAMER,145," Yeah, if you got a loser. But Little Jerry was born to cockfight!"
29167,JERRY,145," No, no more cockfighting. Let's just sell him to Marcelino the 
        cockfighter and be done with it!"
29168,KRAMER,145," You know, I think you're jealous."
29169,JERRY,145, Of what?
29170,KRAMER (points at Jerry like he's found him out),145," Yah, yah! You see in 
        Little Jerry Seinfeld the unlimited future you once had. Now, just because 
        Jerry Seinfeld is a has-been, don't make Little Jerry Seinfeld a never-was! 
      "
29171,JERRY,145," Kramer, give me that rooster!"
29172,KRAMER,145," Never! You hate him because he's doing more with your name than 
        you ever will! Yah-yah! <Kramer leaves.>"
29173,BETSY,145," George, Celia has listed you as a character reference. Whatever 
        you can tell us would certainly be helpful in her getting paroled. "
29174,GEORGE,145," Well, anything I can do to help, um...she's a wonderful girl. 
        Very smart. Very...crafty. "
29175,BETSY,145, Does she have any plans after she's released?
29176,GEORGE,145," Plans. Schemes. She keeps talking about getting back together 
        with her old friends - ""the gang,"" as she likes to call them, 
        you know. Yeah, they're hatching something, you can count on that. "
29177,MARCELINO,145, Jerry! Tonight's fight-night. Where's my rooster?
29178,JERRY,145, Kramer won't sell.
29179,MARCELINO,145," Well, tell you what I'm gonna do. I'm gonna take down your 
        check anyway."
29180,JERRY,145," Well, thank you, Marcelino."
29181,MARCELINO,145," Well, perhaps someday you will do me a favor. And that day 
        is today. Little Jerry Seinfeld must go down in the third round of tomorrow's 
        main event."
29182,JERRY,145, You want Little Jerry to take a dive?
29183,MARCELINO,145," Shhh, not so loud."
29184,JERRY,145," First of all, I don't think you can make a rooster take a dive."
29185,MARCELINO,145," Can, too!"
29186,JERRY,145," Second of all, Jerry Seinfeld - big or little - doesn't go down 
        for anyone, anywhere, at anytime! Now I'd appreciate it if you please 
        leave."
29187,MARCELINO (leaving),145," Big Jerry is making a big mistake, Jerry."
29188,JERRY,145," We'll see about that. <Runs to the window and shouts up to 
        Kramer, who's on the roof.> Kramer, I'm comin' up! We got a cockfight 
        to win!"
29189,KRAMER,145, O.K.!
29190,KURT,145, Elaine said you would be the best person I could talk to.
29191,GEORGE (examining Kurt's head with a lamp),145," Yep. Classic horseshoe pattern. 
        I've seen a lot of this. "
29192,KURT,145," Oh, God."
29193,GEORGE,145," No, no, Kurt - wrong attitude. You should be happy now. "
29194,KURT,145, Happy? Why should I be happy?
29195,GEORGE,145," You've still got pretty good coverage. Once the enemy advances 
        beyond this perimeter - <points at Kurt's head with a pen> - then 
        you won't be Kurt anymore."
29196,KURT,145, Who will I be?
29197,KURT,145, How long do I have?
29198,GEORGE (solemnly),145, 14 months. Maybe 10.
29199,KURT,145, Is there anything I can do?
29200,GEORGE,145," Yes. Live, dammit. Live! Every precious moment as if this was 
        the last year of your life. Because in many ways...it is. <There's 
        a knock at the door.> Excuse me."
29201,GEORGE,145, Celia? What are you doing here?
29202,CELIA,145," Well, I didn't get my parole, so I busted out. "
29203,GEORGE (nervously),145, And you just decided to pop in...!
29204,ELAINE,145, Kurt!
29205,KURT,145," Elaine...<holds out a wedding ring> Will you marry me? <Elaine 
        is shocked.>"
29206,KRAMER,145," Oh, yeah. He's lookin' good, huh Jerry?"
29207,JERRY,145," Yeah. Alright, I think that's enough for today. <Kramer picks 
        up Little Jerry and takes him to the sink.> Little Jerry is lean, mean, 
        peckin' machine! <Kramer starts filling a pot with water.> What 
        are you doing with that?"
29208,KRAMER,145," I'm just gonna heat this up. Make a little hot-tub for Little 
        Jerry."
29209,JERRY,145," Hey, Kramer...?"
29210,JERRY,145," Be careful. <George enters.> Hey, guess what! Little Jerry 
        ran from here to Newman's in under thirty seconds!"
29211,GEORGE,145, Is that good?
29212,JERRY,145, I don't know. Where have you been?
29213,GEORGE,145," Celia broke out of prison. I'm sitting in my home, she shows 
        up at the door!"
29214,JERRY,145, Oh my God! The break-out/pop-in!
29215,GEORGE,145," Yeah. Hey Jerry, listen to this. I discovered something even 
        better than conjugal visit sex. Fugitive sex! Now, it's like everytime 
        -"
29216,JERRY (interrupts),145," George, this is a little too much for me - escaped 
        convicts, fugitive sex...I got a cockfight to focus on. <Jerry leaves.>"
29217,ELAINE,145," Hey Kurt, slow down! I just can't marry you, whim-bam-boom! I 
        mean, I need some ""fiance-time,"" I need some ""make-my-girlfriends-jealous"" 
        time..."
29218,KURT,145," Plus, you want to get to know me."
29219,ELAINE,145," Yeah, yeah, that too."
29220,KURT,145," Well, how much time?"
29221,ELAINE,145, I don't know...a year?
29222,KURT,145," No, no, no...it has to be now."
29223,ELAINE,145, Could I see the ring again?
29224,JERRY (to Elaine),145," So, you're actually considering it?"
29225,ELAINE,145," Well, it'll be a couple of years before he's completely bald. 
        Those'll be good times."
29226,JERRY,145," Marriage is a big step, Elaine. Your life'll totally change."
29227,ELAINE,145," Jerry, it's three-thirty in the morning. I'm at a cockfight. 
        What am I clinging to? <George comes over.>"
29228,GEORGE,145," Hey, sorry I'm late. "
29229,JERRY,145, Where's Celia?
29230,GEORGE,145," She didn't want to come, she's not really into sports. <Kramer 
        comes over with Little Jerry.>"
29231,JERRY,145," Hey, how's he doin'?"
29232,KRAMER,145," He's got a big sweat going. <Takes an envelope out of his 
        pocket.> Oh, this came for you express-mail. It's from your parents."
29233,JERRY (opens the envelope),145, Fifty dollars. I don't believe this!
29234,KRAMER,145," There's Marcelino. <Marcelino enters the ring holding a huge 
        white rooster.>"
29235,JERRY,145, Look at the size of his bird!
29236,KRAMER,145, That looks like a dog with a glove on his head.
29237,KURT,145," Hi, is George back from the cockfight yet? You know, I gotta thank 
        him, he changed my life."
29238,CELIA,145," No, it must have been a good fight, he's not back yet."
29239,KURT,145," Ah, damn. "
29240,DETECTIVE #1 (to Kurt),145," Sorry to bother you, Mr. Costanza. Well, well, 
        well. Look who's here."
29241,CELIA,145," Aw, man!"
29242,DETECTIVE #2 (to Kurt),145," Mr. Costanza, you're under arrest for aiding 
        and abetting a known fugitive."
29243,KURT (laughs),145, I'm not George Costanza.
29244,DETECTIVE #2,145," Save it. We know you're bald. We know it's you. Let's go! 
        <They escort Kurt and Celia out.>"
29245,ELAINE (to a woman at the fight),145," Muchos gracias. <Turns back to Jerry 
        and Kramer.> O.K., I got the whole scoop. Marcelino flew the bird in 
        from Ecuador. He's 68 and 0!"
29246,JERRY,145, He's a ringer!
29247,GEORGE,145," Where's the tamale guy? <The bell rings, and the cockfight 
        begins.>"
29248,KRAMER,145," Little Jerry's going to get his clock cleaned. I gotta get him 
        outta there. "
29249,KRAMER (lunging for Little Jerry),145, Little Jerry!
29250,JERRY,145, Kramer!
29251,ELAINE,145, Stop the fight!
29252,GEORGE (holds up one finger),145, Tamale!
29253,ELAINE,145, Why did you get into a fist fight with the cop? You were innocent!
29254,KURT,145," They thought I was George. I'm not that bald. I have too little 
        time left to take that kind of crap, so I slugged him."
29255,ELAINE,145," So, how long are you gonna be in here for?"
29256,KURT,145," Well, my lawyer says 14 months, but with good behavior, maybe...10?"
29257,ELAINE,145," So, 10 to 14 months."
29258,KURT,145, Yeah.

29264,Directed by,148, Andy Ackerman
29265,Broadcasted,148," February 6, 1997 for the first time."
29266,Stars,148," Jerry Seinfeld, Michael Richards, "
29267,[Setting,148, A Restaurant]
29268,ELLEN,148," So, they have this clock now, where you punch in your age, 
              and all your risk factors. It actually counts down how much time 
              you have left to live."
29269,JERRY,148," So what's the great moment? You're on your death bed, they're 
              pounding on your chest - and you're going 10, 9, 8,.. I told you 
              this thing was good!"
29270,ELLEN,148, (Laughs) I can't believe this is our first date.
29271,JERRY,148, I know.. How about dessert?
29272,ELLEN,148, I suppose I have to get a piece of cake..
29273,JERRY,148, Why?
29274,ELLEN,148, Today's my birthday.
29275,JERRY,148, What? Today? Really?
29276,ELLEN,148, Yeah.
29277,[Setting,148, Jerry's apartment]
29278,GEORGE,148," So, she went out with you on a first date.. and it was 
              her birthday?"
29279,JERRY,148, Yeah. And she picked the day!
29280,GEORGE,148, Is she socially awkward?
29281,JERRY,148," No, she's great! She's.. attractive, she's fun.."
29282,GEORGE,148," Well, maybe she decided to celebrate her birthday on the 
              Monday after the weekend."
29283,JERRY,148, She's not Lincoln.
29284,KRAMER,148, Hey! Anybody up for Lorenzo's pizza?
29285,JERRY,148, I'll pass.
29286,KRAMER,148," Oh, yeah? Huh. (Turns to George) Hey, George! Pizza? Yum, 
              yum!"
29287,GEORGE,148," Eh, I can't. I gotta go down to the foundation. I'm interviewing 
              high schoolers for the Susan Ross.. scholarship."
29288,JERRY,148, Does it ever bother you that this organization-
29289,GEORGE,148, Nope!
29290,JERRY,148, is beating the bushes-
29291,GEORGE,148, Nope! (Starts heading for the door)
29292,JERRY,148, to basically give this money away-
29293,GEORGE,148, Noo!
29294,JERRY,148," to virtually anyone, as long as they're not you?"
29295,GEORGE,148," (Standing in the doorway) I'm fine with it! Fi-hi-hi-hine 
              I say! (Leaves)"
29296,[Setting,148, Susan Ross Foundation conference room]
29297,STUDENT 1,148," And then I received a 740 on the English achievement 
              test. (George looks bored)"
29298,GEORGE,148," Quick, what's your favorite animal?"
29299,STUDENT 1,148, I.. I don't know.. frog?
29300,GEORGE,148, (Disappointed) A frog?
29301,STUDENT 1,148," Well, I.. I.."
29302,GEORGE,148, (Annoyed) Frog is wrong.
29303,GEORGE,148," (Reading) I see here that you play the harp.. tell me, 
              why do you have to tilt it? Can't you just build it on an angle? 
              It'd save you a lot of trouble."
29304,STUDENT 2,148," Well, the modern-day harp has been refined over thousands 
              of years-"
29305,GEORGE,148," (Annoyed) Yeah, yeah. We'll, uh, let you know."
29306,GEORGE,148, (Reading) I see your G.P.A's a 4.0.
29307,STUDENT 3,148," (Smiling gloatingly) You like that, don't you?"
29308,GEORGE,148," so, uh, Steven.. I see you're president of the chess club."
29309,STEVEN,148, State champs.
29310,GEORGE,148, Who's your favorite chess player?
29311,STEVEN,148," (Hesitating, he mumbles) Nastercoff?"
29312,GEORGE,148," Right. (Mumbles) Nastercoff.. What country is he from, 
              again?"
29313,STEVEN,148," (Sighs) I don't know.. I made it up. (Gets up to leave) 
              I'm never gonna get this thing."
29314,GEORGE,148," (Gets up, stopping him) Woah, woah, woah! What are you 
              telling me for? You really had me going, there! C'mon, sit down. 
              (They both sit back down)"
29315,STEVEN,148, I've been telling people that I'd like to be an architect..
29316,[Setting,148, Jerry's apartment]
29317,JERRY,148," Wow. That's great! When it comes out, I'll have to get someone 
              to ghost read it."
29318,KRAMER,148, Hey.
29319,JERRY,148, Hey.
29320,ELAINE,148, Hey!
29321,KRAMER,148," Alright, so there I am at Lorenzo's - loading up my slice 
              of the fixin's bar.. garlic, (imitates the shaking of garlic onto 
              a pizza) and what-not.. mmm,"
29322,JERRY,148," The Van Buren Boys? There's a street gang named after President 
              Martin Van Buren?"
29323,KRAMER,148," Oh yeah, and they're just as mean as he was! So, I make 
              a move to the door, you know, (makes a noise) they block it! So, 
              I lunged for the bathroom."
29324,ELAINE,148, What? What happened?
29325,KRAMER,148," Because I'm still holding the garlic shaker.. Yeah.. like 
              this (grabs Jerry's peper shaker, and demonstrates) I'm only showing 
              eight fingers."
29326,JERRY,148," Well, what does that mean?"
29327,KRAMER,148," That's their secret sign! See, Van Buren, he was teh eighth 
              President.. (Holds up 8 fingers) They thought I was a former Van 
              B. Boy!"
29328,[Setting,148, Outside a coffee shop]
29329,ELLEN,148," (Sees a pay phone) Oh, Jerry, can you hold on a sec? I just 
              want to check my messages.. (She meets up with two of her friends 
              on the way to the phone)"
29330,MELISSA,148, Ellen.
29331,ELLEN,148," Hey! You guys, I want you to meet Jerry. (Gestures tward 
              Jerry, then goes back to the phone)"
29332,MELISSA,148," Ohh, we've heard a lot about you! (Confidentially) It 
              is so sweet of you to take her out."
29333,KIM,148," Yeah, you don't even know how much she needs this."
29334,JERRY,148, (Sympathetically) She coming of a bad break-up?
29335,KIM,148, (Casually) No.
29336,MELISSA,148, See ya!
29337,JERRY,148, Any messages?
29338,ELLEN,148," Yeah, no one called."

29340,JERRY,148," They act like it was some act of charity. Just going out 
              with her."
29341,GEORGE,148," So, she's the loser of the group. Every group has someone 
              that they all make fun of.. Like us with Elaine. (Jerry thinks about 
              this, then shakes it off)"
29342,JERRY,148, There is no way Ellen is the loser of that group.
29343,GEORGE,148, Are you looking deep down at the real person underneath?
29344,JERRY,148," No, I'm being as superficial as I possibly can!"
29345,GEORGE,148," (Changing subject) Hey, I htink I may have found someone 
              for the scholarship."
29346,JERRY,148, Yeah?
29347,GEORGE,148," I'm interviewing all these annoying little overachievers.. 
              finally, this kid walks in - Steven Koren - a regular guy.. likes 
              sports.. watches T.V.."
29348,JERRY,148, Is he smart?
29349,JERRY,148, Hey! Just like you pretend to be.
29350,GEORGE,148," Yes. With a little guidance, Steven Koren is going to be 
              everything I claim to be, only for real. That's my dream, Jerry."
29351,JERRY,148, I had a dream last night that a hamburger was eating me!

              isn't quite what I imagined.. (It's plain, with no sign of Peterman's 
              personality)"
29354,PETERMAN,148, Ohhh.. It's just a place to flop. (Sits in his recliner)
29355,ELAINE,148," Well, (Clears throat) what part of your life (hits the 
              record button on a mini-recorder, and sets it down on the table) 
              do you want to start with? Foreign"
29356,PETERMAN,148," Oh, Elaine, we've covered all of that in the catalogue 
              ad nauseum. No, I would like this book to be about my day-to-day 
              life."
29357,ELAINE,148, Oh. 
29358,PETERMAN,148," (Turns on the T.V, and starts flipping through the channels) 
              Oh damn. They changed the cable stations again.. just when I finally 
              memorized them."

29362,PETERMAN,148," 3.. I don't know what that is.. where's my damn preview 
              channel?"
29363,ELAINE,148," (After observing Peterman's home life) Well, I - I got 
              ta tell you, Mister Peterman.. I don't think I see a whole book 
              here."
29364,PETERMAN,148," well, I'm sure we'll come up with something. What do 
              you say you and I order ourselves a pie? Do you like Lorenzo's?"
29365,ELAINE,148," You know, a friend of mine almost got beat up at that place 
              by the Van Buren Boys?"
29366,PETERMAN,148, (Interested) You don't say.
29367,ELAINE,148," Yeah. The only think that saved him is that he accidentally 
              flashed their secret gang sign."
29368,PETERMAN,148," Well, that's pretty exciting. (Pause) Let's put that 
              in the book."
29369,ELAINE,148," But, that didn't happen to you."
29370,PETERMAN,148," So, we pay off your friend, and it becomes a Peterman."
29371,ELAINE,148," No, I - I really don't think you can do that."
29372,PETERMAN,148," (Looking at his dying plant) Ohh, damn. I forgot to buy 
              plant food again.. I'll bet I got a coupon for it. (Starts looking 
              through a small coupon box)"

              that fell on the floor?! (Dramatically) Are you using the fork that 
              fell on the floor?!"

              tests.."
29388,WYCK,148, These aren't standardized tests - these are his grades.
29389,GEORGE,148," Besides, Steven Koren has the highest of aspirations. He 
              wants to be (pauses for effect) an architect."

              a tilty desk, and a big ruler? (Laughs - so do the board members)"

29536,STEVEN,148, That's not the sign.
29537,GEORGE,148, (Defensively loud) It was when I was banging!
29538,MEMBER 2,148," All right, if you really are one of us.. let's see you 
              take the wallet off the next guy who walks by."
29539,GEORGE,148," Love to! (Cracks his knuckles, then winces under the pain)"
29540,[Setting,148, Coffee shop]
29541,ELLEN,148," And after college, I got my masters at the Sorbonne."
29542,MORTY,148," Sorbonne? Oh, hey. (To Helen) That's in Paris."
29543,ELLEN,148," (Looks at her watch) Oh, Jerry, you're parking meter's about 
              to expire. Don't get up, I've got change. (Leaves with her purse)"
29544,JERRY,148, (To his parents) So? What do you think?
29545,HELEN,148," Jerry, she's fantastic."
29546,JERRY,148, I knew it! I'm not crazy.
29547,HELEN,148," She's so sweet, and she's got some body on her!"
29548,MORTY,148, And smart! Like a computer!
29549,HELEN,148," And so much personality! But, it doesn't matter what we 
              think. Do you like her?"
29550,JERRY,148," (After seeing how much his parents like her) Now, I'm not 
              so sure."
29551,HELEN,148," Well, she's 10 times better than that awful Amber girl that 
              you were with."
29552,JERRY,148," yeah, Amber.. I wonder if she's back from Vegas.."
29553,[Setting,148, NYC Alley]
29554,MEMBER 2,148," The next one, or you're meat!"
29555,GEORGE,148," Alright, alright! (Goes out onto the sidewalk. The Seinfelds 
              walk by) Seinfelds!"
29556,MORTY,148," Hey, George!"
29557,GEORGE,148," Shhh! Listen, you gotta do me a favor. Give me your wallet. 
              I'll give it back to you later."
29558,MORTY,148, How're your folks?
29559,GEORGE,148," Eh, they're trying to pick out a new couch - you don't 
              want to know. (Remembering the watching Van Buren Boys) Give me 
              your wallet, or I'll spill your"
29560,MORTY,148, What did you say?
29561,GEORGE,148," Come on, hurry up, old man! I'm an animal!"
29562,HELEN,148," You're being very rude. Come on, Morty."
29563,GEORGE,148," (Pleading) Please, please, they're gonna hit me! (Attempts 
              to grab Helen's purse, she starts hitting George defensively, he 
              backs off)"

29588,GEORGE,152," Oh, boy I was up to four in the morning watching the Omen trilogy."
29589,JERRY,152, That's good stuff.
29590,GEORGE,152, I can't to myself. I'm exhausted.
29591,JERRY,152, Can you grab a nap at work.
29592,GEORGE,152," Not with that big glass window looking out into the hall. I'd 
        love a good nap. That's the only thing getting me out of bed in the morning. 
        I'll see ya'."
29593,ELAINE,152, Bye.
29594,JERRY,152, So what are you doing now?
29595,ELAINE,152, I'm going to take a little stroll through the park.
29596,JERRY,152, With a gentleman caller?
29597,ELAINE,152," Yes, his name is Hal."
29598,JERRY,152," The walking date is a good date. You don't have to look right 
        at the other -person."
29599,ELAINE,152, It's the next best thing to being alone.
29600,JERRY,152, Shower?
29601,KRAMER,152," No, pool. I just swam 200 laps. "
29602,ELAINE,152, You are kidding.
29603,KRAMER,152," Look at hose babies [hands]. They're prunes. I saw Conrad going 
        up to oyur place."
29604,ELAINE,152," Oh, yeah, that's right. Those new kitchen cabinets. How is that 
        coming?"
29605,JERRY,152," A little slow. I've got to hold this guy's hand on every little 
        decision."
29606,ELAINE,152," Hey, Kramer, listen, you've seen the Omen right?"
29607,ELAINE,152, What exactly was that kid?
29608,KRAMER,152," Who, Damien? Nothing, just a mischievous, rambunctious kid."
29609,WILHELM,152," Oh, George, have you seen the American league directory? It 
        is a big green book. Oh, thanks kiddo."
29610,HAL,152, 
29611,ELAINE,152, Well I don't care. It was delicious.
29612,ELAINE,152, Wanna sit down?
29613,HAL,152," Oh, I don't sit on park benches. They're very bad for the back."
29614,ELAINE,152, Really?
29615,HAL,152," I threw my back out about 15 years ago. Ever since I have been very 
        careful. I only buy furniture in the ergonomics store. "
29616,ELAINE,152," Oh those places have the stupidest names. Like, uh, ""Back 
        in "", or ""Good Vertibrations""."
29617,HAL,152," Not this one. It's called the ""Lumbar Yard""."
29618,CONRAD,152," Oh, Jerry are you okay with this hinge?"
29619,JERRY,152, Yeah.
29620,CONRAD,152," I can get you any kind you want, you know. Four holes, three 
        holes, two holes, bronze, no hinge at all."
29621,JERRY,152," You know, why don't we just go with the one in your hand?"
29622,CONRAD,152," Oh, these are different."
29623,JERRY,152, Drop one. . . . left! 
29624,GEORGE,152," Jerry, look at my eyes."
29625,JERRY,152, A little less beady today.
29626,GEORGE,152," Because I'm REFRESHED. I finally found a way to sleep in my office. 
        Under the desk. I lie on my back. I tuck in the chair. I'm invisible. 
      "
29627,JERRY,152, Sounds like a really cool fort. 
29628,GEORGE,152," Conrad, is it?"
29629,CONRAD,152," Conrad, Connie, or Con, whatever you prefer."
29630,GEORGE,152," Uh, let me ask you a question. Could you, uh, expand the space 
        underneath a desk to give it a little more headroom?"
29631,JERRY,152, He's kind of tied up here.
29632,GEORGE,152," It'll have to be a night job anyway. You don't normally work 
        after dinner, do you?"
29633,CONRAD,152," There is no normal, whatever jerry wants. He wants me here late, 
        I'm here late, he wants me here early, I'm here early, he . . . "
29634,JERRY,152, Why don't you just work on George's project for a while?
29635,CONRAD,152, Whatever you want.
29636,JERRY,152, So how was Wednesday's walk in the park with Hal.
29637,ELAINE,152," Uh, it was okay,. He's coming over later to watch a movie. Hey 
        listen, what's better for your back? Couch cushions or a folding chair? 
      "
29638,JERRY,152, I don't know. 
29639,ELAINE,152," Uh, maybe we'll just stand and watch the tv. [knock knock]. I 
        gotta go someone's at my door. Yeah!"
29640,DELIVERY GUY,152, Delivery. Elaine Benes?
29641,ELAINE,152, Yeah.
29642,DELIVERY GUY,152," We're from the Lumbar Yard, we got your mattress. "
29643,ELAINE,152," Mattress, I didn't order a mattress. Who sent this? Hal Kitzmiller? 
      "
29644,GEORGE,152," Do you think it might be possible to add a little shelf like, 
        uh, for an alarm clock?"
29645,CONRAD,152, You mean like that big?
29646,GEORGE,152, Like this.
29647,CONRAD,152," Yeah, I can do that."
29648,GEORGE,152," Thanks. You know this could sound crazy but, what do you think 
        about adding a drawer for - like a blanket?"
29649,CONRAD,152, Blanket or quilt?
29650,GEORGE,152, Blanket.
29651,CONRAD,152, That thick?
29652,GEORGE,152, Maybe like this.
29653,CONRAD,152, Like that?
29654,GEORGE,152," Yeah, like that."
29655,CONRAD,152, If that is what you want.
29656,GEORGE,152, That is what I want.
29657,CONRAD,152," Hey George, you want this cup holder mounted on the left, or 
        the right, or the middle, . . . "
29658,GEORGE,152," Whatever!!. . . . Oh oh oh this is unbelievable. This is better 
        than my bed at home."
29659,GEORGE,152, Its been a long night. You go home and get some sleep. 
29660,CONRAD,152, If that's what you want.
29661,GEORGE,152, That's what I want.
29662,W,152, Morning George.
29663,GEORGE,152, Good morning Mr. Wilhelm.
29664,KRAMER,152, got problems Jerry.
29665,JERRY,152, What happened?
29666,KRAMER,152," Well I had been swimming for three hours and I was in a real 
        grove so I decided to keep going. But at ten they start the aquasonics 
        Thirty-five geriatrics throwing elbows. It was like I was swimming through 
        a flabby armed spanking machine."
29667,JERRY,152, How long did that last?
29668,KRAMER,152," A half hour then diving class started. Well that got a 
        little messy. I gotta find a new place to swim 'cause that pooll can't 
        hold me, Jerry."
29669,JERRY,152, How was the movie?
29670,ELAINE,152," I cancelled. Hal sent a mattress to my apartment. The nerve of 
        that guy. "
29671,JERRY,152, So you think he was expecting a roll in the supportive hay.
29672,ELAINE,152, After one date!
29673,KRAMER,152," Oh, that's right."
29674,JERRY,152, So what are you going to do with the mattress?
29675,ELAINE,152, I don't know. Chuck it?
29676,KRAMER,152," Oh, no no no no I'll take it. Why don't you come over. Let's 
        see if it will fit in my bedroom."
29677,ELAINE,152," Oh, all right."
29678,KRAMER,152, My old one sprung a leak.
29679,ELAINE,152, You have a water bed?
29680,KRAMER,152, Sand! It's like sleeping on the beach.
29681,[CONRAD,152, enters]
29682,CONRAD,152," Hi, Jerry I'm sorry I'm late. George and I have been up working 
        all night long. I can make up the time in any number of ways."
29683,JERRY,152, How about this? . . . Finish this thing up today!
29684,CONRAD,152, Couple of questions for you.
29685,JERRY,152," No. No more questions. Just figure it out for yourself and get 
        it done."
29686,CONRAD,152, All right Jerry. But I can figure it out myself any way you want.
29687,JERRY,152, Just . . . do it. 
29688,STEINBRENNER,152," Costanza? Where's Costanza? . . . Excus mois? Have you 
        seen Costanza?"
29689,Secretary,152, I've seen him around. 
29690,STEINBRENNER,152," Um, I'm stuck on this song yesterday. I can't seem to get 
        it out of my head. I don't know the name of that. ""She's a heart 
        breaker, love taker . . ..Oh. Oh"" . . .very catchy. You know what? 
        I can't stay awake for that guy. What is this? People? Um, the most beautiful 
        people people. Ally Selica, Nothing wrong with that uh?"
29691,HAL,152," Elaine, your taking this totally the wrong way. That's not what 

        Ii intended."
29692,ELAINE,152," Well, what did you intend, Hal?"
29693,HAL,152," I just wanted you to have the comfort and report you deserve. That's 
        why I had the mattress custom designed for you."
29694,ELAINE,152, Custom designed?
29695,HAL,152," They adjust the foam density and spring tension to your body type. 
        I estimated your height and weight. Five eight, about 110 pounds?"
29696,ELAINE,152," Uh, that is the nicest thing anyone has ever done for me."
29697,HAL,152, So you do like the mattress?
29698,ELAINE,152," Oh, I love it. I'm glad . . . I kept it."
29699,FATHER,152," Over there, that's Brooklyn . That's where Spike Lee lives. "
29700,SON,152," Hey, there's a man swimming in the water."
29701,FATHER,152," Naw, that's probably just a dead body son. You see when the mob 
        kills someone they through the body in the river."
29702,KRAMER,152, Jer.
29703,JERRY,152, Hi.
29704,KRAMER,152," Well my swimming pool problems are solved. I just found myself 
        miles and miles of open lanes."
29705,JERRY,152, What is that smell?
29706,KRAMER,152, That's East River.
29707,JERRY,152," You're swimming in the East River? The most heavily trafficked 
        overly contaminated waterway on the eastern seaboard?"
29708,KRAMER,152, Technically Norfolk  has more gross tonnage.
29709,JERRY,152, How could you swim in that water?
29710,KRAMER,152, I saw a couple of other guys out there.
29711,JERRY,152, Swimming?
29712,KRAMER,152," Floating, they weren't moving much. But they were out there."
29713,ELAINE,152," (on phone) Hey, Kramer, it's Elaine, thanks for bringing my mattress 
        back. And I guess I'll just get my spare key from you - whenever. All 
        right, bye."
29714,ELAINE,152," Oh, this is a good mattress. Sniff, sniff, Ugh! "
29715,STEINBRENNER,152," What is it with this guy? I've been waiting three and a half 
        hours. Should I go? No way Jack! (But I'm not going to hum it to the guy 
        at the record store again), I'll tell you that."
29716,SeConrad,152, Mr. Steinbrenner?
29717,STEINBRENNER,152, That's what they call me.
29718,SeConrad,152, Your grandchildren are here to see you.
29719,STEINBRENNER,152," Oh, well, send them in. Send the little tykes in.  
        little people .. pony express  wow, "
29720,Jerry,152, (on phone) hello.
29721,GEORGE,152," Jerry, I'm trapped under my desk. Steinbrenner is in the room. 
        You got to help[ me."
29722,JERRY,152, Who is this?
29723,GEORGE,152," Jerry, . . . "
29724,XX,152," Hi, "
29725,GEORGE,152," Sh, sh, goodbye, sh, get away."
29726,XX,152," Hi, I'm Brady."
29727,GEORGE,152, ?? get away??
29728,JERRY,152, Why don't you just have him paged?
29729,GEORGE,152, Can't you think of something. Call in a bomb threat.
29730,JERRY,152, A bomb threat? Why would I call in a bomb threat?
29731,GEORGE,152, Just CALL!
29732,JERRY,152, I should have some reason.
29733,STEINBRENNER,152," Hey you kids know tunes; see if this song rinSTEINBRENNER 
        a bell, ""Heartbreaker , . . . """
29734,SeConrad,152," Mr. Steinbrenner we just received a call. There's a bomb in 
        the building."
29735,STEINBRENNER,152," A bomb in the building, oh, m'god. Quick, everyone under 
        the desk."
29736,STEINBRENNER,152," Boy can you think of what went through my mind when I saw 
        there wasn't going to be enough room under that desk for me and my babies."
29737,GEORGE,152, I'm sorry sir.
29738,STEINBRENNER,152," You know what I think? I think you knew about that bomb 
        ahead of time."
29739,GEORGE,152, What?
29740,STEINBRENNER,152," ???? about that bomb. You climbed under that desk because 
        you have ESP. George, what's on my mind? . . . Meatballs! Huh? Unbelievable. 
        Anyway this terrorist had a specific demand. Not more cheap adjustable 
        hats on hat day. He wants fitted hats just like the players wear."
29741,ELAINE,152," Jerry, Jerry."
29742,JERRY,152, Yeah.
29743,ELAINE,152, What the hell is this? Where are you?
29744,JERRY,152, Over here. You can see right through here.
29745,ELAINE,152, What is this. It's like you're selling movie tickets back here.
29746,JERRY,152, It's kind of cozy.
29747,ELAINE,152," Hey, you're not going to believe what Kramer did to my mattress. 
        . . . I can't talk to you like this. So Kramer completely funked up my 
        mattress."
29748,JERRY,152, Does it smell like the East River?
29749,ELAINE,152, How did you know? 
29750,JERRY,152," Because Kramer has been swimming laps between the Queensborough 
        bridge and the Brooklyn bridge."
29751,ELAINE,152," Oh, GREAT! "
29752,KRAMER,152," Oh man, I'm on the wrong floor again."
29753,ELAINE,152," Hey, thanks for ruining my mattress. It reeks."
29754,KRAMER,152," Hey, you know what I think it is? I think it's that East River. 
        I think it might be polluted."
29755,GEORGE,152," Well, you really did it to me this time, Seinfeld. . . . What 
        the hell happened here?"
29756,ELAINE,152, Hi.
29757,GEORGE,152, Hi. Look at how obtrusive this is.
29758,ELAINE,152," It is obtrusive, isn't it?"
29759,KRAMER,152, It is very obtrusive.
29760,JERRY,152, I don't think it's that bad.
29761,KRAMER,152, You can't get a stool in here.
29762,JERRY,152, No the stools go over there.
29763,KRAMER,152," No, that's no good. I'm leaving."
29764,ELAINE,152, I'm with you. I'm going back to my place.
29765,GEORGE,152, Guess who he put in charge of Fitted Hat Day? Me.
29766,JERRY,152, Hey look at you.
29767,GEORGE,152," Yeah, look at me. Now I GOTTA FIGURE OUT THE HAT SIZES OF 59,000 
        DIFFERENT PEOPLE!! WHAT IF A PINHEAD SHOWS UP. I GOTTA BE ON TOP OF THAT."
29768,JERRY,152, No knock offs. I want the ones like the real players wear.
29769,GEORGE,152," ??? KNOCK OFFS. I NOT GOING TO DO IT! AND YOU'RE GOING TO CALL 
        STEINBRENNER BACK AND CANCEL THE WHOLE THING."
29770,JERRY,152, Could you at least get a hat for me?
29771,GEORGE,152, FINE? WHAT SIZE?
29772,JERRY,152, Seven and five eighths
29773,GEORGE,152, SEVEN AND FIVE EIGHTHS!!
29774,JERRY,152, Why are you shouting?
29775,GEORGE,152, I DON'T KNOW. It's this place. I'm very uncomfortable here.
29776,HAL,152, So are you liking the mattress?
29777,ELAINE,152," I am totally loving it. Uh, you know  we should um  
        get going."
29778,HAL,152, What is that smell?
29779,ELAINE,152, What smell?
29780,HAL,152, I think it's the mattress. Did something happen to it.
29781,ELAINE,152," No no, oh, you know what that is? I um, went claming the other 
        day and I forgot to hose off my boots. "
29782,HAL,152, Claming?
29783,ELAINE,152," Yeah, clam and scallop. I clam and scallop."
29784,STEINBRENNER,152," Yes, yes, come in."
29785,GEORGE,152," Sir, I just got a call from the terrorist. I told him to call 
        back here."
29786,STEINBRENNER,152," Just let me ask you something. Is it ""February"" 
        or "" February""? Because I prefer ""Febuary"" and what 
        is this ""ru""? "
29787,GEORGE,152, Let me put that on speaker phone.
29788,STEINBRENNER,152, Hello are you the bomber?
29789,JERRY,152, Yes this is the terrorist bomber.
29790,STEINBRENNER,152, Costanza here is busting his ass on those hats.
29791,JERRY,152, think I've changed my mind.
29792,STEINBRENNER,152," You don't want them, then goodbye."
29793,GEORGE,152," Good thinking, sir."
29794,STEINBRENNER,152, Well what do you want instead?
29795,JERRY,152, What?
29796,STEINBRENNER,152," Well, you're the terrorist. You're going to want something."
29797,JERRY,152," I guess it would be nice if you called all the ticket holders 
        if the game was going to be rained out."
29798,STEINBRENNER,152," All right George, you can handle that."
29799,STEINBRENNER,152, Costanza what the hell are you doing?
29800,GEORGE,152," You have to stand tough sir. That's why I had to hang up the 
        phone."
29801,STEINBRENNER,152," When someone's unstable, you don't stir the fat, George! 
        You know what I'm going to do? I'm going to run around 
        the stadium and close all the windows. That's where I'm going, pal. And 
        I'll tell you something else. I'm very nervous."
29802,ELAINE,152, Gotta get some of that stuffed crust pizza. cheese crust pizza.
29803,HAL,152, It's just more cheese.
29804,ELAINE,152," I'll tell you something. It'll be years before they find places 
        to hide more cheese on a pizza. Kramer!"
29805,KRAMER,152," Oh, hey, "
29806,ELAINE,152," Oh, hi. This is Hal. Hal, this is Kramer. Kramer, Hal."
29807,KRAMER,152," Hal, .. uh Langerhans."
29808,HAL,152, Kitzmiller.
29809,KRAMER,152," Oh, Kitzmiller. That's right"
29810,ELAINE,152, You feeling jiff?
29811,KRAMER,152," Oh, I'm jiff."
29812,HAL,152, That smell
29813,KRAMER,152," Oh, listen I gotta get to the pier. The ferry traffic is really 
        bad around four thirty. Look, I still got the key to your apartment and 
        I'll get it back to you as soon as I can."
29814,ELAINE,152," Oh, baby."
29815,GEORGE,152, Lunch.
29816,HAL,152, Kramer? Can I talk to you a minute?
29817,KRAMER,152," Yeah, sure, um, oh boy, . . . "
29818,HAL,152, Kitzmiller.
29819,KRAMER,152, That's it.
29820,HAL,152, You and Elaine are pretty close.
29821,KRAMER,152," Oh, we go back a ways."
29822,HAL,152," And you've, . . . how do I put this? You've been in her bed?"
29823,KRAMER,152, That's right. 
29824,HAL,152, But this isn't still going on.
29825,KRAMER,152," No, no. She put a stop to that. "
29826,HAL,152, That's all I needed to know. So you actually swim in this thing?
29827,KRAMER,152," Oh yeah. Exercises every muscle in the body. It's great for the 
        back."
29828,HAL,152, Great for the back. Right.
29829,KRAMER,152," Four hours in this chop and I'm a full inch taller. . . . Giddyup. 
      "
29830,STEINBRENNER,152," ""Heatbreaker, Brewbaker, "" Hey George, 
        I remember that tune. George? George? Um, what's that ticking. Oh oh. 
        Oh, oooh,wo wo wo wo . [runs out] fire in the hole!"
29831,ELAINE,152," I wouldn't believe the Lumbar Yard wouldn't pick this up. Ug, 
        oh, okay, . . ."
29832,CONRAD,152, You want it back the way it was?
29833,JERRY,152," Yeah, that's right."
29834,CONRAD,152," You know I don't get you Seinfeld. You want something one day. 
        The next day you don't like it. Come on man, make a decision."
29835,JERRY,152, One second. Hello.
29836,ELAINE,152, Jerry you gotta help me. I threw my back out.
29837,JERRY,152, Just lie down.
29838,ELAINE,152," I am lying down. I am trapped under a funky mattress. I gotta 
        go get a doctor or at least come over and roll this thing off of me."
29839,JERRY,152," All right. I'll be right there., Conrad I gotta go."
29840,CONRAD,152," Stay, go whatever. "
29841,HAL,152," Hey, Kramer."
29842,KRAMER,152, What's going on?
29843,HAL,152," I told my Chiropractor how swimming in the river made my back heal. 
        He recommended it to all his patients. "
29844,OLD MAN,152, Step aside.
29845,KRAMER,152, He just sunk like a stone.
29846,GEORGE,152," Sir, I'm sure it's not a police matter."
29847,STEINBRENNER,152," Don't be so sure George. Mess with them and they're messing 
        with you. All right boys send it in"
29848,STEINBRENNER,152," What's that figure ahead? Is that anything? Okay, let's 
        check the desk. That's where I heard the ticking. Search each one of those 
        drawers starting with the top one. So, empty calories and male curiosity, 
        eh, Georgie? "
29849,BOMB COP,152, Looks like there's more compartments underneath.
29850,STEINBRENNER,152," Compartments underneath, that's probably where it is. Okay 
        boys, let 'er rip. I'll tell you what George. Starting tomorrow no more 
        desks. Just Lucite tables and four leSTEINBRENNER. "
29851,KRAMER,152," Hey, watch where you're kicking!"
29852,ELAINE,152, Kramer.
29853,KRAMER,152, Elaine
29854,ELAINE,152," I can't believe it. Hey, I'll meet you at the coffee shop."
29855,KRAMER,152, Yeah.
29856,ELAINE,152, Yeah.
29857,GEORGE,152," Hi Connie, Jerry around?"
29858,CONRAD,152," No, and I prefer ""Conrad"". So I heard what happened 
        to the desk. "
29859,GEORGE,152, There was something so reassuring about that cozy little space.
29860,CONRAD,152," Yeah, well, whatever. See ya'"
29861,JERRY,152," Ah, back to normal. Not bad for four thousand bucks. . . . I can't 
        believe I got the Low Fat!"
29862,George,153," So, Marcy, you should've seen me in the hot tub yoday."
29863,Marcy,153, Why?
29864,George,153, I was naked.
29865,Marcy,153," Oh, George."
29866,Jerry,153, I saw it.
29867,Marcy,153, How'd he look?
29868,Jerry,153, Okay. I wouldn't see it again.
29869,Marcy,153," You know, a friend of mine thought she got Legonare's disease 
              in the hot tub."
29870,George,153, Really? What happened?
29871,Marcy,153," Oh, yada yada yada, just some bad egg salad. I'll be right 
              back. (She gets up)"
29872,Jerry,153," I noticed she's big on the phrase ""yada yada."""
29873,George,153," Is ""yada yada"" bad?"
29874,Jerry,153," No, ""yada yada"" is good. She's very succinct."
29875,George,153, She is succinct.
29876,Jerry,153," Yeah, it's like you're dating USA Today. (Tim the dentist 
              enters Monk's)"
29877,George,153, Hey.
29878,Jerry,153," Hey, George, you know Tim Whatley."
29879,George,153," Yeah, dentist of the stars."
29880,Jerry,153, What's up?
29881,Tim,153, I'll tell you what's up. I'm a Jew.
29882,Jerry,153, Excuse me?
29883,Tim,153, I'm a Jew. I finished converting two days ago.
29884,Jerry,153, Well... (Thinking of something to say) Welcome aboard.
29885,Tim,153, Thanks.
29886,George,153," Hey, where you just at the health club?"
29887,Tim,153," Oh, well, I didn't do much. I just sat in the sauna. You know, 
              it was more like a Jewish workout. I'll see ya. (Jerry and George 
              give confused looks)"
29888,Jerry,153," Elaine, the guy's Jewish two days, he's already making Jewish 
              jokes."
29889,Elaine,153," So what? When someone turns twenty-one, they usually get 
              drunk the first night."
29890,Jerry,153, Booze is not a religion.
29891,Elaine,153," Tell that to my father. Anyway, guess what? Beth Lookner 
              called me."
29892,Jerry,153," Ooh. Beth Lookner, still waitin' out hat marriage."
29893,Elaine,153," What are you talking about? That marriage ended six months 
              ago. She's already remarried."
29894,Jerry,153, I gotta get on that internet. I'm late on everything.
29895,Elaine,153," Anyway, Beth and her new husband Arnie have listed me a 
              reference for an adoption agency. They're trying to get a baby. 
              (Kramer and Mickey enter wearing the same shirt)"
29896,Kramer,153," Elaine, all right, who looks better in this shirt? Me or 
              Mickey?"
29897,Mickey,153," We're double dating tonight, and if we wear the same shirt 
              we'll look like idiots."
29898,Elaine,153," Hmm, turn around. (They turn around) Both so striking."
29899,Kramer,153, Tell me about it. We just picked up two women at the Gap.
29900,Elaine,153," How did you decide which one of you would date which girl? 
              (They pause then look at each other)"
29901,Marcy,153," So I'm on 3rd Avenue, mindin' my own business, and, yada 
              yada yada, I get a free massage and a facial."
29902,George,153, What a succinct story.
29903,Marcy,153, I'm surprised you drive a Cadillac.
29904,George,153," Oh, it's not mine. It's my mother's."
29905,Marcy,153, Are you close with your parents?
29906,George,153," Well, they gave birth to me, and, yada yada..."
29907,Marcy,153, Yada what?
29908,George,153, Yada yada yada...
29909,Karen,153," (To Mickey, wearing the shirt Elaine looked at for them) 
              I like your shirt."
29910,Mickey,153," Oh, thank you. It's 100% cotton, and some wool."
29911,Kramer,153," Well, you too seem to have the same taste."
29912,Julie,153," Well I like it, too."
29913,Kramer,153, Well I have the same shirt.
29914,Mickey,153," Yeah, well I'm wearin' it."
29915,Julie,153, I like your shirt too.
29916,Karen,153," Oh, so do I."
29917,Kramer,153, Oh. (Waiter approaches table)
29918,Waiter,153," Anything to drink? Some wine, perhaps."
29919,Mickey,153, I like Merlot.
29920,Karen,153, I love Merlot.
29921,Julie,153, I'm crazy about Merlot.
29922,Kramer,153, I live for Merlot.
29923,Waiter,153, We're out of Merlot.
29924,Agent,153," So you, uh, know Betha and Arnie pretty well?"
29925,Elaine,153," Oh, yeah, yeah."
29926,Agent,153, Do you socialize with them often?
29927,Elaine,153," Yeah, we got out to dinner a lot. Usually Chinese, well 
              sometimes Thai. And we go to the movies, Arnie's a real film buff."
29928,Agent,153, Oh.
29929,Elaine,153," Actually, I remember this one time, um, this is funny. 
              Um, we went to see the movie Striptease. I don't know if you've 
              seen... doesn't matter. Anyway, I was whispering something to Beth, 
              and Arnie leens over to me, and he goes, ""Would you SHUT UP?!"" 
              I mean, he barely even knew me. Where did he get ah-- But they're 
              nice people. (Elaine tries to smile realizing her mistake)"
29930,George,153," Oh, you're in here."
29931,Jerry,153, What're you doing here?
29932,George,153, I knew you had an appointment.
29933,Jerry,153, Well this is very awkward.
29934,George,153," I'll leave when the guy comes in. I gotta tell you, I am 
              loving this yada yada thing. You know, I can cross over my whole 
              life story. (Picks up dental tool)"
29935,Jerry,153," Hey, you don't play with that. That's going in my mouth."
29936,George,153," Hey, what this thing? Whew!"
29937,Jerry,153," All right, that's enough. Now get going. Get outta here. 
              (Tim and his staff enter)"
29938,George,153," Hey, Tim. Quick question. Is it normal for your teeth to 
              make noises, like a hissing or a chirping?"
29939,Jerry,153, George...
29940,Tim,153, Um...
29941,George,153," Fine, I'll make an appointment. (He leaves)"
29942,Tim,153," All right, it is cavity time. Ah, here we go. Which reminds 
              me, did you here the one about the rabbi and the farmer's daughter? 
              Huh?"
29943,Jerry,153, Hey.
29944,Tim,153, Those aren't mahtzah balls.
29945,Jerry,153," Tim, do you think you should be making jokes like that?"
29946,Tim,153," Why not? I'm Jewish, remember?"
29947,Jerry,153," I know, but..."
29948,Tim,153," Jerry, it's our sense of humor that sustained us as a people 
              for 3000 years."
29949,Jerry,153, 5000.
29950,Tim,153," 5000, even better. Okay, Chrissie. Give me a schtickle of 
              flouride."
29951,Jerry,153, And then he asked the assistant for a schtickle of flouride.
29952,Elaine,153, Why are you so concerned about this?
29953,Jerry,153," I'll tell you why. Because I believe Whatley converted to 
              Judaism just for the jokes. (Phone rings)"
29954,Phone,153," Would you be interested in a subscription to the New York 
              Times?"
29955,Jerry,153, Yes. (Slams down phone. Kramer and Mickey enter)
29956,Kramer,153, I don't believe that.
29957,Mickey,153," If you had gotten into the backseat of the car we could've 
              figured this whole thing out."
29958,Kramer,153, Why were you holding the door open for?
29959,Mickey,153, Not for you! Who holds a door open for a man?
29960,Kramer,153," Well, I thought it was a nice gesture. But I guess I was 
              wrong!"
29961,Mickey,153, Let's just put they're names in a hat.
29962,Kramer,153," I don't even know their names! Look, why don't you just 
              take the one that was on the left?"
29963,Mickey,153, I'm not sure she was my type.
29964,Kramer,153," Oh, everybody's your type."
29965,Mickey,153, What the hell does that mean?
29966,Kramer,153, You've been married three times.
29967,Mickey,153," That's it, it's go time! (Charges toward Kramer, only to 
              be held back by Jerry and Elaine)"
29968,Jerry,153," All right, take it easy."
29969,Elaine,153," Hey, hey, hey!"
29970,Kramer,153," Come on, let him go. You want throw? Let's throw!"
29971,Elaine,153," Hey! Hold on a second. All right, look, I got an idea. 
              Why don't you just show up early for your next date, sit across 
              from each other, and see who the girls sit next to."
29972,Mickey,153, That's not bad.
29973,Kramer,153," All right, so we let the girls decide."
29974,Mickey,153," Yeah, why should we knock ourselves out?"
29975,Kramer,153," Yeah, I wanna wear that shirt next time."
29976,Mickey,153," No, no one wears the shirt next time."
29977,Kramer,153," That's right, 'cause they already saw it."
29978,Mickey,153, We'll look like idiots. (They exit)
29979,George,153," Well, we were engaged to be married, uh, we bought the 
              wedding invitations, and, uh, yada yada yada, I'm still single."
29980,Marcy,153, So what's she doing now?
29981,George,153, Yada.
29982,Marcy,153," Speaking of ex's, my old boyfriend came over late last night, 
              and, yada yada yada, anyway. I'm really tired today."
29983,Elaine,153," Beth, Arnie, hi. What's up?"
29984,Arnie,153, Well our adoption application was denied.
29985,Elaine,153, Really.
29986,Beth,153," The adoption agent seems to feel that Arnie has a violent 

              temper."
29987,Elaine,153, Oh.
29988,Beth,153," So we're just asking our friends what they may have said 
              to the adoption agent."
29989,Elaine,153," Uh, you know, I just told them what kind people you are 
              and, uh, yada yada yada, that is it."
29990,Jerry,153, How you doing?
29991,Father,153, I have a discomfort in my molar. (Enter Tim)
29992,Tim,153," Well, the Curtis, why don't you come in? (To Jerry) Father 
              Curtis, good guy. Oh, which reminds me, did you hear the one about 
              the Pope and Raquel Welch on the lifeboat, huh? I'll tell you later. 
              (Exits)"
29993,Jerry,153," Whatley. (Like ""Newman"")"
29994,Kramer,153, What are they doing here?
29995,Mickey,153, I told you we should've gotten here a half hour early.
29996,Kramer,153," All right, all right. Now what're we gonna do?"
29997,Mickey,153," All right, don't panic. Let's just decide now. Which one 
              do you want?"
29998,Kramer,153," All right, I'll take Julie."
29999,Mickey,153, I knew you wanted her. That's who I wanted.
30000,Kramer,153," All right, I'll take Karen."
30001,Mickey,153," No, no, you think I'm fallin' for that? I'll take Karen."
30002,Kramer,153," All right, which one is Julie? (They walk over to the table 
              and fight over who sits where) Hey, you ladies look lovely tonight. 
              (Continue to struggle)"
30003,Jerry,153," So Whatley sayd to me, ""Hey, I can make Catholic jokes, 
              I used to be Catholic."""
30004,Elaine,153," You see, I don't think it is a Catholic joke. I think it's 
              more of a Raquel Welch joke. What was it? No, I said hand me the 
              buoys. (Laughing) Bouys!"
30005,Jerry,153," Don't you see what Whatley is after? Total joke telling 
              immunity. He's already got the two big religions covered, if he 
              ever gets Polish citizenship there'll be no stopping him."
30006,Elaine,153, So what're you gonna do?
30007,Jerry,153," I think this Father Curtis might be very interested to hear 
              what Whatley has the Pope doing with Raquel Welch."
30008,Elaine,153," (Calling on phone) Hey, Beth, Arnie, it's Elaine. Um, thought 
              you guys might wanna have lunch. Gimme a call. Bye."
30009,Jerry,153," They're not getting a baby so you're taking them out to 
              lunch?"
30010,Elaine,153, Thought it would be nice.
30011,Jerry,153, Poor Beth.
30012,Elaine,153," Hey, Arnie's just as upset."
30013,Jerry,153, Oh screw him! (George enters)
30014,George,153," Listen to this. Marcy comes up and she tells me her ex-boyfriend 
              was over late last night, and ""yada yada yada, I'm really tired 
              today."" You don't think she yada yada'd sex."
30015,Elaine,153, (Raising hand) I've yada yada'd sex.
30016,George,153, Really?
30017,Elaine,153," Yeah. I met this lawyer, we went out to dinner, I had the 
              lobster bisk, we went back to my place, yada yada yada, I never 
              heard from him again."
30018,Jerry,153, But you yada yada'd over the best part.
30019,Elaine,153," No, I mentioned the bisk."
30020,George,153," Well, I gotta do somethin'. (Walks over to bathroom. Kramer 
              enters)"
30021,Kramer,153," Well, I gotta do somethin'."
30022,Jerry,153, George is already in there.
30023,Kramer,153," (Confused) No, Mickey and I, we can't work it out. You 
              know, I'm thinking of asking that Karen out by myself."
30024,Jerry,153, I thought you were leaning towards Julie.
30025,Kramer,153," I was, but the one I thought was Julie turned out to be 
              Karen."
30026,George,153, Well it was a helluva yada yada.
30027,Marcy,153," He's moving to Seattle. We wanted to say goodbye, I was 
              just getting out of the shower, and yada yada yada--"
30028,George,153," All right, enough! Enough! From now on, no more yada yada's. 
              Just give me the full story."
30029,Marcy,153, Okay.
30030,George,153, Tell me about the free facial.
30031,Marcy,153," Okay, well, like I said I was on 3rd Avenue, and I stopped 
              by a large department store."
30032,George,153, Which one?
30033,Marcy,153, Bloomingdale's.
30034,George,153, Very good. Go on.
30035,Marcy,153," Oh, and I stole a Piaget watch."
30036,George,153, What's that?
30037,Marcy,153," And then, I was on such a... high, that I went upstairs 
              to the salon on the fifth floor, and got a massage and facial, and 
              skipped out on the bill."
30038,George,153, Shoplifting.
30039,Marcy,153," Well, what about you? You told me that you were engaged. 
              What was the rest of that? (Pause)"
30040,Jerry,153," Excuse me, Mother?"
30041,Nun,153, Sister.
30042,Jerry,153," Sister, right. Do you know when Father Curtis has office 
              hours?"
30043,Nun,153, Well not until tomorrow.
30044,Jerry,153," Hmm, I really need to speak with him."
30045,Father,153, That's a kneeler.
30046,Jerry,153, Oh. (Adjusts accordingly)
30047,Father,153," Tell me your sins, my son."
30048,Jerry,153, Well I should tell you that I'm Jewish.
30049,Father,153, That's no sin.
30050,Jerry,153," Oh good. Anyway, I wanted to talk to you about Dr. Whatley. 
              I have a suspicion that he's converted to Judaism just for the jokes."
30051,Father,153, And this offends you as a Jewish person.
30052,Jerry,153," No, it offends me as a comedian. And it'll interest you 
              that he's also telling Catholic jokes."
30053,Father,153, Well.
30054,Jerry,153," And they're old jokes. I mean, the Pope and Raquel Welch 
              in a lifeboat."
30055,Father,153, I haven't heard that one.
30056,Jerry,153," Oh, I'm sure you have. They're out on the ocean and, yada 
              yada yada, and she says, ""Those aren't buoys."" (Father 
              starts laughing) Father..."
30057,Father,153," One second... Well, if it would make you feel better I 
              could speak to Dr. Whatley. I have to go back and have a wisdom 
              teeth removed."
30058,Jerry,153," You know the difference between a dentist and a sadist don't 
              you?"
30059,Father,153, Um...
30060,Jerry,153, Newer magazines.
30061,Father,153, Now if you'll excuse me. (Closes door. George enters confessional.)
30062,George,153," Jerry, I gotta talk to you."
30063,Kramer,153, Hi.
30064,Karen,153," Hi, Kramer."
30065,Kramer,153, Got a minute?
30066,Karen,153," Uh, actually my parents are over, but, would you like to 
              meet them?"
30067,Kramer,153, Sure.
30068,Karen,153," (Parents enter and are little people like Mickey) Mom, Dad."
30069,Kramer,153, Hi.
30070,Arnie,153," Elaine, I have to ask you something. What exactly happened 
              down there?"
30071,Elaine,153," Well, I don't know. I mean, I talked to him and, blah blah 
              blah, he asked about you guys and, da da da da da, more questions, 
              bleh bleh bleh...."
30072,Arnie,153," All right, shut up!"
30073,Elaine,153, Again you are telling me to shut up?
30074,Arnie,153, What?
30075,Elaine,153," You yelled that time at the movies. That's why you're not 
              getting the baby."
30076,Arnie,153, Oh my God. How am I gonna tell Beth?
30077,Elaine,153," Look, I'll go down and talk to this adoption guy and I'll 
              make sure that it all gets worked out."
30078,Arnie,153," All right, just don't screw it up this time! (He exits)"
30079,Elaine,153," See, again with the yelling. Not a fan of the yelling."
30080,Jerry,153," (In pain) Oh, are you about done?"
30081,Tim,153," I'm just getting warmed up. Because I'm just a sadist with 
              newer magazines."
30082,Jerry,153, Huh?
30083,Tim,153, Father Curtis told me about your little joke.
30084,Jerry,153, What about all your Jewish jokes?
30085,Tim,153," I'm Jewish, you're not a dentist. You have no idea what my 
              people have been through."
30086,Jerry,153, The Jews?
30087,Tim,153," No, the dentists. You know, we have the highest suicide rate 
              of any profession?"
30088,Jerry,153, Is that why it's so hard to get an appointment?
30089,Kramer,153," So, I'll uh... all right. (Hangs up)"
30090,Jerry,153, Date with Karen?
30091,Kramer,153," No, Julie. She's the one."
30092,Jerry,153, What happened to Karen?
30093,Kramer,153," Well, Mickey and her have a lot more in common. you know 
              her parents are little people?"
30094,Jerry,153," Oh, small world. So little people can have not little people 
              children?"
30095,Kramer,153," Oh yeah, and vice versa. Mother Nature's a mad scientist, 
              Jerry."
30096,Jerry,153," So you won't believe what happened with Whatley today. It 
              got back to hime that I made this little dentist joke and he got 
              all offended. Those people can be so touchy."
30097,Kramer,153," Those people, listen to yourself."
30098,Jerry,153, What?
30099,Kramer,153," You think that dentists are so different from me and you? 
              They came to this country just like everybody else, in search of 
              a dream."
30100,Jerry,153," Kramer, he's just a dentist."
30101,Kramer,153," Yeah, and you're an anti-dentite."
30102,Jerry,153, I am not an anti-dentite!
30103,Kramer,153," You're a rabid anti-dentite! Oh, it starts with a few jokes 
              and some slurs. ""Hey, denty!"" Next thing you know you're 
              saying they should have their own schools."
30104,Jerry,153, They do have their own schools!
30105,Kramer,153, Yeah!
30106,Elaine,153," One little baby, whatever you have in stock."
30107,Agent,153, Miss Benes...
30108,Elaine,153," Look it, look it, Ryan. These people are gettin' a baby. 
              Period. Now we can do this the easy way, or we can do this the fun 
              way."
30109,Beth,153," Jerry, I'm sorry to bother you, but you always said you'd 
              be there for me."
30110,Jerry,153," Well, what's wrong?"
30111,Beth,153, I'm thinking of leaving Arnie.
30112,Jerry,153, Talk to me.
30113,Beth,153," He met with Elaine, and I asked him what happened, and he 
              yada yada'd me. I mean, could he be having an affair?"
30114,Jerry,153," Well, I wouldn't put anything past anybody."
30115,Beth,153, But we just got married.
30116,Jerry,153," Well obviously that was a mistake. You need to forget about 
              Arnie. The important thing is you're moving on."
30117,Beth,153, Why would Elaine do that to me?
30118,Jerry,153," Forget about Elaine. Let's just focus on us. Come on, big 
              hug. (Mickey and Karen enter)"
30119,Mickey,153, Hey Jerry. Where's Kramer? I've got exciting news.
30120,Jerry,153, I'm kinda in the middle of something.
30121,Mickey,153, Karen and I are getting married.
30122,Jerry,153," Oh, congratulations. Her marriage just fell apart."
30123,Mickey,153, (To Beth) How many is that for you?
30124,Beth,153, Two.
30125,Mickey,153," You're a lightweight. Come on, honey."
30126,Elaine,153, Hey Jerry. What are you doing here with Beth?
30127,Jerry,153, Beth and Arnie broke up.
30128,Elaine,153, So they don't want a baby?
30129,Jerry,153, (Shaking his head no) Pff.
30130,Elaine,153," (Realizes her mistake) I think I'm gonna be sick. (George 
              enters alone)"
30131,Jerry,153," Hey, where's Marcy?"
30132,George,153," She, uh, went shopping for some shoes for the wedding and, 
              yada yada yada, I'll see her in six to eight months. (Kramer and 
              Julie enter)"
30133,Jerry,153," Hey, Kramer, over here."
30134,Kramer,153, I just assume not sit next to you.
30135,Jerry,153," Kramer... Oh look, there's Mickey and his parents."
30136,Elaine,153, Nice looking family.
30137,Jerry,153, Very handsome.
30138,Kramer,153, (To Mr. Abbott) How ya doing?
30139,Mr. Abbott,153, Hey Kramer.
30140,Julie,153," Oh Mickey. Excuse me, I can't take this. (She exits quickly)"
30141,Jerry,153," Hi, Mr. Abbott."
30142,Mr. Abbott,153," That's Dr. Abbott, D.D.S. Tim Whatley was one of my 
              students. And if this wasn't my son's wedding day, I'd knock you 
              teeth out you anti-dentite bastard."
30143,Beth,153, What was that all about?
30144,Jerry,153," Oh, I said something about dentists and it got blown all 
              out of proportion."
30145,Beth,153," Hey, what do you call a doctor who fails out of med school?"
30146,Jerry,153, What?
30147,Beth,153, A dentist. (They laugh)
30148,Jerry,153, That's a good one. Dentists.
30149,Beth,153," Yeah, who needs 'em? Not to mention the Blacks and the Jews. 
              (Jerry fakes a smile)"
30150,Elaine,153, Where's Beth?
30151,Jerry,153, She went out to get her head shaved.
30152,Father,153," We are gathered her today to unite this couple in holy... 
              matrimony."
30153,Jerry,153, Those wisdom teeth are tough to get out.
30154,Father,153," Marriage is not an intervention to be entered lightly... 
              Yada yada yada, I pronounce you man and wife. (They kiss, walk toward 
              exit)"
30155,Karen,153, (To Kramer) I really wanted you.

30158,Guest Stars,155, 
30159,Jerry,155, Hang on just let me pick up a paper.
30160,Man,155, Excuse me. Would you mind watching my bag for a minute?
30161,George,155, Yeah. No problem.
30162,Jerry,155, Let's go.
30163,George,155," Woah, I gotta watch this guy's bag."
30164,Jerry,155, For how long?
30165,George,155, I'm sure he'll be back in a second.
30166,Jerry,155, Come on.
30167,George,155, Excuse me sir. Would you mind watching my bag for a minute?
30168,Man 2,155," Why? So I can stand here like an idiot not knowing if you'll 
              ever come back?"
30169,George,155, Where are you going?
30170,Jerry,155, I'm going to be this guy's friend.
30171,Jerry,155, New clothes?
30172,George,155," Yeah. I did some shopping. Some new clothes shopping. (turns 
              to a man) Can I borrow your menu?"
30173,Jerry,155," Strange. For new pants, there's noticable wear on the buttocks 
              of those chinos. Wait those are the clothes from the bag!"
30174,George,155, The guy never came back.
30175,Jerry,155, He asked you to watch them not wear them.
30176,George,155, I'm still watching them.
30177,Jerry,155, You look like a tourist.
30178,Jerry,155, When you hear like a soft russeling.
30179,Jerry,155," Oh right, the new job, how is it?"
30180,George,155," I love it. New office, new salary. I'm the new Wilhelm."
30181,Jerry,155, So who's the new you?
30182,George,155," They got a new intern from Francis Louis High. His name 
              is Keith. He comes in Mondays after school."
30183,Jerry,155, Oh hi Alex.
30184,Alex,155, I'm sorry I'm late. Have you ordered yet?
30185,Jerry,155, No.
30186,Alex,155, I'll be right back.
30187,George,155," Where are you meeting these women? When they get off the 
              bus at the port authority?"
30188,Jerry,155," Right here, George. In here. (pointing to his chest) Try 
              opening this up. You'll find the biggest dating scene in the world."
30189,George,155, Thanks. Thanks a lot.
30190,Kramer,155, Hey.
30191,Elaine,155, Hey.
30192,Kramer,155, Hi.
30193,Elaine,155, Where's Jerry?
30194,Kramer,155, Well he's in the shower. You want me to get him?
30195,Elaine,155, No. No no. Actually I kind of need to speak to you.
30196,Kramer,155, Well let's sit down.
30197,Elaine,155," Kramer, ahem, remember that whole deal with you selling 
              Peterman your stories for his book and then he gave them back to 
              you?"
30198,Kramer,155, Vaguely.
30199,Elaine,155," Well I was kind of, hehehe, short on material and I, um, 
              I put them in the book anyway."
30200,Kramer,155, You put my life's stories in his autobiography?
30201,Elaine,155," Kramer listen, it is such a stupid book. It doesn't matter."
30202,Kramer,155," Oh no. Sure. It matters. Wow. I've broken through, huh. 
              I'm part of popular culture now. Listen I've got to thank Mr. Peterman."
30203,Elaine,155, He's doing a book signing at Waldenbooks this afternoon.
30204,Kramer,155, Waldenbooks? That's a major chain huh.
30205,Kramer,155," He Jerry, I'm going to waldenbooks."
30206,Jerry,155, (yelling) Get out! Get out! I don't want to live like this.
30207,Kramer,155," All right, let's go."
30208,Elaine,155," Mr. Lippman, how are you?"
30209,Mr Lippman,155, Well I'm not bad. Not bad. 
30210,Elaine,155, What are you doing here?
30211,Mr Lippman,155, I work for Pundant Publishishing. This is our book.
30212,Elaine,155, Oh.
30213,Mr Lippman,155," If you can call it that. Why is it every half-wit and 
              sitcom star has his own book out now?"
30214,Kramer,155, Hey buddy. Remember me?
30215,Mr Peterman,155, You're that gangly fellow we bought the stories from.
30216,Kramer,155," Yeah, I'm just here to do my part. What's your name darling?"
30217,Woman,155, Who are you?
30218,Kramer,155, I'm the real Peterman.
30219,Mr Peterman,155, All right playtime's over.
30220,Kramer,155," Relax man. There's enough juice here to keep us all fat 
              and giggley."
30221,Woman,155, I can't believe somebody pulled the top off of this muffin.
30222,Elaine,155, That was me. I'm sorry. I don't like the stumps.
30223,Mr Lippman,155, So you just eat the tops.
30224,Elaine,155," Oh yeah. It's the best part. It's crunchy, it's explosive, 
              it's where the muffin breaks free of the pan and sort of (makes 
              hand motions) does it's own thing. I'll tell you. That's a million 
              dollor idea right there. Just sell the tops."
30225,Kramer,155," I have a right to be here. These are my fans. Hey you're 
              hurting my elbow."
30226,Man 1,155, Try looking up hayseed.
30227,Man 2,155, You wanna sightsee? Get on a bus.
30228,Mary Anne,155, Please don't think all New Yorkers are so rude.
30229,George,155, Well actually I'm...
30230,Mary Anne,155," I'm Mary Anne. I work for the New York Visitor's Center. 
              Where are you visiting from?"
30231,George,155," Little Rock, Arkensas."
30232,Mary Anne,155, Ooh.
30233,Jerry,155, Hmm. That looks new.
30234,Kramer,155," So get this. Peterman has his henchmen forcefully eject 
              me from the book signing like I'm some kind of a maniac."
30235,Jerry,155, (uncomfortably) Yeah that's too bad.
30236,Kramer,155, What's the matter with you?
30237,Jerry,155, (uncomfortably) Nothing.
30238,Kramer,155," No, no, no. Don't give me that. I know you. Something's 
              wrong. What is it."
30239,Jerry,155, I did something stupid.
30240,Kramer,155, What did you do?
30241,Jerry,155," Well I was shaving. And I noticed an asymmetry in my chest 
              hair and I was trying to even it out. Next thing I knew, (high pitched 
              voice) Gone."
30242,Kramer,155," Don't you know you're not supposed to poke around down 
              there."
30243,Jerry,155, Well women do it.
30244,Kramer,155," (high pitched voice) ""Well women do it."" I'll 
              tell you what. I'll pick you up a sundress and a parasol and you 
              can just (high pitched voice) sashey your pretty little self around 
              the town square."
30245,Jerry,155, Well what am I going to tell Alex?
30246,Kramer,155," Listen to me. You don't tell anybody about this. No one. 
              You hear me?"
30247,Jerry,155, Um hum.
30248,Kramer,155," Hey, Jerry shaved his chest."
30249,Jerry,155, Hey!
30250,Kramer,155, I forgot. Wait. Never mind. 
30251,Alex,155, How about the beach this weekend?
30252,Jerry,155," You couldn't pay me enough to go to the beach on a weekend. 
              I mean it's hard enough..."
30253,Alex,155," All right. All right. Wow is that a Mexican Hairless? Oh, 
              I love those. Ooh, Hairless. This is where it's at. It's so much 
              smoother and cleaner."
30254,Jerry,155, Really?
30255,Elaine,155," ""Top of the Muffin to you!""?"
30256,Mr. Lippman,155, Top of the muffin to you. Elaine!
30257,Elaine,155, Mr Lippman?
30258,Jerry,155, So you're pretending to be a tourist?
30259,George,155," It's beautiful. She makes all the plans. I'm not from around 
              here so it's okay if I'm stupid, and she knows I'm only in town 
              visiting so there's no messy breakup"
30260,Jerry,155, How do you explain your apartment?
30261,George,155, I got a hotel room.
30262,Jerry,155, you moved into a hotel?
30263,George,155," Well I don't know anyone here Jerry. Where else am I going 
              to stay?"
30264,George,155, So?
30265,Jerry,155," So. I figure since she likes one hairless animal why not 
              another."
30266,George,155, Oh really. You tell her you shaved it?
30267,Jerry,155," Are you nuts? I don't want her to think I'm one of those 
              low-rise briefs guys who shaves his chest."
30268,Kramer,155, (yelling up at Jerry) Hey Jerry.
30269,Kramer,155," (yelling) I'm starting a Peterman Reality Bus Tour. Check 
              it out. Hahaha."
30270,George,155, Reality tour?
30271,Jerry,155," The last thing this guy's qualified to give a tour of is 
              reality."
30272,Elaine,155, This was my idea you stole my idea.
30273,Mr. Lippman,155," Elaine these ideas are all in the air. They're in 
              the air."
30274,Elaine,155," Well if that air is comming out of this face then it is 
              my air and my idea."
30275,Mr. Lippman,155, You want a muffin or not?
30276,Elaine,155, Peach.
30277,Mary Anne,155, So I notice you don't have much of an accent.
30278,George,155, Yeah my parents have it. Sometimes it skips a generation.
30279,Mary Anne,155," Look george, I'm really enjoying spending time with 
              you but I'm not sure this is going to work out. At some point you're 
              going back to your job at Tyler Chicken and your three-legged dog 
              Willie."
30280,George,155, Willie. Yeah.
30281,Mary Anne,155, And I'm still going to be here.
30282,George,155, Well what if I told you I'm thinking of moving here?
30283,Mary Anne,155," (laughs) George, no offense. But this city would eat 
              you alive."
30284,Jerry,155," You're moving to New York? That's fantastic. I can see you 
              all the time now."
30285,George,155," Eat me alive, huh? We'll see who can make it in *this* 
              town."
30286,Jerry,155, What is it she think you can't do?
30287,George,155, Find a job. Get an apartment.
30288,Jerry,155, How did you do those things?
30289,George,155," Never mind. The're done. All I have to do now is redo them. 
              You know if you take everything I've ever done in my entire life 
              and condense it down into one day, it looks decent."
30290,Jerry,155," Hey, what were you doing with that bus yesterday?"
30291,Kramer,155," Here you go, here you go, check it out."
30292,Jerry,155," ""The Real Peterman Reality Bus Tour"". I'm confused."
30293,Kramer,155," Peterman's book is big business. People want to know the 
              stories behind the stories."
30294,Jerry,155," Nobody wants to go on a three hour bus tour of a totally 
              unknown person's life."
30295,Kramer,155," I'm only charging $37.50, plus you get a pizza bagel and 
              desert."
30296,George,155, What's desert?
30297,Kramer,155," Bite-size Three Musketeers. Just like the real Peterman 
              eats."
30298,George,155, He eats those?
30299,Kramer,155, No. I eat those. I'm the real Peterman.
30300,George,155," I think I understand this. Jay Peterman is real. His biography 
              is not. Now, you Kramer are real. "
30301,Kramer,155, Talk to me.
30302,George,155," But your life is Peterman's. Now the bus tour, which is 
              real, takes to places that, while they are real, they are not real 
              in sense that they did not *really* happen to the *real* Peterman 
              which is you."
30303,Kramer,155, Understand?
30304,Jerry,155, Yeah. $37.50 for a Three Musketeers.
30305,Mr. Lippman,155," Elaine. I'm in over my head. Nobody likes my muffin 
              tops."
30306,Elaine,155, So? What do you want me to do about it?
30307,Mr. Lippman,155," You're the muffin top expert, tell me what I'm doing 
              wrong."
30308,Elaine,155," Mr. Lippman, when I worked for you at Pendent Publishing, 
              I believed in you, you know as a man of integrity. But, I saw you 
              in that paper hat and that aprin..."
30309,Mr. Lippman,155, What if I cut you in for 30% of the profits?
30310,Elaine,155," Deal. Here's your problem. You're making just the muffin 
              tops. You've gotta make the *whole* muffin. Then you... Pop the 
              top, toss the stump. Taste."
30311,Mr. Lippman,155, Ah. (takes a bite of the top.) Mmmmm. Ah hah?
30312,Elaine,155, Yeah.
30313,Mr. Lippman,155, So what do we with the bottoms?
30314,Elaine,155," I don't know, give em to a soup kitchen."
30315,Mr. Lippman,155, That's a good idea.
30316,Elaine,155," And one more thing, you really think we need the exclamation 
              point? Because, it's not ""Top of the Muffin *TO YOU!!!*"""
30317,Mr. Lippman,155, No. No. It is.
30318,Kramer,155, Hey Jerry. What is this? Lady Gillette? What's going on?
30319,Jerry,155, What? Can't I get a moment's peace?
30320,Kramer,155, What are you doing to yourself?
30321,Jerry,155, I can't stop. Alex thinks I'm naturally hairless. 
30322,Kramer,155," You can't keep this up. Don't you know what's going to 
              happen? Everytime you shave it, it's going to come in thicker and 
              fuller and darker."
30323,Jerry,155, Oh that's an old wives tale.
30324,Kramer,155, Is it? Look at this.
30325,Kramer,155," (high pitched voice) Look at it! Look at it! And it's all 
              me. I shaved there when I was a lifeguard."
30326,Jerry,155," Oh come on. That's genetics. That's not going to happen 
              to me."
30327,Kramer,155, Won't it? Or is it already starting to happen?
30328,Elaine,155, Wow. Look at this. We're cleaning up.
30329,Rebecca,155," Excuse me, I'm Rebecca Demore from the homeless shelter."
30330,Elaine,155," Oh, hi."
30331,Rebecca,155," Are you the ones leaveing the muffing pieces behind our 
              shelter?"
30332,Elaine,155, You been enjoying them?
30333,Rebecca,155, They're just stumps.
30334,Elaine,155, Well they're perfectly edible.
30335,Rebecca,155," Oh, so you just assume that the homeless will eat them, 
              they'll eat anything? "
30336,Mr. Lippman,155," No no, we just thought..."
30337,Rebecca,155," I know what you thought. They don't have homes, they don't 
              have jobs, what do they need the top of a muffin for? They're lucky 
              to get the stumps."
30338,Elaine,155," If the homeless don't like them the homeless don't have 
              to eat them."
30339,Rebecca,155, The homeless don't like them.
30340,Elaine,155, Fine.
30341,Rebecca,155," We've never gotten so many complaints. Every two minutes, 
              ""Where is the top of this muffin? Who ate the rest of this?"" 
            "
30342,Elaine,155, We were just trying to help.
30343,Rebecca,155," Why don't you just drop off some chicken skins and lobster 
              shells."
30344,Elaine,155, I think I might.
30345,Mary Anne,155," I can't believe you found something so quickly. How 
              much you pay?"
30346,George,155, $2300.
30347,Mary Anne,155, Ouch. A month?
30348,George,155, Yeah.
30349,Mary Anne,155," Well, guess that's all right for now, but if you say 
              here for more than a few months, you're a real sucker."
30350,George,155," Yeah, well I uh got lots of other stuff to show you too. 
              Wait till you see the plum job that I landed."
30351,Mary Anne,155," Yeah. We should let this place air out anyway. It smells 
              like the last tenant had monkeys or something."
30352,Kramer,155," Comming up on the right, if you glance up you can just 
              make out my bedroom window. It's the one that's covered in chicken 
              wire."
30353,Woman,155," Hey if you're the real Peterman, who come you're wearing 
              those ratty clothes? The're not very romantic."
30354,Kramer,155, (over the speaker) Well that's your opinion.
30355,Man 1,155, Can I have another Three Musketeers? They're rather small.
30356,Kramer,155, Forget it. Okay Newman's postal route is around here somewhere.
30357,Man 2,155, Who's Newman?
30358,Man 3,155, Who cares.
30359,Man 4,155," Hey fake Peterman, let me off. I'm nautious."
30360,Man 1,155, Can I have his candy bar?
30361,Kramer,155," Ahh. Everyone just settle down. We have three hours left 
              on this thing, and I can't drive and argue with you rubes all at 
              the same time."
30362,Jerry,155, Why do I have to go on the tour?
30363,Kramer,155," Jerry you're a minor celebrity. If you go on this thing, 
              it could create a minor stir. Bring that girlfriend of your and 
              I'll only charge to 60 bucks."
30364,Jerry,155," Hey, how's business?"
30365,Elaine,155," Ooh, I've got stump troubles. The Sanitation Department 
              won't get rid of them all, I can't get a truck to haul this stuff 
              until next week. Meanwhile, I'm sitting on a mountain of stumps."
30366,Kramer,155," All right, I've got to hose the puke off the floor of the 
              bus."
30367,Elaine,155," Bus? Wait a minute, wait a minute, bus? You've got a bus?"
30368,Kramer,155, Yeah.
30369,Elaine,155, You got any room on that thing?
30370,Kramer,155, Yeah there are a few seats still available.
30371,Elaine,155," Do you think you could transport some stumps for me? I'll 
              make it worth your while."
30372,Kramer,155," Well, if they don't mind sitting in the back."
30373,Elaine,155, No they don't.
30374,Kramer,155, Are they war veterans?
30375,Mary Anne,155, Wow this is your office.
30376,Mr. Steinbrenner,155," Woah. Hello. Sorry George, didn't know you got 
              a girl in here. Give me a signal on the doornob like a necktie or 
              a sock or something. Come on George, help me out."
30377,Mary Anne,155," Mr. Steinbrenner, I would like to thank you for taking 
              a chance on a hen supervisor at Tyler Chicken like our boy George 
              here."
30378,Mr. Steinbrenner,155, Hen supervisor from Tyler Chicken?
30379,George,155," Yes. Very nice to have had her to mention... (starting 
              to leave)"
30380,Mr. Steinbrenner,155, Wait a minute George.
30381,George,155, Be right with you. Look Mr. Steinbrenner.
30382,Mr. Steinbrenner,155," Moonlighting for Tyler Chicken. Pretty impressive 
              George. Days with the New York Yankees and nights in Arkensas with 
              a top flight bird outlet. And a hen supervisor to boot. I am blown. 
              Bloooown away. Blown George. (vibration in the ""o""'s) 
              Bloooooooooooooooooooown."
30383,Alex,155," You know when you make a pizza bagel, you really shouldn't 
              use cinnimon rasin."
30384,Jerry,155, You also shouldn't use a donut.
30385,Kramer,155," All right ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to the Peterman 
              Reality Tour..."
30386,Tape Player,155, Turn music off.
30387,Jerry,155, Can we just go?
30388,Kramer,155, And go we will.
30389,Man,155,"   What is this, a pizza-pound cake?"
30390,Kramer,155," We have a bonus reality stop today. We will be hauling 
              muffin stumps to the local repository."
30391,Man 2,155, We're going to a garbage dump?
30392,Kramer,155, And we're off.
30393,Jerry,155," You know I never though he would be able to recreate the 
              experience of actually knowing him, but this is pretty close."
30394,Mr. Steinbrenner,155," (the back of his head to the camera) John Tyler? 
              George Steinbreener here. I want to talk about George Castanza. 
              I understand he's been dividing his time between us and you. I cannot 
              have that."
30395,John Tyler,155," (the back of his head also to the camera) Well I don't 
              know who he is but if you want him that bad I'm not giving him up 
              that easily."
30396,Mr. Steinbrenner,155," Oh is that so. Playing a little hardball huh 
              Jonnyboy?"
30397,John Tyler,155," How about this. You give me Castanza, I convert your 
              concessions to all chicken no charge. Instead of hot dogs, chicken 
              dogs. Instead of pretzels, chicken twists. Instead of beer, alcoholic 
              chicken. "
30398,Mr. Steinbrenner,155, How do you make that alcoholic chicken?
30399,John Tyler,155," Let if ferment, just like everything else."
30400,Mr. Steinbrenner,155," That stuff sounds great. All right. I'll have 
              Costanza on the next bus."
30401,Man,155, Hey hey hey hey hey. Where do you think you're going?
30402,Kramer,155, I was going to dump this.
30403,Man,155, It doesn't look like garbage.
30404,Kramer,155, Well it's muffin stumps
30405,Man,155, Where are the muffin tops?
30406,Kramer,155, This is a garbage dump. Just let me dump it.
30407,Man,155, Can't do it.
30408,Kramer,155, Is this a joke?
30409,Man,155, That's what I'd like to know about it.
30410,Alex,155," You have a pretty heavy beard, don't you? "
30411,Jerry,155, What's that?
30412,Alex,155, Well look it's almost time for you to shave again.
30413,Jerry,155, Oh. Yeah. 
30414,Kramer,155," (gets back on the bus, yelling) Well maybe I will take 
              it up with Consumer Affairs."
30415,Man,155, Where are we going?
30416,Kramer,155," (looking at a map) I don't know. (over the speaker) Uh, 
              no more questions."
30417,Waitress,155," So, the New York Yankees traded you for a bunch of Tyler 
              chicken."
30418,George,155," Dogs, twists, a kind of fermented chicken drink."
30419,Man,155," Hey, aren't you the guy I asked to watch my clothes?"
30420,George,155, What clothes?
30421,Man,155, These clothes. The ones you're wearing.
30422,Jerry,155," (in low voice to next to Kramer) Kramer how much longer? 
              My chest hair is comming back and it's itching me like crazy. I 
              can't let her see me scratch it."
30423,Kramer,155, Don't worry. I've got a good feeling about this dump.
30424,Jerry,155," I'm telling you man, I'm losing it."
30425,Jerry,155," I can't sit on this bus anymore. I think I'll go play with 
              that dog."
30426,Kramer,155, I don't know where the tops are. 
30427,Kramer,155, Jerry what's the matter?
30428,Jerry,155," (for the first half of the howl, a dog howls along with 
              him.) Awoooooo-oooooooo, that feels good."
30429,Bartender,155," Hey, you looking for George?"
30430,Mary Anne,155, Yeah.
30431,Bartender,155," He's been in the bathroom awhile. You might want to 
              check on him."
30432,George,155," (talking on the phone) Jerry you gotta bring me some clothes 
              down here. I lost my job with the Yankees. I'm standing in the men's 
              room on 43rd street in my underpants."
30433,Mary Anne,155, I told you this city would eat you alive.
30434,Mr. Lippman,155, What is this guy again?
30435,Elaine,155, They call him a Cleaner. He makes problems go away.
30436,Newman,155, Hello Elaine. Where are they?
30437,Elaine,155, In the back.
30438,Newman,155," All right, I'm going to need a clean 8 ounce glass."
30439,Mr. Lippman,155, What is going on here?
30440,Newman,155," If I'm curt, then I appologize. But as I understand it, 
              we have a situation here and time is of the essence."
30441,"He bites into a stump, then takes a drink of milk from the glass. 
              (continuity error",155," he never actually poured the glass of milk.) 
              He swishes the muffin and the milk together and swollows. He takes 
              another stump.

              It's a"
30449,George,157," No, that's the Netherlands."
30450,Jerry,157, Holland *is* the Netherlands.
30451,George,157, Then who are the Dutch?
30452,Jerry (picking at his moustache),157," You know I cannot stand this 
              thing anymore."
30453,George,157," I know, I hate it too. I feel like an out of work porn 
              star."
30454,Jerry,157," I told you, we should have taken some kind of vacation."
30455,George,157, Well why didn't we?
30456,Jerry,157," Because you said this would be better. Remember? A vacation 
              from"
30457,George,157, What if we grew muttonchops?
30458,Jerry,157, No.
30459,George,157, Buzz cuts? Parachute pants!
30460,Jerry,157," Stop it, George. Stop it. I'm sorry, you've gotta get a 
              job."
30461,George(resigned),157, Dammit.
30462,George,157," Hey hey hey, check me out, huh?"
30463,Jerry,157," No more crutches, that must be a relief."
30464,George,157," Yeah, with crutches everyone has questions."
30465,Jerry,157, Not with a cane?
30466,George,157," Nah, with crutches it's a funny story, with a cane it's 
              a sad story. "
30467,Jerry,157," Always a sad story. Hey, you should have been here tonight. 
              Some guy"
30468,George,157," Alright, we're back in!"
30469,Jerry,157, We? No.
30470,Club announcer (off camera),157," Ladies and gentlemen, Kenny Bania."
30471,Bania,157," Thank you, thank you, (To Jerry) Hey, Jerry, didja see me 
              up there? I"
30472,Jerry,157, Killed?
30473,Bania,157," Killed. (pause) I'm gonna go pick up some chicks. Good looking 
              ones,"
30474,too! (walking away),157," Hey, what's your name?"
30475,George,157, Killed.
30476,Jerry,157," Because I killed first and warmed up the crowd. He's like 
              that fish"
30477,George,157, And you're the shark?
30478,Jerry,157," Yeah, I'm the shark and he's the fish eating my laughs."
30479,George,157, I don't know how a fish could eat laughs.
30480,Jerry,157," Well, I'm glad I brought it up."
30481,Kramer,157, Got any shredded coconut?
30482,Jerry (looking at Kramer's moustache),157," Uh, we're not doing that 
              anymore."
30483,Kramer,157," Yeah, yeah, right. (walks out)"
30484,George,157, Oh my god.
30485,Jerry,157, What?
30486,George,157, I got a job interview. They want to see me this afternoon.
30487,Jerry,157, So what's this job?
30488,George,157," Oh, it's beautiful. It's in sports."
30489,Jerry,157, Knicks? Rangers?
30490,George,157, Playground equipment.
30491,Jerry,157, Welcome back to the show.
30492,Kramer,157," Yeah, this is better. So, you got any shredded coconut?"
30493,Jerry,157, No.
30494,George (holding his cane),157, I gotta hobble. (walks out)
30495,Kramer,157, D-d-d-d. I gotta switch shaving cream. I'm getting no protection.
30496,Jerry,157, What kind do you use?
30497,Kramer,157, Whatever you get.
30498,Jerry (nods),157," Look, postcard from Elaine from Europe."
30499,Kramer,157, Don't tell me she's dragging another poor guy across Europe.
30500,Jerry,157, Remember David Puddy?
30501,Kramer,157," She's dating him again, huh?"
30502,Jerry,157," Well, I guess she's batted around and she's back at the 
              top of the"
30503,Kramer,157," Boy, a month in Europe with Elaine. That guy's coming home 
              in a body"
30504,Puddy,157," Well, let's see, I've got a ten kroner, a five kroner, a 
              twenty kroner. "
30505,Elaine,157, We have to break up.
30506,Puddy,157, What?
30507,Elaine,157," I can't take this anymore! I don't want to hear how interesting 
              the"
30508,Puddy,157," Well what about you? What do you think The Gap in Rome has 
              that's not"
30509,Elaine,157," Okay, alright listen. Forget about The Gap because we are 
              through!"
30510,Puddy,157, Fine!
30511,Elaine,157, Fine!
30512,Cab driver,157," Okay, terminal three. Have a nice flight."
30513,Captain,157," Ladies and gentlemen, our flight time, with stopovers, 
              will be"
30514,Elaine (to flight attendant),157," Hey, you gonna bust out that drink 
              cart or what?"
30515,Kramer,157," Hey, what are you doing?"
30516,Jerry,157," Oh, I'm taking this lace out. It came undone and touched 
              the floor of a"
30517,Kramer,157," Did you see Bania's set last night? 'Cause I read on the 
              Internet he"
30518,Jerry,157," He killed. He only does well when he has me for a lead-in. 
              He's a time"
30519,Kramer,157," Well, you gotta give him some credit. (starts rubbing a 
              stick of"
30520,Jerry,157," Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait a minute."
30521,Kramer,157, What?
30522,Jerry,157, Do I have to ask?
30523,Kramer,157," I ran out of butter so I had to borrow yours. Anything 
              else, Mr. Nosy?"
30524,Jerry,157, Why are you buttering your face?
30525,Kramer,157, I'm shaving with it.
30526,Jerry,157, Oh Moses smell the roses.
30527,Kramer,157," Jerry, it's vastly superior to any commercial shaving cream. 
              Now feel"
30528,Jerry,157, No.
30529,Kramer,157, Feel it.
30530,Jerry,157, I don't want to.
30531,Kramer,157, Feel it. Feel it.
30532,Jerry (places two slices of bread against Kramer's face),157," That 
              is close."
30533,George,157, I got the job?
30534,Mr. Thomassoulo,157," I don't want you to think that anyone's gonna 
              treat you any"
30535,George,157, Handicap? (gesturing to his cane) I'm not handicapped.
30536,Mr. Thomassoulo,157," I'm sorry. Differently, uh, advantaged."
30537,George,157," Yeah, I didn't mean that."
30538,Mr. Thomassoulo,157," Of course you will have your own private, fully 
              equipped"
30539,George,157, When do I start?
30540,Mr. Thomassoulo,157," Whenever you feel that you're able. (Rises to 
              show George"
30541,George,157," Yeah, what the hell."
30542,Jerry,157, You got the job?
30543,George,157," Jerry, it's fantastic. I love the people over there. They 
              treat me so"
30544,Jerry,157," Hold on, they think you're handicapped?"
30545,George,157," Yeah, yeah, well, because of the cane. You should see the 
              bathroom"
30546,Jerry,157, How can you do this?
30547,George,157," Jerry, let's face it, I've always been handicapped. I'm 
              just now"
30548,Jerry,157, He drove a car with no arms?
30549,George,157," Alright I made up the part about the car, but the rest 
              is true. He"
30550,Jerry,157," Do you know how hard it's getting just to tell people I 
              know you?"
30551,George,157," I love that bathroom. It's got that high, high toilet. 
              I feel like a"
30552,Kramer,157, They hooked me up.
30553,George,157, What's with all the butter?
30554,Kramer,157," I'm shaving with it, and you know what I discovered?"
30555,Jerry,157, You can eat it?
30556,Kramer,157," No, my face feels so good, I'm gonna use it all over my 
              body."
30557,Jerry,157," Oh my god, it's Bania and Jenna."
30558,George,157, Who?
30559,Jerry,157, The tooth brush in the toilet bowl.
30560,Bania,157," Hey Jerry, this is Jenna. Pretty good lookin' huh?"
30561,Jenna,157, Jerry's the guy that I dated right before you.
30562,Bania,157, Oh. This is awkward.
30563,Jenna,157," Don't worry, Kenny. After dating Jerry, you're a pleasure."
30564,Jerry,157, I don't believe this.
30565,George,157," You miss her, don't you?"
30566,Jerry,157," No! He's riding my coattails again. He's getting everything 
              off me,"
30567,George,157, You miss her.
30568,Puddy (to flight attendant),157," You know I think ultimately, I'm upset 
              with"
30569,Elaine (to another passenger),157, Huh. You believing this?
30570,Passenger (apologetic),157," Excuse me, I was sleeping."
30571,Elaine,157, You missed quite a performance.
30572,Passenger (disbelieving),157, That's my apple juice.
30573,Jerry,157, Someone's cooking.
30574,Newman,157," Hello, Jerry."
30575,Jerry,157," Hello, Newman."
30576,Newman,157," You know, old friend, sometimes I ponder this silly gulf 
              between us and"
30577,Jerry (cutting in),157," I'm not the one doing the cooking, Newman."
30578,Newman,157," Damn you Seinfeld. You useless pustule. Um, somebody's 
              got something"
30579,Jerry,157," No, he's up on the roof getting some sun with the butter 
              - pause - Oh"
30580,Newman,157, Butter?
30581,Passenger (explaining the coins to Elaine),157, -Fimty kroner.
30582,Elaine (to passenger),157," You know my last boyfriend, he had a real 
              kroner"
30583,Woman,157," David, you are so funny."
30584,Puddy,157," Yeah, I know."
30585,Elaine (grabbing Puddy),157, What are you doing?
30586,Puddy,157," It's a long flight, Elaine. I had to get on with my life."
30587,Elaine,157, By making time with some floozy across the aisle?
30588,Puddy,157," Yeah, that's right. Well, what's going on over there with 
              you and, uh,"
30589,Elaine,157, This guy? He's an idiot. he doesn't mean anything to me.
30590,Passenger (heretofore known as vegetable lasagna),157, I can here you.
30591,Puddy,157," Well, she doesn't mean anything to me either. If it were 
              up to me, we'd"
30592,Elaine,157, Well maybe I feel the same way.
30593,Puddy,157, Ok.
30594,Elaine,157," Ok, so now what?"
30595,Puddy,157, Let's make out.
30596,Jerry,157, Kramer!
30597,Kramer,157," Oh, man. I think I cooked myself."
30598,Jerry,157, Look at your skin.
30599,Kramer,157," Stick a fork in me, Jerry. I'm done."
30600,Kramer,157, I'm fried.
30601,Jerry,157," Technically, you're sauted. So, what are you doing for 
              that?"
30602,Kramer,157," Well, I just gotta keep my skin moist so I don't dry out."
30603,Jerry,157, Is that what the doctor said?
30604,Kramer,157," No, I read an article in Bon Appetite magazine."
30605,George (sniffing),157, Hmm. Game hen?
30606,Jerry,157," Kind of. Nice limp, you're bringing your work home with 
              you?"
30607,George,157," No, I fake limp on my right. This is a real limp because 
              I sprained my"
30608,Jerry,157, What happened?
30609,George,157," Well, I was buttering myself up for a nice shave --"
30610,Jerry,157," Oh no, not you too?"
30611,George,157, I must have dripped some on the floor and I slipped and...
30612,Jerry,157, You know what's good for that? Relish.
30613,Jerry,157," Hello? Yeah, this is Jerry Seinfeld. What? No. No! No! No!! 
              No!!! "
30614,George,157," So what, he's got a couple of good jokes."
30615,Jerry,157," Like what, Ovaltine? Why do dogs drink out of the toilet? 
              Shopping"
30616,George,157," That's true, that always happens to me."
30617,Jerry,157, You think that's funny?
30618,George,157," I don't know, I like stuff you don't have to think about 
              too much."
30619,Jerry,157, You like Bania's act. You're a closet Bania fan!
30620,George,157, maybe I am.
30621,Jerry,157," Oh, I'm gonna puke."
30622,George,157," Puke! That's a funny word. Puke. (laughing) puke! Don't 
              have to"
30623,Elaine,157, I can't believe we broke up like that.
30624,Elaine,157, Do you want something to read?
30625,Puddy,157, Nah.
30626,Elaine,157," Well, are you going to take a nap or --"
30627,Puddy,157, Nah.
30628,Elaine,157," You're just going to sit there staring at the back of a 
              seat?"
30629,Puddy,157, Yeah.
30630,Elaine,157," That's it! I cannot take this! I mean, look at this, nothing 
              has"
30631,Puddy,157," Tell me about it, I don't know why I ever took you back."
30632,Elaine,157," Please! I took you back. You know it, I know it, vegetable 
              lasagna"
30633,Vegetable Lasagna (apologetically),157, I don't want to get involved.
30634,Elaine,157," Ugh, I hope a giant mountain rises out of the ocean and 
              we just ram"
30635,Vegetable Lasagna,157, Oh god.
30636,Passenger,157, Ow! Ow!!
30637,Newman,157," How much longer you gonna be, I'm starving here."
30638,Kramer,157, Just a few more squirts. Cause I gotta stay juicy.
30639,Newman,157," The smell. It's still with you, huh?"
30640,Kramer,157," Yeah, it's baked on it. Put some butter in. Stir it up 
              so it melts."
30641,Kramer,157," Ahh, now I'm simmering."
30642,Newman,157, I'll meet you at the coffee shop.
30643,Mr. Thomassoulo,157," Good morning, George. Is something wrong with 
              your other leg?"
30644,George,157," Oh, no, that's just the old handicap acting up."
30645,Mr. Thomassoulo,157, But your cane's on the wrong side.
30646,George,157," That's just because we're standing on opposite sides. See, 
              when we"
30647,George,157," See? This looks right to you, doesn't it?"
30648,Mr. Thomassoulo,157," Uh, yeah, I guess."
30649,George (passes cane from right to left and back a few times),157," But, 
              see here. "
30650,Mr. Thomassoulo,157," Will you stop it, George? Just stop it! I think 
              I can see"
30651,George,157," Well, you're not gonna believe what happened."
30652,Jerry,157, You mugged Stephen Hawking?
30653,George,157," Play Now thinks I got problems in both legs. My own personal 
              Rascal,"
30654,Jerry,157," Well it must be comforting to know you'll be going straight 
              to hell at"
30655,Jerry,157, Hello?
30656,Elaine,157, Jerry.
30657,Jerry,157," Hey, Lainie, how's the trip going?"
30658,Elaine,157, Awful. This trip was a *huge* mistake. Huge!
30659,Vegetable Lasagna,157, Please don't shout. I can't take it.
30660,Jerry,157, Who's that?
30661,Elaine,157, It's Vegetable Lasagna.
30662,Jerry,157, Who?
30663,Elaine,157, Vegetable Lasagna!
30664,Vegetable Lasagna,157, My name is Magnus.
30665,Elaine,157, Shut up or I'll snap you in half and stuff you in the overhead!
30666,Jerry,157, Get me some duty free Kahlua.
30667,George,157, How's the trip?
30668,Jerry,157, Sounded good.
30669,Jerry,157," Hey, if you got any juice left, you might wanna roll by 
              the big showcase"
30670,George,157," Ah, you still going on in front of Bania, eh?"
30671,Jerry,157," That's right, and I'll tell you what. I'm feeling a little 
              off."
30672,George,157, What are you talking about? You're not!
30673,Jerry,157," That's right, I'm taking a dive."
30674,George,157, You're throwing the set?
30675,Jerry,157," I'm laying down! Then let's see how he does up there, without 
              all the"
30676,George,157," Listen Jerry. Bania's voice is the voice of a new generation. 
              My"
30677,Jerry,157, We're four months apart.
30678,George,157, nevertheless. His time has come.
30679,George,157," Now if you will kindly help me unwedge my front wheel, 
              I'll be on my"
30680,Newman,157, Butter. Kramer. Butter. Kramer.
30681,Kramer/turkey (waving wing),157, Hey buddy.
30682,Kramer,157," What are you doing? George tells me you're gonna throw 
              your set?"
30683,Jerry,157," That's right, Choochie. Let's see how Bania does without 
              the cushy"
30684,Club Announcer (OC),157," Ladies and gentlemen, Jerry Seinfeld!"
30685,Jerry,157, If you'll excuse me.
30686,Jerry,157," What's the deal with lampshades? I mean if it's a lamp, 
              why do you want"
30687,Jerry,157, And what's with people getting sick?
30688,Newman,157, Hee hee! Yeah yeah!
30689,Jerry,157," I mean, what's the deal with cancer?"
30690,Man in audience,157, I have cancer!
30691,Kramer,157," Oh, tough crowd."
30692,Man,157," Hey, hey! You dented my ride."
30693,George,157," Whatcha got there, the 4 volt? Heh, I did you a favor."
30694,Man,157, How about I do you a favor upside your head?
30695,George,157, Oh yeah?
30696,Man,157, Oh yeah.
30697,Man,157, Hey!
30698,Woman,157, Get the bikes.
30699,Bania,157, Ouch.
30700,Kramer,157, You didn't do so bad.
30701,Jerry,157, What are you talking about? I bombed!
30702,Kramer,157," No, you had some good stuff. The cancer bit? It was edgy, 
              it was not"
30703,Jerry,157, Like who?
30704,Kramer,157, Like that guy who yelled out.
30705,Jerry,157, He had cancer!
30706,Kramer,157, And laughter is the best medicine.
30707,Jerry,157," Hey, sorry Kenny. Guess you got your work cut out for you."
30708,Club Announcer (OC),157," Ladies and gentlemen, Kenny Bania!"
30709,Kramer,157," Hey, Jerry, he could have used your laugh. He was a big 
              turkey out"
30710,Newman (salivating),157, Turkey?
30711,Kramer,157, A big fat turkey.
30712,Newman,157, I'm sorry I missed that.
30713,Kramer,157, He worked so hard and then he just--
30714,Kramer,157," What is this, oregano?"
30715,Kramer,157," Look at me! I'm all covered in oregano and Parmesan, and 
              it's sticking"
30716,Newman,157, Here. Hold this.
30717,Kramer,157," What is this, parsley?"
30718,Jerry,157," Ah, the sweet stench of failure."
30719,Kramer,157," Get off of me, get off of me!"
30720,Man,157, Now I got you!
30721,Mr. Thomassoulo,157, George? Your legs!

30724,Man,157, Eat hickory!!
30725,Bania,157," Hey Jerry, didja see it?"
30726,Jerry,157, Ouch.
30727,Stu,157," Kenny! There you are. Jay Shermak and Stu Crespi from NBC. 
              Listen,"
30728,Jerry,157, What?
30729,Jay,157," That thing you did having the two guys running through? I 
              love stuff you"
30730,Stu,157, Give us a call. We want to be in the Kenny Bania business.
30731,Jay,157," By the way, Jerry? The suspenders? A little hacky."
30732,Bania,157," How about that Jerry? First you had a pilot on NBC and now 
              I'll have"
30733,Jerry,157," Oh, I'm gonna puke."
30734,Bania,157, Puke? That's a funny word. Can I use that?
30735,Elaine,157," David, this has been the worst month of my life and if 
              I never see you"
30736,Puddy,157, Ditto.
30737,Elaine,157, Oh that's origi-
30738,Puddy,157, Shut up.
30739,Elaine,157, 86th and Broadway please.
30740,Cab driver,157," I'm sorry lady, there's a cab shortage. The Transit 
              Police are"
30741,Elaine,157, Oh no.
30742,Vegetable Lasagna,157, Hello! (sees Elaine) Oh no. I'm sorry.
30743,Elaine,157, Noooooooooooo!

              Play Now office)"
30745,Thomassoulo,158," George, 
              youre not really handicapped, are you? "
30746,George,158," Ive 
              had my difficulties. "
30747,Thomassoulo,158," I 
              saw you running down Amsterdam Avenue lifting that 200 pound motorized 
              cart with one hand. "
30748,George,158," Mr. Thomassoulo 
              during times of great stress, people are capable of super human 
              strength. Have you ever seen the Incredible Hulk, sir?"
30749,Thomassoulo,158," No 
              "
30750,George,158," How about 
              the old Spider Man live action show?"
30751,Thomassoulo,158," George, 
              Ive realized weve signed a one-year contract with you, 
              but at this point I think its best that we both go our separate 
              ways. "
30752,George,158," I dont 
              understand."
30753,Thomassoulo,158," We 
              dont like you. We want you to leave. "

30756,Jerry,158," So youre 
              staying at Play Now?"
30757,George,158," Why not? 
              Pay is good. I got dental, private access to one of the great handicapped 
              toilets in the city."
30758,Jerry,158," But they 
              not you arent handicapped, arent you ashamed?"
30759,George,158," Theyre 
              the ones who should be ashamed. They signed me to a one-year contract. 
              As long as I show up for work every day, they have to pay me."
30760,Elaine,158, Hey
30761,Jerry & George,158," 
              (doing the voice) Hello-o-o-o! "
30762,George,158," Hello-o-o-o 
              Elaine!"
30763,Elaine,158," Whats 
              that?"
30764,Jerry,158," Oh, its 
              just this stupid thing. "
30765,Elaine,158," Well, 
              Im sure its stupid. Its not about me, is it?"
30766,Jerry,158," (doing 
              the voice) No-o-o-o."
30767,George,158," (doing 
              the voice) Not at all."
30768,Elaine,158, Tell me!
30769,Jerry,158," All right. 
              You know this girl Clare I am seeing? "
30770,Elaine,158, Yeah.
30771,Jerry,158," Well, he 
              and I starting joking that when she falls asleep her stomach stays 
              awake all night and talks to me."
30772,Elaine,158," How is 
              it talking?"
30773,Jerry,158," Well, her 
              belly button is like a mouth. (doing the voice) Im bored. 
              Talk to me."
30774,Elaine,158," Oh I gotta 
              start taking these ""stupid"" warnings more seriously."
30775,Jerry,158," Hey, look 
              whose here - Puddy. "
30776,Elaine,158," My Puddy? 
              But we broke up."
30777,Jerry,158," And yet 
              he continues to live."
30778,Puddy,158," Hey Benes, 
              How are you?"
30779,Elaine,158," Im 
              doing great. "
30780,Puddy,158," Great. 
              (pauses) See ya."
30781,Jerry,158," Well, thats 
              it. You two are back together."
30782,Elaine,158, What?
30783,Jerry,158," The bump 
              into. The bump into always leads to the backslide."
30784,Elaine,158," David 
              and I will not be getting back together. "
30785,Jerry,158," Elaine, 
              breaking up is like knocking over a coke machine. You cant 
              do it in one push, you got to rock it back and forth a few times, 
              and then it goes over."
30786,George,158," Thats 
              beautiful."
30787,Elaine,158," What about 
              you? You were even engaged, and you cut it off just like that."
30788,Jerry,158," Thats 
              different. I didnt have feelings for those people. But you, 
              youll backslide"
30789,Elaine,158," You want 
              to bet?"
30790,Jerry,158, Stakes?
30791,Elaine,158, 50
30792,Jerry,158, Dollars?
30793,Elaine,158," All right. 
              Witness? (looks at George)."
30794,George,158, Witness.
30795,Jerry,158, Done.
30796,George,158, Percentage?
30797,Jerry & Elaine,158," 
              No."
30798,(Scene,158," At Jerrys 
              apartment)"
30799,Clare,158," So Ill 
              call you tonight?"
30800,Jerry,158, Yeah.
30801,Clare,158," Whats 
              wrong with the belt?"
30802,Jerry,158," I went 
              to the movies last night, I went to the bathroom and I unbuckled 
              a little wobbly and the buckle kind of banged against the side of 
              the urinal. So(throws away belt) thats it!"
30803,Clare,158," So, youre 
              insane?"
30804,Jerry,158," Oh yes, 
              quite."
30805,Kramer,158, Hello!
30806,Jerry,158," Of course 
              its a sliding scale."
30807,Clare,158," Catch you 
              later."
30808,Kramer & Jerry,158," 
              (doing the voice) Hello-o-o-o! (haha)"
30809,Jerry,158," (doing 
              the voice) La la la."
30810,Kramer,158," (doing 
              the voice) La la la."
30811,Kramer,158," Look at 
              this, they are redoing the Cloud Club."
30812,Jerry,158," Oh, that 
              restaurant on top of the Chrysler building? Yeah, thats a 
              good idea."
30813,Kramer,158," Of course 
              its a good idea, its my idea. I conceived this 
              whole project two years ago."
30814,Jerry,158," Which part? 
              The renovating the restaurant you dont own part or spending 
              the two hundred million you dont have part?"
30815,Kramer,158," You see 
              I come up with these things, I know theyre gold, but nothing 
              happens. You know why?"
30816,Jerry,158," No resources, 
              no skill, no talent, no ability, no brains."
30817,Kramer,158," (interrupts) 
              No, notime! Its all this meaningless time. Laundry, 
              grocery, shopping, coming in here talking to you. Do you have any 
              idea how much time I waste in this apartment?"
30818,Jerry,158," I can ball 
              park it."
30819,Elaine,158," (doing 
              the voice) Hello-o-o-o!"
30820,Kramer,158," Here we 
              go; now she comes in. Now my whole day is shot!"
30821,Jerry,158," Hey, I 
              called you last night, where were you?"
30822,Elaine,158," (looking 
              VERY guilty) I went out with a (fake cough) a friend."
30823,Jerry,158, George?
30824,Elaine,158," (looking 
              guiltier) No, nono."
30825,Jerry,158," Well, I 
              was here, thats everyone (laughing)."
30826,Elaine,158, (laughing).

              the same shoes as yesterday?"
30828,Elaine,158," Oh, you 
              know I wear these shoes all the time. "
30829,Jerry,158," Your hair, 
              its somewhat de-poofed. "
30830,Elaine,158," Its 
              the new look. You know Heroin Cheek? "
30831,Jerry,158," Wait a 
              second, whats going on here?"
30832,Elaine,158," Nothing, 
              nothing. "
30833,Jerry,158, (screams).
30834,Elaine,158, (screams).
30835,Jerry,158," Youre 
              wearing the same clothes as yesterday!!! (pauses) You saw Puddy!"
30836,Kramer,158," Hoochie 
              moochie. (haha)"
30837,Jerry,158," Hand it 
              over. Pay up."
30838,Elaine,158," No! Its 
              an isolated, sexual incident. We are not back together!"
30839,Jerry,158," Then what 
              do you call it? People dont just bump into each other and 
              have sex. This isnt cinemax."
30840,Elaine,158," It was 
              no big deal OK? I mean we fooled around, then we went out and grabbed 
              a little dinner. "
30841,Jerry,158," Ah, dinner! 
              Thats it, youre all the way back!"
30842,Elaine,158, Ugh!
30843,Jerry,158," Sex, thats 
              meaningless, I can understand that, but dinner; thats heavy. 
              Thats like an hour."
30844,Kramer,158," (still 
              reading the paper) Man, 2.9 percent financing on a Toyota Onedun 
              (Sp?). That was my idea too!"

              thats the bedroom. Heres the bathroom. If you need to, 
              you can familiarize yourself with the kitchenYeah, go ahead 
              and look through some of the drawers. "

              are?"

              Im Darren. Im new here."
30857,Kramer,158," Yeah, 
              thats Jerry, you dont have to worry about him. Why dont 
              you go across the hall and get started on that mail."
30858,Darren,158, Right!
30859,Kramer,158," Hes 
              a go getter!"
30860,Jerry,158," Whos 
              he? "
30861,Kramer,158," My intern 
              from NYU. Well, you remember my corporation, Kramerica Industries."
30862,Jerry,158, Alright.
30863,Kramer,158," Well, 
              apparently NYU is very enthusiastic about their students getting 
              some real world corporate experience. "
30864,Jerry,158," But you 
              only provide fantasy world corporate experience."
30865,Kramer,158," Well, 
              this will really free up my time so I can focus on more important 
              things, like my bladder system."
30866,Jerry,158," Alright, 
              its time to go. "
30867,Kramer,158," Jerry, 
              its not for people, its for oil tankers."
30868,Jerry,158," (sarcastically) 
              I know!"
30869,Kramer,158," You see 
              the idea is for a rubber ball inside the tanker so if it crashes, 
              the oil wont spill out."
30870,Jerry,158," Actually, 
              that is not a bad idea."
30871,Kramer,158," (smiles) 
              yeah."
30872,Jerry,158," Now, its 
              time to go."

              the voice) Hello-o-o-o. (pauses) So, whats going on?"
30876,George,158,"   Siege mentality   Jerry. They really want me out of here. Theyve 
              downgraded me to some sort of a bunker. Im like Hitlers 
           last days here."
30877,Jerry,158," So, are 
              you going to leave?"
30878,George,158," Oh no! 
              Im vigilant. Theyll never get me out. Im like 
              a weed, Jerry."
30879,Jerry,158," I thought 
              youre like Hitler in the bunker?"

              a weed in Hitlers bunker."
30881,Jerry,158," Im 
              getting a little uncomfortable with the Hitler stuff. (his other 
              line beeps) Im getting another call, see ya(answers

              over at Puddys. I should call him. I need those gloves. No, 
              I better not. Ill call. (looks at table) Oh, look at that! 
              There are the gloves. I was just about to call. There they are.

              have to write all this stuff down."
30902,Darren,158," Well, 
              Mr. Kramer is in a meeting with Mr. Lohmase and he didnt want 
              to miss anything."
30903,Jerry,158," So, how 
              hot did it get?"
30904,George,158," I dont 
              know, 120, 130Then they sent some guys to sandblast for 6 
              hours. Tomorrow they are putting in asbestos. "
30905,Jerry,158," I guess 
              you can take anything, but actual work."
30906,George,158," Bring 
              it on!"
30907,George,158," (doing 

              the voice) Hello-o-o-o Kramer!"
30908,Jerry,158," (doing 
              the voice) Wel-l-l-c-o-m-e!"
30909,George,158," (doing 
              the voice) La la la."
30910,Kramer,158," Sorry 
              I couldnt get out of there, what did I miss? (asking his ""intern"")"
30911,Darren,158," Well, 
              after ordering, Mr. Seinfeld and Mr. Costanza debated on whether 
              or not iron man wore some sort under garment between his skin and 
              his iron suit"
30912,Kramer,158, Uh huh
30913,George,158," (Interrupts) 
              And I still say hes naked under there!"
30914,Jerry,158," Oh that 
              makes a lot of sense."
30915,George,158," Oh, shut 
              up!"
30916,Darren,158," Then 
              Mr. Seinfeld went to the restroom, at which point Mr. Costanza scooped 
              ice out of Mr. Seinfelds drink with his bare hands using it 
              to wash up (Jerry is taking a sip of water and looking mad) then 
              Mr. Costanza remarked to me, ""This never happened."" (Jerry 
              then spits out the water)."

              so funny?"

              (still giggling)"
30921,Clare,158," What are 
              you laughing about? Tell me."
30922,Jerry,158," Oh all 
              right, this is really dumb, really stupid. Weve been doing 
              this silly, dumb voice."
30923,Clare,158," So is it 
              fun humiliating me?"
30924,Jerry,158," No, its 
              not you. Its your stomach, hes taking with this funny, 
              booming, jovial voice. (doing the voice) Hello-o-o-o."

              kind of in the middle of something here. Would you mind coming back 
              later?"
30929,Darren,158," Oh yeah 
              sure, sure. Should we set something up now?"

              leaving too."

30933,Clare,158," He 
              is fat!"
30934,Jerry,158," No, hes 
              just a little bloated."
30935,Clare,158, Good-bye!
30936,Jerry,158," Its 
              mostly water weight."

              gloves were right by the phone. That is pretty funny."
30945,Elaine,158," See, this 
              is what Jerrys doesnt understand. We can see each other. 
              We can see each other every day, but it doesnt mean we are 
              back together."
30946,Puddy,158," I mean 
              I love just seeing you and having sex."

              you sweet heart? Listen, can you give Mr. Thomassoulo a message

              been reviewing Darrens internship journal. Doing laundry"
30966,Kramer,158, Yeah.
30967,Dean Jones,158," Mending 
              chicken wire, hi-tea with a Mr. Newman."
30968,Kramer,158," I know 
              it sounds pretty glamorous, but its business as usual at Kramerica. 
              "
30969,Dean Jones,158," As 
              far as I can tell your entire enterprise is more than a solitary 
              man with a messy apartment which may or may not contain a chicken."
30970,Kramer,158," And with 
              Darrens help, well get that chicken."
30971,Dean Jones,158," Im 
              sorry, but we cant allow Darren to continue working with you."
30972,Kramer,158," Well, 
              I have to say this seems capricious and arbitrary."

              sure youre not still angry about last night?"
30976,Clare,158," No, Im 
              fine. Just as long as you dont ever do that voice again."
30977,Jerry,158, Never?
30978,Clare,158, Never.
30979,Jerry,158," What about 
              if youre not around?"
30980,Clare,158, No!
30981,Jerry,158," So I have 
              to choose between seeing you and doing the voice?"
30982,Clare,158," Thats 
              right."
30983,Jerry,158," I can do 
              that."

              do the voice. (doing the voice) La-la-la. Whats the matter?"
30991,George,158," I think 
              Im getting tired of it. I mean is that all it does? Hello? 
              La-la-la?"
30992,Jerry,158," No, it 

              can do anything. It can be Spanish. (doing the voice) Hola. Hello-o-o-o."

              I like the girl better than the voice."

              well not for long. Im breaking up with him."
31001,Jerry,158," No, I dont 
              think so. Ive seen you two together. You make each other miserable.

31009,Kramer,158," I dont 
              know. I found them in your closet. Ever since Darren left I havent 
              been able to find anything. He took all my clothes to some cleaners. 
              Im clueless. (looks at clock) Is that clock right?"

              oclock."

              care about the internship. I care about Kramerica."
31020,Kramer,158," Kramerica 
              is no more."
31021,Darren,158," What about 
              the oil tanker bladder system? We were going to put an end to maritime 
              oil spills."
31022,Kramer,158," Probably. 
              Darren, you go home. Forget about Kramerica."

              to drink that whole thing?"
31041,Kramer,158," No. No. 
              No. Its for oil tankers. All I need to do is fill some sort 
              of rubber container with oil and then drop it to see whether or 
              not it can restrain the impact."

31081,Jerry,158," Uh, bathroom."
31082,George,158," Hey, use 
              mine. Ill let you in."
31083,Jerry,158," I thought 
              it was open to the public."
31084,George,158," I uh, 
              took care of that."
31085,Jerry,158," Wow! Zanadu 
              . No wonder youre putting in so many hours. (looks at urinal) 
              May I?"
31086,George,158," I insist. 
              Ill fix us a drink. (phone rings  who would that be?) 
              I got it."
31087,Kramer,158," Whew. 
              You know Darren, if you would have told me twenty-five years ago 
              that some day Id be standing here about to solve the worlds 
              energy problems, I wouldve said youre crazy Now 
              lets push this giant ball of oil out the window."
31088,George,158," So, check 
              out my view."
31089,Jerry,158," Wow! Hey, 
              theres Clare. I better go down."
31090,George,158," Hey, theres 
              Kramer & Darren."
31091,Jerry,158," Theres 
              the giant ball of oil. Clares right underneath that thing. 
              Clare! Hello-o-o-o! Hello-o-o-o! Hello-o-o-o!"
31092,Clare,158," I dont 
              believe this. I am not looking up if youre going to 
              do that voice."
31093,Kramer,158," Bombs 
              away (Uh oh)."
31094,Jerry,158," This is 
              going to be a shame."
31095,George,158, Hello.
31096,Kramer,158," Well, 
              that didnt work. Hey, how about thisketchup and mustard 
              in the same bottle? "
31097,Darren,158," Oh that 
              sounds interesting sir."
31098,Kramer,158, Yeah.
31099,(Scene,158," At Monks 
              Caf)"
31100,Jerry,158," Clare won 
              her lawsuit against Play Now. Gee, Play Now is filing for bankruptcy. 
              I guess youre not going in anymore. "
31101,George,158, Yeah.
31102,Jerry,158," So theyre 
              not paying you your"
31103,George,158, No.
31104,Jerry,158," So youre 
              pretty much"
31105,George,158, Yeah.
31106,Jerry,158," What ever 
              happened to Darren?"
31107,Kramer,158," Darren 
              is going away for a long long time. "
31108,Jerry,158," So Clare 
              sure looked real funny covered in oil like that (doing the 
              voice) Hello-o-o-o I got beamed with a giant ball of oil"
31109,George,158," (doing 
              the voice) Im slippery as an eel"
31110,Kramer,158," (doing 
              the voice) La la la."
31111,Jerry,158," Im 
              just so glad its back."
31112,(Scene,158," At Elaines 
              apartment in bed with Puddy AGAIN)"
31113,Elaine,158," See, this 
              is good. This is the way it should be. You know why are we fooling 
              ourselves. We belong together."
31114,Elaine,158, Ah nuts!

31116,Cast,159,
31117,Frank,159, I got no leg room back here. Move your seat forward. 
31118,Estelle,159, That's as far as it goes. 
31119,Frank,159," There's a mechanism. You just pull it, and throw your body 
              weight. "
31120,Estelle,159, I pulled it. It doesn't go. 
31121,Frank,159," If you want the leg room, say you want the leg room! Don't 
              blame"
31122,George,159," All right, Dad, we're five blocks from the house. Sit"
31123,Frank,159," Like an animal. Because of her, I have to sit here like 
              an animal!"
31124,George,159, What is that? 
31125,Frank,159," Doctor gave me a relaxation cassette. When my blood pressure 
              gets"
31126,George,159, Are you supposed to yell it? 
31127,Frank,159, The man on the tape wasn't specific. 
31128,George,159, What happened to the screen door? It blew off again? 
31129,Estelle,159, I told you to fix that thing. 
31130,Frank,159, Serenity nowww! 
31131,Patty,159, So I told Bobby and Lisa that we'd try the new Chinese Spanish
31132,Jerry,159," Oh, I thought we had tickets for the Knicks home opener."
31133,Patty,159," Well I thought this would be more fun so I gave the tickets 
              away."
31134,Jerry,159," What? All right, fine."
31135,Patty,159, Are you mad at me?
31136,Jerry,159," No, I love a good Chinese Spanish whatever it is."
31137,Patty,159, You know... I've never seen you mad. 
31138,Jerry,159, I get peeved. 
31139,Patty,159, Mad. 
31140,Jerry,159, Miffed. 
31141,Patty,159, *Mad*. 
31142,Jerry,159, Irked? 
31143,Patty,159, I'd like to see you get *really* mad. 
31144,George,159, Why does she want you to be mad? 
31145,Jerry,159, She says I suppress my emotions. 
31146,George,159, So what do you care what she thinks. 
31147,Jerry,159, Good body. 
31148,George,159, She probably gets that impression because you're cool.
31149,Jerry,159," But I get upset, I've yelled. You've heard me yell. "
31150,George,159, Not really. Your voice kind of raises to this comedic
31151,Kramer,159, Hey. 
31152,Jerry,159," Kramer, I am so sick of you comin' in here and eatin' all 
              my food."
31153,Kramer,159," (Laughing) What is that, a new bit? "
31154,George,159," I told ya. Hey, any of you guys want to come out and help 
              me fix"
31155,Jerry,159," Sorry, I'm fixing a screen door in the Bronx. "
31156,Kramer,159, I'll do it. 
31157,George,159, Really? You wanna come? 
31158,Kramer,159," Yeah, I love going to the country. "

31163,Elaine,159," I need someone to go with me to Mr. Lippman's son's Bar 
              Mitzvah."
31164,Jerry,159," You know, if you don't bring a guest they save a catering. 
              You"
31165,Elaine,159," (Taking out Boggle) Oh, I don't think that's possible."
31166,Kramer,159," (Holding camera) Get in a little closer. I can't see the 
              screen"
31167,George,159," Dad, the hinges are all rusted here. That's why the wind 
              keeps"
31168,Estelle,159, I hate that old door. Throw it out! 
31169,Frank,159, Serenity now! 
31170,Kramer,159," It might be time to just let her go, Frank. She's worked"
31171,Frank,159, Will you put her to rest for me? 
31172,Kramer,159," Oh yeah, I'll take good care of her. (Rips out the screen 
              door)"
31173,Estelle,159, (From other room) Get George to put those boxes in the
31174,George,159," Dad, what's all this?"
31175,Estelle,159, (From other room) It's junk.
31176,Frank,159," My computers. I've been selling them for two months now. 
              Shut up!"
31177,George,159, You're selling computers?
31178,Frank,159," Two months ago, I saw a provocative movie on cable TV. It 
              was"
31179,George,159," Dad, you know what it takes to compete with Microsoft and"
31180,Frank,159," Yes, I do. That's why I got a secret weapon... my son. "
31181,Jerry,159," Damn it, they gave me cream! I asked for nonfat milk! "
31182,Patty,159, I think they have 1% over there. 
31183,Jerry,159, 1%?! They can kiss 1% of my ass! 
31184,Patty,159," OK, Jerry, enough. I'm not buying it. "
31185,Jerry,159, You're damn right you're not buying it! 
31186,Patty,159, You shouldn't have to try. It's just being open. 
31187,Jerry,159, I'm open. There's just nothing in there. 
31188,Patty,159, Sarcastically) Uh huh. 
31189,Jerry,159," Oh, you think I'm lying about this? "
31190,Patty,159, I think you are. 
31191,Jerry,159," Well, I'm not. "
31192,Patty,159," Yes, you are, liar. "
31193,Jerry,159," Oh, stop it. "
31194,Patty,159," OK, liar. "
31195,Jerry,159, That's enough! 
31196,Patty,159," Ooh, that was good. "
31197,Jerry,159, Really? It felt good.

31203,Elaine,159, Yeah. 
31204,George,159, Wow! I didn't try that 'til I was 23. 
31205,Jerry,159, Well this kid's not just a man. He's a man's man.

31209,Jerry,159," Patty showed me how to get mad. You gotta problem with that? 
            "
31210,Elaine,159, No. 
31211,Jerry,159, Good.

31218,Jerry,159, What do you need it for?

              Let's see"
31220,George,159," Morning, ma. "
31221,Estelle,159, (From another room ) You're late! 
31222,George,159," Morning, dad. "
31223,Frank,159," I'm not 'dad' in the workplace. My professional name is 
              Mr."
31224,Lloyd ,159," (Handing Frank coffee) Morning, George. Two cream, no sugar. 
            "
31225,George,159, What is Lloyd Braun doing here? 
31226,Frank,159, Your mother recommended him. 
31227,George,159," Yeah, of course she did. That's all I ever heard growing 
              up"
31228,Frank,159, I didn't read his resume. 
31229,Braun,159," (Ringing the sale bell) Another sale, Mr. Costanza. Chalk 
              me up on"
31230,George,159, (Inquiring about the chalk board) What is this? 
31231,Elaine,159," So Adam, I just talked to your father, and, apology"
31232,Adam,159, I'm not apologizing. It was great. I told everyone. 
31233,Elaine,159," Yeah, I know. Uh, by the way, could you do me a favor and"
31234,Adam,159, Are you free Friday night? 
31235,Elaine,159," I am, but that is not the point. You are thirteen, and 
              I am"
31236,Adam,159, But I'm a man. The rabbi said so. 
31237,Elaine,159," No. You are not a man. It takes a *long* time to become 
              a"
31238,Adam,159," Well, if I'm not a man, then this whole thing was a sham! 
              First,"
31239,Lippman,159, Who wants cookies? 
31240,Adam,159," As of this moment, I am no longer Jewish. I quit! "
31241,Lippman,159, What? 
31242,Elaine,159," (Eating) Walnuts, mmmmmm. "
31243,Frank,159," You're late again, Costanza, so listen up. Starting tonight, 
              we're"

            "
31245,Frank,159, Serenity now! 
31246,George,159," You know what? It doesn't matter, because I quit! "
31247,Frank,159," I guess your mother was right. You never could compete with 
              Lloyd"
31248,George,159, You wanna sell computers? I will show *you* how to sell
31249,Elaine,159," Adam, you don't become a man overnight. Look at your"

31256,Kramer,159," (Spraying his flowers) Hello, neighbor. "
31257,Jerry,159," Boy, those azaleas are really coming in nicely. "
31258,Kramer,159," Oh, you gotta mulch. You've got to. "
31259,Jerry,159, You barbecuing tonight? 
31260,Kramer,159, (Ringing his wind chimes) Right after the fireworks. 
31261,Jerry,159," So, where do you want to eat tonight? "
31262,Patty,159, How about La Caridad again? 
31263,Jerry,159, Again!? How much flan can a person eat!? 
31264,Patty,159," Jerry, you've been yelling at me all afternoon. "
31265,Jerry,159," Well, I don't think more flan is the answer! "
31266,Patty,159, Maybe I should just leave. 
31267,Jerry,159, 'Maybe'!? 
31268,Patty,159, Good-bye! 
31269,Jerry,159," Double good-bye! (As Patty leaves, open door reveals Kramer,"
31270,Kramer,159," Hey, buddy! "
31271,Elaine,159, (Coming in Jerry's apartment) Hey. Happy New Year!

              talk about"
31274,Elaine,159," Well, then you're free tonight. You know what, I heard"
31275,Jerry,159," That's the last thing she said to me. She wanted to go there 
              also,"
31276,Elaine,159, Whoa. What is the matter? 
31277,Jerry,159, It's Patty. 
31278,Elaine,159," Jerry, you break up with a girl every week. "
31279,Jerry,159, (Crying) What--what is this salty discharge? 
31280,Elaine,159, Oh my God. You're crying. 
31281,Jerry,159, This is horrible! I care! 
31282,Jerry,159," Patty won't call me back. I don't know if I can live without 
              her. "
31283,Kramer,159," She's really gotten to you, hasn't she? "
31284,Jerry,159, I don't know what's happening to me. 
31285,Kramer,159," Simple. You let out one emotion, all the rest will come"
31286,Jerry,159, That was the mother on Bewitched. You mean Pandora. 
31287,Kramer,159," Yeah, well, she... had one, too. (George enters)"
31288,George,159," Jerry, can I talk to you for a second? (They enter Jerry's"

              it! I"
31290,George,159," (hearing Jerry broke up with Patty) Are you still down 
              in"
31291,Jerry,159, You ever heard of a little thing called feelings? 
31292,George,159," Well, I got just the thing to cheer you up. A computer!"
31293,Jerry,159," Porn quotes... I'm so lucky to have a friend like you, George. 
              Ever"
31294,George,159, What? 
31295,Jerry,159," I love you, George. Come here. "
31296,George,159," I-I'm already here. I'm here. I'm here. Uh, you know what?"
31297,Jerry,159, Go wherever you want. I'm still gonna love you. 
31298,Kramer,159," Look what they did. Look what they did to my house! I turn 
              my back"
31299,Jerry,159," Hose under my sink. I love *you*, Kramer! "
31300,Kramer,159," I love you, too, buddy, and George-- "
31301,George,159," I don't want to hear it, Kramer! "
31302,Kramer,159," Listen, when I give you the signal, I want you to turn 
              this"
31303,George,159, What signal? What-what signal? 
31304,Kramer,159," I'll yell, uh, 'Hoochie mama!' "
31305,George,159," If I do it, will you buy a computer? "
31306,Kramer,159," On the signal, George. On the signal. "
31307,George,159, Only if you buy. I gotta make a sale. 
31308,Jerry,159," I love you, Costanza. "
31309,George,159, Will you shut up?! 
31310,Kramer,159," Now! Now, George! Turn on the faucet! George, turn on the"
31311,Elaine,159, So now the *other* Lippman kissed me. 
31312,George,159," Well, sure. They're Jewish, and you're a shiksa. "
31313,Elaine,159, What? 
31314,George,159, It means a non-Jewish woman. 
31315,Elaine,159," I know what it means, but what does being a shiksa have 
              to"
31316,George,159, You've got 'shiksappeal'. Jewish men love the idea of
31317,Elaine,159," Oh, that's insane. "
31318,Elaine,159, I am not buying a computer from you. 
31319,George,159, There's porn. 
31320,Elaine,159, (Pausing) Even so. 
31321,George,159, Damn it! 
31322,Elaine,159," Don't get me wrong, Mr. Lippman. I-I'm very flattered that"
31323,Lippman,159, That's simply not true. 
31324,Elaine,159," If you weren't Jewish, you wouldn't be interested in me.

31325,Lippman,159, You are wrong. I'll prove it. 
31326,Elaine,159," Oh, no. Don't! "
31327,Lippman,159, I renounce Judaism! 
31328,Elaine,159, Oy vey! 
31329,Jerry,159," What happened to you, pal? "
31330,Kramer,159, Joey Zanfino and some of the neighborhood kids. They
31331,Jerry,159, Are you all right? 
31332,Kramer,159," Oh, no. I'm fine. Serenity now. Serenity now. Serenity 
              now."
31333,Jerry,159," So, you're using Frank's relaxation method? "
31334,Kramer,159, Serenity! (He exits)
31335,Elaine,159, Well. You are not gonna believe this. Now Lippman is
31336,Jerry,159," Sit down, Elaine. "
31337,Elaine,159," Oh, no. Jerry, I can't take any more gentle sobbing. "
31338,Jerry,159, I've been thinking about what it means to be complete. 
31339,Elaine,159, Do you have an apple or anything? 
31340,Jerry,159," Look at us, hurtling through space on this big, blue marble. 
            "
31341,Elaine,159, Or a nectarine? I would absolutely love a nectarine. 
31342,Jerry,159, Looking everywhere for some kind of meaning... 
31343,Elaine,159," Why am I in such a fruit mood? Ahh, banana! "
31344,Jerry,159," When all the while, the real secret to happiness has been 
              right in"
31345,Elaine,159, What? 
31346,Jerry,159, Elaine... 
31347,George,159," (Entering Jerry's apartment with a cartload of computers) 
              Jerry,"
31348,Jerry,159, I'm asking Elaine to marry me. 
31349,Jerry,159, Elaine? 
31350,Elaine,159," Uhh, Jerry, I've got a lot goin' on with, uh, Lippman"
31351,Jerry,159, Lippman? 
31352,Jerry,159, Can I help you? 
31353,Elaine,159, No. Stay! Stay. Stay. 
31354,Frank,159," Hey, Braun, Costanza's kicking your butt! "
31355,Frank,159," Costanza, you're white hot! "
31356,Phone,159," If you'd like to make a call, please hang up and-- "
31357,Frank,159," Hey, Braun, I got good news and bad news. And they're both 
              the"
31358,same,159," you're fired. Costanza, you've won the water pik! "
31359,Estelle,159, You're not gonna give away that water pik! 
31360,Frank,159," You wanna bet? Serenity now, serenity now! "
31361,Lloyd,159," You know, you should tell your dad that 'serenity now' thing"
31362,George,159, What do you know? You were in the nut house. 
31363,Lloyd,159, What do you think put me there? 
31364,George,159, I heard they found a family in your freezer 
31365,Lloyd,159, Serenity now. Insanity later. 
31366,Jerry,159," (Entering the hallway to his apartment) What happened here,"
31367,Kramer,159," Serenity now, serenity now... "
31368,Jerry,159, Kramer! 
31369,Kramer,159," Geez! Jerry, I didn't here you come in. Yeah, the children,"
31370,Jerry,159, You don't look well. 
31371,Kramer,159," Well, that's odd, 'cause I feel perfectly at peace with 
              the"
31372,Jerry,159," Oh, I'm sorry. Look at me, I stepped on your last rose. 
            "
31373,George,159, Jerry! I did it! Haha! I beat Braun! 
31374,Kramer,159, (crashing and banging in his apartment) Serenity now! 
31375,George,159," Come on, wanna give me a hand with the computers? "
31376,Kramer,159, (Crashing and banging around) Serenity nooooowwwww! 
31377,George,159, Why couldn't you squeeze one of those stupid rubber balls
31378,Kramer,159," (Leaving) George, you listen to me. I owe ya one. "
31379,Jerry,159, He's incorrigible. You want to talk about it? 
31380,George,159," Oh, please don't tell me you love me again, Jerry, I can't 
              handle"
31381,Jerry,159," George, letting my emotions out was the best thing I've 
              ever done."
31382,George,159, All right... here goes... 
31383,Elaine,159," Rabbi, is there anything I can do to combat this"
31384,Rabbi,159," Ha! Elaine, shiks-appeal is a myth, like the Yeti, or his 
              North"
31385,Elaine,159," Well, something's goin' on here, 'cause every able-bodied"
31386,Rabbi,159," Elaine, there's much you don't understand about the Jewish"
31387,Elaine,159," (About to leave) Well, what does that have to do...? "
31388,Rabbi,159," You know, a member of my congregation has a timeshare in 
              Myrtle"
31389,George,159," So, that's it. All of my darkest fears, and... everything 
              I'm"
31390,Jerry,159," Yikes. Well, good luck with all that. "
31391,George,159, Where you going? I-I thought I could count on you for a
31392,Jerry,159, I think you scared me straight. 
31393,Elaine,159," All right, Jerome, I'm in. "
31394,Jerry,159, What? 
31395,Elaine,159, Maybe we should get married. Maybe everything we need is
31396,Jerry,159," I tell ya, I don't see it happening. "
31397,Elaine,159, What? What happened to the new Jerry? 
31398,Jerry,159, He doesn't work here anymore. 
31399,Elaine,159," Oh, well that's just *great!* "
31400,George,159," I love you, Jerry. "
31401,George,159," You know, all these years, I've always wanted to see the"
31402,Elaine,159," Well, that's because you're an idiot. "
31403,Frank,159," You single-handedly brought Costanza and Son to the brink 
              of"
31404,George,159, Well what about all the Lloyd Braun sales? 
31405,Frank,159," He's crazy. His phone wasn't even hooked up. He just liked 
              ringing"
31406,Estelle,159," I told you to clean out this garage. I have to put my 
              car"
31407,Frank,159," This is a place of business. I told you never to come in 
              here."
31408,Estelle,159, All right... 
31409,George,159," Dad, you really should lay off the 'serenity now' stuff. 
            "
31410,Frank,159," So, what am I supposed to say? "
31411,George,159, 'Hoochie mama'? 
31412,Estelle,159," Move your crap, I'm comin' in! "
31413,Frank,159, No you're not! Hoochie mama! Hoochie mama!

31418,Jerry,160, Are you sure you can't stay longer? 
31419,Morty,160," No, we just came for the funeral. `"
31420,Helen,160," Poor Marvin Kessler, he went too early. "
31421,Jerry,160, He was 96 years old. 
31422,Morty,160," That had nothing to do with it, the man was out of shape. "
31423,Helen,160," That's why we joined a program. We walk once around the block 
        three times a week. "
31424,Morty,160, And every morning I eat a plum. 
31425,Jerry,160," Well, what ever you do, you're wearing me out. "
31426,Helen,160, What about you? 
31427,Morty,160," Yeah, looks like you're getting a little spare tire there, tiger. 
      "
31428,Jerry,160, Really? 
31429,Kramer,160," Hey, Seinfelds! "
31430,Morty,160," Hey, Mr. Kramer! "
31431,Kramer,160, How long are you staying? 
31432,Helen,160, We just came down for a funeral. 
31433,Kramer,160," Oh yeah, yeah I heard, Marvin Kessler. Boy, that makes you think. 
        If he could go... "
31434,Helen,160, See you downstairs with the car. 
31435,Jerry,160, Are you sure you don't need a hand with that? 
31436,Morty,160," No no, the luggage is on the program. I got a brick in here. "
31437,Jerry,160, Did you give blood? 
31438,Kramer,160," No, not giving. hoarding. I'm storing it in to a blood bank. 
        Just in case. "
31439,Jerry,160, In case of what? 
31440,Kramer,160," Jerry, I know myself. If I'm out on the street and it's starts 
        to go down, I don't back off until it's finished. "
31441,Jerry,160, Are we finished? 
31442,Kramer,160, Done. 
31443,Vivian,160," Elaine, I'm so glad you came out. "
31444,Elaine,160, Yeah... 
31445,Vivian,160, You haven't seen Jimmy for years. 
31446,Elaine,160," I know, I'm glad I got to see him before he hit puberty and got, 
        you know all lurchy and awkward. "
31447,Vivian,160," Actually, I'm gonna need someone to look after him tomorrow evening. 
      "
31448,Elaine,160," Tomorrow evening, sure. "
31449,Vivian,160, Do you know anyone responsible? 
31450,Elaine,160, Do I know anyone?? 
31451,Vivian,160," Well, if you think of anybody, give me a call. "
31452,George,160, What are you doing? 
31453,Tara,160," Incense, for the mood. "
31454,George,160," Oh yes, by no means, the mood. Let me know if there's anything 
        I can do to lend support to the mood. "
31455,George,160," Um, cream soda? "
31456,Tara,160, Vanilla. 
31457,Elaine,160," Can you believe that, Vivian doesn't think I'm responsible? "
31458,Elaine,160," I couldn't raise a kid? Come on, I love bossing people around. 
      "
31459,Jerry,160," What happened, I thought you were with Tara tonight? "
31460,George,160," I was, I had to leave. She lit some vanilla incenses. The smell 
        drove me nuts, all I could think about was food, I had to get out of there. 
        We need some pudding here! Pudding! "
31461,Elaine,160, You just left? What did you tell her? 
31462,George,160," I told I had a bus transfer that was only good just for another 
        hour. "
31463,Jerry,160, What? 
31464,George,160," I don't know, I was starving Jerry! "
31465,George,160," Oh, pudding! You want some? "
31466,Jerry,160," Hey, you guys think I'm getting a little...chunky? "
31467,George,160," What are you kidding? We look great! You know what this pudding 
        needs? The skin on the top, you know like your mother used to make it 
        on the stove. "
31468,Jerry,160," Elaine, what do you think? "
31469,Elaine,160," I think you're getting a little pudding under the skin yourself. 
      "
31470,Kramer,160," My service rates went up? You banks are all the same with your 
        hidden fees and your service charges. Well, maybe I'll just take my blood 
        elsewhere, yeah. "
31471,Bank employee,160," Well, we can transfer to another bank for you. "
31472,Kramer,160," Oh, no no no...no more banks. I'm keeping my blood in my freezer 
        with...my money! "
31473,George,160," So eh, what do you say? "
31474,Tara,160, I guess we could use some food in our lovemaking. 
31475,George,160," Ok, we got your...got your strawberries, your chocolate sauce, 
        your pastrami on rye with mustard, your honey... "
31476,Tara,160," Wait wait wait, pastrami on rye with mustard? "
31477,George,160," Oh yeah yeah, don't you know they used pastrami in that movie 
        9 weeks? Remember the pastrami scene? "
31478,Tara,160, No. 
31479,George,160," Well, maybe it was Ghostbusters? Where ever it was, it worked! 
      "
31480,Jerry,160," Didn't go for it, huh? "
31481,George,160, No. 
31482,Jerry,160," So, she didn't appreciate the erotic qualities of the salted cured 
        meats? "
31483,George,160," She tolerated the strawberries and the chocolate sauce, but eh, 
        it's not a meal, you know? Food and sex, those are my two passions. It's 
        only natural to combine them. "
31484,Jerry,160," Natural? Sex is about love between a man and a woman, not a man 
        and a sandwich. "
31485,George,160," Jerry, I'm not suggesting getting rid of the girl. She's integral. 
      "
31486,Jerry,160," Maybe instead of trying to satisfy two of your needs, how about 
        satisfying one of somebody else's. "
31487,George,160," Hey, speaking of which, I found a great way to separate the skin 
        from the top of the pudding without leaving any around the edges; Exacto 
        knife. "
31488,Jerry,160," I told you George, no more pudding. I'm starting a purification 
        program. Keep all that kind of food away from me. "
31489,George,160," Well, I guess these would be out of the question. [pulls out 
        two pudding skins in plastic bags.] "
31490,Jerry,160, What the hell is that? 
31491,George,160, Pudding skin singles. 
31492,Kramer,160," Hey buddy, I'm borrowing all your Tupperware. "
31493,Jerry,160," Oh, why? "
31494,Kramer,160, I closed down my account at the blood bank. 
31495,Jerry,160," What, it...it's here in the building? "
31496,Kramer,160," Right across the hall. What, you wanna go see? "
31497,Jerry,160," No I don't! In fact, if even one corpuscles of that blood should 
        find it's way across that hall I will freak out on you Kramer! Freak out. 
      "
31498,Kramer,160," You know, for a fat guy you're not very jolly. "
31499,Elaine,160," Hey, working out? "
31500,Jerry,160, You know it and I ditched all my junk food. 
31501,Kramer,160, What the heck is going on here? 
31502,Jerry,160," Sorry buddy, clean house. It's all health food. "
31503,Kramer,160," Well, I may have to take it, but I don't have to like it. "
31504,Elaine,160," Vivian left me a message. I guess a certain someone changed her 
        mind about whether someone was responsible enough to watch certain other 
        someone. "
31505,Jerry,160, Is this about me? 
31506,Elaine,160, No. 
31507,Jerry,160," Oh, then I lost interest. "
31508,Elaine,160," Vivian, hi it's Elaine. Yeah, I'm over at Jerry's, I got your 
        message...What? Yeah, he's right here, hold on...[hands the phone to Kramer.] 
      "
31509,Kramer,160," For me? Go...Yeah, what tonight? Yeah, I'll be there...Yeah later. 
        [puts the phone down] Well, somebody's baby-sitting. "
31510,Elaine,160, You? I'm more responsible than you are! 
31511,Kramer,160," Don't be ridiculous. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have to go to 
        fill my freezer with my own blood. "
31512,George,160," Oh, Tara! "
31513,Kramer,160," Hello, Vivian! Oh, this is a nice screen. "
31514,Elaine,160, Kramer... 
31515,Kramer,160, Don't take my money! 
31516,Elaine,160," It is me, you idiot. Hi, all right you've got to get out of here, 
        I'm gonna baby-sit the hell out of that kid. "
31517,Kramer,160," No, I'm the baby-sitter. "
31518,Elaine,160," No no no, you're out, I'm in. Now, hit the road. "
31519,Vivian,160, Elaine? What are you doing here? 
31520,Elaine,160," Kramer is actually sleeping one off, so I thought that I'd help 
        out...[Kramer moans from the bushes] what's that, some raccoon or something...[hits 
        Kramer with a broom.] "
31521,Vivian,160," Well, I guess this would be all right. Jimmy, you remember Elaine? 
        She's gonna watch you tonight. "
31522,Elaine,160," Hi Jimmy. [Jimmy kicks Elaine to the shin.] Ouch! [The screen 
        door hits her in the head.] "
31523,Jerry,160," Hey, what are you doing here? I thought you were baby-sitting 
        at Vivian's. "
31524,Kramer,160, There was an incident. 
31525,Jerry,160," Oh no, where's the blood? [opens the fridge] It's in here isn't 
        it? "
31526,Kramer,160, Would you stop it. 
31527,Jerry,160, What is this? 
31528,Kramer,160, It's Jell-O. 
31529,Jerry,160, What about this? This is blood isn't it?! 
31530,Kramer,160," This is tomato juice, look...[drinks from the bottle.] "
31531,Jerry,160," Ooh, you're sick! You're sick!! "
31532,Kramer,160," Will you calm down. I took all my blood down to Newman's. He 
        let me put it in his meat freezer. "
31533,Jerry,160," Hey, what's going on? Who made pudding? "
31534,Kramer,160," Oh yeah yeah, George he came by and made more of those pudding 
        skin singles. They're delicious. "
31535,Jerry,160," Damn that George, I told him I don't want this stuff around here 
        anymore... "
31536,Kramer,160, Heads up! 
31537,Jerry,160, Aaah... 
31538,Jimmy,160," You're dead, president Lincoln! You're dead! "
31539,Elaine,160, I wish I was dead. 
31540,Jimmy,160, Can I have your juice? 
31541,Elaine,160, As long as you don't put... 
31542,Elaine,160, Thanks for the re-fill. 
31543,Vivian,160," Hey, Elaine! How did it go? "
31544,Elaine,160," Oh, he's...he's a joy... "
31545,Vivian,160, Really? Some sitter have told me he's bit of a handful. 
31546,Elaine,160," Oh, handful of sunshine. I wish I could do this every day. "
31547,Vivian,160," Oh Elaine, that's so good to hear. I've been having a few health 
        problems lately. "
31548,Elaine,160," It's not serious, is it? "
31549,Vivian,160," Well, it might be. Just in case anything does happen, it's nice 
        to know there's somebody like you around. "
31550,Elaine,160," Oh yeah, that eh...that is nice to know. [Pours the juice from 
        the bag back to glass.] "
31551,Jerry,160, Aah! 
31552,Kramer,160," It's ok, Jerry. I'm right here. "
31553,Jerry,160, I can see that! What happened? 
31554,Kramer,160," That knife, it nicked your jugular. You know Jerry, when somebody 
        yells 'heads up', you're not supposed to actually look up. "
31555,Jerry,160, I'll remember that. 
31556,Kramer,160," Anyway, you were lucky that I was there. You lost a lot of blood. 
      "
31557,Jerry,160, What? 
31558,Kramer,160," Oh yeah, you've got three pints of Kramer in you, buddy. "
31559,George,160, Three pints of Kramer's blood? 
31560,Jerry,160," I can feel his blood inside of me. Borrowing things from my blood. 
      "
31561,George,160," Well, so much for purification week. "
31562,Jerry,160," So, how's the fornicating gourmet? "
31563,George,160," Doing quite well, thank you. Yesterday I had a soft boiled egg 
        and a quickie. You know what? If I could add TV to the equation, that 
        would really be the ultimate. "
31564,Jerry,160," George, we're trying to have a civilization here. "
31565,Elaine,160, Hey. 
31566,Jerry,160," Hey, how was baby-sitting? "
31567,Elaine,160," Oh, just great. I found out that Vivian has some kind of medical 
        problem and if the worst happens she wants me to take care of Jimmy. "
31568,Jerry,160," Oh, I'm sure it won't be the worst. "
31569,Elaine,160," It doesn't matter. If anything happens to her, I'm on deck! Scissors 
        mishap, air show disaster, chinese organ thieves...it's a dangerous world. 
      "
31570,George,160," She's right, I heard Kramer got mugged out on the suburbs on 
        a baby-sitting gig. "
31571,Jerry,160, Really? 
31572,Kramer,160," Look at this, look at the hair on the back of my neck. It's all 
        bramble, see it's like thicket back there. Look, I need somebody to shave 
        it for me, huh? "
31573,Jerry,160, I'm not touching that thing. 
31574,Kramer,160," Well, I have to say I'm very surprised and disappointed - blood 
        brother. "
31575,Jerry,160," Oh, no... "
31576,Kramer,160," What? Jerry, I gave you my blood. Listen to your pulse, [takes 
        Jerry hand] hey buddy-hey buddy-hey buddy... "
31577,Jerry,160," Kramer, I'm not shaving your neck. "
31578,Kramer,160," So, my blood is not enough. Would you like a kidney too, because 
        I'll give it to you? I'll rip it out right here and stack it on the table! 
      "
31579,Jerry,160," All right, all right I'll do it, sit down. "
31580,Kramer,160," No no no, I don't have time right now. I'll catch you tonight, 
        we'll do sort of an all over kind of thing, all right? "
31581,Jerry,160, Hello? 
31582,Helen,160," Kramer called, he told that you were in a hospital. "
31583,Jerry,160, Kramer called you? 
31584,Helen,160, He calls every week. Are you all right? 
31585,Jerry,160," Yes, I'm fine. "
31586,Helen,160, He says he's fine. 
31587,Morty,160, Tell him to eat a plum. 
31588,Helen,160," Jerry, you really have to take better care of yourself. We bought 
        you some session with a personal trainer. "
31589,Jerry,160," I don't need a personal trainer. [Kramer comes in] all right I've 
        got to go, we'll talk about this later. "
31590,Morty,160, Plum...[Jerry hangs up.] 
31591,Jerry,160, Why are you calling my parents? 
31592,Kramer,160," Well, maybe if you called more often, I wouldn't have to. Listen, 
        is it all right if I watch a tape in here? "
31593,Jerry,160, Why here? 
31594,Kramer,160," Well, I'm taping Canadian Parliament, you know on C-Span. "
31595,Jerry,160, Ok... 
31596,Kramer,160," Is it all right if I watch it in your bedroom, cause your bed 
        is really nice? "
31597,Jerry,160, Fine... 
31598,Kramer,160, Ok! 
31599,Jerry,160, No no no no no no no no no no! I do not want that in here! 
31600,Kramer,160, Blood! 
31601,Jerry,160, All right. 
31602,Izzy,160," Hello, dough boy. "
31603,Jerry,160, Mr. Mandelbaum? You're the personal trainer? 
31604,Izzy,160," I'm here to whip you in to shape, so grab your jocks - if you need 
        one. It's go-time. "
31605,Vivian,160, Elaine? Elaine? 
31606,Elaine,160," Oh, hi, oh God. I didn't here you come in. "
31607,Vivian,160, Where's Jimmy? 
31608,Elaine,160," I don't know, I don't know...we had HoHos for dinner and then 
        eh...and then he put this plastic bag over his head and started running 
        around until he got tired and then he laid down somewhere I...I tell you 
        I'm no good watching that kid. "
31609,Vivian,160," Sleeping like an angel. Elaine, you're the best. "
31610,Elaine,160," No! I'm a scatter brain. That's why I probably can't hold a job 
        or keep a man! "
31611,Vivian,160," Be quiet. So, will you watch Jimmy tomorrow? "
31612,Elaine,160," All right, but I'm running out of purses here. [takes her purse 
        from a punch ball.] "
31613,Jerry,160," Ok Mr. Mandelbaum, what you want me to do? "
31614,Izzy,160," Drop your purse, and pick up that medicine ball. "
31615,Jerry,160," Is this a gym, or some kind of fitness museum? "
31616,Izzy,160," Not funny, over your head with it. Are you ready? "
31617,Jerry,160, For what? 
31618,Izzy,160, All aboard in the pain train! 
31619,Jerry,160, How many session did my parents paid for? 
31620,Izzy,160," Not enough to make a man of you, daffodil. "
31621,George,160," Oohoho...spicy mustard...woohoho, you're hot tonight! "
31622,Tara,160," Oh, George! "
31623,George,160," And now for the trifecta. [Picks up a hand held TV and gets back 
        under the covers.] "
31624,Tara,160," George? George? What are you doing?! [Pulls the covers off. George 
        is eating a sandwich and watching TV.] "
31625,George,160, Pleasuring you? 
31626,"[5A. Kramer and Newman are making sausages. Tape recorder plays Jackie 
        Davis",160, Manana. Jerry comes in.] 
31627,Jerry,160, What is this? 
31628,Kramer,160, We're making sausages. 
31629,Jerry,160, I thought you were gonna watch a video. 
31630,Kramer,160," Yeah, an instructional video about how to make your own sausages. 
      "
31631,Jerry,160," Kramer, I'm not in a mood for this. "
31632,Kramer,160," All right, all right. Newman, let's go grab some mail sacks and 
        haul these beauties out of here. "
31633,Jerry,160," Blood over there, sausages over here. I'm living in a slaughter 
        house. "
31634,Izzy,160," Tonight I want you to sleep on this. Toughens the vertebrae. [Looks 
        at the sausages] What in holy hell? Sausages? Is this your diet? "
31635,Jerry,160, No they're not mine Mr. Mandelbaum... 
31636,Izzy,160," Don't lie to me, butter bean. We're taking it up a notch. "
31637,Jerry,160," So, the free love buffet is over? "
31638,George,160," I got greedy. Flew too close to the sun on wings of pastrami. 
      "
31639,Jerry,160," Yeah, that's what you did...I can't believe I got another session 
        with Izzy Mandelbaum, he's probably makes me box a kangaroo. "
31640,Jerry,160, What's going on? 
31641,George,160, I don't know. This sandwich is making me flush. 
31642,Jerry,160," Oh no, I'll tell you what you did Caligula; you combined food 
        and sex in to one disgusting uncontrollable urge. "
31643,George,160, I think you're right. You gonna eat that? 
31644,Jerry,160," No, but please tell me that's all you're gonna do with it. "
31645,Elaine,160," Jerry, I tell you; if this woman dies, it is going to be a major 
        inconvenience. "
31646,George,160, These fries are really really good... 
31647,Jerry,160," All right, that's enough of that. [Jerry takes the plates and 
        hands them to a waitress.] "
31648,Elaine,160," I mean I can't shake this woman. You know, now I have to go to 
        Jimmy's birthday party. "
31649,George,160," Uuh, sleepy. "
31650,Elaine,160," No matter what I do, I cannot weasel out of raising this kid. 
      "
31651,Jerry,160," Well, sleepy here is quite a weasel, maybe he can bat for you. 
      "
31652,Elaine,160," Yeah, that's what I need; a pinch weasel. "
31653,Kramer,160, Why did you get rid of that sausage? 
31654,Jerry,160," It wasn't me, it was Mr. Mandelbaum. "
31655,Kramer,160," Yeah well, Newman's not happy, he booted me out of his freezer. 
        Look, I've got to take my blood back to the bank, can I borrow your car? 
      "
31656,Jerry,160, What's wrong with yours? 
31657,Kramer,160," I got no A/C and I gotta keep the blood cold or it'll go bad. 
      "
31658,Jerry,160," All right, but this is it, this is the last favor, we're even! 
      "
31659,Kramer,160," All right, Even Steven. Oh, by the way, when you get back to 
        your apartment try to keep it down because Newman is taking a nap in your 
        bed. "
31660,Kramer,160," Oh, man...[looks to the glove compartment for a manual.] ""If 
        the engine begins to overheat, turn off air conditioner"". Never, 
        I can't do that. "
31661,Kramer,160," Oh, mama... "
31662,Kramer,160," Shees, come on...[opens the radiator]..this thing is bone dry. 
        [Looks at the blood.] "
31663,Elaine,160, Vivian... 
31664,Vivian,160, Elaine! 
31665,Elaine,160, Hi! This is my friend George. 
31666,Vivian,160, Hi... 
31667,Elaine,160, I'm gonna go say hi to Jimmy. 
31668,Vivian,160, Ok. 
31669,Elaine whispers to George,160, You're up. 
31670,Vivian,160," Oh, isn't Elaine fantastic? "
31671,George,160," Yes she is. It's a pity we won't be seeing much more of her. 
      "
31672,Vivian,160," Really, why? "
31673,George,160," Oh, you haven't heard, she's going to live with her grandparents 
        in Redding Pennsylvania. "
31674,Vivian,160, Her grandparent passed away five years ago. 
31675,George,160," Yes they did. I was covering. Elaine has been deported back to 
        Scotland. "
31676,Vivian,160," She's American citizen, I have seen her passport. "
31677,George,160," All right, no more lies. Elaine is been chosen to represent the 
        Upper West Side in the next Biosphere project. "
31678,Vivian,160, I haven't heard anything about another Biosphere. 
31679,George,160, That's because it's underwater. 
31680,Vivian,160, This is insane. 
31681,George,160, Is it? 
31682,Vivian,160, Yes it it. 
31683,George,160," Well, it's all for charity, so what's the difference. "
31684,Vivian,160, You...very knowledgeable. 
31685,George,160," Well, I'm also an architect. Is that pastrami? "
31686,Vivian,160," Yes it is. I find the pastrami to be the most sensual of all 
        the salted cured meats. Hungry? "
31687,George,160, Very. 
31688,Vivian,160," Oh, wait...[Vivian turns the TV on.] Oohh... "
31689,George,160, Vivian!! 
31690,Jerry,160, Is this really necessary? 
31691,Izzy,160," If you wanna live in a butcher shop, I'm gonna treat you like a 
        piece of meat. "
31692,Jerry,160, What if I can't keep up? 
31693,Izzy,160," You lie, you dry. Fire it up, son. "
31694,Izzy Jr.,160," Right dad, Mandelbaum, Mandelbaum... "
31695,Izzy and Izzy Jr,160," Mandelbaum, Mandelbaum...[Izzy Jr. drives ahead, but 
        the car starts jerking] "
31696,Izzy,160," Move it, move it! Get those knees up! Come on, kick it, kick it! 
      "
31697,Jerry,160, What's going on? 
31698,Izzy Jr.,160," There's something wrong with your car. It's dripping something 
        on my feet. Some kind of red liquid. "
31699,Jerry,160," Oh my God, the blood! "
31700,Izzy Jr.,160, Blood!! 
31701,Izzy,160," Get up boy, get up! We got a problem here! Tough it up. This is 
        for real, you've got to want it... "
31702,Elaine,160, So how long did they drag you? 
31703,Jerry,160," Well, for the first quarter mile they thought that I was just 
        doggin' it. "
31704,Elaine,160, Hi George. Hi Jimmy. 
31705,George,160," Yeah, Jimmy why don't you wait outside, you know, play with something. 
      "
31706,George,160, Ouch! 
31707,Jerry,160, What's the kid doing here? 
31708,George,160," I'm baby-sitting! Vivian asked me to raise him if she doesn't 
        make it. "
31709,Jerry,160," Oh, that's a drag... "
31710,Kramer,160, That kid... 
31711,Jerry,160, You put blood in the car?! 
31712,Kramer,160," Jerry, it was overheating. You should take better care of that 
        thing. "
31713,Jerry,160," Well, they told me that I got more blood, so I guess I owe you 
        again. "
31714,Kramer,160, You didn't get the blood from me. 
31715,Jerry,160, Then who? 
31716,Newman,160, Hello Jerry. 
31717,Jerry,160, Aaaaahhh...!!!

31721,JERRY,162, Why were you making gravel?
31722,KRAMER,162, Well ... I like the sound it makes when you walk on it.            
31723,JERRY,162, Of course. It's garbage.
31724,KRAMER,162," No, no, no, no. These brown things. The chairs. Jerry, 
              this is the set from the old Merv Griffin "
31725,JERRY,162," Yeah, at least in the dumpster behind the Smithsonian."
31726,KRAMER,162," Look at this. Boy, one minute Elliot Gold is sitting on 
              you and the next thing - "
31727,JERRY,162," Come on, Kramer, get out of there."
31728,KRAMER,162," No, no, no. You go on ahead. I'm not finished taking this 
              in."

31730,GEORGE,162," You know I uh, spilled a yohgurt smoothie in here two days 
              ago. Can't smell anything, can "
31731,MIRANDA,162, Banana?
31732,GEORGE,162, Right.
31733,MIRANDA,162, George watch out for those pigeons.
31734,GEORGE,162, Oh they'll get out of the way. You really smell banana?
31735,MIRANDA,162, Oh my God. Oh.
31736,GEORGE,162, So uh where are we eating?
31737,JERRY,162, And it was his idea to put a sprig of parsley on the plate.
31738,CELIA,162, You're making this up. There was never a Joseph Garnish.
31739,JERRY,162, Wow! 
31740,CELIA,162, Oh yeah the toys.
31741,JERRY,162, Where did you get all these?
31742,CELIA,162," My dad was a collector. I inherited them after he died from 
              a long and painful bout ..."
31743,JERRY,162," Super bowl! Hey, an original G. I. Joe. With a full frogman 
              suit. "
31744,CELIA,162," Jerry, what are you doing?"
31745,JERRY,162, I'm putting this on him and we're going to the sink.
31746,CELIA,162, No Jerry. They're priceless. They've never been played with.
31747,JERRY,162, I just want to touch them a little.
31748,CELIA,162, I said no. Now come here. 
31749,LOU,162, Hi I'm Lou Filerman. I'm new here. 
31750,ELAINE,162, Hey Walter what is the deal with that guy?
31751,WALTER,162," Oh he's Lou Filerman. He's new here. Hey your coffee stain 
              looks like Fidel Castro."
31752,ELAINE,162, You've been an enormous help.
31753,JERRY,162, You ran over some pigeons? How many?
31754,GEORGE,162," What ever they had. Miranda thinks I'm a butcher but it's 
              not my fault is it? Don't we have a deal with the pigeons?"
31755,JERRY,162," Of course. We have a deal. They get out of the way of our 
              cars, we look the other way on the statue defecation. "
31756,GEORGE,162," Right! And these pigeons broke the deal. I will not accept 
              the blame for this."
31757,JERRY,162, So Maranda's cooled on y'a?
31758,GEORGE,162, I'm getting nothing.
31759,JERRY,162," Yeah, me neither."
31760,GEORGE,162, Really? I thought you and Celia were sleeping together?
31761,JERRY,162," Oh, the sex is wild but she's got this incredible toy collection 
              and she won't let me near it!"
31762,GEORGE,162, I don't understand women.
31763,JERRY,162, Here comes one.
31764,ELAINE,162, Hey. What's going on?
31765,GEORGE,162, Hey <sees coffee marks> Art Garfunkle?
31766,ELAINE,162," No, Castro."
31767,GEORGE,162, Right.
31768,ELAINE,162," All because of this creepy new guy at work. He just - he 
              just comes out of nowhere and he's right "
31769,JERRY,162, So he just sidles up?
31770,ELAINE,162, That's right! He's a real sidler.
31771,JERRY,162, Maybe you didn't see him.
31772,ELAINE,162," You never see him. He sidled me again in my office. I was 
              sitting there making a cup of soup"
31773,JERRY,162, Hakuna Matata?
31774,ELAINE,162, I thought I was alone.
31775,JERRY,162, That doesn't make it right.
31776,JERRY,162," See, to me, the Hakuna Matata is not nearly as embarrassing 
              as the cup of soup ..."
31777,ELAINE,162, Would you just let it go?
31778,KRAMER,162," Hey, Jerry! Come in here a sec! Hey!"
31779,JERRY,162, Oh my God!
31780,KRAMER,162, It's the Merv Griffin set
31781,JERRY,162, How did you get this in here?
31782,KRAMER,162," Oh, you just bring it in sideways and hook it."
31783,JERRY,162, So where are you gonna sleep?
31784,KRAMER,162, Yeah ... backstage. 
31785,ELAINE,162, Phew! This chair smells like garbage.
31786,KRAMER,162," Oh, well a lot of the stars from the 70's - they were not 
              as hygienic as they appeared on TV"
31787,JERRY,162, I'm gonna get that. 
31788,KRAMER,162," All right. Well, Jerry, we'd love to have you back anytime< 
              Jerry exits> Well, Elaine Benes! "
31789,ELAINE,162, <giggles>
31790,GEORGE,162, We had a deal!
31791,ELAINE,162," Mr. Peterman, here are these pages that you wanted."
31792,PETERMAN,162," One moment. I'm reading the most fascinating article 
              on the most fascinating people of the "
31793,ELAINE,162, What? 
31794,JERRY,162," So three dates and she still won't let me play with her 
              toys."
31795,KRAMER,162," That's interesting. You know someone mentioned to me you 
              were not very happy with your toys growing up."
31796,JERRY,162," Yeah, that was me."
31797,KRAMER,162," Oh, that's right, right, right. And uh you mentioned that 
              uh, you didn't get a G.I. Joe. You had."
31798,JERRY,162, An Army Pete.
31799,KRAMER,162, Right.
31800,JERRY,162," He was made of wood and in the rain he would swell up and 
              then split."
31801,KRAMER,162, And we all know how painful that can be.
31802,ELAINE,162, Jerry
31803,KRAMER,162," Oh, Elaine Benes. Well, this is quite a thrill, yes. Come 
              on sit down. Yes."
31804,ELAINE,162," Well, I'll tell ya, this sidler guy is really chapping 
              my hide."
31805,KRAMER,162, Excuse me yeah. We're talking ... this way.
31806,ELAINE,162," Well, he's getting credit for work I did! He's gonna sidle 
              me right out of a job."
31807,KRAMER,162," Now, for those of us who don't know, uh, sidling is what?"
31808,ELAINE,162," Kramer, what is wrong with you?"
31809,KRAMER,162, What do you mean?
31810,ELAINE,162," Well, for starters, you're looking at note cards <to 
              Jerry> I'm gonna have to give that guy a taste "
31811,JERRY,162," You, sidle? You ... you stomp around like a Clydesdale!"
31812,ELAINE,162, Not with these honeys. ... Wrestling shoes!
31813,KRAMER,162, Only in New York. ... ha ha 
31814,GEORGE,162, Jerry? 
31815,KRAMER,162," Oh! Well, ladies and gentlemen! It's our good friend, George 
              Costanza! What a surprise! "
31816,GEORGE,162," Well, it happened again."
31817,JERRY,162, What happened?
31818,KRAMER,162," tut tut , I'll ask the questions. What happened?"
31819,GEORGE,162," Well, I just stomped some pigeons in the park. They - they 
              didn't move."
31820,KRAMER,162," All right, let's change the subject. Now, uh you and Jerry 
              dated for a while. Tell us ... what "
31821,GEORGE,162," I I don't get these birds! They're breaking the deal. It's 
              like the pigeons decided to ignore me!"
31822,JERRY,162, So they're like everyone else.
31823,KRAMER,162," <laughs too loudly> All right, let's take a short 
              break. .... Okay! We're back!"
31824,GEORGE,162, Boy that bank clock is eight minutes off.
31825,MIRANDA,162, Then why don't you just run IT over too?
31826,GEORGE,162, Zing.
31827,MIRANDA,162," George, what are you doing?"
31828,GEORGE,162," Did you see that? That-that pigeon didn't move! I had to 
              swerve to get out of the way! I saved "
31829,MIRANDA,162," What pigeon? You drove right onto that squirrel. <leaves 
              the car>"
31830,GEORGE,162," Squirrel? Well, we have no deal with THEM!"
31831,CELIA,162, Jerry! Those hands! They never stop!
31832,JERRY,162, I'm sorry. You got any booze? Let's say you and I get ripped!
31833,CELIA,162, No thanks. I have a headache. Can you just get me an aspirin?
31834,JERRY,162," All right. <Jerry checking in the medicine cabinet for 
              bottles that say ""cause drowsiness"">"
31835,LOU,162, Here's the new copy you wanted. 
31836,PETERMAN,162," Ah, yes. Well this certainly looks like a lot of words. 
              In record time. I'm very impressed ... "
31837,ELAINE,162, <quietly standing behind Lou> Thank you. ha ha 
31838,PETERMAN,162," Unfortunately, I am also disgusted. This is incoherent 
              dribble! This is a total redo and I'm "
31839,ELAINE,162," Well, I guess we'll just <Lou has left> Hey, just 
              gimme that. "
31840,JERRY,162," <playing with the toys while Celia is sleeping> Mission 
              accomplished! Back to base, Joe."
31841,MIRANDA,162," Doctor, is the squirrel going to live?"
31842,DOCTOR,162," There's been massive trauma. We could of course try to 
              save him but it would be costly, "
31843,GEORGE,162," Well, uh, are there any other options?"
31844,DOCTOR,162, We could put him to sleep.
31845,GEORGE,162, What might that cost?
31846,DOCTOR,162," Well, it's by the pound. So ... about 80 cents."
31847,GEORGE,162," Well? <Miranda hits George> I was just - I'm curious, 
              that's all. We, uh. we'd like you to do "
31848,DOCTOR,162," He, um. he's not going to be the same, you know?"
31849,GEORGE,162, yeah. yeah. I know.
31850,GEORGE,162, So they're flying the tiny instruments in from El Paso.
31851,KRAMER,162, El Paso? I spent a month there one night.
31852,NEWMAN,162, <laughs>El Paso! 
31853,JERRY,162, What's he here for?
31854,KRAMER,162," To take some of the pressure off of me. So, Jerry, what's 
              going on with you? I understand "
31855,JERRY,162," Well, actually, it's kind of a funny story because she has 
              this amazing toy collection and last night"
31856,KRAMER,162," Well. It sounds like things are progressing. Do I hear 
              wedding bells?"
31857,NEWMAN,162, Are you married right now?
31858,JERRY,162," Actually she doesn't even know about the toys. I gave her 
              the wrong kind of medicine and "
31859,KRAMER,162," What do you mean ""wrong kind of medicine""?"
31860,JERRY,162, She's even got that old Matel football game that we love!
31861,GEORGE,162," Oh, come on! You gotta get me over there!"
31862,KRAMER,162," Wait a minute, wait a minute! You mean to say that you 
              drugged a woman so you could take "
31863,NEWMAN,162, I told you he was a risk.
31864,JERRY,162," Oh, like he's not just carrying you! And has been for years!"
31865,NEWMAN,162," Yeah? Well, you bombed! That story stunk worse than these 
              chairs!"
31866,KRAMER,162," Smile, everyone! We're back! "
31867,LOU,162," You wanted to see me, Elaine?"
31868,ELAINE,162," Yes, Lou. you've got a lot going for you. You're, ... um 
              ... you're spontaneous. You're "
31869,LOU,162, My dead tooth?
31870,ELAINE,162, No. Your. <breathes>
31871,LOU,162, My breath?
31872,ELAINE,162, Eechh. 
31873,LOU,162, What can I do?
31874,ELAINE,162," Well, you should never ever go anywhere without these. 
              <Tic Tacs>"
31875,LOU,162," Thanks, Elaine. You're such a super lady! <he clicks ans 
              clicks now when he walks>"
31876,GEORGE,162, More wine and turkey? <Pours Celia more wine>
31877,CELIA,162, What is that stuff in turkey that makes you sleepy?
31878,JERRY and GEORGE,162, Triptaphen.
31879,JERRY,162, ... I think. Have some more wine. 
31880,CELIA,162, What video did you get?
31881,JERRY,162," Oh, George brought home movies of his boyhood trip to Michigan."
31882,GEORGE,162, Four hours.
31883,JERRY,162, More heavy gravy?
31884,GEORGE,162," <playing with toys> Yes! Touch down! Your turn, Jerry.            "
31885,NEWMAN,162," Lately, though, I've been, uh, - I've been buying the generic 
              brand of waxed beans. you know. "
31886,KRAMER,162," Well, we've officially bottomed out. Who's our next guest?"
31887,NEWMAN,162, We've got no one!
31888,KRAMER,162, We need a new foreman. We should shut down and re-tool.            
31889,NEWMAN,162, What about a guest-host?
31890,KRAMER,162, I'll pretend I didn't hear that.
31891,MIRANDA,162," Doctor, how's the squirrel?"
31892,GEORGE,162, Is he dead?
31893,DOCTOR,162," No. Fortunately, the special tiny instruments arrived just 
              in time. Would you like to visit him?"
31894,MIRANDA,162, Yes he would.
31895,DOCTOR,162, You have 30 minutes. <exits>
31896,GOERGE,162," So ... uh, squirrel."
31897,DOCTOR,162," One more thing Mister Costanza, we just need to know what 
              time you'll be picking him up "
31898,GEORGE,162, What's that?
31899,DOCTOR,162," Oh, we're discharging the squirrel. We think he'll be better 
              off at home."
31900,GEORGE,162, He has no home. He's a squirrel.
31901,DOCTOR,162," Your home, Mister Costanza. Just make sure he gets his 
              medicine six times a day and keep his "
31902,JERRY,162, Maybe it'll be fun having a pet.
31903,GEORGE,162," It's not a pet! It's a wild invalid! And it knows that 
              I tried to kill it. As soon as it gets better, it's "
31904,KRAMER,162," Jerry, what are you doin' tomorrow? I want you to come 
              by the set."
31905,JERRY,162," What about my ""questionable material""?"
31906,KRAMER,162," Nope, we got a whole new format. Edgy, youthful, plus ... 
              we got Jim Fowler!"
31907,JERRY,162," Jim Fowler? The animal guy from ""Wild Kingdom"" 
              is coming to your apartment?"
31908,KRAMER,162," Well, I practically raised his kids."
31909,GEORGE,162," That's perfect! He's a zoo guy! He take's care of animals. 
              Can I bring the squirrel by?"
31910,KRAMER,162," What? Two animal acts on the same show? What is this, amateur 
              hour? Look, George, I'm "
31911,GEORGE,162," I gotta get to Fowler. I know that he would take this squirrel 
              off my hands. It's practically "
31912,ELAINE,162," Hey! ha ha Nice sidle, huh? Speaking of which I think I 
              got that problem solved."
31913,JERRY,162, Tic-Tacs worked?
31914,ELAINE,162, He's a human maraca.
31915,GEORGE,162," Boy, my knuckles are still cramped from that football game."
31916,ELAINE,162, You took him over to Celia's?
31917,JERRY,162, What? It's a victimless crime.
31918,ELAINE,162," What about the woman who's been drugged and taken advantage 
              of?"
31919,JERRY,162," Okay, one victim."
31920,ELAINE,162, I think it's unconscionable.
31921,GEORGE,162," Hey, last night, I found a whole Weeble Village right behind 
              the EZ Bake oven."
31922,ELAINE,162, EZ Bake oven?
31923,ELAINE,162, Who wants cupcake?
31924,GEORGE,162," Oh, me, me, me, me, me!"
31925,JERRY,162," You know, that batter is, like, 30 years old."
31926,FRANK,162, <on TV> You step on it and it flushes.
31927,ELAINE,162, Why is your father giving a tour of a rest stop?
31928,ESTELLE,162, <on TV> Stop squirming.
31929,GEORGE,162," Oh, don't look. This is the part where they change me."
31930,JERRY,162, You're like eight years old.
31931,ESTELLE,162, <on TV> Georgie.
31932,GEORGE,162, I was seven and a half.
31933,PETERMAN,162, That noise. that's the noise. 
31934,ELAINE,162, What?
31935,PETERMAN,162," That inferno rattling sound that has plagued me these 
              past two days - and I could not find the "
31936,ELAINE,162," No, no, Mr. Peterman that wasn't me!"
31937,PETERMAN,162," That reminds me of the Hatian Voodoo rattle torture! 
              You haven't gone over to their side"
31938,ELAINE,162, No Mister Peterman.
31939,PETERMAN,162," Because, if I hear one more rattle - just one - your 
              out on your can And if you are undead - "
31940,ELAINE,162, Lou! In here! We have to talk.
31941,LOU,162," Oh, right. "
31942,ELAINE,162," <Takes the Tic Tacs away from Lou> No, stop it! Bad 
              voodoo. You gotta stop using these."
31943,LOU,162, Why?
31944,ELAINE,162, Because they're turning your teeth green?
31945,LOU,162, I only buy the white ones.
31946,ELAINE,162," Okay ... well then your teeth are green for a different 
              reason. Just stop carrying these, okay? "
31947,LOU,162, I can't. It burns my cankers.
31948,ELAINE,162, Binacca?
31949,LOU,162, Again.
31950,ELAINE,162," Right, right, cankers. Um, I got it! Chew gum!"
31951,LOU,162," I hate gum. The only guy I ever liked came with the Mickey 
              Mouse gumball machine. They stopped "
31952,ELAINE,162," Well, stinky, this is your lucky day."
31953,KRAMER,162," Okay. a little later, we're gonna be talking with animal 
              expert Jim Fowler."
31954,FOWLER,162, Where are the cameras?
31955,KRAMER,162," But first, we're talking with Jerry. Okay, Jerry, uh, you 
              drugged a woman in order to play with "
31956,JERRY,162, It was great! I've done it a few more time since then.
31957,KRAMER,162, And she doesn't know anything about this?
31958,JERRY,162," No, not a thing. "
31959,Newman,162, laughs
31960,KRAMER,162," Well, Jerry, we have a little surprise for you! Come on 
              out, Celia!"
31961,CELIA,162, What kind of a sick twisted creep are you?
31962,NEWMAN and KRAMER,162, Woah.
31963,JERRY,162, What is this? What is she doing here?
31964,KRAMER,162, It's the new format. Scandals and Animals. Go with it.
31965,CELIA,162," If you think you can drug me and play with my toys, you 
              got another thing coming, buddy!"
31966,NEWMAN,162, Go girl!
31967,JERRY,162," Well, what kind of woman drinks a whole box of wine?"
31968,NEWMAN and KRAMER,162, Ohhh!
31969,GEORGE,162," Mister Fowler, I have a squirrel here that is a miracle 
              of modern science!"
31970,KRAMER,162, George I told you we're booked!
31971,FOWLER,162, Careful. Hawks and squirrels don't get along together.
31972,KRAMER,162," Ohhh. another interesting confrontation. This could be 
              spicy. Yeah, George bring him over."
31973,FOWLER,162," No, you idiot! Hawks eat squirrels!"
31974,KRAMER,162, Are we getting this?
31975,JERRY,162, So the whole set was destroyed?
31976,KRAMER,162," Well, the squirrel kept scurrying and the hawk kept clawing."
31977,GEORGE,162," Well, at least we know the prosthetic squirrel hips work 
              ... sorry about the set."
31978,KRAMER,162," I tell y'a it was a grind trying to fill 10 hours a week. 
              I'm not sure I was ready to have my own "
31979,MIRANDA,162," I got the nut bread, George. Let's go. <exits>"
31980,JERRY,162, So the squirrel's gonna make it?
31981,GEORGE,162," Yeah, he's in my bed. I'm sleeping on the couch."
31982,JERRY,162, Sleeping on the couch? So you're...
31983,GEORGE,162," Still getting nothing! So go ahead pigeons. Laugh it up. 
              I'm getting in my car now and the last "
31984,CELIA,162," I'm glad you called, Elaine. I really needed to talk to 
              someone."
31985,ELAINE,162," Oh well, hey, I dated Jerry too. I know what a monster 
              he can be. More wine and turkey?"
31986,CELIA,162, Who's he? <Lou>
31987,ELAINE,162," Oh, he's nobody. Hey, listen, ... let me top that off for 
              y'a."

31995,Jerry,163, But why?

32012,Kruger,163," Your background is impressive George, but how does it apply to 
        what we do here, at Kruger Industrial Smoothing? "
32013,George,163," Well, at the Yankees it was all about smoothing things over, 
        you know, chiseling away, grinding down. In fact we used to call it 'the 
        grind'. "
32014,Kruger,163, It says here that you worked at Play Now for four days? 
32015,George,163," That should be 14, let me just...[corrects it with a pen.] "
32016,Kruger,163," George, I have to honest; I could go either way with you...but 
        what the hell, we need someone, huh. "
32017,George,163," You won't regret this, sir. "
32018,Kruger,163, I don't care. Let's find you an office. 
32019,[Kruger leaves and George notices a photograph on the table,163," Kruger's 
        family and George on the background.] 

        [Monk's cafe. Jerry, George and Kramer.] "
32020,George,163,"...and then when I saw the photo I remembered where I'd seen him; 
        the boom box incident. "
32021,Jerry,163, The boom box incident? 
32022,George,163," Summer of '89 I'm at the beach. This family sits up next to me. 
        I go in to the surfs and when I come from out, my clothes, my towel, my 
        umbrella, they're all gone. I am furious, I start screaming to these kids 
        demanding my stuff back and finally I lose it; I grab their boom box and 
        I chuck it in to the ocean. "
32023,Jerry,163, Seems reasonable. 
32024,George,163," Then I see my clothes floating out there. The tied took them 
        out, not the kids. "
32025,Jerry,163, Even more reasonable. 
32026,George,163," So now, the father is screaming at me, he's demanding that I 
        pay for the boom box. Finally, I gave them a fake address and got the 
        hell out of there. "
32027,Jerry,163, And that guy is your new boss? 
32028,George,163, Until that stupid photo jogs his memory. 
32029,Kramer,163," Kruger? That's not Kruger Industrial Smoothing, is it? "
32030,George,163, Yeah. 
32031,Kramer,163," Grinders, sanders, wet stones. They are the ones who botched 
        the Statue of Liberty job. "
32032,Jerry,163," Right, they couldn't get the green stuff off. "
32033,George,163," It is a horrible company. There's no management what so ever. 
        I could go hog wild in there. "
32034,Kramer,163," You now what you do? You sneak that photo out of there for couple 
        of days and get it air brushed. "
32035,George,163, Like retouched. 
32036,Kramer,163," You remember that photo of me and Gerald Ford and I took it in. 
        Got that Ford right out of there. "
32037,George,163," Oh, this is good. This Kruger guy is clueless. I can't wait to 
        work for him. "
32038,Kramer,163," Look at this. This sandwich is terrible. Everywhere you go, they 
        give you this misshaped shardy meat. Look at this... "
32039,Kramer,163, I haven't had a decent sandwich in 13 years. 
32040,Jerry,163, Neither have I. 
32041,Kramer,163," Hey, our meat problems are solved. "
32042,Jerry,163, Where did you get this thing? 
32043,Kramer,163," I traded it to my sausage press. Look how thin that is, see that's 
        all surface area. The taste has nowhere to hide. "
32044,Elaine,163, Hey. 
32045,Kramer,163," Hey, spice. [gives Elaine a piece of meat.] Welcome to flavor 
        country. "
32046,Elaine,163," Yeah, that's pretty good. "
32047,Jerry,163," Hey, I got a date with that doctor you met. "
32048,Elaine,163, Sara Sitarides? 
32049,Jerry,163, Mmhu. 
32050,Elaine,163, Oh...[falls in to the sofa.] 
32051,Jerry,163, What's with you? 
32052,Elaine,163," You remember that next door neighbor of mine, the apartment that 
        always smells like potatoes? "
32053,Jerry,163, Your whole building smells like potatoes. 
32054,Kramer,163," You know, that happened to Lomez, so he blew his neighbor's circuit. 
      "
32055,Elaine,163, How do you do that? 
32056,Kramer,163," Yeah well, that's easy. Just let me finish this mile high and 
        I'll be right with you. Oh, and Jerry, we are gonna need a case of Kaiser 
        rolls. "
32057,Jerry,163, I think we might have one left in the stock room. 
32058,Kramer,163, This hallway smells like potatoes. 
32059,Elaine,163," I know, I know, this is it. [points to a door.] "
32060,Kramer,163," Ok, oh, you see this socket it's probably connected to her apartment. 
        So what we'll do, we'll take this paper clip and bend it so it'll short 
        out the entire circuit. Here you go... "
32061,Elaine,163, I think I'll let you do it. 
32062,Kramer,163," No no no. It's easy, you just...do it quickly. "
32063,Elaine,163," No, I really don't want to. "
32064,Kramer,163," Well, I don't want to either. "
32065,Elaine,163, I thought you had done this before. 
32066,Kramer,163, It's just...it's no picnic. 
32067,Elaine,163," Well, how are we gonna do it? "
32068,Kramer,163," Alright, fine fine, I'll do it. "
32069,Kramer,163, Oh mama. 
32070,Elaine,163, Are you okay? 
32071,Kramer,163, I will lose that nail. 
32072,Sara,163," I enjoy the challenge of medicine. Naturally you have no idea what 
        it's like to have someone's life depending on you. "
32073,Jerry,163," Well, I have this neighbor... "
32074,Sara,163," A joke. Do you have any idea how it feels like to save someone's 
        life? "
32075,Jerry,163, Is it anything like hitting a home run in softball? 
32076,Sara,163, No. 
32077,Jerry,163, Cause I hit a whopper last week! 
32078,Clerk,163," Here you go, airbrushed in to sand and sky. "
32079,George,163, What did you do here? You took out the wrong guy. 
32080,Clerk,163, I thought you said you wanted to be out? 
32081,George,163," Well, I'm still here. You took out the other guy! "
32082,Clerk,163, You've really lost a lot of hair. 
32083,George,163, I am aware! 
32084,Elaine thinking,163," Hmm, the world's best pizza cutter. 76 bucks, how often 
        do I make...oh, I've gotta buy a book. "
32085,Elaine,163, The cat. 
32086,Jerry,163, He took out Kruger? 
32087,George,163," I just pray Kruger doesn't realize that it's gone until this 
        guy can fix it up. "
32088,Kramer,163, This slicer is indomitable. 
32089,Jerry,163, Where did you get that butcher's coat? 
32090,Kramer,163," You buy enough meat, they'll give you anything. "
32091,Elaine,163," Kramer, my neighbor has a cat. When you blew the power, we must've 
        shut off the automatic feeder. "
32092,Kramer,163," See, that's the same thing that happened to Lomez. "
32093,Elaine,163, What did he do about it? 
32094,Kramer,163," Well, he moved to a hotel and the cat eventually died. "
32095,Elaine,163," Well, this meowing is absolutely worst than the alarm. "
32096,Kramer,163," Oh, that's a prickly one. "
32097,Elaine,163," Yeah, how's the doctor date? "
32098,Jerry,163," Eh, died on the table. Just spent hour and a half making me feel, 
        if I don't save lives, I'm worthless. "
32099,Elaine,163," Well, she's very focused. Dermatology is her life. "
32100,Jerry,163, Dermatology? 
32101,Elaine,163," Yes, she's a dermatologist. "
32102,Jerry,163," Saving lives? The whole profession is; eh, just put some aloe 
        on it. "
32103,Kramer,163," The slicer! Elaine, let's go. "
32104,Elaine,163, Where are we going? 
32105,Kramer,163, The cat. Just grab that meat and let's ride. 
32106,George,163, When are you going on your next date with her? 
32107,Jerry,163," Oh, what's the point? "
32108,George,163," What, you're gonna pass up a wonderful opportunity to put that 
        aloe pusher in her place? "
32109,Jerry,163, Revenge date? That sound like you more than me. 
32110,George,163," This good be so sweet, Jerry. Saving lives? She's one step away 
        working at the clinique counter! "
32111,Jerry,163, Dermatologist? Skin doesn't need a doctor! 
32112,George,163," Of course not! Wash it, dry it, move on! "
32113,Jerry,163, You're right. I'm gonna call her right now and tell her off. 
32114,George,163," No no no no no, this has to be carefully orchestrated. You go 
        to a fancy dinner, flowers... "
32115,Jerry,163, Flowers? 
32116,George,163," Yeah, you gotta do it classy [wipes his mouth to his sweater.] 
      "
32117,Jerry,163," So, you've done this? "
32118,George,163," Almost. Couldn't get the girl go out with me the second time. 
      "
32119,Kramer,163, I think we are looking half a millimeter. 
32120,Elaine,163, Can it cut that thin? 
32121,Kramer,163," Oh, I've cut slices so thin, I couldn't even see them. "
32122,Elaine,163, How did you know you cut it? 
32123,Kramer,163," Well, I guess I just assumed. "
32124,Elaine,163," Hold on kitty, dinner's coming. "
32125,Kramer,163," Yeah, that's a hall of famer. "
32126,Elaine,163," Alright, let's do it. "
32127,Kramer,163," Alright, here we go. Yeah, watch that baby slide...[Puts a slice 
        of meat under the door.] "
32128,Elaine,163," Come on, come on kitty...[slice disappears] ooh...how about that; 
        it worked! Wow, can I borrow that thing for a while? "
32129,Kramer,163," Oh no, I don't think so. "
32130,Elaine,163, Why not? 
32131,Kramer,163," Well, you're not checked at on it. "
32132,Elaine,163, What do I have to know? 
32133,Kramer,163," Well, where the meat goes? "
32134,Elaine,163, Right there. 
32135,Kramer,163, Where do you turn it on? 
32136,Elaine,163, Right there. 
32137,Kramer,163," But where does the meat go? 

        [Jerry is on the revenge date with Sara.] "
32138,Sara,163," Restaurant, flowers...this is so nice. "
32139,Jerry,163," Well, I'm a classy guy. How's the life saving business? "
32140,Sara,163, It's fine. 
32141,Jerry,163," It must take a really really big zit, to kill a man! "
32142,Sara,163, What is with you? 
32143,Jerry,163, You call yourself a lifesaver. I call you pimple popper MD! 
32144,Parry,163, Dr. Sitarides? 
32145,Sara,163," Mr. Parry, how are you? "
32146,Parry,163, I just wanted to thank you again for saving my life. 
32147,Jerry,163, She saved your life? 
32148,Parry,163, I had skin cancer. 
32149,Jerry,163, Skin cancer! Damn. 
32150,Elaine,163," You were right Kramer, this slicer is absolutely amazing...yeah, 
        yeah...no no no I'll bring it by tonight...ok bye. 
        [Walks off the couch.] "
32151,Elaine,163, These heals are so uneven. [Watches the slicer.] 
32152,Clerk,163, Here you Mr. Costanza. 
32153,George,163, What is this? This is a drawing. 
32154,Clerk,163," Looks real, doesn't it? "
32155,George,163, This is a cartoon! 
32156,Clerk,163," Hey, I had to draw that guy from memory. Considering, I think 
        that's damn good. "
32157,George,163," But it's not a photograph, I need a photograph! "
32158,Clerk,163, Then you better get a camera. 
32159,Jerry,163, He looks like a Peanuts character. 
32160,George,163," I know. The only way to fix it now, is to get a whole new photo 
        of Kruger. "
32161,Jerry,163, You can do that. 
32162,George,163, Without his shirt on. 
32163,Jerry,163," You can't do that. Well, maybe Kruger wasn't the place for you. 
      "
32164,George,163, It seemed so disorganized. 
32165,Jerry,163, I understand. 
32166,George,163," What about the Coast Guard? Seems like a lot of pride there, 
        a lot of tradition. "
32167,Jerry,163," True. You mean, for you? "
32168,George,163, I think. 
32169,Jerry,163, What about your sea sickness? 
32170,George,163, Maybe I could be a land guy. 
32171,Jerry,163, I don't know if they have land guys. 
32172,George,163," Someone's have to unhook the boat before it leaves...the place! 
      "
32173,Elaine,163, Pliers? 
32174,Jerry,163, Drawer. 
32175,Elaine,163, Got it. 
32176,Jerry,163, What are they for? 
32177,Elaine,163, I...eh...I got a piece a my heal stuck in a slicer. 
32178,Jerry,163, Come again? 
32179,Elaine,163," Okay, I got a little slicer happy, but listen; don't tell Kramer, 
        okay? He has very strong feelings for it. "
32180,George,163, I forgot to ask you; how did the revenge date go? 
32181,Jerry,163," Eh, it went okay. "
32182,George,163," Did you dressed nice, did you do it classy? "
32183,Jerry,163," Yeah, I started out real classy... "
32184,George,163," Yeah you did, you classed it up! "
32185,Jerry,163, But then I found out about the skin cancer. 
32186,George,163," Oh, so it backfired? "
32187,Jerry,163, Yeah. 
32188,George,163," So, I guess I was lucky that I never tried that myself. "
32189,Elaine,163," Of course she treats skin cancer. That's how I met her, she was 
        doing a skin cancer screening at Peterman. That's what dermatologists 
        do. "
32190,Jerry,163," Sadly, that knowledge could've help me. "
32191,George,163," Wait a minute, she did a skin cancer screening at Peterman? "
32192,Elaine,163, Aha. 
32193,George,163, Could she do that at Kruger? 
32194,Elaine,163," I don't know, I guess. "
32195,George,163," So I set up a screening, everyone takes their shirt off and click, 
        I snap me a shot of a bear-chested Kruger. "
32196,Elaine,163, You have a little thing for this fella'? 
32197,George,163," Jerry, you gotta talk to Sitarides. "
32198,Jerry,163, Yesterday you said I had to get my revenge on her! 
32199,George,163," And that was wrong, Jerry! You simple must to apologize.. "
32200,Jerry,163, Must I? 
32201,George,163," Yes! Because it is the mature, adult thing to do. "
32202,Jerry,163, How does that reflect me? 
32203,Kramer,163," Elaine, alright where's the SP2000? Cause I gotta slice. "
32204,Elaine,163," Aah, I forgot it. I gotta get home. "
32205,Kramer,163," Ok, I'll go with you. "
32206,Elaine,163," Umm, I'm not actually going straight to home, I have to first 
        stop at the eh...circus, you know with all the...clowns. "
32207,Kramer,163," Oh, well you have fun...[Elaine leaves] oh no clowns...hate clowns...the 
        clowns. "
32208,Jerry,163," So again, I'm sorry. I had no right to yell at you, you're a life 
        saving doctor and I'm just a comedian... "
32209,Sara,163," Jerry, enough. I'll do your friend's cancer screening, because 
        I believe in that, but as far as you and I are concerned; it's off. "
32210,Jerry,163, Was it pimple popper MD? 
32211,Sara,163, That's the one. [Taps Jerry on the cheek and leaves.] 
32212,Jerry,163, Still got it. 
32213,Elaine,163," Out, damn heal! "
32214,Kramer,163, Elaine? 
32215,Elaine,163, Kramer? 
32216,Kramer,163," Yeah listen, I need my slicer back. "
32217,Elaine,163, Just hold on! 
32218,Kramer,163," Hey, what's going on? "
32219,Elaine,163," Nothing...[heal comes loose and Elaine opens the door.] Here, 
        ok I'm on the phone alright? I'm on the phone with someone... "
32220,Kramer,163," My blade is all dinged up. Oh, come on! Elaine! "
32221,Elaine,163, Phone call! I'm in a big phone call! 
32222,Kramer,163," Come on, this is important! [Shakes the door handle and it comes 
        loose. Kramer falls backwards to the next door.] "
32223,Neighbor,163," Hey, get the hell out of here! "
32224,Kramer,163," Wow, that's a lot of potatoes. "
32225,Kramer,163," So, George took my slicer down to Kruger and they're smoothing 
        it out for me. "
32226,Jerry,163, What the hell is this? 
32227,Kramer,163," Boy, that looks like an allergic reaction. Have you been wearing 
        a fake beard? "
32228,Jerry,163, No. 
32229,Kramer,163," Well, what have you been doing? "
32230,Jerry,163," Nothing, I got up, run some errands, I went down to Sara's office 
        and apologized... "
32231,Kramer,163," Whoa whoa, backup, Dr. Sitarides, what happened there? "
32232,Jerry,163," Well, I tried to apologise, it didn't go over that well... "
32233,Kramer,163," There, there's your hives. "
32234,Jerry,163," What, she gave me hives? "
32235,Kramer,163," Jerry, as the Bible says; Thou who cureth, can maketh ill. "
32236,Jerry,163, She did kind of touch my face. 
32237,Kramer,163," Now you listen to me, you've got to find this woman and tell 
        her that you're not a test tube pin cushion. "
32238,Jerry,163," It does itch. Maybe I will go down at Kruger and talk to her. 
      "
32239,Kramer,163," Alright, great, because I got to get down there and pick up my 
        blade. Hey, and I couldn't find that stock room. "
32240,Elaine,163," Oh, that's fantastic. "
32241,George,163," I just talked to Mr. Kruger, he'll be down in a minute. He wanted 
        me to take a photograph for the record. "
32242,Sara,163, What record? 
32243,George,163," His personal file, I, I don't ask... "
32244,Sara,163, Jerry? What brings you here? 
32245,Jerry,163," I don't know, this? [Shows his neck to Sara.] "
32246,Sara,163, Looks like hives. 
32247,Jerry,163, Where do you suppose that could've come from? 
32248,George,163," Jerry, what are you doing... "
32249,Kramer,163, He is just setting the record straight. 
32250,Jerry,163," Come on Sitarides, cop to it. What brand of perverted science 
        do you practice? "
32251,Sara,163, Are you suggesting I somehow I infected you on purpose? 
32252,Jerry,163," I want the antidote, pimple popper! "
32253,Sara,163," That's it, I'm out of here! You're insane. "
32254,Jerry,163, Am I? You touched my face. I didn't imagine that! 
32255,George,163," Dr. Sitarides don't go! Oh, thanks Jerry! "
32256,Kruger,163," Hey George, hey Doc. We doing the screening here? "
32257,George,163," Aah, yeah, yeah. Won't you head on in, we'll be in in a second. 
        Be right with you. "
32258,Kramer,163," Doc, huh? "
32259,George,163," Kramer, this is perfect. I need you to go in there, pretend you're 
        a doctor and check this guy for moles. "
32260,Kramer,163," Moles, yes. Freckle's ugly cousin. "
32261,George,163," And get a picture of him, with his shirt off. "
32262,Kramer,163," You really are cooking up a little scheme here, aren't you? "
32263,George,163," Alright, lets get in there. Quick, quick, quick... "
32264,Elaine,163, This is it. I can take this anymore. 
32265,[She turns the radio on loud (Foghat,163," Slow Ride) and ""dances"" 
        few little kicks.] "
32266,Kramer,163," Male mammal. Approximately 30 to 60 years of age. Weight...uh 
        indeterminate. Ok, Mr. Kruger, we are gonna take a photo now for the records. 
        So if you'll stand up please and give me a big smile, oh no no no, not 
        that big. Yeah, that's nice, yes okay. Yes, let's have a looksee...ok, 
        so eh, fiber from shirt on the left shoulder. I'm gonna have to keep my 
        on that. "
32267,Kruger,163, How long have you been doing this Dr. Van Nostrand? 
32268,Kramer,163," Uuh, long long time. Yes, I've seen moles so big they have their 
        own moles. Freckles that cover two men. "
32269,Kruger,163," So, how am I looking? "
32270,Kramer,163," Oh, so far, so good...[looks at Mr. Kruger's shoulder] yeuye... 
      "
32271,George,163," Kramer, I really owe you one. "
32272,Kramer,163," George, we got a problem. "
32273,George,163, What? 
32274,Kramer,163," Well, he's got a mole on his shoulder. Very suspicious. "
32275,George,163," So, tell him you're concerned about it and he should see someone 
        else. "
32276,Kramer,163," George, why would I, a Juilliard trained dermatologist, send 
        him to another doctor? "
32277,George,163," Because, you're not a dermatologist. "
32278,Kramer,163," He thinks I am. I'm not gonna betray that trust. Here's what 
        I wanna do; I think I can get a section... "
32279,George,163," Whoa, whoa, a section?! "
32280,Kramer,163," Yeah, if I could crab my slicer and he'd hold still... "
32281,George,163," No, you're not taking a deli slicer to my boss... "
32282,Kramer,163," It'll be operative thing, he would barely feel it. "
32283,George,163, No! Absolutely Not! 
32284,Kramer,163," Well, it's my medical opinion, that you're making a big mistake. 
        And it's going in my chart. "
32285," 
        [Elaine is on the phone and the radio plays music very loud (Iron Butterfly",163," 
        In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida)] "
32286,Elaine,163," Yeah, hello is this Allied Lock Smith?! Oh, finally, listen I 
        need someone to come over here right away! "
32287,Neighbor,163, Turn it off! Turn it off! 
32288,Elaine,163," I am getting a lock smith, alright?! Relax! "
32289,Neighbor,163," Alright, that's it! "
32290,Elaine,163," Yeah, the address is 78th West... "
32291,Neighbor,163," Oh, oh mama... "
32292,Jerry,163," So, Kramer pulled it off? "
32293,George,163," Yep, and the photo was all fixed and back on his desk, no thanks 
        to you. "
32294,Jerry,163," Well, that woman had it coming to her. Look at my neck, it looks 
        like I had a beard of bees! "
32295,George,163, Why don't you see someone about it? 
32296,Jerry,163," I've called everyone. You know how hard it is to get a dermatologist 
        in this town? [Kramer comes in] A real dermatologist. "
32297,Kramer,163, [Points to a page on the book] Squamous cell carcinoma. 
32298,George,163," You're not a doctor. You shouldn't even have books like this. 
      "
32299,Kramer,163," George, that's what he has and I have to give him a call. Now 
        we gotta came clean. "
32300,George,163," You can't tell him the truth, you're gonna blow the whole thing. 
      "
32301,Kramer,163, I don't want this on my conscience. 
32302,George,163," I'll get him to see a real doctor. You just stay away from this. 
      "
32303,Kramer,163," Yeah, alright... "
32304,Jerry,163," Hey, I wonder if they have a picture of my rash in here. "
32305,Kramer,163," They've got everything there, Jerry. I underlined the best parts. 
      "
32306,Jerry,163," Hey, this looks like the thing I have. Caused by exposure to benzene, 
        a common ingredient in metal cleaners. "
32307,Kramer,163," Well, that's weird. "
32308,Jerry,163, What are you doing? 
32309,Kramer,163," Well, I'm cleaning my slicer. "
32310,Jerry,163," That's my hand towel! I use that on my face, hands and chest! 
        That's where the hives are coming from! It's not from Dr. Sitarides, it's 
        from Dr. Van Nostrand! "
32311,Kramer,163," So, somehow the Bronzo (?) is reacting to the poison she's giving 
        you. "
32312,Jerry,163," Alright, get out. And take your Bronzo with you [throws the bottle 
        to Kramer.] "
32313,Kramer,163," Ohh, that's toxic. [Jerry throws the towel over Kramer's head.] 
        Ououou.... "
32314,Kruger,163," George, come in. I'm just going over our annual report...boy 
        did we take it on the chin last year. "
32315,George,163," Eh, listen Mr. Kruger, I got a message from Dr. Van Nostrand 
        and he says it might be wise to you to see another doctor about that mole. 
      "
32316,Kruger,163, I'm not too worried about it. 
32317,George,163," Well, he said it could be cancer, maybe you should get it checked 
        out. "
32318,Kruger,163," George, take a look at this photo. This is taken 10 years ago. 
        That mole looks exactly as it does today. So, there's no cause for concern, 
        eh? "
32319,George,163, Whatever. 
32320,Kruger,163," Actually, funny thing about this photo. We were at the beach 
        and there was this dumb looking guy near by. When he went in for a swim, 
        my sons and I took all his stuff and threw it in the ocean! What a pear 
        shaped loser. "
32321,George,163," Well, that pear shaped loser was me! And I was in that photo, 
        until I broke in here, stole the photograph and airbrushed myself out 
        of there! "
32322,Kruger,163," Well, I'll be...you have lost a lot of hair. "
32323,George,163, That's what they tell me! 
32324,Kramer,163, Do you want more pastrami? 
32325,Elaine,163," Um, what was that last thing you gave me? That was pretty good. 
      "
32326,Kramer,163," Yeah, it was olive loaf. You want that? "
32327,Jerry,163, I can't believe Kruger didn't fire you after all you did. 
32328,George,163," He said he didn't care. Oh, God I love that place. Hey, have 
        you seen other dermatologist? "
32329,Jerry,163," Yeah, I finally got to see Dr. Kazarian. He said it was really 
        bad. "
32330,George,163, What did he give you for it. 
32331,Jerry,163, Aloe. So where's that lock smith? 
32332,George,163, Have to give him time on this hour. 
32333,Elaine,163, Can I have a zip? [Sticks a straw out from keyhole.] 
32334,Kramer,163," Oh yeah, coming up... "
32335,"

32339,GEORGE,164," So, Elaine, are you going to sleep with me or what?!"
32340,ELAINE,164," (Aggravated) George, I just got off a twenty-three hour 
              plane ride. I'm too tired to even vomit at the thought."
32341,GEORGE,164, (Angered) Fine. I'll ask you again when you're rested.
32342,JERRY,164," (Sarcastic) Oh, I'm sure she'll come around."
32343,GEORGE,164," Yeah, I hope so. For your sake!"
32344,JERRY,164, (To George) I said I was sorry.
32345,GEORGE,164," You can stuff you sorries in a sack, mister!"
32346,JERRY,164, (Nauseated at the saying) Would you please stop saying that?!
32347,KRAMER,164, (Confused) What's up with you two?
32348,GEORGE,164, I don't want to talk about it.
32349,KRAMER,164, (To Jerry) So how was the big trip?
32350,JERRY,164, I don't want to talk about it!
32351,KRAMER,164," (Observing Elaine's bandaged nose) Well, what happened 
              to your nose?"
32352,ELAINE,164," I don't want to talk ab-ow!-t it! (She winces under the 
              pain from her nose on the word 'about')"
32353,KRAMER,164," Well, you gotta give me something! Come on, how was the 
              wedding? Was the bride radiant?"
32354,ELAINE,164, She.. was.
32355,JERRY,164, 'Till she found out Elaine slept with the groom.
32356,KRAMER,164," (Interested) Ooohh.. That sounds juicy. Listen, I gotta 
              go to the bathroom, but I want to hear all about it. (Gets up and 
              heads for the bathroom)"
32357,GEORGE,164," (While skimming a Monk's menu) You know, I didn't go to 
              the bathroom the entire time we were in India."
32358,JERRY,164, I can't believe we went all the way to India for a wedding!

32363,SUE ELLEN,164," (Cutting him off. To Elaine) Elaine, you were my maid 
              of honor and you slept with MY Pinter?!"
32364,ELAINE,164," No, no, no! It was years ago - before you met him. And, 
              and I got to tell you.. it was very mechanical."
32365,SUE ELLEN,164, I have never been so humiliated!
32366,ELAINE,164, (To Jerry and George) Idiots! This is all yoru fault!
32367,GEORGE,164," (While pointing at Jerry) Not me! Him! His fault! He betrayed 
              me!"
32368,JERRY,164," (Pleading) George, I'm sorry.."
32369,GEORGE,164," You can stuff your sorries in a sack, Mister!"
32370,JERRY,164, (Confused) I don't know what that means.
32371,GEORGE,164," (To his girlfriend) Alright, Nina, you have to decide right 
              now. Jerry or me?"
32372,NINA,164, (Casually) Alright.. Neither.
32373,GEORGE,164," What?! Well, what are you doing here?"
32374,NINA,164," A free trip to India. And by the way, you can take off those 
              boots. Everyone knows you're five' six."
32375,GEORGE,164, Five' eight! Five' seven!
32376,ELAINE,164," (To Sue Ellen) See? See the way they are?! We're - we're 
              still best friends, right?"
32377,SUE ELLEN,164," No. (Grabbing at the stud in Elaine's nose) And take 
              that stupid thing out of your nose!"
32378,JERRY,164," That's got to hurt, I don't care where you're from!"
32379,GEORGE,164," (Whispering to Jerry) What time is our flight back? I got 
              to go to the bathroom."

32383,JERRY,164, Hey.
32384,ELAINE,164, What happened last night?
32385,JERRY,164," Oh, you were pretty loaded."
32386,ELAINE,164, (Gesturing to her nose stud) I know. I woke up with this.
32387,JERRY,164," Oh. Hello, Tetanus."
32388,NINA,164," George, I've used the bathroom. It's fine."
32389,GEORGE,164," (Struggling) No, no, no, no. I can walk it off. It's a 
              hundred and twenty degrees in here.. I'll sweat it out."
32390,ELAINE,164," (Seeing George, she walks over to greet him) Hey. (Looking 
              at his shoes) Are those Timberlands painted black?"
32391,GEORGE,164, (Looking at her nose) Is your nose pierced?
32392,ELAINE,164, (Embarrassed) I should.. (Walks tward the bride and groom)
32393,GEORGE,164," Yeah. (Points to two open seats in front of Jerry's. To 
              Nina) Sit down there. (Sees Jerry in the crowd) Hello, Jerry. (Obviously 
              angered at Jerry) I"
32394,JERRY,164," (As George sits down) George, we need to talk."
32395,GEORGE,164," (Trying to keep his voice down) I think you've done a lot 
              more than talk! You betrayed me!"
32396,JERRY,164," Alright, I admit it. I slept with Nina, but that's all."
32397,GEORGE,164," (Outraged) ""That's all""?! That's everything! 
              I don't know what all the rest of it is for anyway!"
32398,JERRY,164, (Pleading) I'm really sorry.
32399,GEORGE,164," You can stuff your sorries in a sack, mister!"
32400,JERRY,164, (Confused) Where'd you get that one?
32401,GEORGE,164, It's an expression.
32402,ELAINE,164," (From the front of the room, she can hear George and Jerry's 
              heated discussion) Hey! Shhhhh! (Crosses herself, then shakes her 
              head - apologizing)"

              this right now! I demand reparations! I should get to sleep with 
              Elaine. That's the only way to"
32404,JERRY,164," That doesn't punish me. It punishes Elaine! And cruelly, 
              I might add."
32405,GEORGE,164, (Losing it) Funny guy!
32406,ELAINE,164," Hey! Monkeys! Knock it off. My best friend is trying to 
              get married up here!"
32407,GEORGE,164," Elaine, you have to sleep with me."
32408,ELAINE,164, (Definite) I'm not gonna sleep with you.
32409,GEORGE,164, Reparations!

              slept with (Points to Jerry) him, he slept with me, I slept with

32424,ELAINE,164, He schnapped me.

              a secret! (Elaine laughs) Is there anything else?"

              if I got my nose pierced? That would be pretty freaky.. Oooohhhhaaa!"

              last night, and I wished against your wish."
32450,FDR,164," That's funny. As it happens, I saw the same shooting star 
              and double-wished you to drop dead. (Hands Kramer some coins) Here's 
              your change."

32790,ELAINE,166, (Embarrassed) Free sub.
32791,ELAINE,166, What?
32792,GEORGE,166, Nothing. It's a card from my dad.
32793,ELAINE,166," What is it? (Grabs the card from George, he tries to stop 
              her, but fails. She reads it out loud.) ""Dear son, Happy Festivus.""

32799,JERRY,166," Hated all the commercial and religious aspects of Christmas, 
              so he made up his own holiday."

32801,GEORGE,166, (pleading) Alright..
32802,JERRY,166," And instead of a tree, didn't your father put up an aluminum 
              pole?"
32803,GEORGE,166, Jerry! Stop it!

              card!.. Oh no! I bet I wrote that fake number on the back of it 
              when I gave it to denim vest!"
32808,JERRY,166, So?
32809,ELAINE,166," I've eaten 23 bad subs, I just need 1 more! It's like a 
              long, bad movie, but you want to see the end of it!"
32810,JERRY,166," No, you walk out."
32811,ELAINE,166," Alright, then, it's like a boring book, but you gotta finish 
              it."
32812,JERRY,166," No, you wait for the movie!"
32813,ELAINE,166," (Irritated, and through clinched teeth) I want that free 
              sub."
32814,JERRY,166," You don't need the card. High-end hoagie outfit like that, 
              it's all computerized! (Snaps) They're cloning sheep now."
32815,KRAMER,166," (Correcting) No, they're not cloning sheep. It's the same 
              sheep! I saw Harry Blackstone do that trick with two goats and a 
              handkerchief on the old Dean"
32816,JERRY,166," So, why don't you just try your blow-off number and see 
              if he's called it?"
32817,ELAINE,166, That's a good idea.
32818,KRAMER,166," (Answering phone) Yeah, Go! Wha.. really? Yeah, ok. Yeah! 
              Bye. (Hangs up) Great news! Yeah, the strike has been settled. I'm 
              going back to work."
32819,JERRY,166, What strike?
32820,KRAMER,166," Yeah, H&H Bagels. That's where I worked."

              it out, hands it to Elaine) Yeah, we've been on strike for 12 years."
32825,ELAINE,166," Oh, I remember seeing those guys picketing out there, but 
              I haven't seen them in a long time."
32826,KRAMER,166," Yeah, well, H&H wouldn't let us use their bath room 
              while we were picketing. It put a cramp on our solidarity."
32827,ELAINE,166, What were your.. demands?
32828,KRAMER,166," Yeah, 5.35 an hour. And that's what they're paying now."
32829,ELAINE,166, I believe that's the new minimum wage.
32830,KRAMER,166," Now you know who to thank for that!.. Alright, I've got 
              to go. (Heads for the door)"
32831,JERRY,166, Why didn't you ever mention this?
32832,KRAMER,166," Jerry, I didn't want you to know I was out of work. It's 
              embarrassing! (Leaves) (Scene ends)"

              coat, puts it in the display case, then turns to see a plate full 
              of bagels.) What are those?"
32843,MANAGER,166, Those are rasin bagels.

32950,GEORGE,166," So, she was switching? Back and forth?"
32951,JERRY,166," Actually, the only place she always looked good was in that 
              back booth over there."
32952,GEORGE,166," So, just bring her here. This is all you really need."
32953,JERRY,166," I can't just keep bringing her to the coffee shop. I mean, 
              what if things, you know, progress?"
32954,GEORGE,166, Lights out.
32955,JERRY,166," Alright, I'll give it a shot! I do really like this coffee 
              shop. Nice cuff links, by the way."
32956,GEORGE,166," (Pointing to them) Office Christmas gift. I tell you, this 
              Human Fund is a gold mine!"
32957,JERRY,166," That's not a french cuff shirt, you know."
32958,GEORGE,166," I know. I cut the button off and poked a hole with a letter 
              opener."

32960,KRAMER,166," Well, Happy Festivus."
32961,GEORGE,166, What is that? Is taht the pole?!
32962,FRANK,166," George, Festivus is your heritage - it's part of who you 
              are."
32963,GEORGE,166, (Sulking) That's why I hate it.
32964,KRAMER,166," There's a big dinner Tuesday night at Frank's house - everyone's 
              invited."
32965,FRANK,166," George, you're forgetting how much Festivus has meant to 
              us all. I brought one of the casette tapes. (Franks pushes play, 
              George as a child celebrating"
32966,FRANK,166, Read that poem.
32967,GEORGE,166, (Complaining) I can't read it. I need my glasses!
32968,FRANK,166," You don't need glasses, you're just weak! You're weak!"
32969,ESTELLE,166, Leave him alone!
32970,FRANK,166," Alright, George. It's time for the feats of strength."
32971,GEORGE,166," No! No! Turn it off! No feats of strength! (Gets up and 
              starts running out of the coffee shop) I hate Festivus!"

              should get out of there. I sabotaged the bagel machine last night.

32992,KRUGER,166," George, I got something for you. (Pulls a check from his 
              pocket) I'm suppose to find a charity and throw some of the company's 
              money at it. They all"
32993,GEORGE,166, 20 thousand dollars?
32994,KRUGER,166," Made out to the Human Fund. (Tries to enter his office,

32998,GWEN,166, I just found a rubber band in my soup.

33001,JERRY,166," Hey, Georgie!"
33002,GWEN,166, I think I'm just gonna go.

33004,GEORGE,166," (Sees Gwen's meal) Hey, soup."
33005,JERRY,166, She didn't touch it.
33006,GEORGE,166," Ohh.. Paco! (Flicks rubber band tward the kitchen) Hey, 
              take a look at this. (Hands Jerry Kruger's check)"
33007,JERRY,166, 20 thousand dollars from Kruger? You're not keeping this.
33008,GEORGE,166, I don't know.
33009,JERRY,166, Excuse me?
33010,GEORGE,166," I've been doing a lot of thinking. This might be my chance 
              to start giving something back."
33011,JERRY,166," You want to give something back? Start with the 20 thousand 
              dollars."
33012,GEORGE,166, I'm serious.
33013,JERRY,166, You're going to start your own charity?
33014,GEORGE,166," I think I could be a philanthropist. a kick ass philanthropist! 
              I would have all this money, and people would love me. Then they

              a denim coat) Do you have that card that I gave you?"
33037,DENIM VEST,166," Well, I had it back at my place, but I can't go there 
              now.. I'll give it to you later, or something."

              (Holds it out)"
33050,KRUGER,166," George, I don't get it. If there's no Human Fund, those 
              donation cards were fake. You better have a damn good reason why 
              you gave me a fake"
33051,GEORGE,166," Well, sir, I - I gave out the fake card, because, um, I 
              don't really celebrate Christmas. I, um, I celebrate Festivus."

              for my beliefs. They drove my family out of Bayside, Sir!"

              I never drive around here. If Im gonna recommend this car, 
              I need to see that itll handle my daily"
33171,RICK,167, So where are we going? 
33172,KRAMER,167," Just a little place I like to call, ""Youll see"".

33173,[Setting,167, Puddys office]

              use to soften people up? "
33175,PUDDY,167, (Pointing out his office door) By the service department.
33176,JERRY,167," (As George is leaving for the donuts) Au revoir, Le George. 
            "
33177,GEORGE,167, Dont think it cant happen! (Leaves) 
33178,JERRY,167," So, Puddy, this is a pretty good move for you, huh? No more 
              ""grease monkey"". "
33179,PUDDY,167, I dont care for that term. 
33180,JERRY,167," Oh. Sorry, I didnt know.. "
33181,PUDDY,167," No, I dont know too many monkeys who could take apart 
              a fuel injector. "
33182,JERRY,167, I saw one once that could do sign language. 
33183,PUDDY,167," Yeah, I saw that one. Uh.. Koko. "
33184,JERRY,167," Yeah, Koko. "
33185,PUDDY,167," Right, Koko. That chimps alright. (Holds up his hand) 
              High-five. "
33186,GEORGE,167," Hey, hey, hey! Whats goin on here? (To Jerry) 
              You didnt agree to anything, did ya? "
33187,JERRY,167, No. We both just saw the same monkey. 
33188,GEORGE,167," (Aggravated) Well, I got screwed on the donuts. There were 
              none left. "
33189,PUDDY,167," (Standing up) Well, theres a vending machine. I could 
              show you where it is. (Leaves, showing George the way)"
33190,GEORGE,167," (To Jerry) Hey, gimme a dollar. "
33191,JERRY,167, (Getting a dollar out) Wheres your money? 
33192,GEORGE,167, (Talking it) Im here helpin you.
33193,ELAINE,167, Hey. Wheres Puddy? The copy machine is broken. 
33194,GEORGE,167," (On his way out) Heh, heh, heh. Thats what they want 
              you to think. "
33195,JERRY,167," Hey, Elaine, have you noticed your boyfriend has developed 
              an annoying little habit? "
33196,ELAINE,167," (Squints, imitating Puddy) The squinting? "
33197,JERRY,167, No. 
33198,ELAINE,167," (Stares ahead, again, imitating Puddy) The staring? "
33199,JERRY,167, No. He keeps asking me to give him a high-five. 
33200,ELAINE,167, I thought all guys do that. 
33201,JERRY,167," Slapping hands is the lowest form of male primate ritual. 
              In fact, even some of them have moved on - theyre using sign 
              language now. "
33202,ELAINE,167, Is that bad? 
33203,JERRY,167," What do you think the Nazis were doin? (Imitates the 
              Nazis salute) That was the heil-five. "
33204,ELAINE,167," (Pointing out) Isnt that from your act, like, ten 
              years ago? "
33205,JERRY,167," (Slightly embarrassed) It was a good bit in the 80s, 
              and its still relatable today. "
33206,PUDDY,167," Good news. We got a 900 in black. Thats the hot color. 
              (Holds up his hand) High-five. "
33207,ELAINE,167," Um, David, you know what? Can you come help me fix the 
              copy machine? "

33213,MECHANIC,167, (While retrieving his candy) No. 
33214,GEORGE,167," Could I, uh, could I trade you for another dollar? "
33215,MECHANIC,167, (While walking away) Dont have one. 
33216,GEORGE,167," (Stopping him) Excuse me. When your, uh, when your wallet 
              was open, I glanced inside, and I couldnt help but notice 
              that you had several crisp dollar"
33217,MECHANIC,167, (Calm) Youre incorrect. 
33218,GEORGE,167," (Persistent) Perhaps you could look again, please? Im 
              very hungry. "
33219,MECHANIC,167, (While taking his exit) We had donuts earlier.

              that my celebrity friend is considering, my full endorsement. (Looks

              machine) I think the candy comes out over there. "
33226,GEORGE,167," People can drop change down here, Jerry. And theyre 
              too lazy to pick it up. "
33227,JERRY,167," Either that, or theyve got a little hang-up about 
              lying face-down in filth. Why dont you just go to the cashier? 
            "
33228,GEORGE,167," The cashier is at lunch - which is where Id like 
              to be. "
33229,JERRY,167, How much was under there? 
33230,GEORGE,167," (Looking at his finger) I think somethin bit me. 
              I just need another nickel. "
33231,JERRY,167," (While fishing through his pocket for change) Hey, Puddy 
              thinks I should go for the CD player. What do you think? (Hands 
              him a nickel) "
33232,GEORGE,167," Ho, ho, ho! Hes got a live one. Hes just reeling 
              his big fish in! "
33233,JERRY,167," Hey, can I have my dollar back? "
33234,GEORGE,167, (Stingy) Its wrinkled. Its worthless.

              gets stuck in the spindle right before falling. George begins to 
              pound the machine) Come on!"

              up to him in other ways. "
33247,[Setting,167, Dealership back room] 
33248,GEORGE,167," As you will see, the candy bar is paid for, and yet, remains 
              dangling in the machine. (Notices that the Twix slot is completely 
              empty) Hey, its gone."

33258,ELAINE,167," Im sorry, but the high-five is just so stupid. "

              stupid. You. Stupid. "

33374,WILLIE,167," Dad, I told you you could sit here only if you dont 
              talk. "
33375,WOMAN,167," (Sitting behind George) You make your father sit here all 
              day? "
33376,WILLIE,167, He likes it! 
33377,GEORGE,167," Alright! Do you mind? I have the window! (To Willie) Now, 
              what are you gonna do about my Twix? "
33378,MAN,167, (In line behind George) Twix has too much coconut. 
33379,GEORGE,167, No! Theres no coconut! 
33380,WOMAN,167, (Behind service window) Im allergic to coconut. 
33381,WILLIE,167, Im not.

33387,JERRY,167," No, no. No, Elaine, the car can wait. Whats important 
              is you two getting back together. Eh, then well talk about 
              the car. "
33388,PUDDY,167," (Like a kid) I dont want to get back with her. Shes 
              too bossy. "

              to do to put you two in a relationship today? "

33402,RICK,167," But it needs it, Kramer! It needs it bad! "
33403,KRAMER,167," Do you think that thisll make you happy? Cause 
              it wont! "
33404,RICK,167," (Walking away) Ah, you can just go on without me. "
33405,KRAMER,167," Listen to me. When that car rolls into that dealership, 
              and that tank is bone dry, I want you to be there with me when everyone 
              says, ""Kramer and that"

              from. "
33415,WILLIE,167, It took you an hour? 
33416,GEORGE,167," Only I hold the answer key to their true candy identities. 
              And so, without further ado, I give you.. the candy line-up. (Opens

33463,Waitress,168, I just told you it was hot. Why'd you touch it?
33464,Elaine,168, I just wanted to know what your idea of 'hot' is.
33465,Puddy,168," Hey, babe. You ready to hit the ice?"
33466,Elaine,168," I am ready to skate up a-- ha, ha, ha...Why are you wearing 
              that?"
33467,Puddy,168, It's my winter coat.
33468,Elaine,168, A fur?
33469,Puddy,168, Is there a problem?
33470,Elaine,168, A seemingly infinite supply.

33475,Jerry,168," And, of course, you find fur morally reprehensible."
33476,Elaine,168," Eh, anti-fur. I mean, who has the energy anymore? This 
              is more about hanging off the arm of an idiot."
33477,George,168, And this is the first you're seeing of the coat?
33478,Elaine,168, We never dated in winter.
33479,Jerry,168, You might want to get a look at that bathing suit drawer.

              that massage chair we want to get Joe Mayo as an apartment gift."

              for moving? Birthdays, Christmas, it's enough gifts. I would like 
              one month off."

              him."

              will buy it, you pay me back later. I'll sniff out a deal. I have

              you can see in."
33493,Elaine,168, Why?
33494,Newman,168, To prevent an ambush.
33495,Kramer,168," Yeah, so now I can peek to see if anyone is waiting to 
              jack me with a sock full of pennies."
33496,Jerry,168, But then anyone can just look in and see you.
33497,Kramer,168," Our policy is, we're comfortable with our bodies. You know, 
              if someone wants to help themselves to an eyefull, well, we say,

33501,Newman,168, Wallet.
33502,Jerry,168, What?
33503,Kramer,168," Nobody carries wallets anymore. I mean, they went out with 
              powdered wigs. Yeah, see here's what you need. Just a couple of 
              cards and your bankroll."

33509,Silvio,168," Hey, you know you gotta get permission from me. I'm the 
              super. Who said you could do that?"
33510,Kramer,168," Well, who says I can do any of the things I do in my place?"
33511,Silvio,168, Like what?
33512,Kramer,168," Well, I... uh, nothing. No, I'll, um, I'll switch it back."
33513,Silvio,168," No, no, no, no. No, that's all right."
33514,Kramer,168," Well, that's good. Because, uh, Newman and I--"
33515,Silvio,168," Newman? He did this, too?"
33516,Kramer,168," Well, yeah."
33517,Silvio,168, I deal with him.
33518,George,168," Hey, look at this. This is the same massage chair we're 
              gettin' for Joe Mayo, $60 cheaper."
33519,Jerry,168, Except the store's in Delaware.
33520,George,168, I'll have 'em overnight it.
33521,Jerry,168," Maybe cheapness is a sense. You know it is better without 
              this big wallet. It's more comfortable."
33522,George,168, It doesn't matter if it's more comfortable. It's wrong.
33523,Jerry,168, Why?
33524,George,168," Because important things go in a case. You got a skull 
              for your brain, a plastic sleeve for your comb, and a wallet for 
              your money."
33525,Jerry,168," But look at this thing. It's-it's huge. You got more cow 
              here than here."
33526,George,168, I need everything in there.
33527,Jerry,168, Irish money?
33528,George,168, I might go there.

              & Lows."
33531,Kramer,168, Who is it?
33532,Newman,168, It's Newman.
33533,Kramer,168, What do you want? I'm in the middle of something.
33534,Newman,168, I can't believe I'm being evicted.
33535,Kramer,168, What? What are you talking about?
33536,Newman,168," The reverse peepholes. Silvio said I'm an agitator and 
              I'm out of the building."
33537,Kramer,168," No. No, he can't do that."
33538,Newman,168," I'm homeless! I'm gonna be out on a street corner, dancing 
              for nickels. I'll be with the hobos in the trainyard, eating out 
              of a bucket."
33539,Kramer,168," Come on, we'll go and talk to him, and we'll straighten 
              this thing out."
33540,Newman,168," Uh, you, uh, you better put something on."
33541,Jerry,168," George, I am loving this no wallet thing."
33542,George,168, A man carries a wallet.
33543,Jerry,168," You know, the very fact that you oppose this makes me think 
              I'm onto something."
33544,Joe Mayo,168," Hey, Jerry."
33545,Jerry,168," Hey, Joe Mayo. Nice place."
33546,Joe Mayo,168," Thanks. George, can you do me a favor and stay by the 
              phone in case anybody calls and needs directions?"
33547,George,168, Love to.
33548,Joe Mayo,168, Thanks. Jerry...
33549,Jerry,168, Music?
33550,Joe Mayo,168," Actually, can you keep an eye on the aquarium and make 
              sure nobody taps on the glass?"
33551,Jerry,168, But I could do that and the music.
33552,Joe Mayo,168," Oh, no, don't worry about the music. Just... have fun!"
33553,Jerry,168, I was ready to get jiggy with it.
33554,Puddy,168, Hey.
33555,Jerry,168," Hey, Elaine."
33556,Elaine,168, Hey. I think you know Dr... Zaius.
33557,Jerry,168," So, Elaine, notice anything different about my... pants?"
33558,Elaine,168," So, George... did you get the chair?"
33559,George,168," No, I don't have it yet."
33560,Jerry,168," So, we're givin' him nothing?"
33561,George,168," No, I brought a picture of the chair."
33562,Jerry,168, Did you at least get him a card?
33563,George,168, I thought we'd all sign the picture.
33564,Joe Mayo,168, Elaine...
33565,Elaine,168," Hey, Joe Mayo."
33566,Joe Mayo,168, I need you to be in charge of coats.
33567,Elaine,168," Oh, fantastic."
33568,Joe Mayo,168," And Puddy, can you make sure no one puts a drink on my...sound 
              system?"
33569,Puddy,168," Sure thing, Joe Mayo."
33570,Jerry,168," Hi, I'm Jerry. How do you like my pants?"
33571,Keri,168, Nice.
33572,Jerry,168," (talking to George) It's working. (to the girl, who's tapping 
              on the aquarium) Don't tap on the glass."
33573,George,168, (answering the phone while walking away) Joe Mayo's apartment?
33574,Puddy,168," (standing guard by the stereo as George walks by him) Hey! 
              Cocktail off the speaker."
33575,Elaine,168," Goodbye, Dr. Zaius."
33576,Silvio,168, Why are we in Jerry's apartment?
33577,Kramer,168," Well, I, uh, I like to think of this as my conference room. 
              Yeah, it has a more formal atmosphere, you know, with the shelves, 
              and the furniture."
33578,Silvio,168," Make it quick Kramer, my wife and I are about to go bowling."
33579,Kramer,168," Oh, well, um, Newman thinks that you, uh, evicted him?"
33580,Silvio,168, I did. I don't like Mr. Newman. He is an agitator.
33581,Kramer,168," Look... I've known Newman all my life, in the building, 
              and you're all wrong about him. He's a model tenant. Portly, yes, 
              but smart as a whip."
33582,Silvio,168," OK, on your word he can stay."
33583,Kramer,168, All right.
33584,Silvio,168, But... I'm gonna keep my eye on him.
33585,Kramer,168," Well, you won't regret it."
33586,Silvio,168, What's wrong?
33587,Joe Mayo,168," Elaine, thanks for coming."
33588,Elaine,168, Good working with you.
33589,Puddy,168," All right, let's hit the bricks."
33590,Elaine,168, What?
33591,Joe Mayo,168," Hey, I got a coat just like this!"
33592,Elaine,168, Oh. Uhhh...
33593,Elaine,168, So Joe Mayo had the same coat.
33594,George,168, And you threw it out the window?
33595,Elaine,168, Mm-hmm.
33596,George,168," God, you're like a rock star."
33597,Elaine,168, So now Joe Mayo wants me to buy him a new coat.
33598,Jerry,168, Because you threw it out.
33599,Elaine,168," No, because I was in charge of the coats. It's... insane."
33600,Jerry,168, But you did actually throw his coat out the window.
33601,Elaine,168," But he doesn't know that. As far as he knows, somebody 
              stole it, and that's the person who should be responsible."
33602,Jerry,168, But that's you.
33603,Elaine,168," So I guess I'll have to buy him a new coat, even though 
              I don't think I should be held responsible, which I am anyway."
33604,George,168," Well, I'm satisfied. Uh...my back is...killing me."
33605,Jerry,168," Of course. Because of that wallet. You-you got a filing 
              cabinet under half of your ass."
33606,George,168," This...is an organizer, a secretary, and a friend."
33607,Elaine,168, Look at you. You're on a slant.
33608,George,168," Here, just give me a couple of napkins."
33609,George,168," There, there I'm fine."
33610,Jerry,168, What was that?
33611,George,168, I think I had some hard candy in there.
33612,George,168," No, no, this is supposed to go to Joe Mayo's apartment."
33613,George,168, Ahhh. How does this thing work?
33614,George,168,Ahhhhh...
33615,Delivery Man,168," Sir, do you want me to deliver this to your friend's 
              place or not?"
33616,George,168, Ahhhhh...
33617,Keri,168, Ready to go?
33618,Jerry,168, All set. I can't believe I'm going dancing.
33619,Keri,168, You don't go that often?
33620,Jerry,168," No, because it's so stupid. Shall we?"
33621,Keri,168, Do me a favor. Can you hold this stuff for me?
33622,Jerry,168," Compact, lipstick, all this?"
33623,Keri,168, And can you help to carry my keys?
33624,Jerry,168," What are you, a medieval dungeon master?"
33625,Keri,168, And a tin of altoids.
33626,Jerry,168, Ow! Sharp key.
33627,Kramer,168," So, you're sleeping with Silvio's wife?"
33628,Newman,168," Well, there's very little sleeping going on."
33629,Kramer,168," Well, why didn't you tell me about this?"
33630,Newman,168," Quite frankly, I don't see how it's any of your business."
33631,Kramer,168," Well, it's my business now. Look, I stuck up for you. Man, 
              if he catches you, we're both out."
33632,Newman,168," Hey, what is that up that tree?"
33633,Kramer,168," Hoooh! Man, that looks like a dead bear."
33634,Newman,168," No, that's a fur coat! Hey, uh, give me a boost."
33635,Kramer,168," Man, where did you learn to climb trees like that?"
33636,Newman,168, The Pacific Northwest.
33637,Elaine,168," So, you had to carry some of Keri's stuff. Big deal."
33638,Jerry,168," You don't understand. I went on a successful pocket diet, 
              and I want to keep that weight off."
33639,Elaine,168," You know what? We sell this thing at Peterman that would 
              be perfect for you."
33640,Jerry,168, Not more of that crap from the Titanic?
33641,Elaine,168, No. No. It's a small men's carryall.
33642,Jerry,168, I'm not carrying a purse.
33643,Elaine,168, It's not a purse. It's European.
33644,Jerry,168, Oh.
33645,Elaine,168," Hey, did George buy Joe Mayo that chair yet?"
33646,Jerry,168, I don't know.
33647,Elaine,168," If I'm gettin' him a new fur, I'm not chippin' in on a 
              gift, too."
33648,George,168, Yeah?
33649,Jerry,168," Hey, George, did you get Joe Mayo that chair yet?"
33650,George,168, Not yet. Oh! Ho ho! God...
33651,Jerry,168, What?
33652,George,168, It's in... transit.
33653,Elaine,168, Did he get it?
33654,Jerry,168, No.
33655,Elaine,168," Mmm, good. Tell him I'm out."
33656,Jerry,168," Well, so what? You're gettin' a deal, right? We'll split 
              it three ways."
33657,George,168, Allllll right!
33658,Jerry,168, What is that noise?
33659,George hangs up the phone,168, That's my toaster. I got to go. Ohhhhhhhhhhhhh!
33660,Jerry,168," You know, sometimes I get the feeling George isn't being 
              completely honest with me."
33661,Kramer,168," Hey. Oh, uh, yeah. Uh, here are your pliers back....Weak 
              hinge."
33662,Elaine,168," Well, I guess I better go and price fur coats."
33663,Kramer,168," Oh, go down to 88th Street. They're free."
33664,Elaine,168, What are you talking about?
33665,Kramer,168," Well, they're hanging from the trees. You know, Newman 
              found one there yesterday. Man, that guy can climb like a ring-tailed 
              lemur!"
33666,Elaine,168, 88th Street? That's where Joe Mayo lives. That's the coat!
33667,Jerry,168, What was that pop sound?
33668,Kramer,168," Well, I had some hard candy in there."
33669,Newman,168," So, to what do I owe this unusual invitation?"
33670,Elaine,168," Come in, come in."
33671,Newman,168," Ahh! This is very much as I imagined it to be. Aside from 
              this rattan piece, which seems oddly out of place."
33672,Elaine,168," Please, sit down. Newman, um, I wanted to talk to you about 
              something."
33673,Newman,168, This isn't about my opening your mail?
33674,Elaine,168, What?
33675,Newman,168," Because I don't, never have, anything I read was already 
              open."
33676,Elaine,168," Uh, yeah, uh, no. Newman, uh, I heard that you found a 
              fur coat in a tree. And, I believe that it belongs to a friend of 
              mine, and I'd like to give it back to him."
33677,Newman,168," Sorry. Climbers, keepers."
33678,Elaine,168," You know, Newmie. Um, I know how you feel about me, and 
              I have to tell you, I'm quite flattered."
33679,Newman,168, You are?
33680,Elaine,168," Oh, yeah. I mean, of all the men that I know, you're the 
              only one who's held down a steady job for several years."
33681,Newman,168," Well, it's-it's interesting work, I don't mind it."
33682,Elaine,168, Ha ha ha ha.
33683,Newman,168," Don't you have a-a boyfriend? A, uh, burly, athletic type?"
33684,Elaine,168," Uh, don't worry, he's cool."
33685,Newman,168, Cool?
33686,Elaine,168," Very cool. So, what do you say? Can you do this one little 
              favor, Newmie?"
33687,Newman,168," Oh, how I've waited for this moment. But alas, my heart 
              belongs to another man's wife, and I have given the coat to her."
33688,Elaine,168," All right, we're done here."
33689,Newman,168," For I am in love with Svetlana, and I don't care if the 
              whole world knows, except for Silvio, who would throw me out of 
              the apartment, where I would be"
33690,Elaine,168," Thank you, thank you, thank you very much."
33691,Keril,168, Nice carryall.
33692,Jerry,168, It's European.
33693,Keri,168, Do you still have my lipstick?
33694,Jerry,168," Uh, yeah, I think I do. I can never find anything in here. 
              Ah, here it is. So, that Joe Mayo throws the worst parties, doesn't 
              he? So what was your job?"
33695,Keri,168, My job was to keep you away from the music.
33696,Jerry,168," What, he doesn't like my taste in music?"
33697,Keri,168, Guess not.
33698,Jerry,168, You should've been there last year. I got jiggy with it!
33699,Silvio,168," Kramer! It's Silvio! Open up, I need to talk to you! I 
              can see you through the reverse peephole."
33700,Kramer,168," Hey, Silvio!"
33701,Silvio,168, Look at this.
33702,Kramer,168, Huh?
33703,Silvio,168," Svetlana says she find it in the laundry room, but I think 
              it is a gift from that postman agitator. Where is he?"
33704,Kramer,168," Relax, Silvio."
33705,Silvio,168," No, that's it. You're both out of the building!"
33706,Kramer,168," Oh, come on! Hey, Newman didn't even give her that! No, 
              that's not even a woman's coat. It's a man's!"
33707,Silvio,168, A man's?
33708,Kramer,168, Yeah.
33709,Silvio,168, What kind of a man would wear fur?
33710,Kramer,168," Oh, lots of 'em."
33711,Silvio,168, Would you?
33712,Kramer,168, No.
33713,Silvio,168, Then who?
33714,Kramer,168, What about Jerry?
33715,Silvio,168, Jerry?
33716,Kramer,168," Yeah, sure, he's a celebrity. Oh, yeah, they wear a lot 
              of furs. They're desperate, insecure people."
33717,Silvio,168," Yes, you are right. It's all about, me, me, me. Please, 
              look at me! I am so pretty! Love me! Want me!"
33718,Kramer,168," Yeah, something like that."
33719,Jerry,168, I have to do what?
33720,Kramer,168," All you have to do is wear the fur so Silvio thinks it's 
              yours."
33721,Jerry,168, I'm not wearing the fur.
33722,Kramer,168," Well, then, Newman and I, we get thrown out of the building."
33723,Jerry,168, Is that right?
33724,Kramer,168," All right, why don't you just take a good, hard look at 
              what your life will be like if I'm not around?"
33725,Jerry,168," Newman, too?"
33726,Kramer,168," Oh, come on, man! Well, I'll tell you what, if you do this, 
              I'll give you that walkman you're always asking about."
33727,Jerry,168, That's my walkman!
33728,Kramer,168, And you'll get it back.
33729,Jerry,168, All right.
33730,Kramer,168," All right. Good, thanks, I owe you one."
33731,George,168, Hey.
33732,Kramer,168," Oh, hey, and by the way, uh, that walkman was broke when 
              you gave it to me."
33733,Jerry,168," George, did you get that chair yet?"
33734,George,168, It gets here when it gets here. Would you stop ridin' me?
33735,Jerry,168, You know what? Just call up and cancel it. I'm out.
33736,George,168, Excuse me?
33737,Jerry,168," Joe Mayo doesn't like my taste in music. He's not gettin' 
              a gift from me."
33738,George,168," Oh, I can't believe you're dropping out, too. So now Kramer 
              and I have to pay for the entire gift?"
33739,Kramer,168," Whoa, whoa. Now, who's this Joe Mayo everyone's talking 
              about?"
33740,George,168," He's the guy we're the buying the chair for, remember? 
              It was your suggestion."
33741,Kramer,168," I think the chair is a fantastic gift idea. But I never 
              heard of this Joe Mayo. And frankly, it sounds made up."
33742,George,168," Oh, so now I have to buy this whole chair by myself?"
33743,Jerry,168," No, you don't have to buy anything."
33744,George,168," I already bought it! I've been lyin' to you for three days, 
              and now you're all screwin' me!"
33745,Jerry,168, I don't understand. Why didn't you tell us you had it?
33746,George,168, I needed it! My back is... a little tweaked.
33747,Jerry,168, Because of your giant wallet. Just get rid of it!
33748,George,168," Never! It is a part of me. I will just return the chair, 
              and it will be easy, because the receipt is in my good friend."
33749,Jerry,168, Your good friend is morbidly obese.
33750,George,168," Well, at least, I'm not carrying a purse."
33751,Jerry,168, It's not a purse. It's European!
33752,Kramer,168," All right, Silvio's down there. He's shoveling the walk. 
              Now, all you gotta do is put this on, you go down to the corner, 
              you pick up a paper, and you come"
33753,Jerry,168, All right.
33754,Kramer,168, There you go.
33755,Jerry,168, How do I look?
33756,Kramer,168, Ahh....
33757,George,168," Learn guitar, first lesson free? Huh."
33758,George,168, My receipts! The chair! My tiger poster!
33759,Jerry,168," Hey, Silvio, just out for a little stroll in my favorite 
              fur coat."
33760,Silvio,168, That is your coat?
33761,Jerry,168, It sure is.
33762,Silvio,168," Kramer says you need it because you're an entertainer and 
              you're desperate for attention."
33763,Jerry,168, That's true.
33764,Kramer,168," Jerry, you forgot your purse."
33765,Jerry,168," Oh, thanks."
33766,Kramer,168," Hey, Silvio, look at Jerry here, prancing around in his 
              coat with his purse. Yup, he's a dandy. He's a real fancy boy."
33767,Jerry,168, Maybe this isn't my coat.
33768,Kramer,168," All right, you're not fancy!"
33769,Silvio,168," No, he's very fancy! Want me, love me! Shower me with kisses!"
33770,Elaine,168," Jerry, where'd you get it? That's his coat."
33771,Jerry,168," No, it's not. It's mine. I'm a fancy boy."
33772,Elaine,168," No, that's not your coat."
33773,Silvio,168," If that is not his coat, whose coat is it?"
33774,Elaine,168, It's Joe Mayo's coat.
33775,Silvio,168, Who's Joe Mayo?
33776,Kramer,168, That must be the man that's sleeping with your wife.
33777,Jerry,168, Hey! Officer! Someone took my European carryall!
33778,Cop,168, Your what?
33779,Jerry,168," The...black, leather...thing with a strap."
33780,Cop,168, You mean a purse?
33781,Jerry,168," Yes, a purse. I carry a purse!"
33782,Jerry,168," So, Silvio ambushed Joe Mayo?"
33783,Elaine,168," Yeah, he was waitin' inside his apartment for him with 
              a sock full of pennies."
33784,Jerry,168, He should have had a reverse peephole.
33785,Puddy,168," Hey, Babe."
33786,Jerry,168, Hello? Hello?
33787,Elaine,168, What is that?
33788,Puddy,168, It's my new coat.
33789,Elaine,168, You ditched the fur?
33790,Puddy,168," Yeah, I saw Jerry wearing his. He looked like a bit of a 
              dandy. Check it out! 8-Ball! You got a question, you ask the 8-Ball."
33791,Elaine,168, You're gonna wear this all the time?
33792,Puddy,168, All signs point to 'Yes!'

              . No one can keep track of all those kids"
33807,Jerry,169, Oh! No it's Sally Weaver.
33808,Kramer,169, Oh! Yeah your old college roommate huh?
33809,Jerry,169," No , It's Susan Ross's old college roommate; she moved to 
              New York a few years ago . she's trying "
33810,Kramer,169," Hmmm,, Dramatica comedia heh!"
33811,Jerry,169," Untalented, She's always inviting me to see her in some 
              bad play in tiny room without ventilation."
33812,Kramer,169, Euh.. We don't go to enough theater.
33813,Jerry,169, She should just give up.
33814,Jerry,169, Heeyyy!...
33815,Sally,169," Hey there Mr. Too big to come to my shows. I just came back 
              from (?) Whoooooooo.....I'm on my"
33816,Kramer,169, Why don't you just give up?
33817,Jerry,169, Kramer!!!
33818,Kramer,169," At least that's what Jerry says. Now face it. If it hasn't 
              happen it's not gonna happen."
33819,Jerry,169, So......Susan's dead.....
33820,Kramer,169, I think she was happy someone finally said it.
33821,Jerry,169, Why'd you have to say anything to her?
33822,Kramer,169, 'felt that the conversation was lagging.
33823,Jerry,169, Why can't you ever keep your big mouth shut?
33824,Kramer,169," I come in here to get a pleasant meal and if we're not 
              gonna have one I'll grab a bite to eat at your"
33825,Elaine,169," You know, maybe Kramer is right, some people should just 
              give up . I have."
33826,Jerry,169, What did you wanna be?
33827,Elaine,169," I don't remember , but it certainly wasn't this. Look at 
              this cartoon in the New Yorker, I don't get"
33828,Jerry,169, I don't either.
33829,Elaine,169, And you're on the fringe of the humor business.
33830,George,169, Hey!
33831,Elaine,169, Hey! George look at this.
33832,George,169, That's cute.
33833,Elaine,169, You got it?
33834,George,169," No , never mind."
33835,Elaine,169," Come on , We're two intelligent people here. We can figure 
              this out. Now we got a dog and a cat in"
33836,Jerry,169," It looks like my accountant's office but there's no pets 
              working there."
33837,Elaine,169," The cat is saying "" I've enjoyed reading your E-mail""."
33838,George,169," Maybe it's got something to do with that 42 in the corner 
              ."
33839,Elaine,169, It's a page number.
33840,George,169," Well , I can't crack this one."
33841,Elaine,169, Aahh! this has got to be a mistake.
33842,George,169," try shaking it...(long pause) Well ,Janet should be here 
              any minute."
33843,Jerry,169, You've been hiding her from us. you must really like her?

              got such a nice face. hummmm her eyes, her"

33846,Janet,169, Nice to meet you.
33847,Elaine,169, Hi!
33848,Elaine,169," Jerry , She looks exactly like you."
33849,Jerry,169, She does not.
33850,Elaine,169," Well maybe she doesn't, I don't care."
33851,Jerry,169, Hey! Kramer.
33852,Kramer,169," hey! you got some messages.. Yeahumm.. .George, George, 
              Elaine, George again, Elaine, Newman; but that was a crank call."
33853,Jerry,169, What! You're the one who ruined her life.
33854,Kramer,169, Well that's not how she remembers it.
33855,Jerry,169," Well , I got to talk her out of this."
33856,Jerry,169," She does stink and she should quit. But I don't want it 
              to be because of me. It should be the"
33857,Jerry,169, Yeah...
33858,George,169, Hey! George and Janet.
33859,Kramer,169, Aahh...Who's Janet?
33860,Jerry,169," George's girlfriend , Elaine thinks she looks like me but 
              I think it's as you would say ,kookie talk."

              anything like Jerry"
33864,Janet,169, well maybe we do look a little like each other.
33865,George,169," No..hummm , What do you know about what you look like."
33866,Kramer,169," C'mon George relax . Just because they look alike doesn't 
              mean you're secretly in love with Jerry."

              cartoon. I mean I don't understand why"

33908,George,169, Don't leave (George slams the door)
33909,Kramer,169," Aw right. I know I've been shooting off at the mouth lately; 
              First with that girl whose life"
33910,George,169, What's the decision?
33911,Kramer,169," I know you want me to keep my big mouth shut and that's 
              exactly what I'm going to do."
33912,Jerry,169, Yeah right.
33913,Kramer,169," What do I need to talk for.. ha! , For to blab to the neighbors 
              about George has a new fem-Jerry"
33914,George,169, Silence YES!!
33915,Kramer,169," Jerry, ninety four percent of communications is non-verbal. 
              Here watch."
33916,Jerry,169, Well what does this mean?
33917,Kramer,169," Well it's Frank and Estelle's reaction of hearing George's 
              man love towards she-Jerry."
33918,George,169," (frantic by now) SHUT UP ,SHUT UP , SHUT UP,...(then leaves)"
33919,Kramer,169, That's the idea.
33920,Jerry,169, Kramer there's no way you stick to this.
33921,Kramer,169, (makes a zipper gesture to his mouth) ..Weeeeeepp!!
33922,Jerry,169, Oh! you just startin' now?
33923,Mr. Elinoff,169," So, J. Peterman wants to hire some of our cartoonists 
              to illustrate your catalog?"
33924,Elaine,169," Well we're hoping that if perhaps that the catalog is a 
              little funnier ,people"
33925,Mr. Elinoff,169," Oh! yeah... That's a rather clever jab at inter office 
              politics don't you think."
33926,Elaine,169," Ahan, Ahan....yeah...Euh but, Why is it that the, that 
              the animals enjoy reading the email?"
33927,Mr. Elinoff,169," Well Miss Benes . Cartoons are like gossamer and one 
              doesn't dissect gossamer. heh..hemm.."
33928,Mr. Elinoff,169," Ha! It's merely a commentary on contemporary mores. 
              (slides the magazine to her)"
33929,Elaine,169," But, what is the comment. (she slides the magazine back 
              to him)"
33930,Mr. Elinoff,169, It's a slice of life. 
33931,Elaine,169, No it isn't.
33932,Mr. Elinoff,169, Pun?
33933,Elaine,169," I don,t think so."
33934,Mr Elinoff,169, Vorshtein?
33935,Elaine,169," That's not a word.....You have no idea what this means 
              do you?"
33936,Mr Elinoff,169, No.
33937,Elaine,169, Then why did you print it.
33938,Mr. Elinoff,169, I liked the kitty.
33939,Elaine,169," (gets up) You know what? you people should be ashamed of 
              yourself, you know ya doodle a couple of bears"
33940,Mr. Elinoff,169, Actually that's not bad..
33941,Elaine,169, Oh! really (laughs) well you know..... I have others
33942,Sally,169," No, no.. It's just a little performance piece I wrote... 
              You know what? You really inspired me ,oKay , a tear."
33943,Jerry,169, Ah! There you are.( Kramer motions silence)
33944,Sally,169," Hi everybody think you're really going to like this 'cos 
              it' about me...All right it's not just about me"
33945,Jerry,169, ( to Kramer) Oh! Shut up!!!
33946,Elaine,169," She does a full hour about how you're the devil .I got 
              to go see this thing."
33947,Jerry,169," Good luck , It's sold out for the next three weeks."
33948,Elaine,169," Well I bet I can get in once I mention I'm from ...The 
              New Yorker."
33949,Jerry,169, The New Yorker?
33950,Elaine,169," Yes , The New Yorker , I've met with their cartoon editor 
              and I got him to admit that that cartoon"
33951,Jerry,169," Wow! Good work, Nancy Drew"
33952,Elaine,169," Then we ended up going out to lunch and he had some great 
              gossip about James Thurber."
33953,Jerry,169, Nodding off...
33954,Elaine,169, ....And he said I could submit some of my own cartoons.
33955,Jerry,169, Wow! that's incredible......But you don't draw.
33956,Elaine,169, I do to.
33957,Jerry,169," What , your sad little horsies , the house with the little 
              curl of smoke , the sunflower with the smiley"
33958,Elaine,169, It's better than your drawings of naked Lois Lane.
33959,Jerry,169, Where did you see that? Those are private!!!
33960,Sally,169," Jerry , sorry I'm late. Channel Nine is doing a piece on 
              my show. Isn't that great? Do you hate me?"
33961,Jerry,169," No ,no I tought the show was terrific. I was just wondering 
              if you have to keep saying Jerry Seinfeld"
33962,Sally,169, Well...That is the title.
33963,Jerry,169," I know but I thought that maybe you could mention how I 
              apologized then encouraged you to stick with it."
33964,Sally,169," You know I workshopped that and.. SNOOZERS!!! he he he....but 
              I'll tell you what I'll think..."
33965,Jerry,169, You got a little shmootz there (picks something on her sweater)
33966,Newman,169," Excuse me Miss Weaver , OH! My god it is you! I.. I've 
              seen your show six times.."
33967,Jerry,169, What a surprise.
33968,Newman,169," Aahh! You're great ,It's great , It's so great to see a 
              show that's (looks at Jerry) about something."
33969,Driver,169, Where to?
33970,George,169," (we hear him think) My friends are idiots , she doesn't 
              look like Jerry. She doesn't look like anybody."
33971,Sally,169, You know I really do look like your friend Jerry.
33972,George,169, I know....
33973,TV announcer,169," Thanks for watching Nine News. We leave you tonight 
              with a scene from Sally Weavers One woman show."
33974,Sally,169," Ok so I go to meet Jerry Seinfeld at this horrible coffee 
              shop right? And he's like ""Hey stop doing "
33975,Jerry,169, There really was shmootz on I didn't try to grab her
33976,Sally,169, ...And this is what he looks like when he's eating...
33977,Jerry,169, Get Out of my House!!.
33978,Elaine,169," Well boys, I did it. I had to stay up all night but I finally 
              came up with a great New Yorker cartoon."
33979,Jerry,169," I'd stayed up all night I'd fixed myself up a little before 
              I'd go out."
33980,Elaine,169, That is not the point.
33981,Jerry,169," some mouthwash , a hat , something."
33982,Elaine,169, Just read it!
33983,Jerry,169, (glances at it) Pretty good.
33984,Elaine,169," Pretty good? Well uh! This is a gem . Kramer look it....(Kramer 
              stays silent).....What?"
33985,Jerry,169, It's a pig at a complain department.
33986,Elaine,169," And he's saying "" I wish I was taller"" ha ha. 
              See? that's his complaint."
33987,Jerry,169, I get it.
33988,Elaine,169, Do you!!!.. because that's not a normal complaint.
33989,Jerry,169," How 'bout if it was something like "" I can't find my 
              receipt my place's a stye."
33990,Elaine,169, Everything with you has to be so .. jokey.
33991,Jerry,169, I'm a comedian.
33992,Elaine,169," I wish I was taller, that's, that's, that's nice. that's 
              real."
33993,Jerry,169, Well I got a complaint. This cartoon stinks.
33994,Elaine,169," I'll tell you who doesn't think it stinks , The New Yorker. 
              that's right. They're publishing it in their "
33995,Jerry,169, oh! that's it I'm gonna put an end to this.
33996,Elaine,169," The pig says ""my wife is a slut."""
33997,Jerry,169," Now that's a complaint. ...Hello Sally , yeah this is Jerry 
              ,I just wanted to leave you a message that I "
33998,Jerry,169," ....I'm getting a little tired of hearing how horrible I 
              am and would appreciate it if you would leave"

              in the big guns."

              wish I was taller (hearty laugh)"

              funny and you want to know why?"
34007,Dugan,169, You shouldn't make fun of pigs. ( he leaves)
34008,Elaine,169, Oh! Do tell sir?
34009,Elaine,169, A Ziggy?

              Some charlatan has stolen a Ziggy and"
34011,George,169," You know , you know what's great about our relationship?...It's 
              not about looks."
34012,Janet,169, It's not?
34013,Janet,169, I remember you said I was the prettiest girl at the party.
34014,George,169, ....But after that we really talked didn't we?
34015,Janet,169," Well ,you told me how familiar I looked and that you must 
              have seen me somewhere before."
34016,George,169," Na....no ... This relationship he..he..has got to be about 
              something and fast or I'm in very "
34017,Janet,169," You asked for a piece of gum because you thought your breath 
              smelled like hummus."
34018,George,169, Aw right YES! GUM! Good enough I'll take it.
34019,Janet,169, I like gum.
34020,George,169," I do too. you see that's what we're about . You don't remind 
              me of anyone and we love gum."
34021,Janet,169, I have gum in my hair.
34022,George,169, I'm losin' it
34023,Kramer,169," (loudly) Now you gotta shut up!.....(Sally is speechless)...I'm 
              sorry, I..I haven't spoken in days."
34024,Sally,169," Well , lay it on me string bean."
34025,Janet,169," Let me get this gum out of my hair and then I'll be ready 
              for bed."
34026,George,169," OK Look , the gum isn't cutting it for me. We need to be 
              about something else...anything..please."
34027,Janet,169, George.
34028,George,169, Your hair?
34029,Janet,169," Well I had to cut the gum out and I had a little trouble 
              getting it even. So why don't you get undressed"
34030,George,169, George is in big trouble....
34031,Jerry,169, You ripped off a Ziggy?
34032,Elaine,169," It must've seeped up my subconscious , Puddy has Ziggy 
              bed sheets....D'you read the comics today?"
34033,Jerry,169," I see that Ziggy's back at the complaint department.. ""The 
              New Yorker is stealing my ideas."""
34034,Elaine,169," Hey look it ;Sally's cable show's on ( Kramer turns around 
              to leave)"
34035,Jerry,169," Hey! Kramer come on in. You've got to watch this , now she's 
              got nothing."
34036,Sally,169," (on TV) Master of Evil Jerry Seinfeld has broke off all 
              contacts with me."
34037,Jerry,169, That's right sister. Why don't you just give up?
34038,Elaine,169, Why are you yelling at the TV?
34039,Sally,169," ..OK get this; I heard he makes his best friend date women 
              that look just like him.Hello issues.."
34040,Jerry,169," Elaine , have you been talking to her?"

              and begged his"
34043,Jerry,169, ( to Kramer) I thought you stopped talking??

34045,Jerry,169," You broke up with her just because she cut her hair! how 
              short?"

              wasn't for the toilet, there"
34093,JERRY,173," (Sarcastic) Yeah. I understand Guttenberg used to spend 
              a lot of time in there."
34094,GEORGE,173," They're selling coffee, bran muffins.. you're surrounded 
              by reading material. It's entrapment!"

              'French Impressionist Paintings'?"
34096,GEORGE,173, I find the soothing pastorial images very conduc-
34097,JERRY,173, (Cutting him off) Thank you very much.
34098,GEORGE,173," Well, I'm gonna go back there later and return it when 
              there's different people working.. You want to catch a movie?"
34099,JERRY,173," I can't. I'm meeting Uncle Leo. I saw him shoplifting at 
              the bookstore."
34100,GEORGE,173," (Praising Leo's stealing) Alright, Leo! Stickin' it to 
              the man!"

34104,GEORGE,173," You, uh, didn't dance again, did you?"
34105,ELAINE,173," (Angered) No, I found a better way to humiliate myself. 
              There was this guy, and we had a few too many.."
34106,GEORGE,173, You went home with him?

              down!"

              Did you end up xeroxing anything?"

              is to someone in my position?"
34110,JERRY,173, (Confused) What's your position?
34111,ELAINE,173, I am an associate.
34112,GEORGE,173," Hey, me too."
34113,WAITRESS,173," Yeah, me too."
34114,ELAINE,173, Oh God. Why did I do this? Now I'm the office skank.
34115,GEORGE,173," Well, unless you tell everybody you're dating."
34116,ELAINE,173," (Liking the idea) Ohh.. right. Cause if we're dating, what 
              everyone saw was just a beautiful moment between two lovers."
34117,JERRY,173," (Jokingly rubbing it in) As opposed to a spirited bout of 
              Skanko-Roman wrestling."

              sandwiches?"

34122,NEWMAN,173," (Gesturing to dishes and silverware on the table) But you 
              can clear some of this stuff out of the way."
34123,KRAMER,173," Jerry, check this out. (Pointing at some papers on the 
              table) Remember my idea about rickshaws in New Youk? Well, we're 
              gonna make it happen!"

34127,NEWMAN,173, He's shipping us a rickshaw. It can't miss!
34128,JERRY,173," Yes, it can."
34129,KRAMER,173," We'll start out with one, and they when it catches on, 
              we're gonna have a whole fleet!"

34137,NEWMAN,173, Can't we worry about them later?
34138,KRAMER,173, (Explaining) To pull the rickshaw.
34139,NEWMAN,173," (Pondering Kramer's plan out loud) They do have an intimate 
              knowledge of the street.."
34140,KRAMER,173," They're always walkin' around the city. Why not just strap 
              something to them?!"

              money? Are you strapped? Do you need a little?"

              amending what he just said) But I'm not."

34149,LEO,173, Why didn't ya say hello?
34150,JERRY,173, Because you were too busy stealing a book.
34151,LEO,173, (Giving a courtesy lesson) You still say hello.

34155,LEO,173, Senior citizens. No big deal.
34156,JERRY,173, You could get arrested.
34157,LEO,173," Arrested? Come on! (Goes into a routine explaination for his 
              stealing) I'm an old man. I'm confused! I thought I paid for it.

              back and forth between Newman and him with each word of the rhyme) 
              One spot, two spot,"
34310,NEWMAN,173, (Realizing he won) Yeah.
34311,KRAMER,173," Best two out of three? (Starts the pointing and the rhyme 
              again) One spot, two spot.."
34312,NEMWAN,173," Hey, boy. Smooth it out up there. Too much jostling!"
34313,[Setting,173, A homeless charity center]
34314,REBECCA,173," (Gesturing tward the book) So, you want to donate this 
              to charity?"
34315,GEORGE,173," Well, I assume there's some sort of write-off."
34316,REBECCA,173, What's the value of the book?
34317,GEORGE,173," Uh, about two hundred dollars, Miss DeMooney."
34318,REBECCA,173, (Correcting. Stern) It's DeMornay. Rebecca DeMornay.
34319,GEORGE,173, Oh.
34320,REBECCA,173," (Opens the cover of the book) Oh, wait a second. (Certain) 
              This book has been in the bathroom."
34321,GEORGE,173," (Nervous) Wh-what are you talking about? That - that's 
              rediculous."
34322,REBECCA,173," It's been flagged. I know. I used to work in a Brentano's. 
              Mister, we're trying to help the homeless heare - it's bad enough 
              that we have some nut out"
34323,GEORGE,173," (Desperate to get rid of the book) Alright, I, I'll just 
              take fifty. Do - do we have a deal?"
34324,GEORGE,173, I could take it in merchandise..
34325,REBECCA,173, (Threatening to hit him) Here I come..
34326,[Setting,173, Bookstore]
34327,ELAINE,173," So, this book'll tell me how to get puke out of cashmere?"
34328,CASHIER,173, Yeah.
34329,ELAINE,173, Great.
34330,JERRY,173," (To Elaine) So, the worst is over?"
34331,ELAINE,173," Yeah. Now I can break up with him. He's clean, and I'm 
              the office hero."
34332,JERRY,173," Seems like you're better at fake relationships than real 
              ones."
34333,ELAIEN,173," Yeah, huh. I even got an idea out of it. the Detox Poncho."
34334,ELAINE,173, (Leaving Jerry) See ya.
34335,JERRY,173," (To cashier) I'd like to speak with the manager, please."
34336,[Setting,173, NYC Street]
34337,NEWMAN,173," Mind your pace, Boy. Chop, chop!"
34338,KRAMER,173," (Tired) Oh, I can't go on. I gotta take a break. (Sets 
              the rickshaw down - taking a rest)"
34339,NEWMAN,173," Well, don't tarry. I'm behind schedule as it is."
34340,KRAMER,173, (Stretching) Oh..
34341,NEWMAN,173, (Scared) Boy.. Boy. Kramer!
34342,KRAMER,173, Woah! Wait!
34343,NEWMAN,173, Ahhh! Yaaaahhh!
34344,ZACH,173," (Optimistic) Well, this is the first day of the rest of my 
              life!"
34345,NEWMAN,173, Waaaaahhhh!
34346,[Setting,173, Bookstore]
34347,JERRY,173, George? What are you doin' here?
34348,GEORGE,173, I can't sell the book. It's been marked.
34349,JERRY,173, (Sarcasticly joking) It certainly has.
34350,GEORGE,173," So, I'm gonna steal another one, and then return it. That 
              way, everything is even."
34351,JERRY,173," (Trying to straighten things out) You defile one book, steal 
              another, ask for your money back - and to you that's even?"
34352,GEORGE,173, I'm goin' in!
34353,MANAGER,173, Did you want to speak with the manager?
34354,JERRY,173, Yes. My Uncle Leo was cought shoplifing here the other day..
34355,MANAGER,173," Yes, Uncle Leo. I remember him. I'm sorry, our policy 
              is we prosecute all shoplifters."
34356,JERRY,173," (Pleading) Oh, come on. He's just a lonely old man. All 
              old people steal."
34357,MANAGER,173," That's right. That's why we stopped carrying batteries. 
              Look, I'll be honest with you, we've had a lot of trouble with theft 
              lately - and my boss says I have to make an example to someone."
34358,JERRY,173, So it could be anyone?
34359,MANAGER,173, I.. guess. As long as we catch him in the act.
34360,JERRY,173, That guy! (Pointing at George) Swarm! Swarm!
34361,GEORGE,173, No! Jerry!
34362,ALL (singing),174, Happy birthday to you. 
34363,WALTER,174, Thanks.
34364,FEMALE WORKER,174," Elaine, cake?"
34365,ELAINE,174," Uh, no, thanks."
34366,FEMALE WORKER,174, It's Walter's special day.
34367,ELAINE,174," You know, there are 200 people who work in this office. 
              Every day is somebody's special day."
34368,MALE WORKER,174," Elaine! Where're you going? It's Walter's last day. 
              We have to celebrate."
34369,ELAINE,174, It's his birthday and it's his last day?
34370,MALE WORKER,174," This is other-Walter, from returns."
34371,OTHER-WALTER,174," Hey, what's going on here?"
34372,ALL,174, Surprise! 
34373,OTHER-WALTER,174, Oh guys.
34374,OTHER-WALTER,174," Elaine, it's my last day. Have a piece."
34375,ELAINE,174," All right, pile it on."
34376,"ALL (singing, competing)",174," For he's a jolly good fellow...happy 
              birthday to you...for he's a jolly good fellow...birthday to you...which 
              nobody can deny..."
34377,JERRY,174, What is so bad about having a little piece of cake?
34378,ELAINE,174," It is the forced socializing. I mean, just because we work 
              in the same office, why do we have to act like we're friends?"
34379,JERRY,174, Why aren't you there now?
34380,ELAINE,174," I had to take a sick day. I'm so sick of these people. 
              By the way, I talked to Lisi, and tomorrow night's good for her."
34381,JERRY,174," You know, I shouldn't go out with a friend of yours. I foresee 
              messiness."
34382,ELAINE,174," Yeah, you're better off sitting around here, reading comic 
              books, and eating spaghetti at two in the morning.."
34383,JERRY,174," Hey, speaking of tomato sauce, you want to come with me 
              and George to Mario's Pizza?"
34384,ELAINE,174, Your old high school hangout? Why?
34385,JERRY,174, They're closing. We're going for one last slice.
34386,KRAMER,174," Hey. All right. Hi. Check it out, official police caution 
              tape. Look at that. "
34387,KRAMER,174," Uh-uh-uh. Step back, son, there's nothing to see here."
34388,JERRY,174, Where did you get this?
34389,KRAMER,174," Well, I got it from my cop buddy Doug."
34390,JERRY,174," You sure have a lot of friends. How come I never see any 
              of these people?"
34391,KRAMER,174, They want to know why they never see you.
34392,KRAMER,174, I'm gonna eat that later.
34393,JERRY,174, So they just gave you this?
34394,KRAMER,174," Oh no, no,. no. I had to fish around in the evidence room 
              for it. You know, they're all preoccupied, trying to hunt down this 
              new psycho-serial killer, the Lopper. All right, I'll see ya."
34395,ELAINE,174," Wait a minute, wait a minute. Who is the Lopper?"
34396,KRAMER,174," Oh, it's no big deal. It's just some guy who's been running 
              around Riverside park-pffff. You know, cutting people's heads off."
34397,JERRY,174, How come I haven't read about this?
34398,KRAMER,174," Well, you know, the police, they've been having some internal 
              dissension about the name."
34399,ELAINE,174, Really? What're the other titles?
34400,KRAMER,174," Uh, Headso...uh...The Denogginizer...Son of dad."
34401,JERRY,174, Son of dad?
34402,KRAMER,174, Yeah. That was my suggestion. It's sort of a catchall.
34403,GEORGE,174, Mario's Pizza.
34404,GEORGE,174," Just as she was. Hey, Mario! Remember us?"
34405,MARIO,174, No.
34406,JERRY,174, We used to come in every day.
34407,MARIO,174, So where ya been? We're tanking here.
34408,GEORGE,174, We'll have 2 slices and 2 grape sodas.
34409,MARIO,174," Oh, thanks. That'll save us."
34410,JERRY,174," All right, make it the large sodas."
34411,GEORGE,174," Hey, Jerry, remember Frogger? I used to be so into this 
              game. Gettin' that frog across the street was my entire life."
34412,JERRY,174," Yeah. And then you went on to...Well, it's a good game."
34413,GEORGE,174, Double jump! Eat the fly! Eat it!
34414,BOY,174, Thanks a lot.
34415,GEORGE,174," Ah, beat it, punk."
34416,JERRY,174," Hey, look at the high score--""G.L.C."" George Louis 
              Costanza. That's not you, is it?"
34417,GEORGE,174," Yes! 860,000. I can't believe it's still standing. No one 
              has beaten me in like 10 years."
34418,JERRY,174, I remember that night.
34419,GEORGE,174," The perfect combination of Mountain Dew and mozzarella...just 
              the right amount of grease on the joy stick..."
34420,MARIO,174, Here's your pizza pea brains.
34421,JERRY,174, I think I remember why we stopped coming here.
34422,GEORGE,174, Yeah.
34423,ELAINE (thinking),174," This pen smells really bad. So why do I keep 
              smelling it? Is it too late for me to go to law school?"
34424,ELAINE,174, What is this?
34425,MALE WORKER,174," You were out sick yesterday, so we got you a get-well 
              cake."
34426,FEMALE WORKER,174, It's carrot. It's good for you.
34427,WORKERS (singing),174," Get well get well soon, we wish you to get--"
34428,ELAINE,174," Stop it! That's not even a song! I mean, now we're celebrating 
              a sick day?"
34429,MALE WORKER,174, I think it's nice.
34430,ELAINE,174," What? What is nice? Trying to fill the void in your life 
              with flour and sugar and egg and vanilla? I mean, we are all unhappy. 
              Do we have to be fat, too? Not you Becky, I know you have a slow 
              metabolism. I don't want one more piece of cake in my office!"
34431,WORKER (singing),174," Get well, get well soon--"
34432,MALE WORKER,174, It's not happening.
34433,BECKY,174, Can we still it eat?
34434,JERRY,174," I'll tell you Lisi, I never expected that movie to--"
34435,LISI,174, End under water?
34436,JERRY,174," Be that long. I mean, most action movies are--"
34437,LISI,174, So much more violent.
34438,JERRY,174, Not as long.
34439,LISI,174," Well, I should probably--"
34440,JERRY,174, Get going.
34441,LISI,174, Yeah.
34442,JERRY,174," Well, it was nice meeting you. I'm sure I'll see you--"
34443,LISI,174, Eight tomorrow?
34444,JERRY,174," Actually, that's--"
34445,LISI,174, What you were thinking.
34446,JERRY,174, Right.
34447,GEORGE,174," Oh! Here you are. Ha ha...You, uh, you want to--"
34448,JERRY,174, Sure. (points at booth) How about this one?
34449,GEORGE,174," Well, I'm doing it, Jerry. I'm buying the Frogger machine. 
              Now the torch will burn forever."
34450,JERRY,174," Fabulous. See, now you're really do something."
34451,GEORGE,174," So, you want to come down to Mario's Pizza with me and 
              help me pick up the Frogger?"
34452,JERRY,174," Hey, how you gonna keep the machine plugged in while you 
              move it?"
34453,GEORGE,174, What?
34454,JERRY,174," Once you unplug the machine, all the scores will be erased."
34455,GEORGE,174," You're right. Why must there always be a problem? You'd 
              think just once I could get a break. God knows I earned it with 
              that score!"
34456,KRAMER,174," Well, more bad news Jerry."
34457,KRAMER,174," You know the police, they found another victim of the Lopper 
              in Riverside Park. I saw the photo, and it looked a lot like you."
34458,KRAMER,174, Not as many as there used to be.
34459,GEORGE,174," No. I need a guy that can rig a Frogger machine so that 
              I can move it without losing power, 'cause I have the high score. 
              H-hello?"
34460,KRAMER,174," You know, George, you're not gonna find an electrician 
              like that in the yellow pages. Now, I know just the guy who can 
              do this."
34461,JERRY,174, Another friend?
34462,KRAMER,174," Oh, no, no, no. This guy is no friend. In fact, we don't 
              even get along."
34463,GEORGE,174," Well, is he good, Kramer?"
34464,KRAMER,174," Oh, he's the best...and the worst."
34465,GEORGE,174," Kramer, listen to me. I'm never gonna have a child. If 
              I lose this Frogger high score, that's it for me."
34466,KRAMER,174," Believe me George, you can count on Slippery Pete."
34467,GEORGE,174, Slippery Pete?
34468,KRAMER,174," Yeah, I don't care for the name, either. In fact, that's 
              one of the things that we argue about."
34469,GEORGE,174," All right, I'm gonna find a guy with a truck. GLC must 
              live on!"
34470,JERRY,174, Come on.
34471,KRAMER,174, Dng-ga-gng-ga-wt.
34472,JERRY,174, Hello?
34473,INTERCUT,174,
34474,ELAINE,174, So how's it going with my friend?
34475,JERRY,174, She's a sentence finisher. It's like dating Mad Libs.
34476,JERRY,174, What is that?
34477,JERRY,174, So join in.
34478,ELAINE,174," I can't. I denounced them. Maybe I'll go raid Peterman's 
              fridge. He's always got a truffle or something in there."
34479,JERRY,174, All right.
34480,JERRY,174," Hey, wh-what--"
34481,KRAMER,174, Yeah. I dropped an egg. Be careful.
34482,ELAINE,174, Anybody here? Peterboy?
34483,ELAINE,174," Ooh, it's a cake walk."
34484,PETERMAN (singing),174," Get well, get well soon we wish you to get 
              well."
34485,PETERMAN,174," Ha ha ha ha...Oh, what a stirring little anthem of wellness."
34486,ELAINE,174," Mr. Peterman, um--"
34487,PETERMAN,174," We missed you at the get well party. Poor old Walt has 
              a polyp in the duodenum. It's benign, but--ooh--still a bastard. 
              Oh, Elaine, can you keep a secret?"
34488,ELAINE,174," No, sir, I can't."
34489,PETERMAN,174," Inside that small college boy minifridge is my latest 
              acquisition. A slice of cake from the wedding of King Edward VIII 
              to Wallis Simpson, circa 1937, price--$29,000."
34490,JERRY,174," Well Lisi, that was another-"
34491,LISI,174, Lovely evening.
34492,JERRY,174, Really bad meal. I was thinking maybe we should--
34493,LISI,174, Go for a hansom cab ride?
34494,JERRY,174, Call it a night. I'll walk you home. Where do you live?
34495,LISI,174," 84th street, right off Riverside Park."
34496,JERRY,174, Riverside Park.
34497,LISI,174, I thought we were going--
34498,JERRY,174, Back to my place. That's right.
34499,GEORGE,174, So you slept with her?
34500,JERRY,174," She lives right off Riverside Park. I was scared of the 
              Lopper, So I let her stay over."
34501,GEORGE,174, And you automatically sleep with her?
34502,JERRY,174," Well, I just wanted to make out a little, but she kind of--"
34503,GEORGE,174, Finished your thought.
34504,ELAINE,174, Guess what I ate.
34505,GEORGE,174, An ostrich burger.
34506,ELAINE,174," No. A $29,000 piece of cake. Peterman got it at The Duke 
              Of Windsor auction. It was the most romantic thing I've ever eaten."
34507,JERRY,174, How'd it taste?
34508,ELAINE,174, A little stale.
34509,JERRY,174, Yeah.
34510,GEORGE (nudges Elaine with his elbow),174," So, uh are you sleeping 
              with Peterman?"
34511,ELAINE (nudges George with her elbow),174," No. He doesn't know I ate 
              it. In fact, he almost caught me. I have to sneak back in and even 
              it out."
34512,GEORGE,174," You know, they say ostrich has less fat, but you eat more 
              of it."
34513,ELAINE,174," Hey, so I talked to Lisi and she has got a big surprise 
              for you. She's planning a weekend trip to Pennsylvania Dutch country."
34514,JERRY,174," Pennsylvania Dutch country? Oh, that's the serious relationship 
              weekend place."
34515,EALINE,174, What is going on with you two?
34516,JERRY,174," Well, I think by sleeping with her, I may have sent her 
              the wrong message."
34517,GEORGE,174, What's that?
34518,JERRY,174," Well, I'm calling this off right now. "
34519,ELAINE,174," No, no. You are way past the phone call breakup stage."
34520,JERRY,174," Well, I'm not going over there. That's where the Lopper 
              is."
34521,ELAINE,174," Oh...it's daylight. It won't take you that long. Just make 
              a clean break."
34522,ELAINE,174, Just a little off the side...
34523,ELAINE,174," Well, no point in wasting $1,200."
34524,ELAINE (thinking),174," Oh, commander, isn't the wedding marvelous? 
              More cake? Oh, I shouldn't. I mustn't. Ah, what the hell?"
34525,GEORGE,174," Now, each of you is here because you're the best at what 
              you do."
34526,GEORGE,174," Slippery Pete, Kramer tells me you are one hell of a rogue 
              electrician. And shlomo, you're the best truck driver."
34527,SHLOMO,174, I don't know If I'm the best.
34528,GEORGE,174, Oh...you're very good.
34529,SHLOMO,174," Let's say ""good."""
34530,GEORGE,174," Ok. Good. And Kramer, you're in charge of taping off the 
              loading zone."
34531,KRAMER,174, Lock and load.
34532,SLIPPERY PETE,174," You think you can handle that, numb nuts?"
34533,KRAMER,174," All right, all right, come on, now."
34534,SLIPPERY PETE,174, That was my mail-order bride.
34535,KRAMER,174," Hey, you weren't home, so I signed for her."
34536,SLIPPERY PETE,174, It doesn't give you the right to make out with her.
34537,KRAMER,174, You weren't even married yet.
34538,GEORGE,174," All right, all right, calm down, calm down. Whatever happened 
              in the past is past."
34539,GEORGE,174," Now, this is the basic layout for Mario's Pizza."
34540,SHLOMO,174, So what kind of jail time are we looking at if we're caught?
34541,GEORGE,174, What do you mean?
34542,SLIPPERY PETE,174," We're stealing this thing, right?"
34543,GEORGE,174, No. I--I paid for it.
34544,SLIPPERY PETE,174, I thought we were stealing it.
34545,KRAMER,174, Yeah. It feels like we're stealing it.
34546,GEORGE,174, We're not stealing it.
34547,SHLOMO,174, I definitely thought we're stealing it.
34548,GEORGE,174," All right, let's--let's focus. Can we get back to the plan?"
34549,SLIPPERY PETE,174," Well, I need a battery for this kind of a job. Can 
              I at least steal a battery?"
34550,GEORGE,174," Fine. Steal the battery. Now, all right, here is the Frogger. 
              This is the front door, and this is the outlet."
34551,SLIPPERY PETE,174, What's that?
34552,GEORGE,174, The outlet?
34553,SLIPPERY PETE,174, Mm-hmm.
34554,GEORGE,174, That's where the electricity comes out.
34555,SLIPPERT PETE,174," Oh, you mean the holes."
34556,SHLOMO,174, Which one's the bathroom?
34557,GEORGE,174," Uh, here."
34558,SHLOMO,174, They put the Frogger with the toilet? Yecchh.
34559,GEORGE,174, The Frogger is here.
34560,KRAMER,174," George, I thought that was the door."
34561,SLIPPERY PETE,174, Where are all the pizza ovens?
34562,SHLOMO,174, I thought the bathroom was here.
34563,GEORGE,174, All right. You understand now? It's not that complicated.
34564,ELAINE,174,I need to replace an antique piece of cake.
34565,ELAINE,174," Do you have anything that's been...you know, laying around 
              for a while? Something prewar would be just great."
34566,KRAMER,174," Oh, hey, Elaine. What, you got the munchies?"
34567,ELAINE,174," Oh, Kramer, I am in big. big, big trouble. I need a cake 
              that looks like this."
34568,KRAMER,174," Oh, yeah--Sotheby's. Yeah. They make good cake."
34569,ELAINE,174, Do any of these look close?
34570,KRAMER,174," No, but I know I've seen cake just like that. Oh--Entenmann's. 
              Yeah."
34571,ELAINE,174, Entenmann's? From the supermarket?
34572,KRAMER,174," Well, no. They're not really in the supermarket. Yeah, 
              they got their own case at the end of the aisle."
34573,JERRY,174," Hi, Lisi."
34574,LISI,174," Hi, honey. Is that a bat? "
34575,JERRY,174," Uh, yeah. I found it on the street. It's gotta be worth 
              something."
34576,LISI,174," So, what do you want to do, Sweetheart?"
34577,JERRY,174," Well, before we do anything...maybe we should talk."
34578,MONTAGE,174,
34579,JERRY,174," Then this Pennsylvania Dutch thing comes out of nowhere. 
              I mean, how am I supposed to respond to that?"
34580,LISI,174, Then may I say something... without being interrupted?
34581,JERRY,174," Well I'm sorry if I ruined your life. That's exactly what 
              I set out to do."
34582,LISI,174, Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Mm-hmm. Uh-huh...
34583,LISI,174, Are you afraid to kiss me in public?
34584,JERRY,174, Have we even been in public?
34585,LISI,174," So now you're going to tell me what I'm thinking. Well, go 
              ahead, 'cause I'd really like to know."
34586,JERRY,174, You are not dumb. Don't say that..
34587,JERRY,174, These beans are pretty good.
34588,LISI,174, 20 minutes.
34589,JERRY,174," Well, I'm sorry I'm not Brad. I'm me!"
34590,JERRY,174, Nice to meet ya!
34591,LISI,174," Boy, did your mother do a number on you."
34592,LISI,174, Fine. So it's over.
34593,JERRY,174," Oh, thank god. Why is it dark out? What time is it?"
34594,JERRY,174, We've been breaking up for 10 hours?
34595,LISI,174," Good-bye, Jerry."
34596,JERRY,174," Lopper. You know, Lisi, maybe we should give this a little 
              more time. See how it looks in the light of day."
34597,LISI,174, Out!
34598,JERRY,174, Lopper.
34599,JERRY,174," Lisi, Lisi. Let me in! We can work this out. I was wrong, 
              you were right. I'll do anything!"
34600,GEORGE,174," Jerry, you came for the big moment."
34601,JERRY,174, No. I'm waiting for...
34602,GEORGE,174," Ha ha. Everything's timed out to perfection, Jerry. Slippery 
              Pete's got the Frogger running on battery power, the truck will 
              be there any minute, and Kramer's taped out the loading zone."
34603,JERRY,174, Oh. Sounds great.
34604,GEORGE,174," Yeah, yeah. You gotta come over tonight. We can play."
34605,JERRY,174," Oh, I can't. I'm busy. I'm going away on a long weekend."
34606,GEORGE,174, Where?
34607,LISI,174," Look what I found. I got one for you, too."
34608,JERRY,174," Great. Uh, you know what? Why don't you put it in the car 
              so I don't toss it in that dumpster?"
34609,LISI,174," Ha ha. Ok. I'll meet thee in front of your place, 15 minutes."
34610,JERRY,174," A long, long weekend."
34611,GEORGE,174, I hear thee.
34612,PETERMAN,174," Elaine! Excellent. I'd like you to meet a friend of mine, 
              Irwin Lubeck."
34613,ELAINE,174," Oh, hello."
34614,LUBECK,174, Charmed.
34615,PETERMAN,174," All right, brace yourself, Lubeck. You are about to be 
              launched via pastry back to the wedding of one of the most dashing 
              and romantic Nazi sympathizers of the entire British Royal family."
34616,ELAINE,174, I guess I'll just--
34617,PETERMAN,174," Oh, no Elaine, stay. Lubeck here is the world's foremost 
              appraiser of vintage pastry."
34618,PETERMAN,174," All right, Lubeck. How much is she worth?"
34619,LUBECK,174, I'd say about 219.
34620,PETERMAN,174," Ha ha ha ha ha!$219,000! Lubeck, you glorious titwillow. 
              You just made me a profit of $190,000."
34621,LUBECK,174," No, $2.19. It's an Entenmann's."
34622,PETERMAN,174, Do they have a castle at Windsor?
34623,LUBECK,174, No. They have a display case at the end of the aisle.
34624,PETERMAN,174," Oh, good lord."
34625,LUBECK,174," You all right, Peterman? You look ill."
34626,ELAINE (singing),174," Get well, get well soon, we want you to get well. 
              Get well, get well soon we want you to get well."
34627,GEORGE,174, What are you guys doing?
34628,SHLOMO,174, Eat the fly. Eat the fly. Got him!
34629,GEORGE,174, You idiots. You're gonna wear down the battery.
34630,SLIPPERY PETE,174," The batteries are fine. We've got...oh, god. only 
              3 minutes left."
34631,GEORGE,174, Quick. Get this thing back in the pizzeria
34632,KRAMER,174," George, they closed up."
34633,GEORGE,174, I need an outlet!
34634,SLIPPERY PETE,174, A what?
34635,GEORGE,174, Holes! I need holes!
34636,KRAMER,174, The pharmacy's still open.
34637,GEORGE,174," All right. Kramer, you block off traffic. You to go sweet-talk 
              the pharmacist."
34638,SLIPPERY PETE (to George),174, You owe me a quarter.
34639,GEORGE (to Jerry),174," Slippery Pete. Kramer, hurry up!"
34640,KRAMER,174, Ahh! I'm out! No tape left!
34641,JERRY,174," Well, come on George, I'll help you push it across."
34642,GEORGE,174," Wait a minute. This looks familiar. This reminds me of 
              something. I can do this."
34643,JERRY,174, By yourself?
34644,GEORGE,174," Jerry, I've been preparing for this moment my entire life."
34645,SHLOMO,174, He looks like a Frog.
34646,SLIPPERY PETE,174, So do you.
34647,JERRY,174, Game over.
34648,ELAINE,174," Mr. Peterman, you wanted to see me, sir?"
34649,PETERMAN,174," Elaine, up until a moment ago, I was convinced that I 
              was on the receiving end of one of the oldest baker's grift in the 
              books--The Entenmann's shim-sham."
34650,EALINE,174, Ohh...
34651,PETERMAN,174," Until I remembered the videotape surveillance system 
              that I installed to catch other-Walter using my latrine. But it 
              also caught this."
34652,EALINE,174," Mr. Peterman, I, uh..."
34653,PETERMAN,174," Elaine, I have a question for you. Is the item still...with 
              you?"
34654,ELAINE,174, Um...as far as I know.
34655,PETERMAN,174," Do you know what happens to a butter-based frosting after 
              six decades in a poorly ventilated English basement?"
34656,ELAINE,174," Uh, I guess I hadn't--"
34657,PETERMAN,174," Well, I have a feeling that what you are about to go 
              through is punishment enough. Dismissed."
34658,JERRY (to waitress),175, Cup of tea with lemon.
34659,GEORGE,175, What happened to your voice?
34660,JERRY,175," I was screamin' at hecklers all night. The last time I open 
              for a rodeo."
34661,GEORGE,175," Well, Jerry, I been thinkin'. I've gotten as far as I can 
              go with George Costanza."
34662,JERRY,175, Is this the suicide talk or the nickname talk?
34663,GEORGE,175," The nickname. George. What is that? It's nothing. It's 
              got no snap, no zip. I need a nickname that makes people light up."
34664,JERRY,175, You mean like...Liza!
34665,GEORGE,175, But I was thinking...T-bone.
34666,JERRY,175," But there's no ""t"" in your name. What about G-bone?"
34667,GEORGE,175, There's no G-bone.
34668,JERRY,175, There's a g-spot.
34669,GEORGE,175, That's a myth.
34670,JERRY,175," T-bone, the ladies are gonna love ya."
34671,ELAINE,175, Why did they hire you for a rodeo?
34672,JERRY,175, They heard I opened for Kenny Rogers once.
34673,ELAINE,175," Didn't he throw you off a bus in the middle of Alabama 
              or--"
34674,JERRY,175," Oh, I had that comin' to me. "
34675,ELAINE,175," You know, Kenny Rogers has a-"
34676,ELAINE (whispering),175, Why did you get a maid?
34677,JERRY,175, You don't have to whisper. She knows she's a maid.
34678,ELAINE,175, Where did you get her?
34679,JERRY,175, I hired her from a service!
34680,MAID,175, All done.
34681,JERRY,175, Thank you. Nice job.
34682,MAID,175, Is this mine?
34683,JERRY,175, Yeah.
34684,JERRY,175, What?
34685,ELAINE,175," Come on, Jerry. You didn't notice?"
34686,JERRY,175, Notice what? She's not really even a maid.
34687,ELAINE,175, Oh.
34688,JERRY,175," She wants to be an actress...or a, uh, model...or a dancer...or 
              a...news woman."
34689,ELAINE,175, Uh-huh. News woman. Yeah.
34690,KRAMER,175," Hey. Well, bad news, boys. My life is over. My girlfriend's 
              movin' away."
34691,JERRY,175, You have a girlfriend?
34692,KRAMER,175," Jerry, where have you been?"
34693,JERRY,175, At a rodeo. Where's she moving?
34694,KRAMER,175, Downtown.
34695,ELAINE,175, Downtown New York?
34696,KRAMER,175," Yeah. I don't know if I can handle one of these long-distance 
              relationships."
34697,JERRY,175, It's like 10 minutes by subway.
34698,KRAMER,175, I don't know.
34699,KRAMER,175," Oh! Jeez! Well, you've got a maid. It's a whole different 
              world downtown-- different Gap, different Tower Records, and she's 
              a 646."
34700,ELAINE,175, What? What is that?
34701,JERRY,175," That's the new area code. They've run out of 242s, so all 
              the new numbers are 646."
34702,ELAINE,175, I was a 718 when I first moved here. I cried every night.
34703,KRAMER,175," Listen. Heads up, Elaine. I'm gonna have to stop by later 
              and pick up a fax."
34704,ELAINE,175, At work?
34705,KRAMER,175, No. At your apartment.
34706,ELAINE,175, I don't have a fax machine.
34707,JERRY,175, Here we go. 
34708,KRAMER,175," Well, now what are we gonna do? (to Jerry) See? This is 
              why you should get a fax and a Xerox."
34709,JERRY,175, And a dead bolt.
34710,ELAINE,175, Then maybe you have a fax machine.
34711,KRAMER,175, You just blew my mind.
34712,KRUGER,175, Let's order lunch.
34713,KRUGER,175," Mary, I will have a chef's salad."
34714,MALE WORKER,175, Turkey sandwich.
34715,GEORGE,175, T-bone steak.
34716,KRUGER,175, For lunch?
34717,GEORGE,175," Well, I am just a T-bone kinda guy. Love that T-bone. In 
              fact, you might as well call me--"
34718,WATKINS,175," That sounds good. I'll have one, too."
34719,KRUGER,175," Watkins, you're havin' a T-bone?"
34720,WATKINS,175, I love 'em.
34721,KRUGER,175," Well, then we should call you T-bone."
34722,GEORGE,175," Uh, no. No, we shouldn't."
34723,KRUGER,175, T-bone!
34724,ALL (chanting),175," T-bone! T-bone! T-bone! T-bone! T-bone! T-bone! 
              T-bone! T-bone!"
34725,ELAINE,175, Hello?
34726,ELAINE,175, What?
34727,MACHINE,175, You have 57 messages. Message one...
34728,MACHINE,175, Message two...
34729,MACHINE,175, Message three...
34730,GEORGE,175," Hey, it's George. Listen, I-"
34731,MACHINE,175, Message four...
34732,EALINE,175, Hello?
34733,ELAINE,175, Aah!
34734,JERRY,175," Well Cindy, the place looks great."
34735,CINDY,175," Thanks Jerry, gotta run."
34736,JERRY,175," Ok, I'll see ya."
34737,CINDY,175," Hi, Elaine."
34738,ELAINE,175," All right! You're foolin' around with your maid. That is 
              a wise decision."
34739,JERRY,175," Elaine, do you think I would go willy-nilly into a situation 
              so obviously fraught with potential complications?"
34740,ELAINE,175," You are paying a woman to come to your house and sleep 
              with you."
34741,JERRY,175, No. I pay her to clean. The rest is--
34742,ELAINE,175, What? A health plan?
34743,JERRY,175," I was going to say, ""Being a good host."""
34744,ELAINE,175, Oh-ho-ho. Oh.
34745,JERRY,175," But the point is we have our personal relationship, and 
              we have our work relationship. They're separate and, I think, some 
              what sophisticated."
34746,ELAINE,175, So you consider this a relationship?
34747,JERRY,175," Yes, I do. "
34748,ELAINE,175, Oh. Have you been out?
34749,JERRY,175," Yes, we have."
34750,ELAINE,175, Where did you go?
34751,JERRY,175, The store.
34752,ELAINE,175, Mm! To get what?
34753,JERRY,175, Stuff.
34754,ELAINE,175, Cleaning supplies?
34755,JERRY,175, And gum.
34756,ELAINE,175," Oh. Well, there's nothin' more sophisticated than diddlin' 
              the maid and then chewin' some gum."
34757,JERRY,175, She's not a maid. She might be a news woman!
34758,KRAMER,175," Hey. Well, I just saw Madeline off. Yeah. She's in a cab 
              and--nguh nguh nguh--on her way. I miss her already."
34759,ELAINE,175," Hey, Kramer, what was it you were having faxed to my house 
              every 30 seconds?"
34760,KRAMER,175," Well, I signed up for a food delivery service, Now We're 
              Cookin'. That's a play on words. You know, they're faxing me the 
              menus from some restaurants."
34761,ELAINE,175, Which ones?
34762,KRAMER,175," Well, all of them. It's the deluxe package."
34763,ELAINE,175, So this is never gonna stop?
34764,KRAMER,175," Well, it better not. Paid for the whole year. So, should 
              I pick those up later?"
34765,ELAINE,175, You can pick 'em up right now.
34766,KRAMER,175, Ah!
34767,ELAINE (thinking),175," I wonder if anyone knows he's here. If he just 
              disappeared...would anybody notice?"
34768,PHONE MAN,175," All right, miss Benes, all finished. Here's your new 
              number."
34769,ELAINE,175, Ahem. 646? What is this?
34770,PHONE MAN,175, That's your new area code.
34771,ELAINE,175, I thought 646 was just for new numbers.
34772,PHONE MAN,175, This is a new number.
34773,ELAINE,175," No, no, no, no. It's not a new number. It's--it's--it's 
              just a changed number. See? It's not different. It's the same, just...changed."
34774,PHONE MAN,175," Look, I work for the phone company. I've had a lot of 
              experience with semantics, so don't try to lure me into some maze 
              of circular logic."
34775,ELAINE,175," You know, I could've killed you, and no one would've known."
34776,PHONE MAN,175," I could've killed you, and no one would've known."
34777,JERRY,175," Kramer, you're still on the phone?"
34778,KRAMER,175," Madeline and I are watching Quincy together. Jerry, you 
              know this comes on at the same time here as it does there?"
34779,JERRY,175, Really? It's Tuesday here. What day is it there?
34780,KRAMER (into phone),175," Jerry's teasing. Uh-oh! Commercial. Oh, you 
              going to the bathroom? Yeah. I'll go, too."
34781,JERRY,175, Madeline stays here.
34782,JERRY,175," Hey, T-bone!"
34783,GEORGE,175, No. No T-bone.
34784,JERRY,175, No T-bone?
34785,KRAMER (from bathroom),175," Hey, is that T-bone?!"
34786,JERRY,175, No! There's no T-bone!
34787,KRAMER,175," Well, why no T-bone?!"
34788,JERRY,175, Why no T-bone?
34789,GEORGE,175, 'Cause Neil Watkins from accounting is T-bone!
34790,KRAMER,175," Oh, yeah I'm back. Hey, you wanna play cards over the phone?"
34791,KRAMER,175," Oh, hey, uh, listen, Jerry, uh, laundry's pilin' up there. 
              You might want to tell your girlfriend. Mmm. Yeah."
34792,GEORGE,175, Your girlfriend is doin' your laundry?
34793,KRAMER (from hallway),175, He's sleeping with his maid!
34794,GEORGE,175, You're sleepin' with the maid?
34795,JERRY,175, Yes. 
34796,GEORGE,175, I've done that. Did you ever eat an ostrich burger?
34797,JERRY,175, No.
34798,MAN,175," You're probably one of those women who doesn't like to give 
              out her number."
34799,ELAINE,175," No, I'm not. Here you go."
34800,MAN,175, 646?
34801,ELAINE,175, It's a new area code.
34802,MAN,175, What area? New Jersey?
34803,ELAINE,175," No, no. It's right here in the city. It's the same as 212. 
              They just multiplied it by 3, and then they added one to the middle 
              number. It's the same."
34804,MAN,175, Do I have to dial a one first?
34805,MAN,175, I'm really kinda seein' somebody.
34806,ELAINE,175," Yeah? Well, so am I!"
34807,GEORGE,175," Excuse me. Can I talk to you for a second there, Watkins?"
34808,WATKINS,175, It's T-bone.
34809,GEORGE,175, The thing is...I'm supposed to be T-bone.
34810,WATKINS,175, Heh heh. You're not a T-bone. You're a perfect George.
34811,GEORGE,175," What? Now, you listen to me!"
34812,KRUGER,175," Hey, look at George. He's givin' it to T-bone. He's jumpin' 
              up and down like some kind of monkey. Hey, what was the name of 
              that monkey that could read sign language?"
34813,WATKINS,175," All right, you can have T-bone. Stop crying."
34814,GEORGE (sniffling),175," I'm not crying. And I shouldn't have said that 
              about your wife. Please accept my apologies. "
34815,GEORGE,175," Ok, everybody, uh...I have an announcement to make. From 
              now on, I will be known as-"
34816,KRUGER,175, Koko the monkey.
34817,GEORGE,175, What?
34818,ALL (chanting),175," Koko! Koko! Koko! Koko! Koko! Koko! Koko! Koko! 
              Koko! Koko!"
34819,MAN,175, Thank you both for being here.
34820,EALINE,175," Um, excuse me. I live in the building. Did something happen 
              to Mrs. Krantz?"
34821,MAN,175, She passed. 
34822,ELAINE,175," Oh, I'm so sorry."
34823,MAN,175, Thank you.
34824,ELAINE,175," A quick question-- did she by any chance have a 212 phone 
              number?"
34825,CINDY,175," I can't find my earring. Oh, here it is."
34826,KRAMER,175," Hey, listen, can I borrow your suitcases?"
34827,JERRY,175, Yeah. It's in your closet.
34828,KRAMER,175," No, no, no. I looked."
34829,JERRY,175, They're behind my skis and my tennis racket.
34830,KRAMER,175," Thanks, buddy."
34831,JERRY,175, Where you goin'?
34832,KRAMER,175," Huh? Well, I'm gettin' out of town. I'm gonna visit Madeline 
              for the weekend. You know, this place is lookin' kinda messy. What 
              happened to Cindy?"
34833,JERRY,175," Well, she's here. She just didn't get around to it."
34834,KRAMER,175, Oh.
34835,CINDY,175," Hi, Kramer."
34836,CINDY,175," Thanks, Jerry. Bye."
34837,KRAMER,175," Well, what's the matter?"
34838,JERRY,175, What did I just pay for?
34839,KRAMER,175, Uh-oh. You're a john.
34840,JERRY,175, Koko?
34841,GEORGE,175, Koko.
34842,JERRY,175," Well, it's probably the most intelligent ape there is."
34843,GEORGE,175," Yeah. So, how's Cindy the maid?"
34844,JERRY,175," Well, everything's goin' great except, basically, I'm payin' 
              for sex."
34845,GEORGE,175," Tell me about it. I went out with this girl last week. 
              First I had to pay for dinner, then--"
34846,JERRY,175," No, George. She's coming over and not cleaning. It's like 
              I'm seein' a prostitute."
34847,GEORGE,175, How much you pay this maid?
34848,JERRY,175, 40.
34849,GEORGE,175," 40? I'm payin' 60 to my maid. She doesn't do laundry and 
              I'm gettin' nothin'. All right. Once she pinched my ass, but I don't 
              know what that was."
34850,JERRY,175, I don't know what this is.
34851,KRAMER,175," Hey, hey, hey. Look at that."
34852,JERRY,175, Ooh.
34853,KRAMER,175," Jerry, you wouldn't believe what it's like down there. 
              Taxicab drivers are insane. You know, everybody is in a hurry."
34854,GEORGE,175," I can't eat with you leanin' over like this. Just look 
              straight forward."
34855,KRAMER,175," Well, now I can't see Jerry."
34856,JERRY,175, I look about the same.
34857,GEORGE,175, What?
34858,JERRY,175, I was talking to him.
34859,KRAMER,175, What?
34860,JERRY,175, Never mind.
34861,KRAMER,175, Come on. What'd he say?
34862,GEORGE,175, Never mind.
34863,KRAMER,175," Jerry, come on. What'd you say?"
34864,JERRY,175, What?
34865,KRAMER,175, Come on. Where'd you go?
34866,JERRY,175, Go back.
34867,KRAMER,175, Eh! Come on. What did you say?
34868,JERRY,175," I said, never mind."
34869,KRAMER,175," Yeah. I know that. Uh, uh."
34870,JERRY,175, I hate the counter.
34871,ELAINE,175, Hey.
34872,JERRY,175, Hey.
34873,ELAINE,175, I hate the counter.
34874,KRAMER,175, Who's that?
34875,ELAINE (to Jerry),175," Well, I got a 212 number from this little old 
              lady in my building-- Mrs. Krantz."
34876,JERRY,175," Oh, she didn't mind?"
34877,ELAINE,175, No. She died.
34878,JERRY,175," Hey, that's great."
34879,GEORGE,175, What happened to Mrs. Krantz?
34880,JERRY,175, Elaine got a new number because she died.
34881,KRAMER,175, Newman died?
34882,ELAINE,175, What did he say?
34883,JERRY,175, Some new kind of pie.
34884,GEORGE,175, I'll try a piece.
34885,KRAMER,175," All right, who's down there?"
34886,JERRY,175," Hey, there's a booth."
34887,KRAMER,175," Hey, Elaine."
34888,ELAINE,175," Oh, hi."
34889,KRAMER,175, Did you hear about Newman?
34890,ELAINE,175, What?
34891,GEORGE,175, Hey. 
34892,JERRY,175, So how's it goin' at work? They get tired of it?
34893,GEORGE,175," Oh, yeah."
34894,JERRY,175, Double zero?
34895,GEORGE,175," It's ""ooh"" As in ""ooh ooh ah ah."" "
34896,CINDY,175," Your nickname's Koko? One of the girls down at the maid 
              service is named Coco."
34897,GEORGE,175, Really? Coco?
34898,CINDY,175, Yeah. Coco. That girl's all right.
34899,GEORGE,175," You know, if I could get this Coco woman down to Kruger, 
              they wouldn't be able to call me Koko anymore because Kruger would 
              never allow 2 Kokos."
34900,JERRY,175, Sounds like he runs a real tight ship.
34901,GEORGE,175, Say good-bye to Koko.
34902,JERRY,175," Good-bye, Koko."
34903,KRAMER,175," Bye, Koko. Whew! Jerry, this relationship is killing me. 
              The distance, the longing, the distance, the-- you know, I didn't 
              realize it, but I'm a needy person."
34904,JERRY,175," Kramer, maybe this relationship isn't for you."
34905,KRAMER,175," Oh, yeah? So what am I supposed to do, be more like you? 
              All sealed up in here, emotionally unavailable, paying scrubwomen 
              for sexual favors! No! Jerry, I won't be like you! Never! I'll never 
              be like you! "
34906,CINDY,175, What was that?
34907,JERRY,175, I didn't hear anything.
34908,CINDY,175," All right, I'm takin' off. Aren't you forgetting something?"
34909,JERRY,175," Oh, right! Hey, it was great seeing you again. I love your 
              outfit."
34910,CINDY,175, No. My money.
34911,JERRY,175, For what?
34912,CINDY,175, For my maid services. You booked me for today.
34913,JERRY,175, But you didn't really do any work.
34914,CINDY,175, I made the bed.
34915,JERRY,175, But you took a nap in it.
34916,CINDY,175, So?
34917,JERRY,175, I thought that was kind of girlfriend bed making.
34918,CINDY,175, No. That was the maid.
34919,JERRY,175," Well, who took the nap?"
34920,CINDY,175, The girlfriend.
34921,JERRY,175, $40 seems kind of steep for a nap.
34922,CINDY,175," So, what are you saying? That I'm a bad maid or some kind 
              of a prostitute?"
34923,JERRY,175," Ho, ho...ho! Hold on. Let's keep this sophisticated."
34924,CINDY,175," You know, I don't think I want to be your girlfriend or 
              your maid."
34925,JERRY,175, So is this a breakup/quitting?
34926,CINDY,175, Yeah. Don't ever call me or hire me again.
34927,JERRY,175," Oh, yeah? Well, then, we're through! And you're fired!"
34928,PHONE MAN,175, Sign here.
34929,ELAINE,175, Yes! 212.
34930,ELAINE,175," Hey, what happened to the guy I had last time?"
34931,PHONE MAN,175," Oh, you know, it's an odd thing. He went out on a job 
              and never came back. Nobody knows what happened."
34932,ELAINE,175, All right! I am back in the game.
34933,ELAINE,175, Hello?
34934,BOY,175, Gammy!
34935,ELAINE,175," No. You got the wrong number, kid."
34936,BOY,175," Gammy Krantz, it's your grandson Bobby. Why haven't you called?"
34937,ELAINE,175, Oh...nuts. 
34938,BOY,175, Do you hate me 'cause of my lazy eye?
34939,ELAINE,175, No. It's just that I've been kind of buried over here.
34940,JERRY,175, So the kid doesn't know his grandmother is dead? G-5?
34941,ELAINE,175, Hit. No. I guess his parents didn't want to tell him. B-2?
34942,JERRY,175, Miss.
34943,ELAINE,175," He called 6 times yesterday. What a nightmare it must be 
              to have a real family."
34944,JERRY,175, I wouldn't worry about it. B-6?
34945,ELAINE,175, Hit. Uhh...you sank my submarine.
34946,JERRY,175, Elaine...
34947,INTERCUT,175,
34948,JERRY,175, Hello?
34949,COMPUTER VOICE,175, You have a collect call from--
34950,KRAMER,175," Hey, buddy, don't say no!"
34951,JERRY,175, I accept.
34952,KRAMER,175," I went down to Madeline's. I told her, ""You gotta 
              move, or it's over."""
34953,JERRY,175," Well, what happened?"
34954,KRAMER,175," I think it's over. We had a big fight, she threw me out, 
              I started walkin', and now I'm lost downtown! I don't have any money. 
              I don't recognize anybody. I miss home,"
34955,JERRY,175, What's around you?
34956,KRAMER,175, I'm lookin' at Ray's Pizza. You know where that is?
34957,JERRY,175, Is it Famous Ray's?
34958,KRAMER,175, No. It's Original Ray's.
34959,JERRY,175, Famous Original Ray's?
34960,KRAMER,175," It's just Original, Jerry!"
34961,JERRY,175," Well, what street are you on?"
34962,KRAMER,175," Hey, I'm on first and first. How can the same street intersect 
              with itself? I must be at the nexus of the universe."
34963,JERRY,175," Just wait there. I'll pick you up, and, Kramer, stay alive 
              no matter what occurs, I will find you!"
34964,KRAMER,175, Aah!
34965,MAN,175, You Steinfeld?
34966,JERRY,175, Yeah.
34967,MAN,175," My name is Maxwell. I'm from Maid To Order. It's a pun. I 
              sent one of my girls over to your place."
34968,JERRY,175, Cindy.
34969,MAN,175," She says she had a little problem with you. You didn't pay. 
            "
34970,JERRY,175," You know, she didn't really do what she was supposed to 
              do."
34971,MAN,175," Oh, yeah? She told me what you like. You're a little sickie, 
              aren't you? Disinfectant on the blinds, vacuuming the counter--"
34972,JERRY,175," Hey, come on. Come on. I gotta live around here."
34973,MAN,175, You know what I do to people who stiff me on a job?
34974,JERRY,175, What?
34975,MAN,175," Well, it kinda depends on the situation, but if I don't get 
              my money from you, I'm gonna get it from her. "
34976,JERRY,175," I don't want to make trouble. You want the money? Here. 
            "
34977,MAN,175," Hey! Wait, wait, wait! Whoa! Give it to the girl. I'm an independent 
              contractor. Tax purposes."
34978,ELAINE,175," Bobby, you gotta stop calling your Gammy. Why? Because 
              sometimes you call very early in the morning when Gammy has been 
              out late the night before and sometimes when Gammy's not alone. 
              Your parents still haven't said anything to you about your Gammy? 
              (sighs) All right, here we go. (coughing) Gammy doesn't feel so 
              good. I think"
34979,BOBBY,175, 9-1-1.
34980,JERRY,175," Nexus of the universe. Hey, Cindy. Cindy."
34981,CINDY,175, What do you want?
34982,JERRY,175, Here. I got your money.
34983,CINDY,175, I don't want any money from you.
34984,JERRY,175, Come on. Take it. It's money. Let me give it to ya.
34985,POLICE,175," Looking for a good time, sir? You wanna step out of the 
              car, sickie?"
34986,JERRY,175," Well, this is all very sophisticated."
34987,FIREMAN,175," All right, hang on, Gammy! You're gonna make it! "
34988,ELAINE,175, Aah!
34989,MAXWELL,175," Hey, you look a little lost. You from around here?"
34990,KRAMER,175," Uh, no."
34991,MAXWELL,175, You know where you're going?
34992,KRAMER,175," Not really. My friend was supposed to pick me up, but I 
              don't know where he is."
34993,MAXWELL,175, Doesn't sound like much of a friend. You got any money?
34994,KRAMER,175," Uh, no."
34995,MAXWELL,175, You wanna make some?
34996,KRAMER,175, Ok.
34997,MAXWELL,175, Do you know how to use a mop wringer?
34998,KRAMER,175," Yeah, yeah."
34999,MAXWELL,175, Why don't you get in the car?
35000,KRAMER,175, Hi. Ahh...these are soft seats.
35001,KRUGER,175," Hey, Koko, Who's this?"
35002,GEORGE,175," This is our new Vice-president of Acquisitions, sir."
35003,KRUGER,175," So you're just hiring new people now? That's your job, 
              to hire people?"
35004,GEORGE,175, Yes?
35005,KRUGER,175," Ok, good enough for me, Koko."
35006,KRUGER,175," Ahem. Now, what's your name?"
35007,COCO,175, My name is Coco. Coco Higgins.
35008,GEORGE,175, Coco?
35009,KRUGER,175," We can't have 2 Cocos. So I guess you're back to being 
              George."
35010,GEORGE,175," Well, it was a hell of a ride."
35011,KRUGER,175," All right, the Grace building. There's a big stain on the 
              front. How do we get it off?"
35012,COCO,175," When I was a little girl in Jamaica, my Gammy taught me to 
              take a wet rag and in a circ--"
35013,GEORGE,175," Ah, excuse me, Vice-president Coco, no one cares about 
              your Gammy."
35014,COCO,175, What did you say about my Gammy?
35015,GEORGE,175, Forget Gammy.
35016,KRUGER,175, Who's Gammy?
35017,GEORGE,175, There's no Gammy.
35018,KRUGER,175, Maybe there should be a Gammy.
35019,GEORGE,175," Oh, no."
35020,KRUGER,175, George.
35021,ALL (chanting),175," Gammy! Gammy! Gammy! Gammy! Gammy! Gammy! Gammy! 
            "
35022,GEORGE,175, Gammy's gettin' upset!
35023,GEORGE,176," Man, I'm starving."
35024,ELAINE,176, How can you be hungry after what you ate at that Mets game?
35025,GEORGE,176, Because ballpark food doesn't count as real food.
35026,JERRY,176," Right. It's just an activity. It's like that paddle with 
              the ball and the rubber band."
35027,KRAMER,176," You know, my friend Bob Saccamano made a fortune off of 
              those. See he came up with the idea for the rubber band. Before 
              that, people would just hit the ball, and it would fly away. "
35028,JERRY,176," I can't believe you all made me leave before the end of 
              the game."
35029,ELAINE,176," Oh, come on, Jerry. It was 9 to nothing. We were getting 
              shellacked."
35030,GEORGE,176, Those nachos are killing me.
35031,ELAINE,176, I thought you were hungry.
35032,GEORGE,176, It's complicated.
35033,KRAMER,176," Come on, Jerry, you're going to miss the exit."
35034,JERRY,176, Keep your shirt on. I got it.
35035,ELAINE,176, Watch out for that maroon Golf.
35036,KRAMER,176," Oh, boy."
35037,JERRY,176, Look at this guy. He's trying to box me out.
35038,KRAMER,176," I'll tell you when you can go. Wait, wait, wait, Wait-- 
              now, now, now. No, no, no. Go, go! No, no. Wait-- now, now! Now! 
              Jerry! Go--ahh..."
35039,JERRY,176," Oh, calm down, maroon Golf. He thinks I cut him off. He 
              accelerated."
35040,KRAMER,176," You want me to moon him? Ooh, let's moon him. Roll up your 
              window. Let's do a pressed ham under glass."
35041,ELAINE,176," Oh, no, I couldn't do that."
35042,KRAMER,176," Look at this, look at this. He's giving us the finger."
35043,ELAINE,176," Oh, all right."
35044,KRAMER,176, Yeah.
35045,GEORGE,176, So I saw that new movie about the Hindenburg.
35046,ELAINE,176," Oh, yeah. What's that called?"
35047,JERRY,176, How was it?
35048,GEORGE,176, I found it morose. Why dwell on these negative themes?
35049,JERRY,176," Yeah. They should make a movie about all the Hindenburg 
              flights that made it."
35050,GEORGE,176," Anyway, right in the middle, the ship blows up-- burning 
              debris, bodies falling-- and then just as this eerie silence settles 
              over the airfield, I yelled out, ""That's gotta hurt!"""
35051,JERRY,176, Heh.
35052,GEORGE,176, The place went nuts.
35053,JERRY,176," Imagine the laugh you could have gotten if you'd yelled 
              that out at the actual disaster."
35054,GEORGE,176, Yeah.
35055,KRAMER,176, Why are we slowing down?
35056,JERRY,176, What is that music?
35057,GEORGE,176, What's with all these flags?
35058,JERRY,176," Oh, no."
35059,ELAINE AND JERRY,176, It's the Puerto Rican Day parade!
35060,ELAINE,176," Ohh! Oh, the city shuts down Fifth avenue. They never let 
              anyone through."
35061,KRAMER,176, All right. I'm gonna check it out. Aiee. mucho trafico.
35062,STOCK FOOTAGE,176, Puerto Rican Day parade.
35063,KRAMER,176," Yeah...uhh...well, the streets are all blocked. I think 
              every Puerto Rican in the world is out here."
35064,PUERTO RICAN MAN,176," Well, it is our day."
35065,KRAMER,176, Whoo. Wrong car. Sorry.
35066,RADIO,176, And the Mets score two in the eighth inning.
35067,JERRY,176," See? If we had stayed, we could have seen those runs. "
35068,GEORGE,176," I could have had some ice cream. I think that might have 
              calmed down the nachos."
35069,ELAINE,176," I'm going to miss 60 Minutes. You know, I hate to miss 
              60 Minutes. It's part of my Sunday weekend wind-down."
35070,JERRY,176," I don't know how you can unwind with that clock ticking. 
              It makes me anxious."
35071,KRAMER,176," All right, gentlemen, I scouted it out. I think we can 
              get out over there."
35072,JERRY,176," But that's a one-way street coming this way. Besides, how 
              am I gonna get all the way over there?"
35073,GEORGE,176, Just inch over. You worm your way.
35074,ELAINE,176," Just do it, Jerry. Uhh. This exhaust. I'm gonna throw up."
35075,KRAMER,176," You know, you should make yourself throw up."
35076,ELAINE,176, Huh?
35077,KRAMER,176, You know you're going to.
35078,JERRY,176," All right, I'm worming."
35079,KRAMER,176," Hey, Jerry. You know who the grand marshal is of this thing? 
              None other than Miss Chita Rivera."
35080,JERRY,176, They're not letting me in.
35081,GEORGE,176, My hand is out.
35082,JERRY,176," Well, I think we're gonna need more than a hand. They have 
              to see a human face."
35083,ELAINE,176, You sure you want his face?
35084,KRAMER,176," No, no, no. It was Mara Conchita Alonso."
35085,GEORGE,176, This guy's giving me the stare-ahead.
35086,JERRY,176, The stare-ahead. I hate that. I use it all the time.
35087,GEORGE,176, Look at me! I am man! I am you!
35088,GEORGE,176," All right, he's letting you in. Thank you! Creep."
35089,KRAMER,176, Oh! I know who it is. Stacy Keach.
35090,JERRY,176, One more lane to go.
35091,GEORGE,176, All right! We're here!
35092,LAMAR,176," Oh, look who's here. My old buddy, black Saab."
35093,JERRY,176, Maroon Golf.
35094,LAMAR,176," Where you goin', black Saab? You seem to be a tad askew."
35095,JERRY,176, Could you move your car back a little?
35096,LAMAR,176, Oh. Sorry. I seem to have cut you off.
35097,ELAINE,176," All right, I think I know where this is going, and I am 
              going somewhere else."
35098,JERRY,176, You can't do that. You can't just leave the group.
35099,ELAINE,176," I've been trying to leave this group for 10 years. Vaya 
              con dios."
35100,KRAMER,176," Con dios? Well, that's rude."
35101,JERRY,176, Can you believe her?
35102,GEORGE,176, Yeah. I'll see you later.
35103,JERRY,176, Where are you going?
35104,GEORGE,176, The movies. Blimp is playing right there.
35105,JERRY,176," You're going to that again? Why? Just to do that stupid 
              line?"
35106,GEORGE,176," It's a performance, Jerry. Like what you do."
35107,JERRY,176, That's not what I do.
35108,GEORGE,176, Isn't it?
35109,JERRY,176," Maybe a little. Ah, hell, I guess it is."
35110,KRAMER,176," You know, actually, Jerry, you haven't worked a room that 
              big in a while."
35111,STOCK FOOTAGE,176, Taxis stuck in traffic.
35112,ELAINE,176," Look at that guy's dog. I hate it when their ears get flipped 
              inside out like that. Why doesn't he fix it? "
35113,ELAINE (yelling),176, Hey! Fold your dog's ear back!
35114,ELAINE,176, Ooh! This isn't moving! I could walk faster than this.
35115,CAB DRIVER,176," No, you can't."
35116,ELAINE,176," Yes, I can. Here. I'm outta here. "
35117,ELAINE,176," Oh, now it's moving. Oh, yeah. I knew it. Hey! Hey!"
35118,CAB DRIVER,176, Where to?
35119,ELAINE,176," That's cute. That's really cute. Oh! Come on! All right. 
              Bye again."
35120,ELAINE,176, Hey. Taxi! Taxi!
35121,GEORGE,176," Ladies. I, uh, I haven't seen this before."
35122,LADY 1,176, What is that dot?
35123,LADY 2,176," Oh, I think someone has one of those funny laser pointers."
35124,LASER GUY,176, Gimme a box of those and one of those.
35125,GEORGE,176," Excuse me, are you the guy with that funny laser?"
35126,LASER GUY,176, The laser's not funny. I'm funny.
35127,GEORGE,176," Yeah. The thing is, I, uh...I had this little zinger of 
              my own I wanted to try."
35128,LASER GUY,176, Uh-huh. 
35129,GEORGE,176," It's right in the explosion scene. So if you could just...leave 
              me a little window. You know, my, uh, my aunt had a thing removed 
              with a laser. All right, I don't want to interrupt your meal, so..."
35130,JERRY,176," I've gotta see this game. If it wasn't for this guy, we 
              could get out of here."
35131,LAMAR,176," This traffic's a killer, ain't it?"
35132,KRAMER,176," You want to get outta here? Here's what we do. We leave 
              the car here, we take the plates off, we scratch the serial number 
              off the engine block, and we walk away."
35133,JERRY,176, Walk away?
35134,KRAMER,176," You've got insurance. You tell them that the car was stolen, 
              and then you get another one free."
35135,JERRY,176, Isn't there a deductible?
35136,KRAMER,176," All right, what is your deductible?"
35137,JERRY,176, I don't know.
35138,KRAMER,176," Yes, because they've already deducted it."
35139,JERRY,176, From what?
35140,KRAMER,176," The car, which we're leaving. So the net is zero. See you 
              pocket the money, if there is any, and you get a new car."
35141,JERRY,176, We're not leaving the car!
35142,KRAMER,176," All right. If you refuse to grow up and scam your insurance 
              company, you'll have to work this out with maroon Golf."
35143,JERRY,176, Absolutely not. He sped up.
35144,RADIO,176," Swung on, line hard toward left center field. That's in 
              the gap, that's a base hit."
35145,JERRY,176, I'm ready to talk.
35146,LADY 1,176, Hey! There's that laser guy again. 
35147,LADY 2,176, He's funny. I never meet anyone funny.
35148,LADY 1,176," I know. A sense of humor is so much more important to me 
              than looks or hair."
35149,LADY 2,176," Mmm, yeah."
35150,GEORGE,176, That's gotta hurt!
35151,GEORGE,176, It's...gotta hurt! Hurt! Because...Aaarrrrrgh!
35152,GEORGE,176," Damn you, laser guy! You had to grab it all with your lowbrow 
              laser shtick! You're just a prop comic! Where's the craft?!"
35153,LADY 1,176, Look! It's on the bald guy.
35154,LADY 2,176, I am so glad we came to this showing.
35155,KRAMER,176," Ok, here's the deal. He wants you to acknowledge that you 
              cut him off with an ""I am sorry"" wave."
35156,JERRY,176, What's that?
35157,KRAMER,176," You raise the hand, lower the head-- ""I'm sorry, I'm 
              sorry. The buttons are really big on the car. I don't understand 
              it. I haven't read the manual. Ooh!"" You get my drift."
35158,JERRY,176, Ok!
35159,LAMAR,176, Hallelujah. Praise the lord. But I'll take it.
35160,KRAMER,176," Yes! All right, Lamar, back it up a little bit so we can 
              get out now."
35161,GEORGE,176," All right. At last, we're finally gettin' out of here."
35162,JERRY,176, What's that on your forehead?
35163,GEORGE,176, It's probably chocolate.
35164,JERRY,176," Hey, is that one of those laser pointers?"
35165,KRAMER,176," Hey, Jerry, crank up the Floyd. It's a George laserium!"
35166,GEORGE,176," All right, stop it! Stay away from my breasts! Chest!"
35167,JERRY,176," See ya around maroon Golf. And, by the way, that was an 
              ""I'm not sorry"" wave."
35168,LAMAR,176, What was that?
35169,JERRY,176," I'm glad I cut you off, because black Saab rules! So long, 
              jackass! "
35170,JERRY,176, Elaine?!
35171,ELAINE,176, Jerry?!
35172,LAMAR,176, Jackass? So I'm a jackass now?
35173,JERRY,176," So if everyone would just put their cars in reverse at the 
              same time, we can do this. All right, on the count of three. Can 
              everyone hear me? Hey, amigo, are you paying attention?"
35174,PUERTO RICAN MAN,176," Buenos dias, my friend."
35175,JERRY,176, Not you! The guy in the Amigo.
35176,ELAINE,176," Uh, well, uh, here--here is good."
35177,TAXI DRIVER,176," Oh, yeah, sure, and now I'm gonna be stuck here. But 
              you knew the way to go! You went to college!"
35178,ELAINE,176," Hey, I went to Tufts! That was my safety school! So don't 
              talk to me about hardship."
35179,ELAINE,176," Boy, eh, can you believe this mess?"
35180,JERRY,176," Elaine, why did you have the cab come down the street?! 
              We were almost out!"
35181,LAMAR,176," So that was your girlfriend that blocked you in. That's 
              real good."
35182,ELAINE,176," I'm not his girlfriend. Well, actually, we used to date, 
              but not anymore."
35183,JERRY,176," Elaine, he doesn't need-"
35184,LAMAR,176, Used to date? So I guess you found out he's a jackass.
35185,JERRY,176, 'Cause that's what's gonna happen.
35186,KRAMER,176, Wow. He's givin' you a mustache. Where is this guy?
35187,GEORGE,176, Don't look around. Don't look around. That's what he wants.
35188,ELAINE,176," All right. Well, I'll see ya. Hey, George, I think there's 
              a sniper lookin' to pop ya."
35189,GEORGE,176," This thing can't hurt me, can it? I mean, it is a laser. 
              What if it hits my eye?"
35190,JERRY,176, I don't know.
35191,GEORGE,176," I can't be blind, Jerry The blind are courageous."
35192,KRAMER,176," You'll be fine as long as it doesn't hit you right in the 
              pupil, 'Cause then the whole ball will go up like the Death Star. 
              Tchoo! I gotta go find a bathroom."
35193,JERRY,176," Hold it, George. Don't move. It's right between your eyes."
35194,GEORGE,176," Oh, my god. "
35195,JERRY,176," Hey, there's the soda guy."
35196,LAMAR,176," Hey, jackass! Get me a diet Dr. Pepper!"
35197,JERRY (exasperated),176, All right!
35198,OLDER MAN,176," Hey, hey, hey!"
35199,OLDER WOMAN,176, Wha--ow!
35200,ELAINE,176," Oh, this is nuts! I can't get across anywhere!"
35201,OLDER MAN,176," Well, none of us can! We're trapped!"
35202,OLDER WOMAN,176, Ow!
35203,ELAINE,176," Hey! Hey, everyone. This way. I think we can get out through 
              here."
35204,OLDER MAN,176," Oh, I don't know if that's such a good idea."
35205,ELAINE,176," Look! No one knows how long this parade is gonna last! 
              They are a very festive people. All I know is that it's Sunday night, 
              and I have got to unwind! Now who's with me?!"
35206,OLDER WOMAN,176, Father?
35207,PRIEST,176, None of us saw the nylon flap. That might mean something.
35208,PREGNANT WOMAN,176," Oh, all right, all right!"
35209,ELAINE,176, All right! Come on. Come on. Let's go. Let's go.
35210,BUSINESS MAN,176, But it's dark!
35211,ELAINE,176, Get in there!
35212,KRAMER,176," Yes, uh, I'm interested in the apartment."
35213,SALES WOMAN,176," Yes! Come in, come in."
35214,KRAMER,176, Ok.
35215,SALES WOMAN,176, I'm Christine Nyhart.
35216,KRAMER,176, Oh. Delicious to meet you.
35217,SALES WOMAN,176, Did the broker send you over?
35218,KRAMER,176," Uh, yes, most likely, yes. I'm, uh, H.E. Pennypacker. I'm 
              a wealthy industrialist and philanthropist and, uh, a bicyclist. 
              And, um, yes, I'm looking for a place where I can settle down with 
              my, uh, peculiar habits, and, uh, the women that I frequent with. 
              (sniffing wall) Mmm. Mombassa, hmm?"
35219,SALES WOMAN,176, The asking price is $1.5 million.
35220,KRAMER,176," Oh, I spend that much on after shave. Yes, I buy and sell 
              men like myself every day. Now, I assume that there's a waterfall 
              grotto?"
35221,SALES WOMAN,176, No.
35222,KRAMER,176, How about a bathroom?
35223,SALES WOMAN,176, It has 4.
35224,KRAMER,176," Yes, and where would the absolute nearest one be?"
35225,SALES WOMAN,176, Just down the hall.
35226,KRAMER,176," Oh, thank you."
35227,ELAINE,176," Oh, don't worry. We'll get you home to your husband real 
              soon."
35228,PREGNANT WOMAN,176, I'm not married.
35229,ELAINE,176," Well, I, for one, really respect that."
35230,PREGNANT WOMAN,176," Oh, thank you."
35231,ELAINE (whispering),176, Hey! Guess who's not married.
35232,OLDER MAN,176, Is the boyfriend still in the picture?
35233,ELAINE,176," Come on, father, you can make it."
35234,PRIEST,176," No, I can't. I've got a bad hip. Go on without me."
35235,ELAINE,176, No! I won't!
35236,PRIEST,176, Leave me! you must.
35237,ELAINE,176, All right. Take it easy.
35238,ELAINE,176," All right, we can move faster without father o'gimpy."
35239,PRIEST,176, I heard that!
35240,LAMAR,176," You know, I don't think I've ever seen a man driving a Saab 
              convertible. Still haven't."
35241,JERRY (sarcastically),176, Ho ho!
35242,JERRY,176," What seems to be the problem, officer?"
35243,GEORGE,176," They're for protection, Jerry. Can you tell where I'm lookin'?"
35244,JERRY,176, At me?
35245,GEORGE,176, No.
35246,JERRY,176, Oh. It's back.
35247,GEORGE,176," Bring it on, baby "
35248,JERRY,176, What if it gets in the side?
35249,GEORGE,176, The side?
35250,JERRY,176," Yeah. Wouldn't it just bounce back and forth between your 
              cornea and the mirror, faster and faster, getting more and more 
              intense, until finally-"
35251,GEORGE,176, All right!
35252,JERRY,176, Oh. It's in your eye now.
35253,KRAMER,176," Hola, Jerry! I'm into this Puerto Rican day! The sights! 
              The sounds! The hot, spicy flavor of it all! It's caliente, Jerry!"
35254,JERRY,176," Kramer, the Mets have got men on base!"
35255,KRAMER,176," Yeah, I know! I was watchin' the game."
35256,JERRY,176, You were watchin'? Where?
35257,JERRY,176," Oh, that was a strike! Did you see that?! "
35258,SALES WOMAN,176," Would you like to see the rest of the apartment, Mister, 
              um--"
35259,JERRY,176," Eh...Varnsen. Kel Varnsen. Actually, this room intrigues 
              me. Why is it called the TV room?"
35260,SALES WOMAN,176," Well, it's--"
35261,JERRY,176, Balk?! How was that a balk?! You have any snacks?
35262,SALES WOMAN,176," Mr. Varnsen, if you like the apartment, I should tell 
              you I've also had some interest from a wealthy industrialist."
35263,JERRY,176, Not Pennypacker!
35264,SALES WOMAN,176, You know him?
35265,JERRY,176," I wish I didn't. Brace yourself, madam, for an all-out bidding 
              war. But this time, advantage Varnsen!"
35266,GEORGE,176," Wait a second. I think I see where that laser guy is. No! 
              Don't look! Don't look. Oh, yeah, that's him. Ok. I'm gonna sneak 
              up on him. Now the hunted becomes the hunter."
35267,ELAINE,176, We should be able to get across right through here! 
35268,OLDER WOMAN,176, It's a dead end! 
35269,ELAINE,176," Oh, no! I thought--"
35270,BUSINESS MAN,176," You thought?! We're gonna die in the dark! I knew 
              it! I knew it! We're gonna die!"
35271,ELAINE,176, Get a hold of yourself!
35272,PREGNANT WOMAN,176," Oh, come on!"
35273,ELAINE,176, Sorry. Somebody...help us!
35274,MAN,176, !Mira! !Mira! Stacy Keach!
35275,ELAINE,176, We're down here! Help!
35276,MAN,176, There's people down there! Hold on!
35277,ELAINE,176, Let us out. There's an unmarried pregnant woman down here.
35278,PREGNANT WOMAN,176, Don't judge me!
35279,ELAINE,176, Help us up so we can cross the street?
35280,POLICE OFFICER,176," Nah, nah, You can't cross here. There's a parade."
35281,ELAINE,176, But we've come so far. We just want to unwind.
35282,POLICE OFFICER,176," Hey, what can I tell ya?"
35283,BUSINESS MAN,176, Wanna make out some more?
35284,ELAINE,176," Oh, god! Let us out!"
35285,GEORGE,176, That wasn't a laser pen.
35286,DELIVERY MAN,176, No. It's just a pen.
35287,GEORGE,176," Oh, that's funny "
35288,DELIVERY MAN,176," No. You have, like, a dot on your face. Whoever's 
              doing that is very clever."
35289,KRAMER,176," Come on, man. You need to lighten up. You know, a feeling 
              like this only happens once a year. "
35290,KRAMER,176," Yeah, it's like this every day in Puerto Rico."
35291,KRAMER,176," See, now you're getting the spirit of it, huh?"
35292,KRAMER,176, Ooh! !Dios mio!
35293,MAN,176, Hey! There's a guy burning the Puerto Rican flag!
35294,BOB,176, Who! Who is burning the flag?!
35295,KRAMER,176," Oh, no."
35296,BOB,176, Him?!
35297,CEDRIC,176, That's not very nice.
35298,KRAMER,176, It was an accident.
35299,BOB,176," Do you know what day this is? Because I know what day this 
              is, they know what day this is, so I was wondering if you know what 
              day this is!"
35300,CEDRIC,176, Because it's Puerto Rican day.
35301,BOB,176," Maybe we should stomp you like you stomp the flag! What do 
              you think of that?"
35302,KRAMER,176," Now look, I just have one thing to say to you boys. Mama!"
35303,SALES WOMAN,176," Right this way, Mr. Vandelay."
35304,GEORGE,176," Well, this is a lovely apartment. Lovely! My kids are gonna 
              go crazy. I, uh, I wonder if I could see the bathrooms. Preferably 
              one with some paint thinner and, uh, some rags?"
35305,SALES WOMAN,176, It's down the hall.
35306,JERRY,176," Oh, hello..."
35307,GEORGE,176, Art.
35308,JERRY,176," Mr. Vandelay, of course."
35309,SALES WOMAN,176, You two know each other?
35310,SALES WOMAN,176, Mr. Pennypacker!
35311,KRAMER,176," Uh, yes, uh, I--I wanted to, uh, stop by and make sure 
              that my shark tank fits-- uh, hello."
35312,SALES WOMAN,176," Mr. Pennypacker, this is Mr. Vandelay, And you know 
              Mr. Varnsen "
35313,KRAMER,176," Uh, Varnsen."
35314,JERRY,176, Pennypacker.
35315,KRAMER,176, Vandelay.
35316,GEORGE,176, Pennypacker. Varnsen.
35317,JERRY,176," Vandelay. Wait a second. Mr. Pennypacker, if you're here, 
              and Mr. Vandelay is also here, then who's watching the factory?"
35318,KRAMER,176, The factory?
35319,JERRY,176, The Saab factory?
35320,KRAMER,176," Jerry, that's in Sweden."
35321,JERRY,176, My car!
35322,KRAMER,176," Well, you know, it's like this every day in Puerto Rico."
35323,GEORGE,176," Jerry, the Mets lost."
35324,JERRY,176, I love a parade!
35325,GEORGE,176, How do you suppose they did that?
35326,KRAMER,176," Well...there's no logical explanation. All right. Well, 
              shall we go home?"
35327,JERRY,176," Well, what about my car?"
35328,KRAMER,176," Well, Jerry, you can't deduct it now."
35329,JERRY,176," Hey, there's Elaine."
35330,ELAINE,176, Hey.
35331,JERRY,176," Well, you look, uh...relaxed."
35332,ELAINE,176," Well, it is Sunday night, and you know how I like to unwind."
35333,LAMAR,176," Hey, black Saab. Looks like that building cut you off! Ha 
              ha ha! See ya around!"
35334,JERRY,176," Well, at least he didn't-"
35335,LAMAR,176, Jackass!
35336,JERRY,176, Somebody remember where we parked.
35337,KRAMER,176, This was a fun day. It's nice to get out.

35344,Jerry,179," It seems like whenever these office people call you in for a meeting, 
        the whole thing is about the sitting down. I would really like to sit 
        down with you. I think we need to sit down and talk. Why don't you come 
        in, and we'll sit down. Well, sometimes the sitting down doesn't work. 
        People get mad at the sitting.You know, we've been sitting here for I 
        don't know how long. How much longer are we just going to sit here? I'll 
        tell you what I think we should do. I think we should all sleep on it. 
        Maybe we're not getting down low enough. Maybe if we all lie down, then 
        our brains will work."
35345,George,179," I can't eat this without catsup. Would it kill her to check up on us? Would
        that be a terrible thing? ""How's everything? Do you need anything? What can I do for
        you?"""
35346,Jerry,179, I know what you mean.
35347,George,179, Do ya?
35348,Jerry,179, It's like going out with someone and you never hear from them again.
35349,George,179, Same thing!
35350,Jerry,179," Not really, but it's something. Ask the people behind you."
35351,George,179, Excuse me. Are you using your catsup?
35352,Woman,179, What do you think? You want to give him the catsup?
35353,Man,179, It's up to you.
35354,Woman,179, You know what? I don't think so. I'm going to need it from time to time.
35355,Jerry,179, So what are you doing later? You want to go to the movies?
35356,George,179, Nah - what for?
35357,Jerry,179, To see a movie.
35358,George,179, I've been to the movies.
35359,Jerry,179, Not this movie.
35360,George,179," They're all the same. You go, you sit, you eat popcorn, you watch. I'm sick of
        it."
35361,Jerry,179, Did you shower today?
35362,George,179, Yeah.
35363,Jerry,179, That's usually the kind of mood I'm in when I haven't showered.
35364,George,179," When is it going to be my turn, Jerry? When do I get my 15 minutes? I want my
        15 minutes!"
35365,Jerry,179," Oh, quit complaining. At least you have your health."
35366,George,179," Ah! Health's not good enough. I want more than health. Health's not doing it
        for me anymore. I'm sick"
35367,Woman,179," All right, we're done. You can have it now."
35368,George,179," Oh, very gracious."
35369,Man,179, Nice day
35370,George,179, Yeah.
35371,Jerry,179, What is that?
35372,Kramer,179, Hey! JoJo!
35373,Jerry,179," Ey, ey!"
35374,Elaine,179," All right, thanks for the ride, Kramer."
35375,Kramer,179," No, thank you. So what are you doing?"
35376,Jerry,179, Nothing.
35377,Kramer,179," Come on, let's go to the beach."
35378,George,179, What are you crazy?
35379,Kramer,179, What? It's a beautiful day.
35380,Jerry,179, Have a good time.
35381,Kramer,179," Yeah, there's something in the air today. You feel it? There's something in the
        air."
35382,Jerry,179, You know you're turning into Burt Lancaster?
35383,Kramer,179," Yeah, there's something in the air."
35384,Elaine,179," Oh, I forgot to call Jill. Jill. Hi, it's Elaine. How is your father? Is
        everything okay? What? I can't hear you so good. There's a lot of static. Wha? I'm going
        to call you back."
35385,Jerry,179, Jill's father is in the hospital and you call to ask about him on a cell phone?
35386,Elaine,179, What? No good?
35387,Jerry,179, Faux pas.
35388,Elaine,179, Faux pas?
35389,George,179, Big hefty stinking faux pas.
35390,Elaine,179, Why?
35391,Jerry,179," You can't make a health inquiry on a cell phone. It's like saying ""I don't
        want to take up any of my "
35392,George,179, On-the-street cell-phone call is the lowest phone call you can make.
35393,Jerry,179, It's an act of total disregard. It's selfish.
35394,George,179, It's dismissive.
35395,Jerry,179, It's pompous.
35396,George,179, Why don't you think before you do something?
35397,Elaine,179, Here's a thought - Bye bye.
35398,George,179, Too much?
35399,George,179," Boy - I'm really surprised at Elaine - that whole phone business - she should
        know better than that."
35400,Jerry,179, Hey - hey - hey!
35401,George,179, What?
35402,Jerry,179," Where do you think this relationship is? If you are thinking of instituting an
        open-door urination policy, let me disabuse you of that notion right now, my friend."
35403,George,179, You're so uptight.
35404,Jerry,179," Uptight? Let's all just have a big pee party. Hey everybody, grab a bucket.
        We're going up to Jerry's. It's a pee party."
35405,Phone Tape,179," Jerry, this is Elizabeth Clark calling from James Kimbrough's office at
        NBC. Could you please give us a call?Thanks."
35406,Jerry,179," Hello. Yeah, hi, this is Jerry Seinfeld calling for James Kimbrough. Hello? Hi?
        Uh huh, really, uh, no problem,"
35407,George,179, Who's he?
35408,Jerry,179," He is the new president of NBC. He wants to sit down with us and talk about
        ""Jerry."""
35409,George,179," Our show, ""Jerry""?"
35410,Jerry,179, Right.
35411,George,179," ""Jerry"", oh my God. He wants to talk about ""Jerry""?"
35412,Jerry,179, Yeah!
35413,George,179, When? 
35414,Jerry,179," Today, like right now."
35415,George,179," Right now? ""Jerry""?"
35416,Jerry,179," ""Jerry""!"
35417,George,179," He wants to talk about ""Jerry""?"
35418,Jerry,179," He wants to talk about ""Jerry""!"
35419,George,179," ""Jerry""!"
35420,Jerry,179," ""Jerry""!"
35421,George,179, Can I go like this?
35422,Jerry,179, Sure!
35423,George,179, No sports jacket? I don't need a sports jacket? Writers wear sports jackets.
35424,Jerry,179, Forget the sports jacket.
35425,George,179, I won't feel like a writer.
35426,Jerry,179, You're not a writer.
35427,George,179, Right!
35428,George,179, Water. Need some water! Water here!
35429,Jerry,179," Ok, now listen, I don't want any scenes in here like the last time."
35430,George,179," Don't worry, don't worry, no scenes."
35431,Jerry,179, Don't blow this.
35432,George,179, I will not blow this.
35433,Jerry,179," If he says he doesn't want it to be a show about nothing, don't go nuts."
35434,George,179," It's fine, it doesn't have to be about nothing."
35435,Jerry,179, He might not want nothing.
35436,George,179," Something, nothing, I could care less."
35437,Jerry,179, He might want a show about anything and everything.
35438,George,179," Anything, everything, something, nothing - Who the hell cares? Put me down. I'm
        down!"
35439,Jerry,179, All right.
35440,Receptionist,179, Mr. Kimbrough is ready to see you 
35441,George,179, Magic time.
35442,Jerry,179, What?
35443,Receptionist,179, Mr. Kimbrough.
35444,Stu,179," Hey, Jerry, good to see you."
35445,George,179," Hey, hey, hey!"
35446,Stu,179, How you been?
35447,Jerry,179," Good, good. You remember George."
35448,Stu,179," George, good to see you."
35449,George,179, Hello Stu.
35450,Stu,179, You remember Jay Crespi.
35451,George,179," Jay Crespi, how am I gonna forget Jay Crespi?"
35452,Stu,179, This is James Kimbrough.
35453,Kimbrough,179," Nice to meet you, pleasure, thanks for coming in."
35454,George,179, Kimbrough.
35455,Jerry,179, Don't spell.
35456,George,179, K-I-M-B-R-O-U-G-H
35457,Kimbrough,179, That's right.
35458,George,179, It's a talent I have.
35459,Kimbrough,179," Why don't we sit down, glad you're here."
35460,George,179," Woo! Some day out there - You ever see weather like that? Woo! It's crisp -
        it's crispy crisp."
35461,Jerry,179," Shut up, George."
35462,Kimbrough,179, Can I get you anything?
35463,George,179, What do we have in the fruit department?
35464,Jerry,179, Oy.
35465,Stu ,179, Pineapple.
35466,George,179," Oh, that's a dangerous fruit. It's like a weapon that thing, got spikes on the
        end. You can get killed from "
35467,Kimbrough,179," Anyway, let me tell you why I called. When I took over here last month, I
        reviewed what was in development,and it was pretty much same old, same old."
35468,George,179," Been there, done that."
35469,Kimbrough,179," Right. I was looking for something different. Something that would have
        people talking at the water coolers."
35470,George,179, Water coolers?
35471,Crespi,179, We call it a water-cooler show.
35472,Jerry,179," Because the next day in the offices, people gather around the water coolers to
        talk about it, right?"
35473,George,179," See, I think people would talk about it at the coffee machines."
35474,Jerry,179," Well it's probably just easier to say ""water cooler show"" than
        ""coffee machine show."""
35475,George,179," It's really not accurate. Nobody drinks from a water cooler any more - they use
        bottles."
35476,Jerry,179, But I think Mr. Kimbrough makes a good point.
35477,Kimbrough,179," Anyway, Stu here started telling me about a show, ""Jerry"", that he
        developed five years ago."
35478,Stu,179, I have always loved it.
35479,Kimbrough,179," He said it was a show about nothing. So, I saw the pilot and I've got to
        tell you - I flipped out."
35480,Crespi,179, He totally flipped out.
35481,Kimbrough,179," What I want to do is put it on the air. 13-episode commitment. Start it off
        on Wednesday night, build up an"
35482,Jerry,179, He's a little off the wall.
35483,Crespi,179, Oh yeah.
35484,Stu,179, Kramer.
35485,Kimbrough,179, And Elaine - I wouldn't mind seeing something happening between you two.
35486,Jerry,179, Definitely.
35487,George,179," I tell you, I really don't think so-called relationship humor is what this show
        is all about."
35488,Kimbrough,179," Or we could not do the show altogether, how about that?"
35489,George,179, Or we could get them together. Woo!
35490,George,179, Yeah!
35491,Jerry,179, Yeah!
35492,Elaine,179," Jill, hi, it's Elaine. Well, I'm calling from my home. Indoors. Well, I was
        just calling to see how your fa.. "
35493,Jerry,179," Hi. Elaine, it's me."
35494,Elaine,179," Jerry, I'm on the other line."
35495,Jerry,179, No no - this is an emergency - get off the phone.
35496,Elaine,179," I'm sorry, Jill. I'm going to have to take this call. Jerry, what's the
        emergency?"
35497,Jerry,179," The ""Jerry""'s back on - the TV show! George and I are moving to

        California!"
35498,Elaine,179, That's the emergency?
35499,Jerry,179, Did you hear what I said?
35500,Elaine,179, I was on the other line talking to Jill.
35501,Jerry,179," Jill? Well, why didn't you say so?"
35502,Elaine,179, You said it was an emergency.
35503,Jerry,179," So now she's lost a phone face-off? That's even worse than your cell phone
        walk-and-talk."
35504,Helen,179," Congratulations, they're doing the show."
35505,Morty,179," They should have put that show on 5 years ago. Bunch of idiots at that network.
        Can I tell you something, Jerry? It's all crap on TV. The only thing I watch is Xena the
        Warrior Princess. She must be about six-six."
35506,Helen,179, She's not six-six.
35507,Morty,179," Jerry, you ever watch that?"
35508,Jerry,179," Yeah, it's pretty good."
35509,Estelle,179, They picked up the show?
35510,George,179, I'm moving to California.
35511,Frank,179," Oh baby-doll, this kid's going places, I told you."
35512,Estelle,179, The NBC guy liked it?
35513,George,179, Of course he liked it.
35514,Estelle,179, He told you he liked it?
35515,George,179, He wouldn't put it on if he didn't like it.
35516,Estelle,179," Well, what are you doing?"
35517,George,179, I'm writing.
35518,Estelle,179, You know how to write?
35519,Frank,179," Without the writing, you have nothing. You're the ones that make them look good."
35520,Estelle,179, Since when do you know how to write? I never saw you write anything.
35521,George,179, Ma?!
35522,Estelle,179," I don't know how you're going to write all those shows. And where are you get
        all the ideas?"
35523,Frank,179, Would you leave him alone? You'll shatter his confidence!
35524,George,179, I don't need any ideas. It's a show about nothing.
35525,Estelle,179," Nothing. Please. I'll tell you the truth - the whole thing sounds pretty
        stupid to me."
35526,Jerry,179," NBC is letting me use their private jet? And I can go anywhere I want? That's
        fantastic! Thanks. Great. "
35527,Kramer,179, Oh hey!
35528,Jerry,179, Hey - how was the beach?
35529,Kramer,179," Oh, you missed it, buddy - lot of femininas - some major femininas"
35530,Jerry,179, I had a little meeting today at NBC. What are you doing?
35531,Kramer,179," You know, I went swimming and I can't get this water out of my ear."
35532,Jerry,179," So do you remember five years ago, we did that pilot, ""Jerry""? Well,
        the new guy at NBC wants to do it. "
35533,Kramer,179, You're moving to California?
35534,Jerry,179," Yeah, only for a while."
35535,Kramer,179," Yeah, but Jerry, what happens if the show's a hit? You could be out there for
        years! You might never come"
35536,Jerry,179," No, I'll be back."
35537,Kramer,179," Jerry. It's L.A. Nobody leaves. She's a seductress, she's a siren, she's a
        virgin, she's a whore."
35538,Jerry,179," And my agent said as a bonus, I can use their private jet, so we'll all go
        somewhere - the four of us, one big fling before George and I go to California."
35539,Kramer,179, Fling!
35540,Elaine,179, So we can go anywhere we want?
35541,Jerry,179, Anywhere.
35542,Elaine,179, Why are they doing this?
35543,Jerry,179," I think they want to make it up to us cause they let this thing sit on their
        shelf for five years."
35544,Elaine,179, This is all very exciting.
35545,George,179, So? Where are we going?
35546,Kramer,179, I say Japan.
35547,Elaine,179, Why Japan?
35548,Kramer,179," Oh - geishas - they cater to your every whim. They're shy at first, but they're
        quite skilled at conversation. They can discuss anything from world affairs to the fine
        art of fishing - or baking."
35549,Elaine,179, Oh - I got it - how about Russia?
35550,Jerry,179," Russia, it's so bleak."
35551,Elaine,179, It's not bleak - it's springtime.
35552,Jerry,179, It's still bleak.
35553,Elaine,179, You can't be bleak in spring.
35554,Jerry,179, You can be bleak in spring.
35555,George,179," If you're bleak, you're bleak."
35556,Elaine,179, What about Switzerland?
35557,Kramer,179," Oh - Switzerland - the Von Trapp family, huh?"
35558,George,179, It's a bit hilly - no?
35559,Elaine,179, You're not going to do any walking.
35560,George,179, What if I want to walk around a little?
35561,Elaine,179, So then you'll walk down the hill and we'll pick you up.
35562,George,179, What if I'm at the bottom?
35563,Elaine,179," All right! You know what, just forget it!"
35564,Jerry,179," Alright - come on - come on now, people. Let's face it, we're not all going to
        agree on anything. "
35565,Elaine,179, I'll go to Paris.
35566,George,179, Me too.
35567,Kramer,179, Oh yeah - oui oui.
35568,Jerry,179," So that's it - it's settled, we're going to Paris."
35569,Group,179, Yeah!
35570,Elaine,179," Hey. NBC limo is downstairs - beep beep beep. {NBC tune} I'm just going to call
        Jill one more time before we go."
35571,Jerry,179," Wait, you can't make a call like that on your way out. You can't rush that
        conversation."
35572,Elaine,179," Well, I can't call from the limo. Can I call from the plane?"
35573,Jerry,179," First you make a cell-phone walk-and-talk, then she loses a call-waiting
        face-off, now you're talking about"
35574,Elaine,179," All right, I'll just have to call her from Paris."
35575,Newman,179," Hello, Jerry."
35576,Jerry,179," Hello, Newman. What gives?"
35577,Newman,179," I was speaking earlier with Kramer and he mentioned something about a private
        jet to Paris?"
35578,Jerry,179," Yeah, that's right."
35579,Newman,179," Well, I hear it's quite beautiful there this time of year, and of course you
        know I'm one-quarter French."
35580,Jerry,179, Really.
35581,Newman,179," Oh yes, in fact I still have family there. This probably won't interest you,
        but I have a cousin there who's suffering very badly. She's lost all use of her muscles.
        She can only communicate by blinking. I would so love to see her - bring a ray of sunshine
        into her tragic life. But alas, I can't afford it, for I am, as you know, but a simple
        postal worker."
35582,Jerry,179, That's a shame.
35583,Newman,179, Take me! Take me!
35584,Jerry,179," Oh, forget it. Pull yourself together. You're making me sick. Be a man!"
35585,Newman,179," All right! But hear me and hear me well - The day will come. Oh yes, mark my
        words, Seinfeld - your day of "
35586,Captain,179," Ah, Jerry?"
35587,Jerry,179, Yeah.
35588,Captain,179," I'm Captain Maddox this is my co-pilot, Kurt Adams. Ready to go to Paris?"
35589,Jerry,179, All set. We'll just grab the bags.
35590,Captain,179, Don't worry about that. We'll take care of them for you.
35591,Jerry,179, Just keeps on getting better and better.
35592,Jerry,179, Not bad.
35593,Elaine,179, Wow!
35594,Kramer,179, The only way to fly.
35595,George,179, This is it?
35596,George,179," I'm sorry - I have to say, I'm a little disappointed, I thought it would be a
        lot nicer."
35597,Jerry,179, You're complaining about a private jet?
35598,George,179, You think this is the plane that Ted Danson gets?
35599,Jerry,179, Ted Danson is not even on the network anymore.
35600,George,179," Still, I bet when they gave him a plane, it was a lot nicer than this one."
35601,Elaine,179, Will you shut up? You are ruining the whole trip.
35602,George,179," This is a real piece of junk. I don't even feel safe on this thing. I have a
        good mind to write a letter toMr. Kimbrough."
35603,Jerry,179, You're not writing any letters!
35604,Elaine,179, Will you turn around?
35605,George,179, Why?
35606,Elaine,179, You are annoying me sitting like that. It's effeminate.
35607,George,179, It's effeminate to sit like this? 
35608,Elaine,179," Yes, I think it's a little effeminate."
35609,George,179, How is this effeminate?
35610,Elaine,179, I don't know - it just is.
35611,George,179," Kramer, what are you doing?"
35612,Jerry,179, Still got water in your ear?
35613,Kramer,179, Can't get rid of it. Maybe it leaked inside my brain.
35614,George,179, Would you stop that? It's not safe to be jumping up and down on a plane.
35615,Kramer,179," I got to get it out, I can't take this anymore."
35616,George,179," Kramer, don't be fooling around up here."
35617,George,179, Kramer!
35618,Captain,179," Hey, get the hell out of here!"
35619,Elaine,179, What is that?
35620,George,179, Oh my God!
35621,Elaine,179, What is that noise? What is that noise?
35622,Jerry,179," Kramer, what the hell did you do?"
35623,Kramer,179, I lost my balance.
35624,Elaine,179, Oh my God!
35625,Elaine,179, What's going on?
35626,Jerry,179, Kramer!
35627,Kramer,179, It was an accident.
35628,George,179, I told you to stop with the hopping.
35629,Elaine,179," Oh my God, we're going down. We're going to die!"
35630,George,179, Just when I was doing great. I told you God wouldn't let me be successful.
35631,Jerry,179, Is this it? Is this how it ends? It can't- it can't end like this.
35632,Kramer,179, I'm ready! I'm ready! Glory hallelujah!
35633,George,179, Jerry? Jerry can you hear me?
35634,Jerry,179, Yeah.
35635,George,179, There's something I have to tell you.
35636,Jerry,179, What? What is it?
35637,George,179, I cheated in the contest.
35638,Elaine,179, What?
35639,Jerry,179, What?
35640,George,179, The contest - I cheated.
35641,Jerry,179, Why?
35642,George,179, Because I'm a cheater! I had to tell you.
35643,Jerry,179, Great - I won.
35644,Elaine,179," Jerry, I gotta tell you something too."
35645,Jerry,179," Yeah, Elaine I got something I want to say to you."
35646,Elaine,179, No no - me first.
35647,Jerry,179, Alright.
35648,Elaine,179," Jerry, I've always loved ..u.."
35649,George,179, Hey - What's going on?
35650,Kramer,179, We're straightening out!
35651,Elaine,179, We're straightening out?
35652,Jerry,179, We're straightening out!
35653,George,179, We're straightening out!
35654,Group,179, Yeah!
35655,Captain,179," Well, again, sorry about that little mishap. But once you get everything
        checked out there shouldn't be anymore problems."
35656,Jerry,179, Where are we?
35657,Captain,179," Latham, Massachusetts. Why don't you take a cab into town, get yourself
        something to eat. I got your beeper number - I'll beep you as soon as we're ready."
35658,Jerry,179, Okay.
35659,Elaine,179, Okay.
35660,Jerry,179, We'll see you later.
35661,Elaine,179," Well, what are we going to do about Paris? I mean are we actually going to get
        back on this plane?"
35662,Jerry,179," I say we go back to New York, and take a regular flight."
35663,George,179," I'm not getting on a regular plane now - I'm all psyched up to go on a private
        jet. No way I'm getting on a regular plane."
35664,Elaine,179," Well, I'm sure that they would fly us first class."
35665,George,179," First class doesn't make it anymore. Now you get on the phone with Kimbrough,
        tell him what happened and tell him to get another plane down here, but this time, the
        good one - the Ted Danson plane."
35666,Jerry,179," Alright, I'll feel him out."
35667,George,179," Yeah, just tell him to hurry it up."
35668,Stranger,179, Nice day.
35669,Jerry,179, Another one?
35670,Robber,179," Alright fatso, out of the car."
35671,Kramer,179, I want to capture this.
35672,Robber,179, Come on! Gimme your wallet.
35673,Victim,179, Don't shoot.
35674,Jerry,179," Well, there goes the money for the lipo."
35675,Elaine,179," See, the great thing about robbing a fat guy is it's an easy getaway. You know?
        They can't really chase ya!"
35676,George,179, He's actually doing him a favor. It's less money for him to buy food.
35677,Robber,179," I want your wallet. Come on. Come on, come on."
35678,Jerry,179," That's a shame. Alright, I'm gonna call NBC."
35679,Victim,179," Officer, he's stealing my car! Officer, I was carjacked. I was held up at
        gunpoint! He took my wallet, everything!"
35680,Jerry,179," Okay, thanks anyway. They can't get another plane."
35681,Kramer,179," All right, what's wrong with the plane we got? They're just checking it out."
35682,Elaine,179, Forget it.
35683,Jerry,179," No, no, no. We're not getting on there. Come on, let's go get something to eat
        in Sticksville."
35684,Officer,179," All right, hold it right there."
35685,Kramer,179, What?
35686,Officer,179, You're under arrest.
35687,Jerry,179, Under arrest? What for?
35688,Officer,179, Article 223-7 of the Latham County Penal Code.
35689,Elaine,179," What? No, no - we didn't do anything."
35690,Officer,179, It's new. It's called the Good Samaritan Law. Let's go.
35691,Elaine,179, The Good Samaritan Law? Are they crazy?
35692,George,179, Why would we want to help somebody?
35693,Elaine,179, I know.
35694,George,179, That's what nuns and Red Cross workers are for.
35695,Kramer,179, The Samaritans were an ancient tribe - very helpful to people.
35696,Elaine,179," Alright - um, excuse me, hi, could you tell me what kind of law this is."
35697,Deputy,179," Well, they just passed it last year. It's modeled after the French law. I heard
        about it after Princess Diana was killed and all those photographers were just standing
        around."
35698,Jerry,179," Oh, yeah."
35699,Elaine,179," Oh, yeah."
35700,Deputy,179," You're the first ones to be arrested on it, probably in the whole country."
35701,George,179," All right, so what's the penalty here? Let's just pay the fine or something and
        get the hell out of here."
35702,Deputy,179," Well, it's not that easy. Now see, the law calls for a maximum fine of $85,000
        and as much as five years in prison."
35703,Elaine,179, What?
35704,George,179," Oh no no no no - we have to be in California next week. We're starting a TV
        show."
35705,Deputy,179," California? Oh gosh, I don't think so. Yeah, my guess is you're gonna be
        prosecuted. Better get yourselves a good lawyer."
35706,Chiles,179," Who told you to put the cheese on? Did I tell you to put the cheese on? I
        didn't tell you to put the cheese on."
35707,Secretary,179, Jerry Seinfeld on the phone.
35708,Chiles,179," You people with the cheese. It never ends. Hello? Uh huh. Uh huh. Uh huh. Good
        Samaritan Law? I never heard of it. You don't have to help anybody. That's what this
        country's all about. That's deplorable, unfathomable, improbable. Hold on. Suzie, cancel
        my appointment with Dr. Bison. And pack a bag for me. I want to get to Latham,
        Massachusetts,right away."
35709,Prosecutor,179," So they got Jackie Chiles, huh?"
35710,D.A. Hoyt,179," Uh huh. You know what that means. This whole place is going to be swarming
        with media by the time this thing is over. You're not going to be able to find a hotel
        room in this town. The whole country is going to be watching us. Now we got to do whatever
        it takes to win it, no matter what the cost. The big issue in this trial is going to be "
35711,Kramer,179," Mmmm, this is pretty good chow, huh?"
35712,George,179," Would it kill him to check up on us? No - drops off the meals and that's it. I
        realize we're prisoners, but we're still entitled to catsup."
35713,Elaine,179, I guess we could've called for help.
35714,Jerry,179, But then we would have missed the whole thing.
35715,Kramer,179, I still had it on video. We could have watched it later.
35716,George,179," Yeah, he's right."
35717,Jerry,179, I forgot about the video.
35718,Elaine,179, Sure - the video.
35719,Elaine,179, What is that?
35720,Jerry,179, Plane's ready.
35721,Rivera,179," Hi everybody, I'm Geraldo Rivera. Tonight we'll be talking about what most of
        you have probably been "
35722,Wells,179," Yes. Good evening, Geraldo."
35723,Rivera,179, What's the mood? What's going on tonight?
35724,Wells,179," Well, Latham is fairly quite tonight, considering the media circus that has
        descended upon this quaint little town."
35725,Rivera,179," And what about the defendants - the so-called New York Four. How are they
        holding up?"
35726,Wells,179," Well, I did speak with one of the deputies who had some contact with them, and
        he told me quote ""There's no love lost with that group."""
35727,Rivera,179," Anything else, Jane?"
35728,Wells,179," There also seems to be some friction between Mr. Seinfeld, and Ms. Benes. The
        rumor is that they once dated,"
35729,Rivera,179," Well, ladies and gentlemen, who know, maybe this trial will bring them closer
        together. Maybe they'll even end up getting married."
35730,Helen,179, I hope you packed enough - this trial could last for weeks.
35731,Morty,179, What's all that?
35732,Helen,179, Cereal.
35733,Morty,179, You're packing cereal?
35734,Helen,179, I'm bringing it for Jerry.
35735,Morty,179, You got enough here for a life sentence.
35736,Helen,179, He likes it. He says he misses that more that anything.
35737,Morty,179, So bring a snack-pack.
35738,Estelle,179," Poor Georgie, was it our fault this happened to him? Did we do something
        wrong? Maybe it was our fault."
35739,Frank,179, Maybe it was your fault. It wasn't my fault. I can tell you that.
35740,Estelle,179," Oh, so it was my fault, but not yours."
35741,Frank,179, You were the one who smothered him.
35742,Estelle,179, I did not smother him.
35743,Frank,179, You smothered! He couldn't get any air! He couldn't breathe! He was suffocating!
35744,Estelle,179," Sure, and you were always in Korea with your religious chachkis."
35745,Frank,179, I had to make a living!
35746,Kramer,179," This is excellent huh? Don't worry I didn't use too much milk, cause I know we
        gotta make it last."
35747,Jerry,179," You know I've had to reduce my milk level. My whole life I've always filled to
        at least three quarters - sometimes, to the top of the cereal. Now, to conserve, I can't
        even see the milk anymore. It's a big adjustment."
35748,Kramer,179, I bet.
35749,Jerry,179, It's one of the hardest things I've ever had to do.
35750,Chiles,179, Good morning.
35751,Elaine,179," Good morning, Jackie."
35752,Jerry,179, Good morning.
35753,Chiles,179, Is everybody ready? Didn't I tell you I wanted you to wear the cardigan? 
35754,George,179, It makes me look older.
35755,Chiles,179," Look older? Do you think this is a game? Is that what you think this is? I'm
        trying to give you amoral compass. You have no moral compass. You're going to walk into
        that courtroom, and the jury's going to see a mean, nasty, evil George Costanza. I want
        them to see Perry Como. No one's going to convict Perry Como. Perry Como helps out a fat
        tub who's getting robbed. "
35756,Chiles,179, Do you think it's funny?
35757,Jerry,179, No.
35758,Chiles,179," You damn right it isn't. You better not be carrying on laughing in that
        courtroom, funny man. Cause if you start getting all smart-alecky, making wisecracks,
        acting a fool, you gonna find yourself in here for a long, long time. I don't like that
        tie. Suzie, get one of my ties from my briefcase."
35759,Elaine,179," How do I look, Jackie?"
35760,Chiles,179," Oh, you looking good. You look strong. You one fine-looking sexy lady."
35761,Elaine,179," Thank you, Jackie."
35762,Kramer,179," How bout me, Jackie?"
35763,Chiles,179," Kramer, you always look good. You got respect for yourself. You're genuine.
        Jury's going to pick up on that."
35764,Chiles,179, Here.
35765,Jerry,179, This one?
35766,Chiles,179, That's right.
35767,Jerry,179, Do I have to?
35768,Elaine,179," Jackie says put it on, Jerry."
35769,Bailiff,179," All rise. Fourth District County Court, Latham, Massachusetts is now in
        session. The Honorable Judge "
35770,George,179, Vandelay? The judge's name is Vandelay?
35771,Chiles,179, Vanda who?
35772,George,179," Jerry, did you hear that?"
35773,Jerry,179, Yeah.
35774,George,179, I think that's a good sign.
35775,Vandelay,179, Is the District Attorney ready to proceed?
35776,Hoyt,179," We are, Your Honor."
35777,Vandelay,179, Mr. Hoyt.
35778,Hoyt,179," Ladies and gentlemen, last year, our City Council by a vote of twelve to two,
        passed a Good Samaritan Law. Now, essentially, we made it a crime to ignore a fellow human
        being in trouble. Now this group from New York not only ignored, but, as we will prove,
        they actually mocked the victim as he was being robbed at gunpoint. I can guarantee you
        one other thing, ladies and gentlemen, this is not the first time they have behaved in
        this manner. On the contrary, they have quite a record of mocking and maligning. This is a
        history of selfishness, self-absorption, immaturity, and greed. And you will see how
        everyone who has come into contact with these four individuals has been abused, wronged,
        deceived and betrayed. This time, they have gone too far. This time they are going to be
        held accountable. This time, they are the ones who will "
35779,Vandelay,179, Mr. Chiles.
35780,Chiles,179," I am shocked and chagrined, mortified and stupefied. This trial is outrageous!
        It is a waste of the taxpayers' time and money. It is a travesty of justice that these
        four people have been incarcerated while the real perpetrator is walking around laughing -
        lying and laughing, laughing and lying. You know what these four people were? They were
        innocentbystanders. Now, you just think about that term. Innocent. Bystanders. Because
        that's exactly what they were. We know theywere bystanders, nobody's disputing that. So
        how can a bystander be guilty? No such thing. Have you ever heard of a guilty bystander?
        No, because you cannot be a bystander and be guilty. Bystanders are by definition,
        innocent. That is the nature of bystanding. But no, they want to change nature here. They
        want to create a whole new animal - the guilty bystander. Don't you let them do it. Only
        you can stop them."
35781,Vandelay,179, Is the prosecution ready to present its first witness?
35782,Hoyt,179," We are, Your Honor. Call Officer Matt Vogel to the stand."
35783,Bailiff,179, Call Matt Vogel.
35784,Hoyt,179, So they were just standing there?
35785,Voleg,179, Yes.
35786,Hoyt,179, Did one of them have a video camera?
35787,Vogel,179, Yes.
35788,Hoyt,179," Your Honor, with the court's permission, we would like to play back that video
        and enter it into evidence as Exhibit A."
35789,Vandelay,179, Proceed.
35790,Victim,179, Don't shoot.
35791,Jerry,179," Well, there goes the money for the lipo."
35792,Elaine,179," See, the great thing about robbing a fat guy is it's an easy getaway. They
        can't really chase ya!"
35793,George,179, He's actually doing him a favor. It's less money for him to buy food.
35794,[Witness,179, the victim of the robbery]
35795,Hoyt,179, So they just stood there and did nothing?
35796,Victim,179," Yeah, nothing. Nothing!"
35797,Hoyt,179, No further questions.
35798,George,179," Hey! Great plane! Thanks a lot. Piece of junk. You know you almost got us
        killed!"
35799,Hoyt,179, Call Mabel Choate to the stand.
35800,Bailiff,179, Call Mabel Choate.
35801,Chiles,179," Your Honor. I most strenuously and vigorously object to this witness. She was
        not present at the time of "
35802,Hoyt,179," Your Honor, the prosecution has gone to great lengths and considerable cost to
        find these character witnesses.It is imperative that we establish this is not merely an
        isolated incident. It's part of a pattern of anti-social behavior that's been going on for
        years."
35803,Vandelay,179, Objection overruled. I'll hear the witness.
35804,Hoyt,179," Now, Mrs. Choate, would you please tell the court what happen the evening of
        January 4th."
35805,Choate,179," Well, I was in Snitzer's Bakery when I got accosted by that man."
35806,Hoyt,179, Let the record show that she is pointing at Mr. Seinfeld.
35807,Hoyt,179, What did he want?
35808,Choate,179, My marble rye.
35809,Hoyt,179, Your marble rye?
35810,Choate,179," I got the last one. He kept persisting, and I said no."
35811,Hoyt,179, And then you left the bakery.
35812,Choate,179, That's right.
35813,Hoyt,179," But it didn't end there, did it, Mrs. Choate?"
35814,Choate,179, Oh no.
35815,Jerry,179, Gimme that rye.
35816,Choate,179, Stop it.
35817,Jerry,179, I want that rye lady.
35818,Choate,179, Help - someone help.
35819,Jerry,179," Shut up, you old bag!"
35820,Hoyt,179, No further questions.
35821,Hoyt,179, I call Marla Penny to the stand.
35822,Bailiff,179, Call Marla Penny.
35823,Jerry,179, The virgin!
35824,Hoyt,179, And what was your connection to the defendants?
35825,Penny,179, I dated Mr. Seinfeld for several weeks in the autumn of 1992.
35826,Hoyt,179," Then on the evening of October 28, there was an abrupt end to that relationship.
        Tell us what happened."
35827,Penny,179, It's rather difficult to talk about.
35828,Hoyt,179, It's alright. Take your time.
35829,Penny,179," Well, I became aware of a -"
35830,Hoyt,179, A what?
35831,Penny,179," A, uh -"
35832,Hoyt,179, Yes?
35833,Penny,179, A contest.
35834,Hoyt,179, Contest? 
35835,Penny,179, Yes.
35836,Hoyt,179, What was the nature of the contest?
35837,Penny,179," Oh please, I can't."
35838,Hoyt,179, It's okay.
35839,Penny,179, The four of them made a wager to see if they could -
35840,Hoyt,179, Yes?
35841,Penny,179, To see who could go the longest without gratifying themselves.
35842,Peterman,179, For the love of God!
35843,Penny,179," It was horrible, horrible!"
35844,Hoyt,179, Call Donald Sanger to the stand.
35845,Jerry,179, Who the hell is that?
35846,Mr. Sanger,179," Come on Donald, you're doing fine."
35847,George,179, The Bubble Boy!
35848,Chiles,179, Bubble Boy?
35849,Jerry,179," That's right, the Bubble Boy."
35850,Chiles,179, What's a Bubble Boy?
35851,Jerry,179, He's a boy who lives in a bubble.
35852,Bubble Boy,179, What the hell are all you looking at?
35853,Hoyt,179," So Donald, would you please tell the court about the incident that occurred in
        your house, October 7th, 1992."
35854,Bubble Boy,179," Well, Jerry Seinfeld was supposed to come to my house, but his friend
        Costanza showed up instead, so I challenged him to a game of Trivial Pursuit."
35855,George,179, Who invaded Spain in the Eighth Century?
35856,Bubble Boy,179, That's a joke - the Moors.
35857,George,179," Oh no - I'm so sorry, it's the Moops. The correct answer is the Moops."
35858,Bubble Boy,179," Moops? Let me see that. That's not Moops, you jerk. It's Moors. It's a
        misprint."
35859,George,179," Sorry, the card says Moops."
35860,Bubble Boy,179, It doesn't matter. It's Moors - there's no Moops.
35861,George,179, It's Moops.
35862,Bubble Boy,179, Moors!
35863,George,179, Moops!
35864,George,179, Help! Someone!
35865,Bubble Boy,179," There's no Moops, you idiot."
35866,Susan,179, Stop it! Let go of him!
35867,Mrs. Sanger,179," Donald, stop it. No. Donald, stop it."
35868,George,179, It was Moops.
35869,Bubble Boy,179, Moors.
35870,[Witness,179," the lady Kramer gave a defective wheelchair to in ""The Handicapped
        Spot""]"
35871,Hoyt,179," So Mr. Costanza parked in a handicapped spot, and as a result you got in an
        accident, and your wheelchair was destroyed?"
35872,Lady,179, That's right.
35873,Hoyt,179, And then Mr. Kramer gave you a used wheelchair?
35874,Lady,179, That's right.
35875,[Witness,179," Dr. Wilcox, the doctor on duty when Susan died]"
35876,Hoyt,179, So you were the doctor on duty the night Susan Ross died?
35877,Wilcox,179," Yes, that's right. It was May 16, 1996. I'll never forget it."
35878,Hoyt,179," So you broke the news to Mr. Costanza? Could you tell the court, please, what his
        reaction was?"
35879,Wilcox,179, I would describe it as restrained jubilation.
35880,Mr. Ross,179, Murderer!
35881,Mrs. Ross,179, He killed our daughter! He knew those envelopes were toxic!
35882,Vandelay,179, Order in this court!
35883,Hoyt,179, Call Sidra Holland to the stand.
35884,Chiles,179," Whew! Look at this one, she fine. You dated her?"
35885,Hoyt,179, So you met Jerry Seinfeld in a health club sometime in 1993?
35886,Sidra,179, Yes.
35887,Hoyt,179, And you also met Miss Benes in that same health club?
35888,Sidra,179," Yes, that's true."
35889,Hoyt,179, Would you describe the circumstances of that meeting.
35890,Sidra,179," We were in the sauna, making chit-chat."
35891,Sidra,179," You know, I've seen you around the club. My name's Sidra. This is Marcie."
35892,Elaine,179," Oh, hi, I'm Elaine."
35893,Hoyt,179," So, she pretended to trip, and she fell into your breasts?"
35894,Sidra,179, Yes.
35895,Hoyt,179, Why would she do something like that?
35896,Sidra,179, Because he sent her in there to find out if they were real.
35897,[Witness,179," Joe Bookman, library cop]"
35898,Hoyt,179, State your name.
35899,Bookman,179," Bookman, Joe Bookman."
35900,Hoyt,179, And what's your occupation?
35901,Bookman,179, I'm a library cop.
35902,Hoyt,179, What does a library cop do?
35903,Bookman,179, We chase down library delinquents.
35904,Hoyt,179, Anyone in this room ever delinquent?
35905,Bookman,179," Yeah, he was. Right over there - Seinfeld."
35906,Hoyt,179, How long was his book overdue?
35907,Bookman,179, 25 years. We don't call them delinquent after that long.
35908,Hoyt,179, What do you call them?
35909,Bookman,179, Criminals.
35910,[Witness,179, George's old girlfriend]
35911,Hoyt,179, So you and Mr. Costanza were dating.
35912,Woman,179, Yes.
35913,Hoyt,179, And then what happened?
35914,Woman,179," Well, I invited him to attend my son's birthday party and -"
35915,George,179, Fire! Get out of the way!
35916,[Witness,179, parking lot security guard]
35917,Guard,179," At the time, I was employed as a security guard in the parking lot at the Garden
        Valley Shopping Mall."
35918,Jerry,179, Why would I do it unless I was in mortal danger? I know it's against the law.
35919,Guard,179, I don't know.
35920,Jerry,179, Because I could get uromycitisis poisoning and die - that's why.
35921,Hoyt,179," Uromycitisis! I wonder if they're having any trouble controlling themselves
        during this trial? Perhaps these two "
35922,Chiles,179," Objection, Your Honor! This is completely inappropriate! My clients' medical
        condition is not on trial here! "
35923,Vandelay,179," Sit down, Mr. Chiles."
35924,[Witness,179, Police Detective]
35925,Hoyt,179," Alright, Detective, then what happened?"
35926,Detective,179," We got a tip that a lot of prostitutes had been turning tricks in the
        parking lot."
35927,Pro,179, You just cost me some money.
35928,Kramer,179," Cool it, lady. Cool it. Cool it, lady. Cool it."
35929,Police,179, Police officers - freeze right there!
35930,Hoyt,179," So Cosmo Kramer was, in fact, a pimp."
35931,[Witness,179, the low-talker]
35932,Hoyt,179, So you asked Mr. Seinfeld if he would wear your puffy shirt on the Today Show?
35933,Hoyt,179, Excuse me?
35934,Chiles,179," Uh, excuse me, Your Honor, but what is the point of this testimony? This
        woman's a low-talker. I can't hear "
35935,[Witness,179, George Steinbrenner]
35936,Hoyt,179, Call George Steinbrenner to the stand.
35937,Bailiff,179, Call George Steinbrenner.
35938,Hoyt,179, So George Costanza came to work for you in May of 1994?
35939,Steinbrenner,179," Yes, that's right, he was good kid - a lovely boy. Shared his calzone
        with me - that was a heck of a sandwich, wasn't it, Georgie?"
35940,George,179," Yes, sir, that was a good sandwich, sir."
35941,Steinbrenner,179, He had one little problem though.
35942,Hoyt,179, What was that?
35943,Steinbrenner,179, He was a communist. Thick as they come. Like a big juicy steak.
35944,Frank,179, How could you give twelve million dollars to Hideki Irabu?!
35945,Vandeley,179, Order!
35946,[Witness,179," Man from ""The Little Jerry""]"
35947,Hoyt,179, Cock fighting?
35948,Witness,179, Cock fighting.
35949,[Witness,179," Pharmacist from ""The Sponge""]"
35950,Pharmacist,179," Sponges. I don't mean the kind you clean your tub with. They're for sex.
        Said she needed a whole case of "
35951,[Witness,179, Elaine's old boyfriend]
35952,Man,179, She exposed her nipple.
35953,[Witness,179," Mr. Pitt from ""The Diplomat's Club""]"
35954,Hoyt,179, How did she try to kill you?
35955,Pitt,179, She tried to smother me with a pillow.
35956,Hoyt,179, Call Yev Kassem to the stand.
35957,Bailiff,179, Call Yev Kassem.
35958,Jerry,179, Who?
35959,Elaine,179, The Soup Nazi!
35960,Chiles,179, Soup Nazi? You people have a little pet name for everybody.
35961,Hoyt,179, State your name.
35962,Soup Nazi,179, Yev Kassem.
35963,Hoyt,179, Could you spell that?
35964,Soup Nazi,179, No! Next question.
35965,Hoyt,179, How do you know the defendants?
35966,Soup Nazi,179, They used to come to my restaurant.
35967,George,179, Medium turkey chili.
35968,Jerry,179, Medium crab bisque.
35969,George,179, I didn't get any bread.
35970,Jerry,179, Just forget it. Let it go.
35971,George,179," Um, excuse me, I think you forgot my bread."
35972,Soup Nazi,179, You want bread?
35973,George,179," Yes, please."
35974,Soup Nazi,179, Three dollars!
35975,George,179, What?
35976,Soup Nazi,179, No soup for you!
35977,Soup Nazi,179," But the idiot clowns did not know how to order. I banned that one - the
        woman - for a year. Then one day, "
35978,Elaine,179," Five cups chopped porcini mushrooms. Half a cup of olive oil. Three pounds
        celery."
35979,Soup Nazi,179, That's my recipe for wild mushroom.
35980,Elaine,179," You're through, Soup Nazi. Pack it up. No more soup for you. Next!"
35981,Soup Nazi,179," She published my recipes. I had to close the store, move to Argentina. She
        ruined my business!"
35982,Elaine,179, Soup's not all that good anyway.
35983,Soup Nazi,179, What did you say?!
35984,Hoyt,179, The state calls Mr. Babu Bhatt to the stand.
35985,Jerry,179, How did they find Babu?
35986,Elaine,179, I thought he was deported.
35987,Hoyt,179," You came a long way to be here today, haven't you?"
35988,Babu,179," Yes, all the way from Pakistan."
35989,Hoyt,179, And what's your connection to the defendant?
35990,Babu,179," I owned a restaurant. Seinfeld told me to change the menu to Pakistani. But
        nobody came! There were no people."
35991,Hoyt,179, And then what happened?
35992,Babu,179," Then, he got me an apartment in his building. But they mixed up the mail. And I
        never got my immigration renewal papers. So they deported me. It's all his fault. Him. And
        the woman. But they did not care. They're totally indifferent. All they do is mock me,
        just like they did the fat fellow. All the time. Mocking, mocking, mocking, mocking,
        mocking. All the time! Now it is Babu's turn to mock. Finally I will have some justice.
        Send them away! Send them all away! Lock them up forever! They are not human. Very bad!
        Very, very, very bad!"
35993,Rivera,179," Hi everybody, I'm Geraldo Rivera and welcome to this special edition of Rivera
        Live. Well, arguments in the "
35994,Wells,179," Geraldo, just a few minutes ago, the jury asked to see the video tape."
35995,Rivera,179," That's the one where they are overheard making sarcastic remarks during the
        robbery."
35996,Wells,179," Yes, it's a very incriminating piece of evidence. But I must tell you, Geraldo,
        this courtroom and everyone who has attended this trial is still reeling from the endless
        parade of witness who have come forth so enthusiastically to testify against these four
        seemingly ordinary people. One even had the feeling that if Judge Vandelay didn't finally
        put a stop to it, it could've gone on for months."
35997,Rivera,179," Jane, whose testimony do you think resonated most strongly with this jury?"
35998,Wells,179," That is so hard to say. Certainly there's the doctor with the poison
        invitations. The Bubble Boy was an extremely sympathetic and tragic figure. And that
        bizarre contest certainly didn't sit well with this small town jury.There's the woman they
        sold the defective wheelchair to, the deported Pakistani restaurateur. Geraldo, it just
        went on, "
35999,Rivera,179, And so we wait.
36000,Jerry,179, Do they make you wear uniforms in prison?
36001,Elaine,179, I think so.
36002,Jerry,179, It's not that bright orange one is it?
36003,Elaine,179," I hope it's not that one, because I cannot wear orange."
36004,Kramer,179," Will you stop worrying? Jackie's going to get us off. He never loses. How about
        when he asked that cop "
36005,Estelle,179," Sorry to bother you, Judge."
36006,Vandelay,179, How did you get in here?
36007,Estelle,179," Please, if he's found guilty, please be kind to him. He's a good boy."
36008,Vandelay,179, This is highly irregular.
36009,Estelle,179," Well, maybe there's something I can do for you."
36010,Vandelay,179, What do you mean?
36011,Estelle,179, You know
36012,Sidra,179," Oh, Jackie, you're so articulate."
36013,Jackie,179," We have plenty of time, too. This jury could be out for days."
36014,Jackie,179, Hello? Damn. They're ready.
36015,Jerry,179," Hey Elaine, what was it you were about to say to me on the plane when it was
        going down?"
36016,Elaine,179, I've always loved ... United Airlines.
36017,Kramer,179, I think it's going to be okay - that girl just smiled at me.
36018,Jerry,179, Maybe because she knows you're going to jail.
36019,Bailiff,179, All rise.
36020,Vandelay,179," Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, have you reached a verdict?"
36021,Foreman,179," We have, Your Honor."
36022,Vandelay,179," Will the defendants please rise. And how do you find, with respect to the
        charge of criminal indifference?"
36023,Foreman,179, We find the defendants - guilty.
36024,Vandelay,179," Order! Order in this court, I will clear this room! I do not know how, or
        under what circumstances the four of you found each other, but your callous indifference
        and utter disregard for everything that is good and decent has rocked the very foundation
        upon which our society is built. I can think of nothing more fitting than for the four of
        youto spend a year removed from society so that you can contemplate the manner in which
        you have conducted yourselves. "
36025,George,179, You had to hop! You had to hop on the plane.
36026,Elaine,179," Puddy, don't wait for me."
36027,Puddy,179, Alright.
36028,Frank,179, We gotta get out of here. We want to beat the traffic.
36029,Sidra,179," Come on, Jackie. Let's go."
36030,Jerry,179, What?
36031,Chiles,179," Oh, and by the way, they're real, and they're spectacular."
36032,Jerry,179," Well, it's only a year. That's not so bad. We'll be out in a year, and then
        we'll be back"
36033,Kramer,179," Could be fun. Don't have to worry about your meals, or what you're going to do
        Saturday night. And they do shows. Yeah, we could put on a show - maybe ""Bye Bye
        Birdie"" or ""My Fair Lady"". Elaine, you could be Liza Doolittle."
36034,Elaine,179, Why don't you just blow it out your...
36035,Elaine,179," If I call Jill from prison, do you think that would make up for the other ones?"
36036,Jerry,179, Sure.
36037,Elaine,179, Cause you only get one call. The prison call is like the king of calls.
36038,Jerry,179, I think that would be a very nice gesture.
36039,Kramer,179," I got it - it's out! How about that, huh? Oh, boy, what a relief."
36040,Jerry,179," See now, to me, that button is in the worst possible spot."
36041,George,179, Really?
36042,Jerry,179," Oh yeah. The second button is the key button. It literally makes or breaks the
        shirt. Look at it, it's "
36043,George,179, Haven't we had this conversation before?
36044,Jerry,179, You think?
36045,George,179, I think we have.
36046,Jerry,179," Yeah, maybe we have."
36047,Jerry,179," So what is the deal with the yard? I mean when I was a kid my mother wanted me
        to play in the yard. But of "
36048,Prisoner 1,179, I am.
36049,Jerry,179," I'll talk slower. I'm kidding - I love Cellblock D. My friend George is in
        Cellblock D. What are you in for,sir?"
36050,Prisoner 2,179, Murder one.
36051,Jerry,179," Murder one? Oooooo, watch out everybody. Better be nice to you. I'm only kidding
        sir - lighten up. How about "
36052,Prisoner 3,179, Grand theft auto.
36053,Jerry,179, Grand theft auto - don't steal any of my jokes.
36054,Prisoner 3,179, You suck - I'm gonna cut you.
36055,Jerry,179," Hey, I don't come down to where you work, and knock the license plate out of
        your hand."
36056,Guard,179," Alright, Seinfeld, that's it. Let's go. Come on."
36057,Jerry,179," Alright, hey, you've been great! See you in the cafeteria."
36058,Jerry,180," It seems like whenever these office people call you in for a meeting, 
        the whole thing is about the sitting down. I would really like to sit 
        down with you. I think we need to sit down and talk. Why don't you come 
        in, and we'll sit down. Well, sometimes the sitting down doesn't work. 
        People get mad at the sitting.You know, we've been sitting here for I 
        don't know how long. How much longer are we just going to sit here? I'll 
        tell you what I think we should do. I think we should all sleep on it. 
        Maybe we're not getting down low enough. Maybe if we all lie down, then 
        our brains will work."
36059,George,180," I can't eat this without catsup. Would it kill her to check up on us? Would
        that be a terrible thing? ""How's everything? Do you need anything? What can I do for
        you?"""
36060,Jerry,180, I know what you mean.
36061,George,180, Do ya?
36062,Jerry,180, It's like going out with someone and you never hear from them again.
36063,George,180, Same thing!
36064,Jerry,180," Not really, but it's something. Ask the people behind you."
36065,George,180, Excuse me. Are you using your catsup?
36066,Woman,180, What do you think? You want to give him the catsup?
36067,Man,180, It's up to you.
36068,Woman,180, You know what? I don't think so. I'm going to need it from time to time.
36069,Jerry,180, So what are you doing later? You want to go to the movies?
36070,George,180, Nah - what for?
36071,Jerry,180, To see a movie.
36072,George,180, I've been to the movies.
36073,Jerry,180, Not this movie.
36074,George,180," They're all the same. You go, you sit, you eat popcorn, you watch. I'm sick of
        it."
36075,Jerry,180, Did you shower today?
36076,George,180, Yeah.
36077,Jerry,180, That's usually the kind of mood I'm in when I haven't showered.
36078,George,180," When is it going to be my turn, Jerry? When do I get my 15 minutes? I want my
        15 minutes!"
36079,Jerry,180," Oh, quit complaining. At least you have your health."
36080,George,180," Ah! Health's not good enough. I want more than health. Health's not doing it
        for me anymore. I'm sick"
36081,Woman,180," All right, we're done. You can have it now."
36082,George,180," Oh, very gracious."
36083,Man,180, Nice day
36084,George,180, Yeah.
36085,Jerry,180, What is that?
36086,Kramer,180, Hey! JoJo!
36087,Jerry,180," Ey, ey!"
36088,Elaine,180," All right, thanks for the ride, Kramer."
36089,Kramer,180," No, thank you. So what are you doing?"
36090,Jerry,180, Nothing.
36091,Kramer,180," Come on, let's go to the beach."
36092,George,180, What are you crazy?
36093,Kramer,180, What? It's a beautiful day.
36094,Jerry,180, Have a good time.
36095,Kramer,180," Yeah, there's something in the air today. You feel it? There's something in the
        air."
36096,Jerry,180, You know you're turning into Burt Lancaster?
36097,Kramer,180," Yeah, there's something in the air."
36098,Elaine,180," Oh, I forgot to call Jill. Jill. Hi, it's Elaine. How is your father? Is
        everything okay? What? I can't hear you so good. There's a lot of static. Wha? I'm going
        to call you back."
36099,Jerry,180, Jill's father is in the hospital and you call to ask about him on a cell phone?
36100,Elaine,180, What? No good?
36101,Jerry,180, Faux pas.
36102,Elaine,180, Faux pas?
36103,George,180, Big hefty stinking faux pas.
36104,Elaine,180, Why?
36105,Jerry,180," You can't make a health inquiry on a cell phone. It's like saying ""I don't
        want to take up any of my "
36106,George,180, On-the-street cell-phone call is the lowest phone call you can make.
36107,Jerry,180, It's an act of total disregard. It's selfish.
36108,George,180, It's dismissive.
36109,Jerry,180, It's pompous.
36110,George,180, Why don't you think before you do something?
36111,Elaine,180, Here's a thought - Bye bye.
36112,George,180, Too much?
36113,George,180," Boy - I'm really surprised at Elaine - that whole phone business - she should
        know better than that."
36114,Jerry,180, Hey - hey - hey!
36115,George,180, What?
36116,Jerry,180," Where do you think this relationship is? If you are thinking of instituting an
        open-door urination policy, let me disabuse you of that notion right now, my friend."
36117,George,180, You're so uptight.
36118,Jerry,180," Uptight? Let's all just have a big pee party. Hey everybody, grab a bucket.
        We're going up to Jerry's. It's a pee party."
36119,Phone Tape,180," Jerry, this is Elizabeth Clark calling from James Kimbrough's office at
        NBC. Could you please give us a call?Thanks."
36120,Jerry,180," Hello. Yeah, hi, this is Jerry Seinfeld calling for James Kimbrough. Hello? Hi?
        Uh huh, really, uh, no problem,"
36121,George,180, Who's he?
36122,Jerry,180," He is the new president of NBC. He wants to sit down with us and talk about
        ""Jerry."""
36123,George,180," Our show, ""Jerry""?"
36124,Jerry,180, Right.
36125,George,180," ""Jerry"", oh my God. He wants to talk about ""Jerry""?"
36126,Jerry,180, Yeah!
36127,George,180, When? 
36128,Jerry,180," Today, like right now."
36129,George,180," Right now? ""Jerry""?"
36130,Jerry,180," ""Jerry""!"
36131,George,180," He wants to talk about ""Jerry""?"
36132,Jerry,180," He wants to talk about ""Jerry""!"
36133,George,180," ""Jerry""!"
36134,Jerry,180," ""Jerry""!"
36135,George,180, Can I go like this?
36136,Jerry,180, Sure!
36137,George,180, No sports jacket? I don't need a sports jacket? Writers wear sports jackets.
36138,Jerry,180, Forget the sports jacket.
36139,George,180, I won't feel like a writer.
36140,Jerry,180, You're not a writer.
36141,George,180, Right!
36142,George,180, Water. Need some water! Water here!
36143,Jerry,180," Ok, now listen, I don't want any scenes in here like the last time."
36144,George,180," Don't worry, don't worry, no scenes."
36145,Jerry,180, Don't blow this.
36146,George,180, I will not blow this.
36147,Jerry,180," If he says he doesn't want it to be a show about nothing, don't go nuts."
36148,George,180," It's fine, it doesn't have to be about nothing."
36149,Jerry,180, He might not want nothing.
36150,George,180," Something, nothing, I could care less."
36151,Jerry,180, He might want a show about anything and everything.
36152,George,180," Anything, everything, something, nothing - Who the hell cares? Put me down. I'm
        down!"
36153,Jerry,180, All right.
36154,Receptionist,180, Mr. Kimbrough is ready to see you 
36155,George,180, Magic time.
36156,Jerry,180, What?
36157,Receptionist,180, Mr. Kimbrough.
36158,Stu,180," Hey, Jerry, good to see you."
36159,George,180," Hey, hey, hey!"
36160,Stu,180, How you been?
36161,Jerry,180," Good, good. You remember George."
36162,Stu,180," George, good to see you."
36163,George,180, Hello Stu.
36164,Stu,180, You remember Jay Crespi.
36165,George,180," Jay Crespi, how am I gonna forget Jay Crespi?"
36166,Stu,180, This is James Kimbrough.
36167,Kimbrough,180," Nice to meet you, pleasure, thanks for coming in."
36168,George,180, Kimbrough.
36169,Jerry,180, Don't spell.
36170,George,180, K-I-M-B-R-O-U-G-H
36171,Kimbrough,180, That's right.
36172,George,180, It's a talent I have.
36173,Kimbrough,180," Why don't we sit down, glad you're here."
36174,George,180," Woo! Some day out there - You ever see weather like that? Woo! It's crisp -
        it's crispy crisp."
36175,Jerry,180," Shut up, George."
36176,Kimbrough,180, Can I get you anything?
36177,George,180, What do we have in the fruit department?
36178,Jerry,180, Oy.
36179,Stu ,180, Pineapple.
36180,George,180," Oh, that's a dangerous fruit. It's like a weapon that thing, got spikes on the
        end. You can get killed from "
36181,Kimbrough,180," Anyway, let me tell you why I called. When I took over here last month, I
        reviewed what was in development,and it was pretty much same old, same old."
36182,George,180," Been there, done that."
36183,Kimbrough,180," Right. I was looking for something different. Something that would have
        people talking at the water coolers."
36184,George,180, Water coolers?
36185,Crespi,180, We call it a water-cooler show.
36186,Jerry,180," Because the next day in the offices, people gather around the water coolers to
        talk about it, right?"
36187,George,180," See, I think people would talk about it at the coffee machines."
36188,Jerry,180," Well it's probably just easier to say ""water cooler show"" than
        ""coffee machine show."""
36189,George,180," It's really not accurate. Nobody drinks from a water cooler any more - they use
        bottles."
36190,Jerry,180, But I think Mr. Kimbrough makes a good point.
36191,Kimbrough,180," Anyway, Stu here started telling me about a show, ""Jerry"", that he
        developed five years ago."
36192,Stu,180, I have always loved it.
36193,Kimbrough,180," He said it was a show about nothing. So, I saw the pilot and I've got to
        tell you - I flipped out."
36194,Crespi,180, He totally flipped out.
36195,Kimbrough,180," What I want to do is put it on the air. 13-episode commitment. Start it off
        on Wednesday night, build up an"
36196,Jerry,180, He's a little off the wall.
36197,Crespi,180, Oh yeah.
36198,Stu,180, Kramer.
36199,Kimbrough,180, And Elaine - I wouldn't mind seeing something happening between you two.
36200,Jerry,180, Definitely.
36201,George,180," I tell you, I really don't think so-called relationship humor is what this show
        is all about."
36202,Kimbrough,180," Or we could not do the show altogether, how about that?"
36203,George,180, Or we could get them together. Woo!
36204,George,180, Yeah!
36205,Jerry,180, Yeah!
36206,Elaine,180," Jill, hi, it's Elaine. Well, I'm calling from my home. Indoors. Well, I was
        just calling to see how your fa.. "
36207,Jerry,180," Hi. Elaine, it's me."
36208,Elaine,180," Jerry, I'm on the other line."
36209,Jerry,180, No no - this is an emergency - get off the phone.
36210,Elaine,180," I'm sorry, Jill. I'm going to have to take this call. Jerry, what's the
        emergency?"
36211,Jerry,180," The ""Jerry""'s back on - the TV show! George and I are moving to

        California!"
36212,Elaine,180, That's the emergency?
36213,Jerry,180, Did you hear what I said?
36214,Elaine,180, I was on the other line talking to Jill.
36215,Jerry,180," Jill? Well, why didn't you say so?"
36216,Elaine,180, You said it was an emergency.
36217,Jerry,180," So now she's lost a phone face-off? That's even worse than your cell phone
        walk-and-talk."
36218,Helen,180," Congratulations, they're doing the show."
36219,Morty,180," They should have put that show on 5 years ago. Bunch of idiots at that network.
        Can I tell you something, Jerry? It's all crap on TV. The only thing I watch is Xena the
        Warrior Princess. She must be about six-six."
36220,Helen,180, She's not six-six.
36221,Morty,180," Jerry, you ever watch that?"
36222,Jerry,180," Yeah, it's pretty good."
36223,Estelle,180, They picked up the show?
36224,George,180, I'm moving to California.
36225,Frank,180," Oh baby-doll, this kid's going places, I told you."
36226,Estelle,180, The NBC guy liked it?
36227,George,180, Of course he liked it.
36228,Estelle,180, He told you he liked it?
36229,George,180, He wouldn't put it on if he didn't like it.
36230,Estelle,180," Well, what are you doing?"
36231,George,180, I'm writing.
36232,Estelle,180, You know how to write?
36233,Frank,180," Without the writing, you have nothing. You're the ones that make them look good."
36234,Estelle,180, Since when do you know how to write? I never saw you write anything.
36235,George,180, Ma?!
36236,Estelle,180," I don't know how you're going to write all those shows. And where are you get
        all the ideas?"
36237,Frank,180, Would you leave him alone? You'll shatter his confidence!
36238,George,180, I don't need any ideas. It's a show about nothing.
36239,Estelle,180," Nothing. Please. I'll tell you the truth - the whole thing sounds pretty
        stupid to me."
36240,Jerry,180," NBC is letting me use their private jet? And I can go anywhere I want? That's
        fantastic! Thanks. Great. "
36241,Kramer,180, Oh hey!
36242,Jerry,180, Hey - how was the beach?
36243,Kramer,180," Oh, you missed it, buddy - lot of femininas - some major femininas"
36244,Jerry,180, I had a little meeting today at NBC. What are you doing?
36245,Kramer,180," You know, I went swimming and I can't get this water out of my ear."
36246,Jerry,180," So do you remember five years ago, we did that pilot, ""Jerry""? Well,
        the new guy at NBC wants to do it. "
36247,Kramer,180, You're moving to California?
36248,Jerry,180," Yeah, only for a while."
36249,Kramer,180," Yeah, but Jerry, what happens if the show's a hit? You could be out there for
        years! You might never come"
36250,Jerry,180," No, I'll be back."
36251,Kramer,180," Jerry. It's L.A. Nobody leaves. She's a seductress, she's a siren, she's a
        virgin, she's a whore."
36252,Jerry,180," And my agent said as a bonus, I can use their private jet, so we'll all go
        somewhere - the four of us, one big fling before George and I go to California."
36253,Kramer,180, Fling!
36254,Elaine,180, So we can go anywhere we want?
36255,Jerry,180, Anywhere.
36256,Elaine,180, Why are they doing this?
36257,Jerry,180," I think they want to make it up to us cause they let this thing sit on their
        shelf for five years."
36258,Elaine,180, This is all very exciting.
36259,George,180, So? Where are we going?
36260,Kramer,180, I say Japan.
36261,Elaine,180, Why Japan?
36262,Kramer,180," Oh - geishas - they cater to your every whim. They're shy at first, but they're
        quite skilled at conversation. They can discuss anything from world affairs to the fine
        art of fishing - or baking."
36263,Elaine,180, Oh - I got it - how about Russia?
36264,Jerry,180," Russia, it's so bleak."
36265,Elaine,180, It's not bleak - it's springtime.
36266,Jerry,180, It's still bleak.
36267,Elaine,180, You can't be bleak in spring.
36268,Jerry,180, You can be bleak in spring.
36269,George,180," If you're bleak, you're bleak."
36270,Elaine,180, What about Switzerland?
36271,Kramer,180," Oh - Switzerland - the Von Trapp family, huh?"
36272,George,180, It's a bit hilly - no?
36273,Elaine,180, You're not going to do any walking.
36274,George,180, What if I want to walk around a little?
36275,Elaine,180, So then you'll walk down the hill and we'll pick you up.
36276,George,180, What if I'm at the bottom?
36277,Elaine,180," All right! You know what, just forget it!"
36278,Jerry,180," Alright - come on - come on now, people. Let's face it, we're not all going to
        agree on anything. "
36279,Elaine,180, I'll go to Paris.
36280,George,180, Me too.
36281,Kramer,180, Oh yeah - oui oui.
36282,Jerry,180," So that's it - it's settled, we're going to Paris."
36283,Group,180, Yeah!
36284,Elaine,180," Hey. NBC limo is downstairs - beep beep beep. {NBC tune} I'm just going to call
        Jill one more time before we go."
36285,Jerry,180," Wait, you can't make a call like that on your way out. You can't rush that
        conversation."
36286,Elaine,180," Well, I can't call from the limo. Can I call from the plane?"
36287,Jerry,180," First you make a cell-phone walk-and-talk, then she loses a call-waiting
        face-off, now you're talking about"
36288,Elaine,180," All right, I'll just have to call her from Paris."
36289,Newman,180," Hello, Jerry."
36290,Jerry,180," Hello, Newman. What gives?"
36291,Newman,180," I was speaking earlier with Kramer and he mentioned something about a private
        jet to Paris?"
36292,Jerry,180," Yeah, that's right."
36293,Newman,180," Well, I hear it's quite beautiful there this time of year, and of course you
        know I'm one-quarter French."
36294,Jerry,180, Really.
36295,Newman,180," Oh yes, in fact I still have family there. This probably won't interest you,
        but I have a cousin there who's suffering very badly. She's lost all use of her muscles.
        She can only communicate by blinking. I would so love to see her - bring a ray of sunshine
        into her tragic life. But alas, I can't afford it, for I am, as you know, but a simple
        postal worker."
36296,Jerry,180, That's a shame.
36297,Newman,180, Take me! Take me!
36298,Jerry,180," Oh, forget it. Pull yourself together. You're making me sick. Be a man!"
36299,Newman,180," All right! But hear me and hear me well - The day will come. Oh yes, mark my
        words, Seinfeld - your day of "
36300,Captain,180," Ah, Jerry?"
36301,Jerry,180, Yeah.
36302,Captain,180," I'm Captain Maddox this is my co-pilot, Kurt Adams. Ready to go to Paris?"
36303,Jerry,180, All set. We'll just grab the bags.
36304,Captain,180, Don't worry about that. We'll take care of them for you.
36305,Jerry,180, Just keeps on getting better and better.
36306,Jerry,180, Not bad.
36307,Elaine,180, Wow!
36308,Kramer,180, The only way to fly.
36309,George,180, This is it?
36310,George,180," I'm sorry - I have to say, I'm a little disappointed, I thought it would be a
        lot nicer."
36311,Jerry,180, You're complaining about a private jet?
36312,George,180, You think this is the plane that Ted Danson gets?
36313,Jerry,180, Ted Danson is not even on the network anymore.
36314,George,180," Still, I bet when they gave him a plane, it was a lot nicer than this one."
36315,Elaine,180, Will you shut up? You are ruining the whole trip.
36316,George,180," This is a real piece of junk. I don't even feel safe on this thing. I have a
        good mind to write a letter toMr. Kimbrough."
36317,Jerry,180, You're not writing any letters!
36318,Elaine,180, Will you turn around?
36319,George,180, Why?
36320,Elaine,180, You are annoying me sitting like that. It's effeminate.
36321,George,180, It's effeminate to sit like this? 
36322,Elaine,180," Yes, I think it's a little effeminate."
36323,George,180, How is this effeminate?
36324,Elaine,180, I don't know - it just is.
36325,George,180," Kramer, what are you doing?"
36326,Jerry,180, Still got water in your ear?
36327,Kramer,180, Can't get rid of it. Maybe it leaked inside my brain.
36328,George,180, Would you stop that? It's not safe to be jumping up and down on a plane.
36329,Kramer,180," I got to get it out, I can't take this anymore."
36330,George,180," Kramer, don't be fooling around up here."
36331,George,180, Kramer!
36332,Captain,180," Hey, get the hell out of here!"
36333,Elaine,180, What is that?
36334,George,180, Oh my God!
36335,Elaine,180, What is that noise? What is that noise?
36336,Jerry,180," Kramer, what the hell did you do?"
36337,Kramer,180, I lost my balance.
36338,Elaine,180, Oh my God!
36339,Elaine,180, What's going on?
36340,Jerry,180, Kramer!
36341,Kramer,180, It was an accident.
36342,George,180, I told you to stop with the hopping.
36343,Elaine,180," Oh my God, we're going down. We're going to die!"
36344,George,180, Just when I was doing great. I told you God wouldn't let me be successful.
36345,Jerry,180, Is this it? Is this how it ends? It can't- it can't end like this.
36346,Kramer,180, I'm ready! I'm ready! Glory hallelujah!
36347,George,180, Jerry? Jerry can you hear me?
36348,Jerry,180, Yeah.
36349,George,180, There's something I have to tell you.
36350,Jerry,180, What? What is it?
36351,George,180, I cheated in the contest.
36352,Elaine,180, What?
36353,Jerry,180, What?
36354,George,180, The contest - I cheated.
36355,Jerry,180, Why?
36356,George,180, Because I'm a cheater! I had to tell you.
36357,Jerry,180, Great - I won.
36358,Elaine,180," Jerry, I gotta tell you something too."
36359,Jerry,180," Yeah, Elaine I got something I want to say to you."
36360,Elaine,180, No no - me first.
36361,Jerry,180, Alright.
36362,Elaine,180," Jerry, I've always loved ..u.."
36363,George,180, Hey - What's going on?
36364,Kramer,180, We're straightening out!
36365,Elaine,180, We're straightening out?
36366,Jerry,180, We're straightening out!
36367,George,180, We're straightening out!
36368,Group,180, Yeah!
36369,Captain,180," Well, again, sorry about that little mishap. But once you get everything
        checked out there shouldn't be anymore problems."
36370,Jerry,180, Where are we?
36371,Captain,180," Latham, Massachusetts. Why don't you take a cab into town, get yourself
        something to eat. I got your beeper number - I'll beep you as soon as we're ready."
36372,Jerry,180, Okay.
36373,Elaine,180, Okay.
36374,Jerry,180, We'll see you later.
36375,Elaine,180," Well, what are we going to do about Paris? I mean are we actually going to get
        back on this plane?"
36376,Jerry,180," I say we go back to New York, and take a regular flight."
36377,George,180," I'm not getting on a regular plane now - I'm all psyched up to go on a private
        jet. No way I'm getting on a regular plane."
36378,Elaine,180," Well, I'm sure that they would fly us first class."
36379,George,180," First class doesn't make it anymore. Now you get on the phone with Kimbrough,
        tell him what happened and tell him to get another plane down here, but this time, the
        good one - the Ted Danson plane."
36380,Jerry,180," Alright, I'll feel him out."
36381,George,180," Yeah, just tell him to hurry it up."
36382,Stranger,180, Nice day.
36383,Jerry,180, Another one?
36384,Robber,180," Alright fatso, out of the car."
36385,Kramer,180, I want to capture this.
36386,Robber,180, Come on! Gimme your wallet.
36387,Victim,180, Don't shoot.
36388,Jerry,180," Well, there goes the money for the lipo."
36389,Elaine,180," See, the great thing about robbing a fat guy is it's an easy getaway. You know?
        They can't really chase ya!"
36390,George,180, He's actually doing him a favor. It's less money for him to buy food.
36391,Robber,180," I want your wallet. Come on. Come on, come on."
36392,Jerry,180," That's a shame. Alright, I'm gonna call NBC."
36393,Victim,180," Officer, he's stealing my car! Officer, I was carjacked. I was held up at
        gunpoint! He took my wallet, everything!"
36394,Jerry,180," Okay, thanks anyway. They can't get another plane."
36395,Kramer,180," All right, what's wrong with the plane we got? They're just checking it out."
36396,Elaine,180, Forget it.
36397,Jerry,180," No, no, no. We're not getting on there. Come on, let's go get something to eat
        in Sticksville."
36398,Officer,180," All right, hold it right there."
36399,Kramer,180, What?
36400,Officer,180, You're under arrest.
36401,Jerry,180, Under arrest? What for?
36402,Officer,180, Article 223-7 of the Latham County Penal Code.
36403,Elaine,180," What? No, no - we didn't do anything."
36404,Officer,180, It's new. It's called the Good Samaritan Law. Let's go.
36405,Elaine,180, The Good Samaritan Law? Are they crazy?
36406,George,180, Why would we want to help somebody?
36407,Elaine,180, I know.
36408,George,180, That's what nuns and Red Cross workers are for.
36409,Kramer,180, The Samaritans were an ancient tribe - very helpful to people.
36410,Elaine,180," Alright - um, excuse me, hi, could you tell me what kind of law this is."
36411,Deputy,180," Well, they just passed it last year. It's modeled after the French law. I heard
        about it after Princess Diana was killed and all those photographers were just standing
        around."
36412,Jerry,180," Oh, yeah."
36413,Elaine,180," Oh, yeah."
36414,Deputy,180," You're the first ones to be arrested on it, probably in the whole country."
36415,George,180," All right, so what's the penalty here? Let's just pay the fine or something and
        get the hell out of here."
36416,Deputy,180," Well, it's not that easy. Now see, the law calls for a maximum fine of $85,000
        and as much as five years in prison."
36417,Elaine,180, What?
36418,George,180," Oh no no no no - we have to be in California next week. We're starting a TV
        show."
36419,Deputy,180," California? Oh gosh, I don't think so. Yeah, my guess is you're gonna be
        prosecuted. Better get yourselves a good lawyer."
36420,Chiles,180," Who told you to put the cheese on? Did I tell you to put the cheese on? I
        didn't tell you to put the cheese on."
36421,Secretary,180, Jerry Seinfeld on the phone.
36422,Chiles,180," You people with the cheese. It never ends. Hello? Uh huh. Uh huh. Uh huh. Good
        Samaritan Law? I never heard of it. You don't have to help anybody. That's what this
        country's all about. That's deplorable, unfathomable, improbable. Hold on. Suzie, cancel
        my appointment with Dr. Bison. And pack a bag for me. I want to get to Latham,
        Massachusetts,right away."
36423,Prosecutor,180," So they got Jackie Chiles, huh?"
36424,D.A. Hoyt,180," Uh huh. You know what that means. This whole place is going to be swarming
        with media by the time this thing is over. You're not going to be able to find a hotel
        room in this town. The whole country is going to be watching us. Now we got to do whatever
        it takes to win it, no matter what the cost. The big issue in this trial is going to be "
36425,Kramer,180," Mmmm, this is pretty good chow, huh?"
36426,George,180," Would it kill him to check up on us? No - drops off the meals and that's it. I
        realize we're prisoners, but we're still entitled to catsup."
36427,Elaine,180, I guess we could've called for help.
36428,Jerry,180, But then we would have missed the whole thing.
36429,Kramer,180, I still had it on video. We could have watched it later.
36430,George,180," Yeah, he's right."
36431,Jerry,180, I forgot about the video.
36432,Elaine,180, Sure - the video.
36433,Elaine,180, What is that?
36434,Jerry,180, Plane's ready.
36435,Rivera,180," Hi everybody, I'm Geraldo Rivera. Tonight we'll be talking about what most of
        you have probably been "
36436,Wells,180," Yes. Good evening, Geraldo."
36437,Rivera,180, What's the mood? What's going on tonight?
36438,Wells,180," Well, Latham is fairly quite tonight, considering the media circus that has
        descended upon this quaint little town."
36439,Rivera,180," And what about the defendants - the so-called New York Four. How are they
        holding up?"
36440,Wells,180," Well, I did speak with one of the deputies who had some contact with them, and
        he told me quote ""There's no love lost with that group."""
36441,Rivera,180," Anything else, Jane?"
36442,Wells,180," There also seems to be some friction between Mr. Seinfeld, and Ms. Benes. The
        rumor is that they once dated,"
36443,Rivera,180," Well, ladies and gentlemen, who know, maybe this trial will bring them closer
        together. Maybe they'll even end up getting married."
36444,Helen,180, I hope you packed enough - this trial could last for weeks.
36445,Morty,180, What's all that?
36446,Helen,180, Cereal.
36447,Morty,180, You're packing cereal?
36448,Helen,180, I'm bringing it for Jerry.
36449,Morty,180, You got enough here for a life sentence.
36450,Helen,180, He likes it. He says he misses that more that anything.
36451,Morty,180, So bring a snack-pack.
36452,Estelle,180," Poor Georgie, was it our fault this happened to him? Did we do something
        wrong? Maybe it was our fault."
36453,Frank,180, Maybe it was your fault. It wasn't my fault. I can tell you that.
36454,Estelle,180," Oh, so it was my fault, but not yours."
36455,Frank,180, You were the one who smothered him.
36456,Estelle,180, I did not smother him.
36457,Frank,180, You smothered! He couldn't get any air! He couldn't breathe! He was suffocating!
36458,Estelle,180," Sure, and you were always in Korea with your religious chachkis."
36459,Frank,180, I had to make a living!
36460,Kramer,180," This is excellent huh? Don't worry I didn't use too much milk, cause I know we
        gotta make it last."
36461,Jerry,180," You know I've had to reduce my milk level. My whole life I've always filled to
        at least three quarters - sometimes, to the top of the cereal. Now, to conserve, I can't
        even see the milk anymore. It's a big adjustment."
36462,Kramer,180, I bet.
36463,Jerry,180, It's one of the hardest things I've ever had to do.
36464,Chiles,180, Good morning.
36465,Elaine,180," Good morning, Jackie."
36466,Jerry,180, Good morning.
36467,Chiles,180, Is everybody ready? Didn't I tell you I wanted you to wear the cardigan? 
36468,George,180, It makes me look older.
36469,Chiles,180," Look older? Do you think this is a game? Is that what you think this is? I'm
        trying to give you amoral compass. You have no moral compass. You're going to walk into
        that courtroom, and the jury's going to see a mean, nasty, evil George Costanza. I want
        them to see Perry Como. No one's going to convict Perry Como. Perry Como helps out a fat
        tub who's getting robbed. "
36470,Chiles,180, Do you think it's funny?
36471,Jerry,180, No.
36472,Chiles,180," You damn right it isn't. You better not be carrying on laughing in that
        courtroom, funny man. Cause if you start getting all smart-alecky, making wisecracks,
        acting a fool, you gonna find yourself in here for a long, long time. I don't like that
        tie. Suzie, get one of my ties from my briefcase."
36473,Elaine,180," How do I look, Jackie?"
36474,Chiles,180," Oh, you looking good. You look strong. You one fine-looking sexy lady."
36475,Elaine,180," Thank you, Jackie."
36476,Kramer,180," How bout me, Jackie?"
36477,Chiles,180," Kramer, you always look good. You got respect for yourself. You're genuine.
        Jury's going to pick up on that."
36478,Chiles,180, Here.
36479,Jerry,180, This one?
36480,Chiles,180, That's right.
36481,Jerry,180, Do I have to?
36482,Elaine,180," Jackie says put it on, Jerry."
36483,Bailiff,180," All rise. Fourth District County Court, Latham, Massachusetts is now in
        session. The Honorable Judge "
36484,George,180, Vandelay? The judge's name is Vandelay?
36485,Chiles,180, Vanda who?
36486,George,180," Jerry, did you hear that?"
36487,Jerry,180, Yeah.
36488,George,180, I think that's a good sign.
36489,Vandelay,180, Is the District Attorney ready to proceed?
36490,Hoyt,180," We are, Your Honor."
36491,Vandelay,180, Mr. Hoyt.
36492,Hoyt,180," Ladies and gentlemen, last year, our City Council by a vote of twelve to two,
        passed a Good Samaritan Law. Now, essentially, we made it a crime to ignore a fellow human
        being in trouble. Now this group from New York not only ignored, but, as we will prove,
        they actually mocked the victim as he was being robbed at gunpoint. I can guarantee you
        one other thing, ladies and gentlemen, this is not the first time they have behaved in
        this manner. On the contrary, they have quite a record of mocking and maligning. This is a
        history of selfishness, self-absorption, immaturity, and greed. And you will see how
        everyone who has come into contact with these four individuals has been abused, wronged,
        deceived and betrayed. This time, they have gone too far. This time they are going to be
        held accountable. This time, they are the ones who will "
36493,Vandelay,180, Mr. Chiles.
36494,Chiles,180," I am shocked and chagrined, mortified and stupefied. This trial is outrageous!
        It is a waste of the taxpayers' time and money. It is a travesty of justice that these
        four people have been incarcerated while the real perpetrator is walking around laughing -
        lying and laughing, laughing and lying. You know what these four people were? They were
        innocentbystanders. Now, you just think about that term. Innocent. Bystanders. Because
        that's exactly what they were. We know theywere bystanders, nobody's disputing that. So
        how can a bystander be guilty? No such thing. Have you ever heard of a guilty bystander?
        No, because you cannot be a bystander and be guilty. Bystanders are by definition,
        innocent. That is the nature of bystanding. But no, they want to change nature here. They
        want to create a whole new animal - the guilty bystander. Don't you let them do it. Only
        you can stop them."
36495,Vandelay,180, Is the prosecution ready to present its first witness?
36496,Hoyt,180," We are, Your Honor. Call Officer Matt Vogel to the stand."
36497,Bailiff,180, Call Matt Vogel.
36498,Hoyt,180, So they were just standing there?
36499,Voleg,180, Yes.
36500,Hoyt,180, Did one of them have a video camera?
36501,Vogel,180, Yes.
36502,Hoyt,180," Your Honor, with the court's permission, we would like to play back that video
        and enter it into evidence as Exhibit A."
36503,Vandelay,180, Proceed.
36504,Victim,180, Don't shoot.
36505,Jerry,180," Well, there goes the money for the lipo."
36506,Elaine,180," See, the great thing about robbing a fat guy is it's an easy getaway. They
        can't really chase ya!"
36507,George,180, He's actually doing him a favor. It's less money for him to buy food.
36508,[Witness,180, the victim of the robbery]
36509,Hoyt,180, So they just stood there and did nothing?
36510,Victim,180," Yeah, nothing. Nothing!"
36511,Hoyt,180, No further questions.
36512,George,180," Hey! Great plane! Thanks a lot. Piece of junk. You know you almost got us
        killed!"
36513,Hoyt,180, Call Mabel Choate to the stand.
36514,Bailiff,180, Call Mabel Choate.
36515,Chiles,180," Your Honor. I most strenuously and vigorously object to this witness. She was
        not present at the time of "
36516,Hoyt,180," Your Honor, the prosecution has gone to great lengths and considerable cost to
        find these character witnesses.It is imperative that we establish this is not merely an
        isolated incident. It's part of a pattern of anti-social behavior that's been going on for
        years."
36517,Vandelay,180, Objection overruled. I'll hear the witness.
36518,Hoyt,180," Now, Mrs. Choate, would you please tell the court what happen the evening of
        January 4th."
36519,Choate,180," Well, I was in Snitzer's Bakery when I got accosted by that man."
36520,Hoyt,180, Let the record show that she is pointing at Mr. Seinfeld.
36521,Hoyt,180, What did he want?
36522,Choate,180, My marble rye.
36523,Hoyt,180, Your marble rye?
36524,Choate,180," I got the last one. He kept persisting, and I said no."
36525,Hoyt,180, And then you left the bakery.
36526,Choate,180, That's right.
36527,Hoyt,180," But it didn't end there, did it, Mrs. Choate?"
36528,Choate,180, Oh no.
36529,Jerry,180, Gimme that rye.
36530,Choate,180, Stop it.
36531,Jerry,180, I want that rye lady.
36532,Choate,180, Help - someone help.
36533,Jerry,180," Shut up, you old bag!"
36534,Hoyt,180, No further questions.
36535,Hoyt,180, I call Marla Penny to the stand.
36536,Bailiff,180, Call Marla Penny.
36537,Jerry,180, The virgin!
36538,Hoyt,180, And what was your connection to the defendants?
36539,Penny,180, I dated Mr. Seinfeld for several weeks in the autumn of 1992.
36540,Hoyt,180," Then on the evening of October 28, there was an abrupt end to that relationship.
        Tell us what happened."
36541,Penny,180, It's rather difficult to talk about.
36542,Hoyt,180, It's alright. Take your time.
36543,Penny,180," Well, I became aware of a -"
36544,Hoyt,180, A what?
36545,Penny,180," A, uh -"
36546,Hoyt,180, Yes?
36547,Penny,180, A contest.
36548,Hoyt,180, Contest? 
36549,Penny,180, Yes.
36550,Hoyt,180, What was the nature of the contest?
36551,Penny,180," Oh please, I can't."
36552,Hoyt,180, It's okay.
36553,Penny,180, The four of them made a wager to see if they could -
36554,Hoyt,180, Yes?
36555,Penny,180, To see who could go the longest without gratifying themselves.
36556,Peterman,180, For the love of God!
36557,Penny,180," It was horrible, horrible!"
36558,Hoyt,180, Call Donald Sanger to the stand.
36559,Jerry,180, Who the hell is that?
36560,Mr. Sanger,180," Come on Donald, you're doing fine."
36561,George,180, The Bubble Boy!
36562,Chiles,180, Bubble Boy?
36563,Jerry,180," That's right, the Bubble Boy."
36564,Chiles,180, What's a Bubble Boy?
36565,Jerry,180, He's a boy who lives in a bubble.
36566,Bubble Boy,180, What the hell are all you looking at?
36567,Hoyt,180," So Donald, would you please tell the court about the incident that occurred in
        your house, October 7th, 1992."
36568,Bubble Boy,180," Well, Jerry Seinfeld was supposed to come to my house, but his friend
        Costanza showed up instead, so I challenged him to a game of Trivial Pursuit."
36569,George,180, Who invaded Spain in the Eighth Century?
36570,Bubble Boy,180, That's a joke - the Moors.
36571,George,180," Oh no - I'm so sorry, it's the Moops. The correct answer is the Moops."
36572,Bubble Boy,180," Moops? Let me see that. That's not Moops, you jerk. It's Moors. It's a
        misprint."
36573,George,180," Sorry, the card says Moops."
36574,Bubble Boy,180, It doesn't matter. It's Moors - there's no Moops.
36575,George,180, It's Moops.
36576,Bubble Boy,180, Moors!
36577,George,180, Moops!
36578,George,180, Help! Someone!
36579,Bubble Boy,180," There's no Moops, you idiot."
36580,Susan,180, Stop it! Let go of him!
36581,Mrs. Sanger,180," Donald, stop it. No. Donald, stop it."
36582,George,180, It was Moops.
36583,Bubble Boy,180, Moors.
36584,[Witness,180," the lady Kramer gave a defective wheelchair to in ""The Handicapped
        Spot""]"
36585,Hoyt,180," So Mr. Costanza parked in a handicapped spot, and as a result you got in an
        accident, and your wheelchair was destroyed?"
36586,Lady,180, That's right.
36587,Hoyt,180, And then Mr. Kramer gave you a used wheelchair?
36588,Lady,180, That's right.
36589,[Witness,180," Dr. Wilcox, the doctor on duty when Susan died]"
36590,Hoyt,180, So you were the doctor on duty the night Susan Ross died?
36591,Wilcox,180," Yes, that's right. It was May 16, 1996. I'll never forget it."
36592,Hoyt,180," So you broke the news to Mr. Costanza? Could you tell the court, please, what his
        reaction was?"
36593,Wilcox,180, I would describe it as restrained jubilation.
36594,Mr. Ross,180, Murderer!
36595,Mrs. Ross,180, He killed our daughter! He knew those envelopes were toxic!
36596,Vandelay,180, Order in this court!
36597,Hoyt,180, Call Sidra Holland to the stand.
36598,Chiles,180," Whew! Look at this one, she fine. You dated her?"
36599,Hoyt,180, So you met Jerry Seinfeld in a health club sometime in 1993?
36600,Sidra,180, Yes.
36601,Hoyt,180, And you also met Miss Benes in that same health club?
36602,Sidra,180," Yes, that's true."
36603,Hoyt,180, Would you describe the circumstances of that meeting.
36604,Sidra,180," We were in the sauna, making chit-chat."
36605,Sidra,180," You know, I've seen you around the club. My name's Sidra. This is Marcie."
36606,Elaine,180," Oh, hi, I'm Elaine."
36607,Hoyt,180," So, she pretended to trip, and she fell into your breasts?"
36608,Sidra,180, Yes.
36609,Hoyt,180, Why would she do something like that?
36610,Sidra,180, Because he sent her in there to find out if they were real.
36611,[Witness,180," Joe Bookman, library cop]"
36612,Hoyt,180, State your name.
36613,Bookman,180," Bookman, Joe Bookman."
36614,Hoyt,180, And what's your occupation?
36615,Bookman,180, I'm a library cop.
36616,Hoyt,180, What does a library cop do?
36617,Bookman,180, We chase down library delinquents.
36618,Hoyt,180, Anyone in this room ever delinquent?
36619,Bookman,180," Yeah, he was. Right over there - Seinfeld."
36620,Hoyt,180, How long was his book overdue?
36621,Bookman,180, 25 years. We don't call them delinquent after that long.
36622,Hoyt,180, What do you call them?
36623,Bookman,180, Criminals.
36624,[Witness,180, George's old girlfriend]
36625,Hoyt,180, So you and Mr. Costanza were dating.
36626,Woman,180, Yes.
36627,Hoyt,180, And then what happened?
36628,Woman,180," Well, I invited him to attend my son's birthday party and -"
36629,George,180, Fire! Get out of the way!
36630,[Witness,180, parking lot security guard]
36631,Guard,180," At the time, I was employed as a security guard in the parking lot at the Garden
        Valley Shopping Mall."
36632,Jerry,180, Why would I do it unless I was in mortal danger? I know it's against the law.
36633,Guard,180, I don't know.
36634,Jerry,180, Because I could get uromycitisis poisoning and die - that's why.
36635,Hoyt,180," Uromycitisis! I wonder if they're having any trouble controlling themselves
        during this trial? Perhaps these two "
36636,Chiles,180," Objection, Your Honor! This is completely inappropriate! My clients' medical
        condition is not on trial here! "
36637,Vandelay,180," Sit down, Mr. Chiles."
36638,[Witness,180, Police Detective]
36639,Hoyt,180," Alright, Detective, then what happened?"
36640,Detective,180," We got a tip that a lot of prostitutes had been turning tricks in the
        parking lot."
36641,Pro,180, You just cost me some money.
36642,Kramer,180," Cool it, lady. Cool it. Cool it, lady. Cool it."
36643,Police,180, Police officers - freeze right there!
36644,Hoyt,180," So Cosmo Kramer was, in fact, a pimp."
36645,[Witness,180, the low-talker]
36646,Hoyt,180, So you asked Mr. Seinfeld if he would wear your puffy shirt on the Today Show?
36647,Hoyt,180, Excuse me?
36648,Chiles,180," Uh, excuse me, Your Honor, but what is the point of this testimony? This
        woman's a low-talker. I can't hear "
36649,[Witness,180, George Steinbrenner]
36650,Hoyt,180, Call George Steinbrenner to the stand.
36651,Bailiff,180, Call George Steinbrenner.
36652,Hoyt,180, So George Costanza came to work for you in May of 1994?
36653,Steinbrenner,180," Yes, that's right, he was good kid - a lovely boy. Shared his calzone
        with me - that was a heck of a sandwich, wasn't it, Georgie?"
36654,George,180," Yes, sir, that was a good sandwich, sir."
36655,Steinbrenner,180, He had one little problem though.
36656,Hoyt,180, What was that?
36657,Steinbrenner,180, He was a communist. Thick as they come. Like a big juicy steak.
36658,Frank,180, How could you give twelve million dollars to Hideki Irabu?!
36659,Vandeley,180, Order!
36660,[Witness,180," Man from ""The Little Jerry""]"
36661,Hoyt,180, Cock fighting?
36662,Witness,180, Cock fighting.
36663,[Witness,180," Pharmacist from ""The Sponge""]"
36664,Pharmacist,180," Sponges. I don't mean the kind you clean your tub with. They're for sex.
        Said she needed a whole case of "
36665,[Witness,180, Elaine's old boyfriend]
36666,Man,180, She exposed her nipple.
36667,[Witness,180," Mr. Pitt from ""The Diplomat's Club""]"
36668,Hoyt,180, How did she try to kill you?
36669,Pitt,180, She tried to smother me with a pillow.
36670,Hoyt,180, Call Yev Kassem to the stand.
36671,Bailiff,180, Call Yev Kassem.
36672,Jerry,180, Who?
36673,Elaine,180, The Soup Nazi!
36674,Chiles,180, Soup Nazi? You people have a little pet name for everybody.
36675,Hoyt,180, State your name.
36676,Soup Nazi,180, Yev Kassem.
36677,Hoyt,180, Could you spell that?
36678,Soup Nazi,180, No! Next question.
36679,Hoyt,180, How do you know the defendants?
36680,Soup Nazi,180, They used to come to my restaurant.
36681,George,180, Medium turkey chili.
36682,Jerry,180, Medium crab bisque.
36683,George,180, I didn't get any bread.
36684,Jerry,180, Just forget it. Let it go.
36685,George,180," Um, excuse me, I think you forgot my bread."
36686,Soup Nazi,180, You want bread?
36687,George,180," Yes, please."
36688,Soup Nazi,180, Three dollars!
36689,George,180, What?
36690,Soup Nazi,180, No soup for you!
36691,Soup Nazi,180," But the idiot clowns did not know how to order. I banned that one - the
        woman - for a year. Then one day, "
36692,Elaine,180," Five cups chopped porcini mushrooms. Half a cup of olive oil. Three pounds
        celery."
36693,Soup Nazi,180, That's my recipe for wild mushroom.
36694,Elaine,180," You're through, Soup Nazi. Pack it up. No more soup for you. Next!"
36695,Soup Nazi,180," She published my recipes. I had to close the store, move to Argentina. She
        ruined my business!"
36696,Elaine,180, Soup's not all that good anyway.
36697,Soup Nazi,180, What did you say?!
36698,Hoyt,180, The state calls Mr. Babu Bhatt to the stand.
36699,Jerry,180, How did they find Babu?
36700,Elaine,180, I thought he was deported.
36701,Hoyt,180," You came a long way to be here today, haven't you?"
36702,Babu,180," Yes, all the way from Pakistan."
36703,Hoyt,180, And what's your connection to the defendant?
36704,Babu,180," I owned a restaurant. Seinfeld told me to change the menu to Pakistani. But
        nobody came! There were no people."
36705,Hoyt,180, And then what happened?
36706,Babu,180," Then, he got me an apartment in his building. But they mixed up the mail. And I
        never got my immigration renewal papers. So they deported me. It's all his fault. Him. And
        the woman. But they did not care. They're totally indifferent. All they do is mock me,
        just like they did the fat fellow. All the time. Mocking, mocking, mocking, mocking,
        mocking. All the time! Now it is Babu's turn to mock. Finally I will have some justice.
        Send them away! Send them all away! Lock them up forever! They are not human. Very bad!
        Very, very, very bad!"
36707,Rivera,180," Hi everybody, I'm Geraldo Rivera and welcome to this special edition of Rivera
        Live. Well, arguments in the "
36708,Wells,180," Geraldo, just a few minutes ago, the jury asked to see the video tape."
36709,Rivera,180," That's the one where they are overheard making sarcastic remarks during the
        robbery."
36710,Wells,180," Yes, it's a very incriminating piece of evidence. But I must tell you, Geraldo,
        this courtroom and everyone who has attended this trial is still reeling from the endless
        parade of witness who have come forth so enthusiastically to testify against these four
        seemingly ordinary people. One even had the feeling that if Judge Vandelay didn't finally
        put a stop to it, it could've gone on for months."
36711,Rivera,180," Jane, whose testimony do you think resonated most strongly with this jury?"
36712,Wells,180," That is so hard to say. Certainly there's the doctor with the poison
        invitations. The Bubble Boy was an extremely sympathetic and tragic figure. And that
        bizarre contest certainly didn't sit well with this small town jury.There's the woman they
        sold the defective wheelchair to, the deported Pakistani restaurateur. Geraldo, it just
        went on, "
36713,Rivera,180, And so we wait.
36714,Jerry,180, Do they make you wear uniforms in prison?
36715,Elaine,180, I think so.
36716,Jerry,180, It's not that bright orange one is it?
36717,Elaine,180," I hope it's not that one, because I cannot wear orange."
36718,Kramer,180," Will you stop worrying? Jackie's going to get us off. He never loses. How about
        when he asked that cop "
36719,Estelle,180," Sorry to bother you, Judge."
36720,Vandelay,180, How did you get in here?
36721,Estelle,180," Please, if he's found guilty, please be kind to him. He's a good boy."
36722,Vandelay,180, This is highly irregular.
36723,Estelle,180," Well, maybe there's something I can do for you."
36724,Vandelay,180, What do you mean?
36725,Estelle,180, You know
36726,Sidra,180," Oh, Jackie, you're so articulate."
36727,Jackie,180," We have plenty of time, too. This jury could be out for days."
36728,Jackie,180, Hello? Damn. They're ready.
36729,Jerry,180," Hey Elaine, what was it you were about to say to me on the plane when it was
        going down?"
36730,Elaine,180, I've always loved ... United Airlines.
36731,Kramer,180, I think it's going to be okay - that girl just smiled at me.
36732,Jerry,180, Maybe because she knows you're going to jail.
36733,Bailiff,180, All rise.
36734,Vandelay,180," Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, have you reached a verdict?"
36735,Foreman,180," We have, Your Honor."
36736,Vandelay,180," Will the defendants please rise. And how do you find, with respect to the
        charge of criminal indifference?"
36737,Foreman,180, We find the defendants - guilty.
36738,Vandelay,180," Order! Order in this court, I will clear this room! I do not know how, or
        under what circumstances the four of you found each other, but your callous indifference
        and utter disregard for everything that is good and decent has rocked the very foundation
        upon which our society is built. I can think of nothing more fitting than for the four of
        youto spend a year removed from society so that you can contemplate the manner in which
        you have conducted yourselves. "
36739,George,180, You had to hop! You had to hop on the plane.
36740,Elaine,180," Puddy, don't wait for me."
36741,Puddy,180, Alright.
36742,Frank,180, We gotta get out of here. We want to beat the traffic.
36743,Sidra,180," Come on, Jackie. Let's go."
36744,Jerry,180, What?
36745,Chiles,180," Oh, and by the way, they're real, and they're spectacular."
36746,Jerry,180," Well, it's only a year. That's not so bad. We'll be out in a year, and then
        we'll be back"
36747,Kramer,180," Could be fun. Don't have to worry about your meals, or what you're going to do
        Saturday night. And they do shows. Yeah, we could put on a show - maybe ""Bye Bye
        Birdie"" or ""My Fair Lady"". Elaine, you could be Liza Doolittle."
36748,Elaine,180, Why don't you just blow it out your...
36749,Elaine,180," If I call Jill from prison, do you think that would make up for the other ones?"
36750,Jerry,180, Sure.
36751,Elaine,180, Cause you only get one call. The prison call is like the king of calls.
36752,Jerry,180, I think that would be a very nice gesture.
36753,Kramer,180," I got it - it's out! How about that, huh? Oh, boy, what a relief."
36754,Jerry,180," See now, to me, that button is in the worst possible spot."
36755,George,180, Really?
36756,Jerry,180," Oh yeah. The second button is the key button. It literally makes or breaks the
        shirt. Look at it, it's "
36757,George,180, Haven't we had this conversation before?
36758,Jerry,180, You think?
36759,George,180, I think we have.
36760,Jerry,180," Yeah, maybe we have."
36761,Jerry,180," So what is the deal with the yard? I mean when I was a kid my mother wanted me
        to play in the yard. But of "
36762,Prisoner 1,180, I am.
36763,Jerry,180," I'll talk slower. I'm kidding - I love Cellblock D. My friend George is in
        Cellblock D. What are you in for,sir?"
36764,Prisoner 2,180, Murder one.
36765,Jerry,180," Murder one? Oooooo, watch out everybody. Better be nice to you. I'm only kidding
        sir - lighten up. How about "
36766,Prisoner 3,180, Grand theft auto.
36767,Jerry,180, Grand theft auto - don't steal any of my jokes.
36768,Prisoner 3,180, You suck - I'm gonna cut you.
36769,Jerry,180," Hey, I don't come down to where you work, and knock the license plate out of
        your hand."
36770,Guard,180," Alright, Seinfeld, that's it. Let's go. Come on."
36771,Jerry,180," Alright, hey, you've been great! See you in the cafeteria."
