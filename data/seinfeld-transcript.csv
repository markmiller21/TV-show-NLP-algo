3,JERRY,1," You do of course try on, when you buy?",1
4,GEORGE,1," Yes, it was purple, I liked it, I don't actually recall               considering the buttons.",1
5,JERRY,1," Oh, you don't recall?",1
6,GEORGE,1," [pretends he's talking into a microphone] Uh, no, not at               this time.",1

8,WAITRESS,1," Mister Seinfeld. [she pours coffee in his cup] Mister               Costanza. [she wants to pour coffee, but George stops her]",1
9,GEORGE,1," Are, are you sure this is decaf? Where's the orange indicator?",1
10,JERRY,1," Can you relax, it's a cup of coffee, Claire is a professional               waitress.",1
11,GEORGE,1, How come you're not doin' the second show tomorrow?,1
12,JERRY,1," Well, there's this uh, woman might be comin' in.",1
13,GEORGE,1," Wait a second, wait a second, what coming in, what woman               is coming in?",1
14,JERRY,1," I told you about Laura, the girl I met in Michigan?",1
15,GEORGE,1," No, you didn't!",1
16,JERRY,1," I thought I told you about it, yes, she teaches political               science? I met her the night I did the show in Lansing...[looks               in the milk can] There's no milk in here, what...",1
17,GEORGE,1," Wait wait wait, what is she, [takes the milk can from Jerry               and puts it on the table] what is she like?",1
18,JERRY,1," Oh, she's really great. I mean, she's got like a real warmth               about her and she's really bright and really pretty and uh...the               conversation though, I mean, it was...talking with her is like talking               with you, but, ya know, obviously much better.",1
19,GEORGE,1," [with a big smile] So, ya know, what, what happened?",1
20,JERRY,1," Oh, nothing happened, ya know, but is was great.",1
21,GEORGE,1," Oh, nothing happened, but it was...",1
22,JERRY,1, Yeah.,1
23,GEORGE,1, This is great!,1
24,JERRY,1, Yeah.,1
25,GEORGE,1," So, ya know, she calls and says she wants to go out with               you tomorrow night? God bless! Devil you!",1
26,JERRY,1," Yeah, well...not exactly. I mean, she said, you know, she               called this morning and said she had to come in for a seminar and               maybe we'll get together. ",1
27,GEORGE,1," [whistles disapproving] Ho ho ho, ""Had to""? ""Had               to come in""?",1
28,JERRY,1," Yeah, but...",1
29,GEORGE,1," ""Had to come in"" and ""maybe we'll get together""?               ""Had to"" and ""Maybe""?",1
30,JERRY,1, Yeah!,1
31,JERRY,1," [indignant] What, are you serious...why, why did she call?",1
32,GEORGE,1," How do I know, maybe, ya know, maybe she wanted to be polite.             ",1
33,JERRY,1, To be polite? You are insane!,1
34,GEORGE,1," All right, all right, I didn't want to tell you this, you               wanna know why she called you?",1
35,JERRY,1, Yes!,1
36,GEORGE,1," You're a back-up, you're a second-line, a just-in-case,               a B-plan of contingency!",1
37,JERRY,1," Oh, I get it, this is about the button.",1
38,GEORGE,1," [The waitress(Claire) passes the table; George stops her               and writes something on his note-block] Claire, Claire, you're a               woman, right?",1
39,CLAIRE,1," What gave it away, George?",1
40,GEORGE,1," Uhm...I'd like to ask you...ask you to analyze a hypothetical               phone call, ya know, from a female point of view.",1
41,JERRY,1," [to George] Oh, come on now, what are you asking her? Now,               how is she gonna know?",1
42,GEORGE,1," [to Claire] Now, a woman calls me, all right? She says               she has to [makes some gestures to accent ""has to""] come               to New York on business...",1
43,JERRY,1, Oh you are beautiful! [ironically] ,1
44,GEORGE,1," and, and maybe [again some gestures] she'll see me when               she gets there, does this woman intend to spend time with me?",1
45,GEORGE,1, [to Claire] So why did she call?,1
46,CLAIRE,1, To be polite.,1
47,GEORGE,1," To be polite, I rest my case.",1
48,JERRY,1," Good. Did you have fun? You have no idea, what you're talking               about, now, come on, come with me [stands up], I, I gotta go get               my stuff out of the dryer anyway.",1

51,GEORGE,1," Come on, I'm tired.",1
52,GEORGE,1," [takes off his glasses and rubs his eyes; panics] Right,               I knew I felt something...! [Jerry is laughing, Claire walks away               with a smile]",1
53,[Scene,1," Laundry. Jerry and George are there; George is staring               at one of the dryers]",1
54,GEORGE,1," I need a break, Jerry, ya know, I gotta get out of the               city, I feel so cramped...",1
55,JERRY,1, And you didn't even hear how she sounded.,1
56,GEORGE,1, What?!,1
57,JERRY,1, Laura.,1
58,JERRY,1," Yeah, but how could you be so sure?",1
59,GEORGE,1," [gets up] 'Cause it's signals, Jerry [starts snapping his               fingers], it's signals! Don't you....all right. Did she even ask               you, what you were doin' tomorrow night, if you were busy?",1
60,JERRY,1, No.,1
61,GEORGE,1," She calls you today and she doesn't make a plan for tomorrow?               What is that? It's Saturday night!",1
62,JERRY,1, Yeah.,1
63,GEORGE,1," What is that? It's ridiculous! [Jerry bobs agreeingly]               You don't even know, what hotel she's staying at, you can't call               her. That's a signal, Jerry, that's a signal! [snaps his fingers               again] Signal!",1
64,JERRY,1, Maybe you're right.,1
65,GEORGE,1, Maybe I'm right? Of course I'm right.,1
66,JERRY,1," This is insane. You know, I don't even know where she's               staying! She, she's not gonna call me, this is unbelievable.",1
67,GEORGE,1," [puts an arm around Jerry and whispers] I know, I know.               [normal voice] Listen, your stuff has to be done by know, why don't               you just see if it's dried?",1
68,JERRY,1," No no no, don't interrupt the cycle. The machine is working,               it, it knows what it's doing, just let it finish.",1
69,GEORGE,1," You're gonna ""overdry"" it.",1
70,JERRY,1," You, you can't ""overdry"".",1
71,GEORGE,1, Why not?,1
72,GEORGE,1," [looks at the other persons in the laundry and says to               them pointing to Jerry] Any questions?",1

74,[Scene,1, Jerry's apartment. Jerry is watching TV],1
75,KRAMER,1, [enters] Are you up?,1
76,JERRY,1," [To Kramer] Yeah...[in the phone] Yeah, people do move!               Have you ever seen the big trucks out on the street? Yeah, no problem               [hangs up the phone].",1
77,KRAMER,1," Boy, the Mets blew it tonight, huh? ",1
78,JERRY,1," [upset] Ooohhhh, what are you doing? Kramer, it's a tape!               [actually I can't understand the name; maybe ""Kramer""               wasn't named ""Kramer"" in the pilot!] I taped the game,               it's one o'clock in the morning! I avoided human contact all night               to watch this.",1
79,KRAMER,1," Hey, I'm sorry, I...ya know, I, I thought you knew...[takes               two loaves of bread out of his pockets] You got any meat?",1
80,JERRY,1," [a little irritated] Meat? I don't, I don't know, go...hunt!               [Kramer walks to the refrigerator and sticks his head in] Well what,               what happened in the game anyway?",1
81,KRAMER,1," [still with his head in the refrigerator] What happened?               Well, they STUNK, that's what happened! [takes some meat from the               refrigerator and closes it] Ya know, I almost wound up going to               that game.",1
82,JERRY,1," [cynical] Yeah you almost went to the game. You haven't               been out of the building in ten years!",1
83,JERRY,1, No.,1
84,KRAMER,1," [glues the article back with his own saliva and puts the               magazine back on the table] When you're done, let me know.",1
85,JERRY,1," Yeah, yeah...you can have it tomorrow.",1
86,KRAMER,1, I thought I wasn't allowed to be in here this weekend.,1
87,JERRY,1," No, it's OK now, that, that girl is not comin' uh, I, I               misread the whole thing.",1
88,KRAMER,1, You want me to talk to her?,1
89,JERRY,1, I don't think so.,1
90,KRAMER,1," Oh, I can be very persuasive. Do you know that I was almost...               a lawyer. [shows with his fingers how close it was]",1
91,JERRY,1," That close, huh?",1
92,KRAMER,1," You better believe it. [The phone rings. Jerry picks it               up]",1
93,JERRY,1," Hello...Oh, hi, Laura.",1
94,KRAMER,1, Give me it...let me talk to her [continues this way].,1
95,JERRY,1," [gestures Kramer to shut up] No believe me, I'm always up               at this hour. How are you?...great...sure...What time does the plane               get in?...I got my friend George to take me...[Kramer suddenly notices               something in the Mets-game on TV]...",1
96,KRAMER,1, A SLIDE!...Wow!,1
97,[Scene,1," Jerry's apartment. Jerry and George enter, lifting a heavy               mattress]",1
98,JERRY,1," If my father was moving this he'd had to have a cigarette               in his mouth the whole way. [talks from now on like he has a cigarette               in his mouth] Have you got your end?...Your end's got to come down               first, easy now, drop it down...drop it down, your end's got to               come down.",1
99,GEORGE,1," Ya know, I can't believe you're bringin' in an extra bed               for woman, that wants to sleep with you. Why don't you bring in               an extra guy too? [sits down]",1
100,JERRY,1," [hands George a beer] Look, it's a very awkward situation,               I, I don't wanna be presumptuous.",1
101,GEORGE,1," All right, all right, one more time, one more time! What               was the EXACT phrasing of the request?",1
102,JERRY,1," All right, she said she couldn't find a decent hotel- room...",1
103,GEORGE,1, A decent hotel-room...,1
104,JERRY,1," Yeah, a decent hotel-room, would it be terribly inconvenient               if she stayed at my place.",1
105,JERRY,1," [cynical] This is the signal. Thank you, mister Signal,               where were you yesterday?",1
106,GEORGE,1," I think I was affected by the caffeine. [suddenly a dog               enters the apartment and jumps George at the couch] HO, HO, HO,               GOOD DOG [etc.]",1
107,KRAMER,1," [walks in behind the dog and closes the door] He really               likes you, George.",1
108,GEORGE,1," [ironically] Well, that's flattering. ",1
109,KRAMER,1," [the dog runs to the bathroom and apparently starts drinking               from the toilet] Oh, he's getting' a drink of water. [sees the mattress               on the floor] Is this for that girl?",1
110,JERRY,1, Yeah.,1
111,KRAMER,1, Why even give her an option?,1
112,GEORGE,1," Right, can we go? 'Cause I'm double-parked, I'm gonna get               a ticket.",1
113,JERRY,1," Yeah, OK. Oh, wait a second. Oh, I, I forgot to clean the               bathroom.",1
114,GEORGE,1, So what? That's good.,1
115,JERRY,1," Now, how could that be good?",1
116,JERRY,1, This is how you operate?,1
117,GEORGE,1," Yeah, I wish.",1
118,JERRY,1, Let me just wipe the sink.,1
119,KRAMER,1," [stands up from the couch and yells.] WHY EVEN GIVE HER               AN OPTION FOR? [Jerry walks to the bathroom and closes the door;               to George, while pointing to the mattress] It's unbelievable.",1
120,GEORGE,1, Yeah.,1
121,KRAMER,1, ...How's the real estate-business?,1
122,GEORGE,1,"...[surprised he asked] It's uh, not bad, it's comin' along...Why?               Did you need something.",1
123,KRAMER,1, Do you handle any of that commercial...real estate?,1
124,GEORGE,1," Well, I might be getting in to that.",1
125,KRAMER,1, [slaps George on the arm] You keep me posted!,1
126,GEORGE,1," I'm aware of you, all right, let's go [opens the bathroom               door], let's go! [Jerry and the dog come out] You're on stage in               25 minutes.",1
127,[Scene,1, Comedy club.],1
128,[Scene,1, Airport. Jerry and George are waiting for Laura],1
129,JERRY,1," Wouldn't it be great if you could ask a woman what she's               thinking?",1
130,GEORGE,1," What a world that would be, if you just could ask a woman               what she's thinkin'.",1
131,GEORGE,1," Listen, listen, don't get worked up, 'cause you're gonna               know the whole story the minute she steps off the plane.",1
132,JERRY,1, Really? How?,1
133,GEORGE,1, 'Cause it's all in the greeting. ,1
134,JERRY,1, Uh-huh.,1
135,GEORGE,1," All right, if she puts the bags down before she greets               you, that's a good sign.",1
136,JERRY,1, Right.,1
137,GEORGE,1," Ya know, anything in the, in the ""lip-area"" is               good.",1
138,JERRY,1," ""Lip-area"".",1
139,JERRY,1, Hug is definitely good.,1
140,GEORGE,1, Sure.,1
141,JERRY,1," Although what if it's one of those hugs where the shoulders               are touching, the hips are eight feet apart?",1
142,GEORGE,1," That's so brutal, I hate that.",1
143,JERRY,1, Ya know how they do that?,1
144,GEORGE,1," That's why, ya know, a shake is bad.",1
145,JERRY,1," Shake is bad, but what if it's the ""two-hander""?               The hand on the bottom, the hand on the top, the warm look in the               eyes?",1
146,GEORGE,1, Hand-sandwich.,1
147,JERRY,1, Right.,1
148,GEORGE,1," I see, well, that's open to interpretation. Because so               much depends on the layering and the quality of the wetness in the               eyes...[suddenly a woman approaches Jerry from behind and puts her               hands over Jerry's eyes]",1
149,LAURA,1, Guess who?,1
150,JERRY,1," Hey, hey.",1
151,LAURA and JERRY,1," Heeeey! [they take each others hands like they're               planning to do a folk dance; George is looking puzzled]",1
152,JERRY,1, It's good to see you.,1
153,LAURA,1, Hi.,1
154,JERRY,1, This is my friend George.,1
155,LAURA,1," [shakes George's hand] Hi, how nice to meet you.",1
156,GEORGE,1," Hi, how are you?",1
157,JERRY,1, This is Laura.,1
158,GEORGE,1," Laura, sure.",1
159,JERRY,1, [to Laura] I can't believe you're here.,1
160,GEORGE and JERRY,1," Ooh yeah, the bags, sure. [they pick up the bags]",1
161,LAURA,1," Oh, thank you.",1
162,JERRY,1," [privately to George] Now that was an interesting greeting,               did you notice that, George?",1
163,GEORGE,1," Yes, the ""surprise-blindfold-greeting"". That               wasn't in the manual, I don't know.",1
164,[Scene,1, Jerry's apartment. Jerry shows Laura the apartment],1
165,JERRY,1," So uh, what do ya think?",1
166,LAURA,1," Ooohhh, wow! This place isn't so bad.",1
167,JERRY,1," Yeah, it kind a motivates me to work on the road...So uh,               make yourself at home. [Laura sits down on the couch, takes off               her shoes and opens some buttons of her shirt] So uh, can I get               you anything? Uuhhh, bread, water...salad-dressing?",1
168,LAURA,1," [laughs] Actually uhm, do you have any wine?",1
169,LAURA,1," Oh, do, do you mind if I turn this down? [points to the               lamp]",1
170,JERRY,1," Uh, no, yeah, go right ahead. [she turns down the lamp]",1
171,JERRY,1," Uh, yeah, yeah, sure, why don't you stay? Yeah, uhm...What               is your, what is your schedule for tomorrow? Are you, are you doin'               anything?",1
172,LAURA,1," No, I'd love to do something, uh, I have my seminar in the               morning, then after that I'm right open.",1
173,JERRY,1, Really? What would you like to do?,1
174,LAURA,1," Well...now I know this sounds touristy, but I'd just love               to go on one of those five-hour-boat-rides around Manhattan.",1
175,JERRY,1," [doubtfully] Yeah, we could do that...why not, why not.               [pours the wine] I'm just, I'm really glad you're here. [the phone               rings; he picks it up] Yeah, hello...yes...yes, she is, hold on.               [to Laura] Uhm, it's for you.",1
176,LAURA,1," [she takes the phone] Hello?...Hi!...no no it was great,               right on time...no, I, I'm gonna stay here tomorrow...yes, yes it's               fine..no, we're goin' on a boat-ride...don't be silly...I'm not               gonna have this conversation...look I, I'll call you tomorrow...OK,               bye [she hangs up the phone]. Never get engaged.",1
177,JERRY,1, You're engaged?,1
178,LAURA,1," You, you really have no idea what it's like until you actually               do it and I'm on this emotional roller coaster.",1
179,JERRY,1, You're engaged? [still can't believe it],1
180,LAURA,1," Ya know, I can't believe it myself sometimes. You have to               start thinking in terms of ""we"", uh, it's a very stressful               situation.",1
181,JERRY,1, You're engaged! [like he's answering his own question],1
182,LAURA,1," Yeah...yeah, he's a great guy...",1

How does it...?               [imitates horn again] e-e-e-eeeehhhh, ""I don't think she likes               me""...The amazing thing is, that we still get women, don't               we. Men, I mean, men are with women. You see men with women. How               are men getting women, many people wonder. Let me tell you a little               bit about our organization. ""Where ever women are?"", we               have a man working on the situation right now. Now, he may not be               our best man, OK, we have a lot of areas to cover, but someone from               our staff is on the scene...That's why, I think, men get frustrated,               when we see women reading articles, like",1," ""Where to meet men?"".               We're here, we are everywhere.

6307,Jerry,29, Would you take a drink and let us smell you?,3
6308,Kramer,29, You can smell me without the drink.,3
6309,Elaine,29," I suspect that this guy I'm seeing might be drinking but               I can't smell it. ",3
6310,Kramer,29," Okay, well what am I drinking? What do you got?",3
6311,Jerry,29," I got a bottle of scotch my uncle gave me. It's Hennigans.               It's been here for two years. I've been using it as a paint thinner.",3
6312,Kramer,29, All right.,3
6313,Jerry,29, I don't smell anything.,3
6314,Elaine,29, Maybe we're too close to the bottle.,3
6315,Jerry,29, Yeah.,3
6316,George,29, (over the speaker) It's George.,3
6317,Jerry,29, Come on up.,3
6318,Kramer,29," That is *damn* good scotch. I could do a commercial for               this stuff. Mmmmm, boy that Hennigans goes down smooth. And afterwords               you don't even smell. That's right folks. I just had three shots               of Hennigans and I don't smell. Imagine, you can walk around drunk               all day. That's Hennigans, the no-smell, no-tell scotch.",3
6319,George,29, Hello everybody.,3
6320,Kramer,29," Hey. (snuggling really close to George) I'm going to tell               you what I think. I know you don't care what I think, but I'm going               to tell you. I think that you are terrific. ",3
6321,George,29, (uncomfortablly) Thank you.,3
6322,Elaine,29, Hey what's that?,3
6323,George,29, It's an early Christmas present.,3
6324,Elaine,29, Christmas present? For who?,3
6325,George,29, For you.,3
6326,Elaine,29, *gasp* (pushing George) Get out of here. ,3
6327,Kramer,29," Say you got a big job interview, and you're a little nervous.               Well throw back a couple shots of Hennigans and you'll be as loose               as a goose and ready to roll in no time. And because it's odorless,               why, it will be our little secret. (singing) h-e-double n...",3
6328,Jerry,29, Kramer. Yeah that'll do.,3
6329,Elaine,29," (opening the present) Oh George, this is beautiful. Is               this cashmere?",3
6330,George,29, Of course it's cashmere.,3
6331,Elaine,29," Oh, I love cashmere. ",3
6332,George,29, Well who doesn't.,3
6333,Elaine,29," My, George this must have cost a fortune.",3
6334,George,29," Ahh, money.",3
6335,Elaine,29," Jerry, how could you let him spend so much money?",3
6336,Jerry,29," I tried to stop him. I couldn't. He just wants to make people               happy.",3
6337,Elaine,29," George, this is one of the nicest things anyone has ever               given me.",3
6338,George,29," Well good, good. Take it off you're going to wear it out               already. It's for special occasions this thing.",3
6339,Kramer,29, What's that red dot on your sweater?,3
6340,Elaine,29, What?,3
6341,George,29, Just take it off. I'm getting hot just looking at it.,3
6342,Elaine,29, Uhh. This. It's like a red dot.,3
6343,George,29," What red dot? What are you talking about? Jerry come here               for a second. Do you see anything here?",3
6344,Jerry,29," (uncomfortable) Uh, I don't know. Uh, I don't know.",3
6345,Elaine,29, What don't you know?,3
6346,Jerry,29, I don't know.,3
6347,Elaine,29, Well do you see it or don't you?,3
6348,Jerry,29, Ahem. Say that again?,3
6349,Elaine,29, Do you see it or don't you?,3
6350,Jerry,29, Do I see it... or don't I? That's the question.,3
6351,Jerry,29, Now what did you ask me again.,3
6352,Elaine,29, You're still here. You're a dynamo.,3
6353,George,29, I can't believe I get paid for this.,3
6354,Elaine,29, I'll see you tomorrow.,3
6355,George,29, How you doing?,3
6356,Cleaning lady,29, Hello.,3
6357,Jerry,29," You had sex with the cleaning woman on your desk? Who are               you, how did you do that?",3
6358,George,29," Hennigans. I was there sitting in the office and the cleaning               woman comes in. I've always been attracted to cleaning women. Cleaning               women, chambermaids.",3
6359,Jerry,29," Yeah chambermaids, I'm attracted to them too.",3
6360,George,29, Why is that?,3
6361,Jerry,29, It's a woman in your room. So go ahead.,3
6362,George,29," So she starts vaccuming, back and forth, back and forth,               her hips swivelling, her breasts, uh... (trying to think of a word)",3
6363,Jerry,29, Convulsing?,3
6364,George,29, Convulsing?,3
6365,Jerry,29," I don't know, I'm trying to help you.",3
6366,George,29, Then I asked her if she wanted a drink.,3
6367,Jerry,29, You don't drink.,3
6368,George,29," I know but I couldn't think of anything else to say to               her.",3
6369,Jerry,29, So you started drinking.,3
6370,George,29," So we started drinking, and I'll tell you I don't know               if it was the alcohol or the ammonia, but the next think I knew               she was mopping the floor with me.",3
6371,Jerry,29, So how was it?,3
6372,George,29," Well the sex was okay, but I threw up from the Hennigans.",3
6373,Jerry,29, Good thing the cleaning lady was there.,3
6374,Elaine,29, Dick was fired.,3
6375,Jerry,29," You mean to tell me if I had put that drink six inches over               to the right, and none of this would have happened.",3
6376,Elaine,29," You knew he was an alcoholic. Why'd you put the drink down               at all?",3
6377,Jerry,29, What are you saying?,3
6378,Elaine,29, I'm not saying anything.,3
6379,Jerry,29, You're saying something.,3
6380,Elaine,29, What could I be saying?,3
6381,Jerry,29, Well you're not saying nothing you must be saying something.,3
6382,Elaine,29, If I was saying something I would have said it.,3
6383,Jerry,29, Well why don't you say it?,3
6384,Elaine,29, I said it.,3
6385,Jerry,29, What did you say?,3
6386,Elaine,29, Nothing. It's exhausting being with you.,3
6387,Jerry,29, Yeah?,3
6388,George,29, (over the speaker) It's George.,3
6389,Jerry,29, Come on up.,3
6390,Elaine,29," Hey, let me ask you something something. Did George buy               that sweater knowing the red dot was on it because it was cheaper?               (Jerry is unconfortable) Ooookay, you just gave me the answer.",3
6391,Jerry,29, No I didn't.,3
6392,Elaine,29," Yes you did, yes you did. I saw your expression.",3
6393,Jerry,29," I didn't have an expression. I have a deviated septum. I               have to open my mouth sometimes to breathe.",3
6394,Elaine,29, How much did he save?,3
6395,Jerry,29," Frankly I am shocked that you would ask such a question               (Elaine sticking out her tongue like she isn't buying a word of               it) of me, that you would think - the only surprise is how you could               even think of that. That's what you were seeing.",3
6396,George,29," I have to talk to Elaine. This cleaing lady is turning               the screws on me. She's pushing for this whole relationship thing.               She keeps calling me, threatening to go to the boss with this thing,               I could lose my job, I gotta do something to keep her quiet.",3
6397,Jerry,29," Elaine is in the bathroom. She's wise to whole red dot thing.               She's asking me all kinds of questions.",3
6398,George,29, Did you tell her anything?,3
6399,Jerry,29, No.,3
6400,George,29, Do you swear?,3
6401,Jerry,29, I'm not swearing. I don't want to swear.,3
6402,George,29, Oh you told her didn't you.,3
6403,Jerry,29, No.,3
6404,Elaine,29," Hey George, did you buy that sweater knowing that red dot               was on it because you could get it at a discount?",3
6405,George,29, What? Did I what?,3
6406,Elaine,29, You did didn't you.,3
6407,George,29," Elaine, I'm, I'm shocked. I'm shocked. Here I go out in               the spirit of the season (Elaine looking like she's not buying a               word of it) and spend all my savings to buy you the most beautiful               Christmas sweater I have ever seen to show my appreciation to you               at Christmas and this is the thanks that I get at Christmas.",3
6408,Elaine,29, Well Jerry told me that you did.,3
6409,George,29," You told her? How could you tell her? I told you not to               say anything.",3
6410,Jerry,29, I didn't tell her you stupid idiot. She tricked you.,3
6411,George,29," Elaine you don't understand. I had 103 temperature when               I bought that sweater. I was so dizzy I was seeing red dots everywhere.               I thought everything in the store had a red dot on it. I couldn't               distinguish one red dot from another. I couldn't afford anything.               I have nothing. I haven't worked for a really long time. (Jerry               is standing right behind George. Jerry takes out a hankerchief and               starts fake-crying in it.) I mean look, I have no clothes, look               at what I'm wearing. It's just a little red dot.",3
6412,George,29, This is for you.,3
6413,Lady,29," Oh, Georgie, you bought this for me? Oh I knew you cared               for me.",3
6414,George,29," As you care for me. Which is why it is very important that               you never breathe a word of this to anyone about the... you know.               What, with Clarence Thomas and everything. ",3
6415,Lady,29," Okay, okay, can I open it now?",3
6416,George,29," Yes of course go ahead. My guess is you're going to like               this very much.",3
6417,Lady,29, Oh! Is that cashmere? ,3
6418,George,29, Of course it's cashemere.,3
6419,Lady,29, A cashmere sweater. Oh Georgie Porgie!,3
6420,George,29, Just a little something for Christmas.,3
6421,Lady,29," When I was a little girl in Panama, a rich American came               to our town and he was wearing the softest most beautiful sweater.               I said to him, ""what do you call this most beautiful fabric?"",               and he said ""they call it cashmere"". I repeated the words               ""cashmere, cashmere"". I asked if I could have it, and               he said ""No. Get away from me."" Then he started walk away.               But I grabbed onto his leg screaming for him to give me the sweater               and he dragged me through the street. And then he kicked at me with               the other foot and threw some change at me. Oh, but I didn't want               the change Georgie. I wanted the cashmere.",3
6422,George,29," I had a feeling you would like it. No, don't try it on               now, try it on later.",3
6423,Lady,29," Wow, look at this. It feels so beautiful.",3
6424,George,29, Take it off. You're going to ruin it.,3
6425,Lady,29, (noticing the dot) What's this?,3
6426,Jerry,29," I was in the men's room the other day and they had the hand               blower, instead of the paper towels, you know this thing. I like               the hand blower I have to say. It takes a little bit longer, but               I feel when you're in a room with a revolting stench you want to               spend as much time as you can.",3
6427,Dick,29, The only stench is comming from you.,3
6428,Audience,29, Oooooh.,3
6429,Jerry,29," Oh, wait a second, I believe we have a heckler ladies and               gentlemen. Hey Dick I don't know what your problem is. It's not               my fault you're back on the wagon.",3
6430,Dick,29, It's off the wagon.,3
6431,Jerry,29," In the old days how do you think they got the alcohol from               town to town?",3
6432,Dick,29, I don't know.,3
6433,Jerry,29," On the wagon. Don't you think they broke into a couple of               those bottles along the way?",3
6434,Dick,29, You can't drink on a wagon it would be too bumpy.,3
6435,Jerry,29, They had smooth trails. What about the Cumberland Gap?,3
6436,Dick,29, What the hell do you know about wagons?,3
6437,Jerry,29, I know enough not to get on them.,3
6438,Boss,29," I'm going to get right to the point. It has come to my attention               that you and the cleaning woman have engaged in sexual intercourse               on the desk in your office. Is that correct?",3
6439,George,29, Who said that?,3
6440,Boss,29, She did.,3
6441,George,29," Was that wrong? Should I have not done that? I tell you               I gotta plead ingnorance on this thing because if anyone had said               anything to me at all when I first started here that that sort of               thing was frouned upon, you know, cause I've worked in a lot of               offices and I tell you peope do that all the time.",3
6442,Boss,29, You're fired.,3
6443,George,29, Well you didn't have to say it like that.,3
6444,Boss,29, I want you out of here by the end of the day.,3
6445,George,29," What about the whole Christmas spirit thing? Any flexability               there?",3
6446,Boss,29," Nah. Wait, wait, she wanted me to give you this.",3
6447,Elaine,29, You had sex on your desk with the cleaning woman.,3
6448,George,29, You never had sex in the office before?,3
6449,Elaine,29, No. I once made out with someone but that was it.,3
6450,George,29, Alright so you made out with someone.,3
6451,Elaine,29, Well that's not sex.,3
6452,George,29, Kissing is sex.,3
6453,Elaine,29, Kissing is not sex.,3
6454,Jerry,29, George?,3
6455,George,29, Jerry.,3
6456,Elaine,29," Hey, did Jerry leave that drink next to Dick's on purpose?",3
6457,George,29, No.,3
6458,Jerry,29, George?,3
6459,George,29, Over here.,3
6460,Elaine,29, What are you doing here?,3
6461,Jerry,29, I'm taking the kid out to dinner to chear him up.,3
6462,Elaine,29, Hey Jerry when do you consider that sex has taken place?,3
6463,Jerry,29, I would say when the nipple makes its first appearance.,3
6464,Elaine,29," So, George told me that you left the drink next to Dick's               on purpose.",3
6465,Jerry,29, Nice try. So guess who heckled me at the club last night.,3
6466,Dick,29, Merry Christmas.,3
6467,Elaine,29, Oh my god that's Dick. It's Cape Fear.,3
6468,George,29," Hide, hide under the desk.",3
6469,Elaine,29," Ow, ow move over.",3
6470,Jerry,29, Get off of me.,3
6471,Elaine,29, I've got no room.,3
6472,Dick,29, Is that cashmere?,3
6473,George,29, Of course it's cashmere.,3
6474,Dick,29, (noticing the dot) What's this?,3
6475,Jerry,29," But in a way, I think I inadvertantly turned this guy into               an alcoholic. I hate being around alcoholics because they're either               telling you how much they love you or how much they hate you. And               those are the two statements that scare me the most. But I think               he's okay now because I have no idea how he feels about me. He's               finally off the wagon.",3

7054,JERRY,32, No.,3
7055,GINA,32, Then kiss me.,3
7056,JERRY,32, Here?,3
7057,GINA,32," Yes, right here.",3
7058,JERRY,32, Is this the proper venue?,3
7059,GINA,32, You donÂ’t want to?,3
7060,JERRY,32," No, no, I want to. I, I very much want to. I, I desire to. I,         I pine to. ",3
7061,GINA,32, Then kiss me right in front of him.,3
7062,JERRY,32, I canÂ’t. What if he wakes up?,3
7063,GINA,32," A man is lying here unconscious and youÂ’re afraid of him?         What kind of a man are you? ",3
7064,JERRY,32," A man who respects a good comma. If it was one of those in and         out comas, maybe. But when a guyÂ’s got a coma going like this Â…         you donÂ’t want to mess with it.",3
7065,KRAMER,32, Hey.,3
7066,JERRY,32, Hey. ,3
7067,KRAMER,32, Did you hear about Martin?,3
7068,JERRY,32," Yeah, I heard.",3
7069,KRAMER,32, I canÂ’t believe heÂ’s in a coma.,3
7070,KRAMER,32," HeÂ’s got my vacuum cleaner. You know I loaned it to him.         He never returned it. The carpets are filthy. What am I going to do? ",3
7071,JERRY,32, Who told you about Martin?,3
7072,KRAMER,32, Newman! HeÂ’s good friends with him. ,3
7073,KRAMER,32," HeÂ’s got all of my attachments, you know. ",3
7074,JERRY,32," Hey, let me ask you something. How long do you have to wait for         a guy to come out of a coma before you can ask his ex-girlfriend out?",3
7075,KRAMER,32," What, Gina? Why wait? Why not just call Doctor Kavorkian? ",3
7076,JERRY,32," You know I donÂ’t get that whole suicide machine. ThereÂ’s         no tall buildings where these people live? They canÂ’t wrap their         lips around a revolver like a normal person? ",3
7077,KRAMER,32, So whatÂ’s going on between you and Gina?,3
7078,JERRY,32," Well, I went with her to the hospital last night.",3
7079,KRAMER,32," Uh, uh.",3
7080,JERRY,32," So weÂ’re in the room and sheÂ’s trying to get me to kiss         her right in front of him. ",3
7081,KRAMER,32," Uh, uh, you see thatÂ’s the great thing about Mediterranean         women. All right, so what did you do?",3
7082,JERRY,32, Nothing.,3
7083,KRAMER,32," Ah, what kind of a man are you? The guy is unconscious in a coma         and you donÂ’t have the guts to kiss his girlfriend? ",3
7084,JERRY,32, I didnÂ’t know what the coma etiquette was. ,3
7085,KRAMER,32," There is no coma etiquette. You see thatÂ’s the beauty of         the coma, man. It doesnÂ’t matter what you do around it. ",3
7086,JERRY,32," So youÂ’re saying, his girl, his car, his clothes, itÂ’s         all up for grabs. You can just loot the coma victim.",3
7087,KRAMER,32," IÂ’d give him 24 hours to get out of it. They canÂ’t         get out of it in 24 hours, itÂ’s a land rush.",3
7088,JERRY,32," So if the coma victim wakes up in a month, heÂ’s thrilled,         he got out of the coma. He goes home, thereÂ’s nothing left?",3
7089,KRAMER,32," NOTHING LEFT! ThatÂ’s why IÂ’m trying to get that vacuum         cleaner. Because somebodyÂ’s going to grab it. ",3
7090,RULA,32, MartinÂ’s spirit came to you as a warning.,3
7091,ELAINE,32, Why would he come to George?,3
7092,RULA,32," Because George has heightened extra sensory perception. FAYGY GET         YOUR FINGER OUT OF YOUR NOSE.",3
7093,GEORGE,32, I knew it. I always felt different. ,3
7094,RULA,32, You are. Some coffee cake? ,3
7095,GEORGE,32, Drakes? ,3
7096,RULA,32, Yes.,3
7097,GEORGE,32, Did you buy this for me?,3
7098,RULA,32," No, why?",3
7099,GEORGE,32," Ha, because I love DrakeÂ’s Coffee Cake.",3
7100,RULA,32, Maybe I did.,3
7101,ELAINE,32, Take it away.,3
7102,GEORGE,32, She hasnÂ’t eaten in two days.,3
7103,RULA,32, WhoÂ’s Pauline?,3
7104,GEORGE,32," Pauline? . . . Wait a minute. I got it. My brother once impregnated         a woman named Pauline.",3
7105,RULA,32, Do you think about her?,3
7106,GEORGE,32, When I hear her name mentioned.,3
7107,RULA,32, Cut these with your left hand.,3
7108,GEORGE,32," There was a woman, Audrey. She had a very big nose.",3
7109,RULA,32," I see an Audrey, but with a small nose.",3
7110,GEORGE,32," Yes, yes, she had a nose job. I loved her very deeply. Will she         ever speak to me again?",3
7111,RULA,32, Not in this life. ,3
7112,ELAINE,32, Should you be smoking?,3
7113,RULA,32, Does it bother you?,3
7114,ELAINE,32, YouÂ’re pregnant.,3
7115,GEORGE,32, Elaine.,3
7116,RULA,32, I smoked when I had Faisy. ,3
7117,RULA,32, Ah oh.,3
7118,GEORGE,32, Ah oh? What? What Ah oh?,3
7119,RULA,32, I donÂ’t know about this trip George.,3
7120,GEORGE,32," You can see the Cayman Islands in there? Is something going to         happen to me? What?",3
7121,ELAINE,32, ItÂ’s really bad for the fetus. Do you know that.,3
7122,GEORGE,32," Elaine, sheÂ’s a psychic. She knows how the kidÂ’s going         to be. ",3
7123,GEORGE,32, Should I not go on this trip?,3
7124,RULA,32," George, I am going to tell you something and I want you to really         hear me.",3
7125,ELAINE,32," Now listen. I just donÂ’t know how a person, with everything         we now know about pre-natal care can put a cigarette in her mouth. ",3
7126,GEORGE,32," Elaine, what are you doing?",3
7127,ELAINE,32, ItÂ’s disgusting.,3
7128,RULA,32, I DONÂ’T BELIVE IT. I would like you both to leave. ,3
7129,ELAINE,32," Oh fine, I donÂ’t like to be around people who are just so         irresponsible.",3
7130,RULA,32, Get the hell out.,3
7131,"[Elaine leaving]        GEORGE",32, A plane crash? A Heart attack? Lupus? Is it Lupus?,3
7132,RULA,32, Do you want me to call the super? He was an Israeli commando.,3
7133,GEORGE,32," If you donÂ’t say anything I will assume itÂ’s a plane         crash.",3
7134,RULA,32, Get out.,3
7135,GEORGE,32, Not a plane crash. [leaving] Is it a plane crash?,3
7136,GINA,32, I do not like your toothbrush. There are no bristles. ,3
7137,JERRY,32," You can say what you want about me but IÂ’ll be damned if         IÂ’m going to stand here while you insult my toothbrush. ",3
7138,GINA,32," It is too small for someone with such a big mouth [kisses Kerry].         Let me ask you. What will you do if Martine wakes up? Run away like a         mouse?",3
7139,JERRY,32," No, more like the Three Stooges at the end of every movie.",3
7140,GINA,32, Who are these Stooges you speak of?,3
7141,JERRY,32, TheyÂ’re a comedy team.,3
7142,GINA,32, Tell me about them. Everything.,3
7143,JERRY,32," Well, theyÂ’re three kind of funny looking guys and they hit         each other a lot.",3
7144,GINA,32, You will show me The Stooges?,3
7145,JERRY,32, I will show you The Stooges.,3
7146,GINA,32, When?,3
7147,JERRY,32," Well, I donÂ’t really know where The Stooges are right now         but if I locate them you will be the first to know.",3
7148,GINA,32," Come, you walk me to a cab.",3
7149,JERRY,32," Well, uh, I uh, I donÂ’t want you to get upset or anything         but uh, with Martin and all, well maybe itÂ’s not such a good idea         for us to be seen together in the building, because, you know, he had         a lot of friends here.",3
7150,GINA,32, YouÂ’re still afraid. You are not a man.,3
7151,JERRY,32," Well then what are all those ties and sport jackets doing in my         closet?",3
7152,GINA,32, Are you going to walk me to a cab or not?,3
7153,JERRY,32," Yeah, all right. All right.",3
7154,KRAMER,32, You should just eat fruit. ,3
7155,NEWMAN,32, I canÂ’t eat fruit. It makes me incontinent.,3

7157,NEWMAN,32, Hello Gina. Hello Jerry.,3
7158,JERRY,32, Hello Newman.,3
7159,JERRY,32," Do you think Newman would tell Martin if he wakes up? What kind         of sicko would do that? He could kill me.",3
7160,GEORGE,32," People smoke, Elaine. My mother smoked. It didnÂ’t hurt me.",3
7161,ELAINE,32, [jumps with fear to Jerry] Did you see that wall move?,3
7162,JERRY,32," Boy, itÂ’s a good thing we came.",3
7163,GEORGE,32," Could there be a native p0roblem in the Caymans? Maybe thereÂ’s         native unrest.",3
7164,ELAINE,32," Hi, I havenÂ’t eaten in three days. I was wondering how much         longer it would be until I get my X-ray.",3
7165,Nurse,32, WeÂ’ll call you.,3
7166,JERRY,32," George, I want you to promise me something. If IÂ’m ever in         a comma. In the first 24 hours get everything out of my apartment and         put it in storage. ",3
7167,GEORGE,32, How come?,3
7168,JERRY,32, Looters.,3

7180,KRAMER,32," I want my vacuum cleaner! I know you can hear me. Look my mother,         sheÂ’s going to come and visit me. She sees that rug, sheÂ’s going         to kill me.",3
7181,W,32," He canÂ’t hear you, you idiot. Why donÂ’t you just buy another         one. ",3
7182,KRAMER,32," Why would I buy another one when I spent a hundred bucks on this         one?",3
7183,W,32, I have a carpet sweeper you can use.,3
7184,KRAMER,32," I donÂ’t want a carpet sweeper. They donÂ’t do anything.       ",3

7199,NEWMAN,32," Oh, all the way up.",3
7200,JERRY,32, And nothing could change your mind? ,3
7201,NEWMAN,32," Well, it would take a hell of a lot. Because a friend is something         you earn.",3

When you're just sitting there at the gate, maybe the pilot's         just up there in the cockpit going <mimics looking for keys> ""Oh,         I don't believe this. Oh my god...I did it again.""

7793,JERRY,40," I heard you say something, there.",3
7794,ELAINE,40, I didn't say anything.,3
7795,JERRY,40," I'm calling Kramer's mother. <Picks up the phone, dials.>         (To Elaine) I don't know what you said. But it was something. I heard         something. Hello? Hello, Mrs. Kramer? Mrs. Kramer? Could you turn the         music down? Could you turn the music down!",3
7796,GEORGE,40, Ask her about Kramer.,3
7797,JERRY,40, She's drunk out of her mind.,3
7798,JERRY (leaving a message on Elaine's machine),40," Elaine? Are you there?         It's me, I'm locked out of my apartment, I need my spare keys. Where are         you? I'm at the coffee shop.",3
7799,KRAMER (shouting over the cycle's engine),40, Hey! You ever been in an accident?,3
7800,BIKER,40," About five years ago. I was going down this very road. Same time         of day, going about the same speed I'm going now...there was a rock in         the road. Couldn't have been more than a pebble. Never really saw it!         Lost control of the bike, went flyin' about a hundred feet - came down         right on my head. Cracked it wide open! Blood and stuff was just splattered         all over the road, there...I broke every bone in my face. Hey, you know,         when they found me, my eyes were hanging out of their sockets? Yeah, they         pronounced me dead at the scene. I was in a coma for...well, they told         me about a year...said I'd be a vegetable for life. Yeah, but I showed         'em. Ever since then I always wear a helmet! <The biker goes into a         turn.> Lean! <Kramer yells.>",3
7801,JERRY (applauding),40," Georgie Boy! Way to come through with the keys! Sit         down, I'm buying you dinner.",3
7802,GEORGE,40," Look, I gotta tell ya...I been thinkin' about it, I just don't         feel right about letting you into Elaine's apartment.",3
7803,JERRY,40, Don't feel right? What are you talking about? ,3
7804,GEORGE,40," Well, you know, I shouldn't have let you into Kramer's, now you         want to go into Elaine's...she entrusted me with her spare keys, how can         I just let you in?",3
7805,JERRY,40, What is the big deal?,3
7806,GEORGE,40," Just because you have someone's spare keys, it doesn't entitle         you to break into their apartment. That's the reason you took away Kramer's         keys.",3
7807,JERRY,40," First of all, you're not even supposed to have Elaine's keys.         You're supposed to give 'em back to her, so she can give 'em back to me,         because she has mine. So technically, those are my keys.",3
7808,GEORGE,40," Yes, well, if you had never taken your keys back from Kramer,         he never would have taken his back from you and given 'em to me, in which         case I wouldn't have had to take mine back from her.",3
7809,JERRY,40," Well, I want those keys. <Tries to grab the keys from George.>",3
7810,GEORGE,40," Nope, no can do.",3
7811,JERRY,40," George, give them to me, I want these keys. <They struggle         over the keys.> I don't want to get physical!",3
7812,GEORGE,40, Do you wanna fight?,3
7813,JERRY,40, Do you wanna fight?,3
7814,GEORGE,40, I'll fight ya! Not the face! Not the face! <The struggle continues.>,3
7815,KRAMER,40," And then, the evil ogre took back the magical keys from the handsome         young prince.",3
7816,HIPPIE #1,40," Oh no. He didn't take back the keys, no way.",3
7817,KRAMER,40," Yes! And then the handsome young prince was cast out into the         cruel, cruel world.",3
7818,HIPPIE #1,40," Oh man, what a bummer. That ogre dude's pretty cold, huh?",3
7819,KRAMER,40," Oh, he's cold.",3
7820,HIPPIE #1,40," Lemme tell you something, Kramer. If that ogre dude pulled         that crap on me <pulls out a knife> - I'D STAB HIM! I'D CUT HIM         IN HALF! I'D GUT HIM LIKE A FISH, MAN! That's what I'd do!",3
7821,KRAMER,40," Yeah, yeah...that'd be funny. (To driver) Hey, you can drop me         here!",3
7822,HIPPIE #1,40," Hey, what's the rush, man?",3
7823,KRAMER,40," Well, you know, I gotta be goin' now.",3
7824,HIPPIE #1,40," Hey, Kramer - have you ever killed a man?",3
7825,KRAMER,40," What do you think, junior? You think these hands have been soakin'         in Ivory liquid? <mimics choking somebody>",3
7826,HIPPIE #2,40," Don't leave, Kramer, stay with us. You know so much about         the world, we need you, please Kramer! (they all start chanting) Please,         Kramer! Please, Kramer! <Scene ends with Kramer trying to escape their         clutches.>",3
7827,JERRY,40," Don't you see? You're just avoiding the middle man. You were gonna         give her her spare keys, so she was gonna give 'em to me. So, all that's         happening is that instead of giving them to her, you're giving them to         me. It's just unfortunate that when she gave you yours, you didn't give         her hers. 'Cause then she would have given 'em to me, because she has         mine. So then I would have never had to ask you for hers, so that I could         get mine.",3
7828,GEORGE,40," You're right, how did I miss that? <Begins unlocking the door,         mutters under his breath> Maybe because it's a crock of sh*t.",3
7829,JERRY,40, What's that?,3
7830,GEORGE,40, Nothing.,3
7831,JERRY,40, I heard something.,3
7832,GEORGE,40, Didn't say anything. (They go into Elaine's apartment.),3
7833,KRAMER,40," So, how long you been drivin' this thing?",3
7834,WOMAN,40, Goin' on four years. ,3
7835,KRAMER,40," Well, nothin's sexier than a woman behind the wheel of a semi.",3
7836,WOMAN,40," Nothin'? (They exchange a glance, then laugh.) Listen to you,         you're quite the sweet-talker.",3
7837,KRAMER,40," You know, I always wanted to drive the big rigs. I used to watch         those commercials during the reruns of Gomer Pyle. ",3
7838,WOMAN,40, You want to give it a try?,3
7839,KRAMER,40, Really?,3
7840,WOMAN,40, Do you know how to double-clutch?,3
7841,KRAMER,40, Yeah.,3
7842,WOMAN,40," Well, come on! <They trade places and Kramer gets behind the         wheel. Kramer turns out to be really rusty on the ol' double-clutch.>",3
7843,GEORGE,40," They were in here, I saw her put 'em in here!",3
7844,JERRY,40," Well, this is great. ",3
7845,GEORGE,40," Well, what do they look like?",3
7846,JERRY,40," They look like keys, George. They look exactly like keys. (In         disgust) ""What do they look like.""",3
7847,GEORGE,40," Well, they're obviously not here.",3
7848,JERRY,40," Well, they've gotta be here somewhere.",3
7849,GEORGE,40," Jerry, unless I pull down on this statuette and a hidden wall         opens up, we have checked every square inch of this apartment!",3
7850,JERRY (looking through some papers on the desk),40," What is this? ""Murphy         Brown""? ",3
7851,GEORGE,40, What?,3
7852,JERRY,40, By Elaine Benes?,3
7853,GEORGE,40, What?,3
7854,JERRY,40," Elaine's writing a ""Murphy Brown""?",3
7855,GEORGE,40, Lemme see this. (Tries to grab the papers.),3
7856,JERRY,40, Wait a second! (They fight over the paper.),3
7857,GEORGE,40, Gimme half!,3
7858,JERRY,40," All right, here! ",3
7859,GEORGE,40, Why didn't she tell us?,3
7860,JERRY (making fun),40," Elaine is writing a sitcom...! <Elaine enters         the room behind Jerry and George. Jerry spots her and tosses his half         of the script at George. George throws it back and paper goes flying everywhere.>",3
7861,ELAINE,40, You weasels!,3
7862,JERRY,40, What? What?,3
7863,ELAINE,40, How dare you!,3
7864,GEORGE,40, We hardly read anything!,3
7865,JERRY,40, It was funny!,3
7866,ELAINE,40," Who gave you permission to come into my house and just go through         all my things? You thought it was funny?",3
7867,JERRY,40, Well... <picks up some of the pages> From what I saw...,3
7868,ELAINE (grabs the papers from Jerry),40," Well, it's just a first draft!",3
7869,JERRY,40," I was locked out of my apartment, I'm just trying to get my keys.",3
7870,ELAINE (turning on George),40, Why did you let him in?! <Shoves George.>,3
7871,GEORGE,40, He forced me to!,3
7872,JERRY,40, I did not!,3
7873,GEORGE,40, Yes you did!,3
7874,ELAINE,40, You! Get out! Get out! Get out!,3
7875,JERRY,40," Elaine, wait! I need my spare keys!",3
7876,ELAINE,40," Here! Here's your damn keys, you keep 'em! I don't want 'em anymore!",3
7877,JERRY,40, Good!,3
7878,ELAINE (to George),40, And I want my keys back from you!,3
7879,GEORGE,40," What, you don't want me to hold your keys?",3
7880,ELAINE,40," No, you can't be trusted!",3
7881,GEORGE,40," Alright, alright, fine. <Gives the keys to Elaine.>",3
7882,JERRY (to Elaine),40, And I don't want you to hold mine!,3
7883,ELAINE,40, Good! I won't!,3
7884,JERRY,40, Good! Don't! Are these my keys?,3
7885,ELAINE,40, These aren't my keys!,3
7886,GEORGE,40, Whose are these?,3
7887,ELAINE,40, I don't know!,3
7888,ELAINE,40, I just thought I could write it.,3
7889,JERRY,40, Is that something you want to do?,3
7890,ELAINE,40, I don't know. Those writers make a lot of money.,3
7891,JERRY,40," Elaine, let me tell you something about show business. It's hard         work! You don't just write a ""Murphy Brown."" You gotta watch         the show, study it, get a sense of the characters, how they relate to         each other.",3
7892,ELAINE,40," O.K., can I just watch the show? <mutters under her breath>         God, what an asshole.",3

8034,George,44, It's not him!,4
8035,Jerry,44, I can't live tlike this. I'm being stalked.,4
8036,Receptionist,44, Mister Seinfeld? They're ready for you.,4
8037,Jerry,44, Oh.,4
8038,George,44, Mister Seinfeld? What about Mister Costanza? I'm not here?,4
8039,Jerry,44," All right. Look. Now, you promised you're gonna be a little more         flexible on the nothing idea, okay? Jsut a little.",4
8040,George,44, Okay. A little.,4
8041,Newman,44," Okay, you're all set? You got your story?",4
8042,Kramer,44, No.,4
8043,Newman,44," When the cop stopped me, I told him that I was rushing home because         my friend was about to commit suicide.",4
8044,Kramer,44, Uhm...,4
8045,Newman,44," Now, you're that firend. Now, all we need is a reason why you         were going to commit suicide.",4
8046,Kramer,44, I never had an air conditioner.,4
8047,Newman,44, No! That's no reason to kill yourself!,4
8048,Kramer,44," Why? It gets hot at night, you can't sleep. You ever tried to         sleep in a really hot room?",4
8049,Newman,44," Every night I sleep in a really hot room, I don't want to kill         myself.",4
8050,Kramer,44," Well, I slept in really hot rooms and I wanted to kill myself.",4
8051,Newman,44," No, no, no. That's not gonna work. Something else.",4
8052,Kramer,44, I was never able to become a banker.,4
8053,Newman,44," Banker! So you're killing yourself because your dreams of becoming         a banker have gone unfulfilled. You-you-you-you can't live without being         a banker.",4
8054,Kramer,44," Yeah, yeah. If I can't be banker, I don't wanna live.",4
8055,Newman,44, You must be banker.,4
8056,Kramer,44, MUST be banker.,4
8057,Newman (satisfied),44," Okay, we'll go with the banker story.",4
8058,George,44," The story is the foundation of all entertainment. You must have         a good story otherwise it's just masturbation.",4
8059,Russel,44, And people really have to care about the characters.,4
8060,George,44," Care? Forget about care. Love. They have to love the characters.         Otherwise, why would they keep tuning in?",4
8061,Jerry,44, Wouldn't tune in.,4
8062,George,44, Would they tune in?,4
8063,Jerry,44, No tune.,4
8064,Russel,44," We like to look at the show as if it were in EKG. You have your         highs and your lows and it goes up and down.",4
8065,George,44, The show will be like a heart attack!,4
8066,Jerry,44, Just a huge massive coronary.,4
8067,Russel,44," So what you said last week about no story, you're a little flexible         on that now.",4
8068,George,44," Is-is that what I said 'no story'? Because Jerry had to tell         me later.",4
8069,Jerry,44, He couldn't believe it.,4
8070,Police officer,44," Well, I informed him that he was exceeding the speed         limit and uh, that's when he told me that he was racing home because his         friend was about to commit suicide.",4
8071,Judge,44, And then what happened?,4
8072,Russel,44," Look. I don't know how you two guys feel but we would really         like to be in business with you.",4
8073,George,44," Well, we would like to be in business. Let's do business. We'll         have some business. Let's have business.",4
8074,Jerry,44," We would love to be in business. We'll do business. We're in business.         It's... it's business. This is business.",4
8075,George,44, Yeah!,4
8076,Stu,44, Would it be possible to get a-a-a copy of 'La Cocina'?,4
8077,Jerry,44, Your off-Broadway play.,4
8078,George,44," Oh, oh. Uh, you know. It's the damndest thing. I, uh, I moved         recently and my files, pfff, disappeared. Now, I-I don't know if they         fell off the truck or if there was some sort of foul play but let me tell         you something. I'm not through with that moving company.",4
8079,Jerry (backs his story),44," Hmm, hmm.",4
8080,George,44, That's my vow to you.,4
8081,Russel,44," Well, I got a feeling about you two. And even more than that.         I place a great deal of confidence in that lady's judgment. ",4
8082,George,44, Oh! That's good judgment. That's a pile of judgment there. Sure.,4
8083,Jerry,44," Oh! Taht's judgment. Yes, yes. Judgment with earrings on. Yeah.",4
8084,Russel (gets up),44," So, let's make a pilot.",4
8085,Newman,44," I had gone up to Westchester. I go there every Tuesday. I do         charity for the blind in my spare time for the Lighthouse. I was in the         middle of a game of Parcheesi with an old blind man and I excused myself         to call my friend as he was very depressed lately because he never became         a banker.",4
8086,Judge,44, I don't understand.,4
8087,Newman,44," You see, it'd been his lifelong dream to be a banker and he uh,         just the day before he was turned down by another bank. I believe it was         the Manufacturer's Hanover on Lexington and 40th Street. That was the         third bank to turn him down so I was-I was a little concerned. I wanted         to see how he was doing. Well, Your Honor, he was barely audible. But         I distinctly recall him say...",4
8088,Kramer (interupts involuntarily),44, Yo-yo Ma!,4
8089,Newman,44," So I sped home to save my friend's life and I was stopped for         speeding. Yes, I admit I was speeding but it was to save a man's life.         A close friend. An innocent person who wanted nothing more out of life         than to love, to be loved and to be a banker.",4
8090,Judge,44, So then he didn't kill himself.,4
8091,Newman,44," No sir. He did not. But only by thge grace of God. He's in the         courtroom today",4
8092,George,44, See?,4
8093,Jerry,44, Yeah!,4
8094,George,44," I told you, I told you! Ha ha ha! Ooh ooh!",4
8095,Jerry,44," Now, all we gotta do is write it.",4
8096,George,44, Yes! How're we gonna do that?,4
8097,Susan,44, Hey! Congratulations!,4
8098,Jerry,44, Thanks.,4
8099,George,44," Oh, thank you.",4
8100,Jerry,44," Thank you, thanks.",4
8101,George,44," Thanks. Gee, you know, I thought you were mad at me.",4
8102,Susan,44, No.,4
8103,Receptionist,44," Mister Seinfeld, you have a phone call.",4
8104,Jerry,44, Phone call? Who knows I'm here?,4
8105,George,44," When you sent me the-the bill for the dry-cleaning. I thought         the show didn't have a chance.",4
8106,Susan,44," Oh, it was only vomit.",4
8107,George,44," Anyway, I-I would like to-to pay for the cleaning.",4
8108,George,44," No-no-no, we all chipped in. We have the money.",4
8109,Susan,44," Well, it was eighteen dollars.",4
8110,George,44," Okay, uh, eighteen dollars, and there it is. There you go. So         maybe we could get together this weekend.",4
8111,Susan,44, Yeah. Call me.,4
8112,George,44," All right, great.",4
8113,Susan,44, Bye.,4
8114,Jerry,44, Bye thanks.,4
8115,George (chuckles),44," Bye, thanks. (To Jerry, when Susan is far) I can't         believe she took the money.",4
8116,Jerry,44, Why?,4
8117,George,44, I offered to pay. She should've said no.,4
8118,Jerry,44," She did, you insisted.",4
8119,George,44," Maybe this is what the pilot should be about, vomiting on somebody's         vest.",4
8120,Jerry,44, Nah!,4
8121,George,44," How much are we gonna get for this? Fifty, sixty thousand?",4
8122,Jerry,44," oh, I d-I don't know. I d---",4
8123,George,44," Oh, gotta get fifty. Gotta get fifty. All right, I tell you what.         We go to the coffee shop, you call your manager. Maybe they made an offer.",4
8124,Jerry,44, Okay.,4
8125,"George (excited, pushing Jerry forward)",44," All right, let's go, let's go,         let's go, come on.",4
8126,George,44, Thirteen thousand?,4
8127,Jerry,44, Thirteen thousand.,4
8128,George,44, a piece?,4
8129,Jerry,44," No, for both!",4
8130,George,44," That's insulting! Ted Danson makes eight hundred thousand dollars         an episode.",4
8131,Jerry,44," Oh, would you stop with the Ted Danson?",4
8132,George,44," Well, he does.",4
8133,Jerry,44, You're nuts!,4
8134,George,44," I'm sorry. I can't live knowing Ted Danson makes that much more         than me. Who is he?",4
8135,Jerry,44, He's somebody.,4
8136,George,44, What about me?,4
8137,Jerry,44, You're nobody.,4
8138,George,44, Why him? Why not me?,4
8139,Jerry,44," He's good, you're not.",4
8140,George,44, I'm better than him.,4
8141,Jerry,44," You're worse, much much worse. (crouches in booth) That's Davola!",4
8142,George (crouches too),44, What? Where? Where?,4
8143,Jerry,44, Outside! I saw him outside!,4
8144,Elaine,44, what is it?,4
8145,Boyfriend,44," Oh, it's this patient.",4
8146,Elaine (sighing),44, Again?,4
8147,Boyfriend,44," I'm fairly certain. I forgot to leave him an extra prescription         for his medication.",4
8148,Elaine,44," Well, so, he can live without his Valium for a couple of days.",4
8149,Boyfriend,44," Nah, you don't understand. He could be dangerous.",4
8150,Jerry,44, Go outside and see if he's still there.,4
8151,George,44," I can't go out there, he knows we're friends.",4
8152,Jerry,44," Well, what are we supposed to do? I gotta take Kramer to the doctor.",4
8153,George,44, Tell the cop.,4
8154,Jerry,44, Good idea.,4
8155,Cop,44," Yeah, all right. Just let me get a muffin.",4
8156,Jerry,44, Thanks.,4
8157,Jerry (back in booth),44," He's gonna get a muffin and then he'll walk us         outside. This is a great way to go through life. ",4
8158,George,44, I thought you said he was gonna get a muffin.,4
8159,Jerry (bossy),44, What are you doing?,4
8160,Cop,44, What?,4
8161,Jerry,44," What, are you ordering food now?",4
8162,Cop,44," Yeah! Yeah, I decided to get a sandwich.",4
8163,Jerry,44, What happened to the muffin?,4
8164,Cop,44, I got a little hungry.,4
8165,Jerry,44, All of a sudden you get hungry?,4
8166,Cop,44, Yeah! You got a problem with that?,4
8167,Jerry,44, No! Enjoy your lunch.,4
8168,(to George),44, He's getting a sandwich now!,4
8169,George,44, I thought he was just gonna have a muffin.,4
8170,Jerry,44, All of a sudden he gets hungry.,4
8171,George,44," You know, a muffin can be very filling.",4
8172,Jerry,44, I know!,4
8173,Newman (interrogating Kramer],44," Mister Kramer, you heard the testimony         so far. Would you please tell the court in your own words what happened         on the afternoon of September 10th?",4
8174,Kramer,44, What do you mean 'my own words'? Whose words are they gonna be?,4
8175,Newman,44, You know what I mean.,4
8176,Kramer (to Judge),44, I was very upset that day.,4
8177,Newman,44, And why was that?,4
8178,Kramer (to Newman),44, Would you let me say it? Let me talk!,4
8179,Newman,44," All right, all right. Go ahead, go ahead.",4
8180,Kramer,44, All right.,4
8181,Newman,44, Okay.,4
8182,Kramer (to Judge),44," I was very upset that day because I could never become         a banker.",4
8183,Newman,44," And that failure to become a banker was eating at you. Eating-eating-eating         at you inside.",4
8184,Kramer (not convincing),44," Uh, yeah.",4
8185,Newman,44," It was your family that pushed you into banking , it was their         dream for you...",4
8186,Judge,44, Mister Newman.,4
8187,Newman,44," Your Honor, I'm only trying to establish Mister Kramer's fragile         emotional state, my entire case depends on it.",4
8188,Judge,44," Uh, continue.",4
8189,Newman,44," As you were saying, Mister Kramer...",4
8190,Kramer,44, What was the question?,4
8191,Newman,44, You're telling how your parents pushed you into banking.,4
8192,Newman,44," But you never became a banker, did you Mister Kramer? Why? Why         did you fail?",4
8193,Kramer,44, I don't know.,4
8194,Newman,44," It was because you hated your father and you would do anything         to displease him. Isn't THAT true?",4
8195,Judge,44," Uh, could you get to the speeding?",4
8196,Newman,44," Yuh, yes. I intend to Your Honor. And then, on the afternoon         of September 10th, you received a phone call did you not?",4
8197,Kramer (puzzled),44, Phone call?,4
8198,Newman,44," Yes, a phone call!",4
8199,Kramer,44, From who?,4
8200,Newman,44, From me!,4
8201,Kramer,44, From you?,4
8202,Newman,44," Yes, from me!! I called you remember?",4
8203,Kramer,44, You called me?,4
8204,Newman,44," Yes, I called you, you idiot! Because you were going to... You         were going to... Remember?",4
8205,Kramer,44, what?,4
8206,Newman,44, You were going to...,4
8207,Judge,44, I'm afraid I'm gonna have to call a---,4
8208,Newman,44," Yes, the banker!!!",4
8209,Kramer,44, What banking?,4
8210,Newman,44," A banker! A banker! Your Honor, Your Honor, Your Honor...",4
8211,Judge,44, That's enough already.,4
8212,Newman,44," Your Honor, Mister Kramer's obviously very distraught.",4
8213,Kramer,44, I'm distraught!?! Wooh-wooh-hoo!,4
8214,Newman (to Kramer),44, You shut up!,4
8215,(to judge),44," I demand a recess so I can take him outside and help him         regain hius composure.",4
8216,Judge,44, That'll be seventy-five dollars.,4
8217,Newman (Strangling Kramer),44," What's the matter with you? We had it all         worked out!",4
8218,*Jerry,44, Do you see him?,4
8219,George,44, I'm not* sure.,4
8220,Jerry,44," Well, either you see him or you don't.",4
8221,George,44, All right. I don't.,4
8222,Jerry (looking at the cop),44," What is he doing? Is he getting coffee? I         think he's getting coffee.!",4
8223,George,44, What's with this guy?,4
8224,Jerry (still bossy),44, Did you just order coffee?,4
8225,Cop,44, Yeah.,4
8226,Jerry,44, This is really too much.,4
8227,Cop,44, What is your problem?,4
8228,Jerry,44," Well, I'm sitting over there waiting for you to finish your sandwich         for twenty minutes. Now you're drinking coffee, that's gonna be another         ten minutes.",4
8229,Cop,44," Well, you're just gonna have to wait.",4
8230,Kramer,44, Never said anything about the banking.,4
8231,Newman,44, You're off your rocker.,4
8232,Jerry,44, Hey you guys!,4
8233,Kramer,44, Hey!,4
8234,Jerry,44, What are you doing here?,4
8235,Kramer,44, What are YOU doing here?,4
8236,Jerry,44," Hey, is Davola outside?",4
8237,Kramer,44, Davola?,4
8238,Jerry,44, Yeah.,4
8239,Kramer,44," No, I didn't see him.",4
8240,Newman,44, Crazy Joe Davola?,4
8241,George (reading the tabs),44," Jerry, yours is eleven dollars.",4
8242,Jerry,44, Eleven dollars for what?,4
8243,George,44," Muffin, sandwich and coffee!",4
8244,Jerry (to Kramer),44," Hey, NBC okayed our idea. We're gonna make the pilot.",4
8245,Kramer,44," You're gonna do the circus freak show, uh?",4
8246,Jerry,44, No.,4
8247,Newman,44," Pilot? So what do you make for something like that? Fifty? Sixty         thousand?",4
8248,George,44, What's the difference? The money is not important.,4
8249,Jerry (looking outside),44," Hey Newman, is that your red car?",4
8250,Newman,44, Yeah.,4
8251,Jerry,44, I think you're getting a ticket.,4
8252,Newman,44, Deh!,4
8253,Kramer,44," Run, run! Go, go, go!",4
8254,Newman,44," Hey! What are you doing? It's after six o'clock! You can't give         me a ticket! Hey, you're not gonna get away with this. I'll fight this.         I got witnesses.",4
8255,Kramer,44, I saw the whole thing!,4
8256,Jerry,44, Maybe this whole thing would be a good idea for the pilot.,4
8257,George,44," Ah, get outta here. The vomiting is much funnier.",4
8258,Jerry,44," Oh, like you know what you're talking about!",4
8259,George,44," No, YOU do!",4
8260,Written by,45, Larry David ,4

8275,HELEN,45, What kind of problems?,4

8279,HELEN,45," Jerry, I want you to sign that contract. ",4

8284,SUSAN,45, Are you and Jerry in complete agreement on this?,4
8285,GEORGE,45," Ah, yeah, . . . I believe I can speak for the both of us on this.",4
8286,SUSAN,45," Because you know, because this is your first show this is a pretty         standard deal.",4

9260,George,50, About six years ago.,4
9261,Jerry,50, I think you can take the lift ticket off your jacket now.,4
9262,George,50, Women like skiers.,4
9263,Jerry,50, So what? You can't meet anybody. You're going on with Susan.,4
9264,George,50, Yeah. Right.,4
9265,Jerry,50," Hey, see those two women over there? I almost dated the               one on the right. She's in the closet business.",4
9266,George,50, The closet business? What's the closet business?,4
9267,Jerry,50, What is it your business?,4
9268,George,50, I'm interested.,4
9269,Jerry,50," She reorganizes your closet and shows you how to maximize               your closet space. She looked into my closet.",4
9270,George,50," So you thought she was good looking and figured this would               be a good way to meet her.",4
9271,Jerry,50, Yeah.,4
9272,George,50, Yeah. So what happened?,4
9273,Jerry,50," So, she mentioned she had a boyfriend and then it hit me.               What do I need more closet space for? (Across the room) Hi, Marla.",4
9274,Marla,50, (Walks over to Jerry and George) Jerry.,4
9275,Jerry,50," George, Marla.",4
9276,George,50, Marla.,4
9277,Marla,50," George. Jerry, Stacey.",4
9278,Jerry,50, Stacey.,4
9279,Stacey,50, Jerry.,4
9280,Jerry,50," George, Stacey.",4
9281,George,50, Stacey.,4
9282,Stacey,50, George.,4
9283,Jerry,50, George.,4
9284,George,50," Jerry. Marla. (Realizing Jerry's cue) Stacey! (Walks over               to Stacey)",4
9285,Marla,50," So, how was your trip to Berlin?",4
9286,Jerry,50, Trip to Berlin?,4
9287,Marla,50," Remember? That's why you put off doing the closets. You               said you were going to Berlin for a while.",4
9288,Jerry,50," Oh, right, right.",4
9289,Marla,50," The wall had just come down, and you told me you wanted               to be part of the celebration.",4
9290,Jerry,50," Yes, yes, I did. But, you know, I was watching it on CNN,               and they covered it so well I thought, ""Why knock my brains               out?""",4
9291,Marla,50," You, know my boyfriend went.",4
9292,Jerry,50, Really?,4
9293,Marla,50," Yes, I told him all about you going and he got all excited               and decided to go.",4
9294,Jerry,50," Oh, did he like it?",4
9295,Marla,50," I don't know. He never came back. (Over to the other side               of the bar)",4
9296,George,50," Anyway, we met with NBC about a month ago and they gave               us the green light to go ahead and write a pilot. In fact, we got               a big meeting with them tomorrow. They gotta approve of the story               before we can write.",4
9297,Stacey,50," Wow, what a great job. A writer.",4
9298,George,50, Not a bad way to make a buck.,4
9299,Stacey,50, Sounds great.,4
9300,George,50," Well, I'll tell you, Stacey. It's a lot of hard work. But,               it comes fairly easy to me. Some people write symphonies. This is               my gift. (Raises ski lift ticket while Stacey looks away)",4
9301,Jerry,50," So, are you gonna go out with her?",4
9302,George,50, I might.,4
9303,Jerry,50, What about Susan?,4
9304,George,50," What? I'm not married. I'm not allowed to go out with somebody               else?",4
9305,Jerry,50, Depends.,4
9306,George,50, Depends on what?,4
9307,Jerry,50, On many factors.,4
9308,George,50, Like what?,4
9309,Jerry,50," Well, how long you've been seeing her. What's your phone               call frequency? Are you on a daily?",4
9310,George,50, No. Semi-daily. Four or five times a week.,4
9311,Jerry,50," What about Saturday nights? Do you have to ask her out,               or is a date implied?",4
9312,George,50, Implied.,4
9313,Jerry,50, She got anything in your medicine cabinet?,4
9314,George,50, There might be some moisturizer.,4
9315,Jerry,50," Ah hah. Let me ask you this. Is there any tampax in your               house?",4
9316,George,50, (Pause) Yeah.,4
9317,Jerry,50," Well, I'll tell you what you've got here.",4
9318,George,50, What?,4
9319,Jerry,50, You got yourself a girlfriend.,4
9320,George,50," Ah, no, no. Are you sure? A girlfriend?",4
9321,Jerry,50," I'm looking at a guy in a semi-daily with tampax in his               house and an implied date on Saturday night. I would like to help               you out, but...",4
9322,George,50," Would you believe my luck? The first time in my life I               have a good answer to the question, ""What do you do?""               and I have a girlfriend. I mean, you don't need a girlfriend when               you can answer that question. That's what you say in order to get               girlfriends. Once you can get a girlfriend, you don't want a girlfriend,               you just want more girlfriends.",4
9323,Jerry,50, You're going to make a good father someday.,4
9324,George,50," Well it's not fair, Jerry. It's just not fair. All right,               all right. That's it. I'm getting out of this thing.",4
9325,Jerry,50, Fine. Break up with her. But you know what this means?,4
9326,George,50," No, what?",4
9327,Jerry,50," The script, the pilot, the TV show. That's all over.",4
9328,George,50, Why? What do you mean?,4
9329,Jerry,50," Figure it out. She's one of the executives at NBC that's               gonna make the decision whether or not they pick up the show. She's               one of our biggest fans. You drop her off, you think they're gonna               pick us up?",4
9330,George,50," Oh, right. Oh no, man.",4
9331,Jerry,50," you know, it's a very interesting situation. Here you have               a job that can get you girls. But, you also have a relationship.               But if you try and get rid of the relationship so you can get the               girls, you lose the job. You see the irony?",4
9332,George,50," Yeah, yeah. I see the irony. All right. What about this?               What if I can find some way to break up with her so that she'll               still like me and it doesn't affect the deal.",4
9333,Jerry,50," (sarcastically) Oh, yeah.",4
9334,George,50," Wait, wait. Here me out. Don't dismiss this. You're very               quick to dismiss. Don't dismiss. She's got a big crush on David               Letterman, I mean, a big crush. She talks about him all the time.               Suppose I go up to David Letterman. He works at NBC; I work at NBC.               I explain my situation. He agrees to meet her. They go out, they               fall madly in love. And she dumps me for David Letterman.",4
9335,Jerry,50, This is your plan?,4
9336,George,50," No, no. I'm just thinking.",4
9337,Jerry,50, I don't think you are.,4
9338,Marla,50, Let me tell you what I think.,4
9339,Jerry,50," Please, and be brutal. I have no closet sensitivity.",4
9340,Marla,50, Are you very fussy about your pants?,4
9341,Jerry,50, I don't think I am.,4
9342,Marla,50, Because I have a very radical idea. Can you handle it?,4
9343,Jerry,50, Try me.,4
9344,Marla,50," Here's what I'm proposing. We eliminate all this. The hangers,               the bar, the shelves. And in its place install a series of hooks.               We'll put everything on hooks.",4
9345,Jerry,50, Everything?,4
9346,Marla,50," Everything. The shirts, pants, sport jackets, pajamas. We               could get eighty hooks on here.",4
9347,Jerry,50," You're quite mad, you know. (Kramer enters) Oh, I don't               believe this. (Goes into other room) Hey?",4
9348,Kramer,50, Hey.,4
9349,Jerry,50, What are you doing?,4
9350,Kramer,50, I'm watching The Bold and the Beautiful.,4
9351,Jerry,50, No.,4
9352,Kramer,50, What?,4
9353,Jerry,50, This is not a good time.,4
9354,Kramer,50, Five minutes. What?,4
9355,Jerry,50, What did you have to give your TV away to George for?,4
9356,Kramer,50," Because I've been watching too much. It was an addiction.               I couldn't stop. It was, it was destroying my brain cells.",4
9357,Jerry,50," Yeah, but now you're in here all the time. (Marla enters               from other room)",4
9358,Kramer,50," Well, wow.",4
9359,Jerry,50," Marla, Kramer.",4
9360,Kramer,50, Hey.,4
9361,Jerry,50, Why don't you go out? It's nice out.,4
9362,Kramer,50," Oh, no. There's nothing out there for me.",4
9363,Jerry,50, There's weather.,4
9364,Kramer,50," Weather? I don't need weather. Weather doesn't do it for               me.",4
9365,Jerry,50, I'm tellin' George to give you your TV back.,4
9366,Kramer,50," No, no, I don't want it back. (Pause) Are you gonna watch               the Knick game tonight?",4
9367,Jerry,50, I don't know.,4
9368,Kramer,50, Will you tape it?,4
9369,Jerry,50, Kramer... (points to Marla),4
9370,Kramer,50, Yeah. (He exits),4
9371,Jerry,50, So your boyfriend never came back from Berlin.,4
9372,Marla,50, Never came back.,4
9373,Jerry,50," Oh, you must have been devastated being left for a wall.",4
9374,Marla,50, It was about to end anyway. There was this... problem.,4
9375,Jerry,50, Ah hah. (Buzzer) Excuse me one second. Yeah?,4
9376,Elaine,50, It's me.,4
9377,Jerry,50," Come on up. Oh, it's Elaine, she's just a friend of mine.               I don't know what she's doing here now. (Buzzer) I'm sorry. What?",4
9378,Elaine,50, I didn't get it.,4
9379,Jerry,50, Ugh. So you were saying there was this problem.,4
9380,Marla,50," Well, he wanted me to move in with him.",4
9381,Jerry,50, Snapple?,4
9382,Marla,50, No thanks.,4
9383,Jerry,50, Go on.,4
9384,Marla,50, Well I wouldn't move in because...,4
9385,Jerry,50, Yes.,4
9386,Marla,50, Well because...,4
9387,Jerry,50, Yeah.,4
9388,Marla,50, Well because I'm a virgin. (Elaine enters),4
9389,Elaine,50, Hello!,4
9390,Jerry,50," Hi, um. Marla, Elaine.",4
9391,Elaine,50," I'm sorry, I didn't know you had company. I just wanted               to return your tape.",4
9392,Jerry,50," Oh, thanks a lot, two weeks late. Now that costs me thirty-five               dollars to see Havana.",4
9393,Elaine,50," I'm sorry, I really am. I just kept forgetting.",4
9394,Marla,50, I should be going.,4
9395,Elaine,50," No, no, I'm leaving.",4
9396,Jerry,50, I like that thing in your hair there.,4
9397,Elaine,50," Oh yeah? This woman was selling them at this crazy party               I was at last night. You'll appreciate this. Snapple? ",4
9398,Marla,50, No thanks. ,4
9399,Elaine,50," I was talking to this guy, you know, and I just happened               to throw my purse on the sofa. And my diaphragm goes flying out.               So I just froze, you know, ahh! Staring at my diaphragm. You know,               it's just lying there. So then, this woman, the one who sold me               this hair thing, she grabbed it before the guy noticed, so. I mean,               big deal, right? So I carry around my diaphragm, who doesn't? Yeah,               like it's a big, big secret that women carry around their diaphragms.               You never know when you're gonna need it, right? (Sips the Snapple)               Ahh. ",4
9400,Marla,50, I should be going.,4
9401,Jerry,50, So we'll talk about the hooks then?,4
9402,Marla,50, Yes. (She exits),4
9403,Elaine,50, What? Was it something I said?,4
9404,Jerry,50," She's a virgin, she just told me.",4
9405,Elaine,50, Well I didn't know.,4
9406,Jerry,50, Well it's not like spotting a toupee.,4
9407,Elaine,50," Well you think I should say something? Should I say something?               Should I apologize? Was I being anti-virgin?",4
9408,Jerry,50," No, no, I mean...",4
9409,Elaine,50, 'Cause I'm not anti-virgin. I'll be right back. (She leaves),4
9410,Jerry,50," Elaine, Elaine... (Buzzer) Yeah?",4
9411,George,50, It's George.,4
9412,George,50, She's a virgin?,4
9413,Jerry,50, A virgin.,4
9414,George,50, Wow. So what're you gonna do?,4
9415,Jerry,50," I don't know. I'm very attracted to her. That accent, it's               so sexy.",4
9416,George,50," I don't think I could do it. You know, they always remember               the first time. I don't want to be remembered. I wanna be forgotten.",4
9417,Jerry,50," You need a little pioneer spirit. You know, you don't have               any of that Lewis and Clark in you.",4
9418,George,50," You know, sometimes those guys don't make it back. (Looks               in fridge) I'm really hungry.",4
9419,Jerry,50," Yeah, me too.",4
9420,George,50," We gotta get something. I don't want to go to that meeting               on an empty stomach. Let's get some Chinese. You wanna order it?",4
9421,Jerry,50," All right, but then we gotta get some work done. Let me               just call Kramer, see if want anything. (Calls) Hey, we ordering               Chinese food. If you want anything-- (Kramer enters quickly) let               me know what it is and I'll order for you.",4
9422,Kramer,50, I'm in. Let's go for it.,4
9423,George,50, What do you want?,4
9424,Kramer,50," I don't care, whatever.",4
9425,George,50," I'll tell you what. Why don't we just get a couple of dishes               and we'll just share 'em.",4
9426,Kramer,50, Okay. What are you getting?,4
9427,George,50, I'm gonna get a Chow Fung.,4
9428,Kramer,50, What's a Chow Fung?,4
9429,George,50, It's a broad noodle.,4
9430,Kramer,50," What do you mean, a broad noodle?",4
9431,George,50, It's a big flat noodle.,4
9432,Kramer,50, Well I don't want a big flat noodle.,4
9433,George,50, What kind of noodle do you want?,4
9434,Kramer,50, Who says I want a noodle?,4
9435,George,50," All right, look. I'm getting the Chow Fung. You don't have               to have any.",4
9436,Kramer,50," All right. I'll get pea pods and you can't have any of               my pea pods.",4
9437,George,50, Fine.,4
9438,Kramer,50, Get extra MSG.,4
9439,Elaine,50," Look, Marla. This whole sex thing is totally overrated.               Now, here's the one thing you've gotta be ready for is how the man               changes into a completely different person five seconds after it's               over. I mean, something happens to their personality it's really               quite astounding. It's like they committed a crime and they want               to flee the scene before the police get there.",4
9440,Marla,50, So they just leave?,4
9441,Elaine,50," Yeah, pretty much, yeah. Well, the smart ones start working               on their getaway stories during dinner. How, you know, they gotta               get up early tomorrow. What is about being up early? They all turn               into farmers suddenly.",4
9442,Marla,50, Wow. It must be pretty good to put up with all that.,4
9443,Elaine,50, Eh.,4
9444,Jerry,50," All right, let's go. We don't have much time before the               meeting. ",4
9445,George,50, Where's the food? What happened to Ping?,4
9446,Jerry,50," Don't worry, he'll be here. Look, we only got about two               hours. We just need to come up with one good story so we can get               through this meeting. (Buzzer) There's your food.",4
9447,George,50," Hey, what about this? I'm in a car accident. The motorist               is uninsured, you with me?",4
9448,Jerry,50, Yeah.,4
9449,George,50," My car's totaled. It's all his fault and now, he has absolutely               no money. There is no way that he can pay me. So the judge decrees               that he becomes my butler.",4
9450,Jerry,50, Your butler?,4
9451,George,50," Right. He cooks my food, he cleans my house, he does all               my shopping for me. And there you go, that's your program.",4
9452,Jerry,50, What about me?,4
9453,George,50," Don't worry, we'll find something for you. (Knock of Jerry's               door)",4
9454,Jerry,50," (Getting the door) That's the stupidest idea I ever heard.               Sentenced to be a butler. (Elaine, Marla, and an injured Ping are               at the door) Ping, what happened?",4
9455,Elaine,50, There was a bit of an accident.,4
9456,Ping,50, Head hurts. Head really hurts.,4
9457,Jerry,50, What happened?,4
9458,Elaine,50," Marla and I went out for coffee and afterwards I was crossing               the street and he was biking right towards me. So I got out of the               way just in time, but then he ran into a parked car. He hit his               head and everything went flying.",4
9459,George,50, Something happened to the food?,4
9460,Ping,50, I only saved one bag.,4
9461,Jerry,50, Should I call an ambulance? Do you wanna see a doctor?,4
9462,Marla,50, I'll get some ice.,4
9463,George,50," (After looking in the bag) The pea pods? All you saved               was the pea pods? (Kramer enters)",4
9464,Kramer,50," Hey, you got the food?",4
9465,Jerry,50," Yeah, here.",4
9466,Kramer,50," What took you so long? Hey, Ping!",4
9467,Ping,50, Kramer. (Kramer and George sit on the couch),4
9468,Kramer,50, Yeah. Where's yours?,4
9469,George,50, He dropped it.,4
9470,Kramer,50," Oh, that's too bad.",4
9471,Elaine,50," You should slow down, you know that? It's dangerous to               go that fast.",4
9472,Ping,50," No, no. I have green light. You jaywalked.",4
9473,Kramer,50," (To Jerry) Hey, you watchin' Oprah?",4
9474,Elaine,50, (To Ping) I did not jaywalk.,4
9475,Jerry,50, (To George) You're givin' him back that TV.,4
9476,Ping,50," (To Elaine) Yes, you jaywalked.",4
9477,Kramer,50," (To Jerry) No, I don't want it back.",4
9478,Ping,50, (To Elaine) Jaywalker. I could slap suit on you.,4
9479,George,50, (To Jerry) We got work to do. What about the meeting?,4
9480,Kramer,50," (To himself) Hey, look. An hour with Patrick Swayze.",4
9481,Jerry,50," A month and a half we had. We did nothing. I can't believe               we put it off until today and then we couldn't do anything because               Elaine runs out to apologize to a virgin, crosses against a light,               and knocks over a Chinese delivery boy. Now we're gonna make fools               of ourselves, we got nothing. You're not even in show business.               I gotta reputation. You drag me into the sewer with you. I've been               on TV buddy boy. You know how fast word spreads in show business?               It's like that (Snaps in George's face) , like that! One bad impression,               you're outta the business!",4
9482,George,50," All right, let's postpone it. Let's get out of here.",4
9483,Jerry,50, What do you mean? They know we're here.,4
9484,George,50," I'll fake an illness. (Acts it out) My back! My back! I               can't believe, my back.",4
9485,Jerry,50," No, no, would you get up?",4
9486,George,50," I can do this, Jerry.",4
9487,Jerry,50, No.,4
9488,George,50," All right, I'll tell them my sister died. (Starts fake               crying) My poor sister died. She was standing and then she was laughing               and then they SHOT her! That's the kind of sick city that we're               livin' in. They shoot you for laughing. I must go and comfort my               poor family. Jerry, take me home so I can comfort my... my poor               family.",4
9489,Jerry,50, What?,4
9490,George,50," That's David Letterman. I just saw David Letterman walk               by. I'll be right back. (He exits)",4
9491,Woman,50," Mr. Seinfeld, they're ready for you. (She exits)",4
9492,Jerry,50," Yes, I was very wise to hitch my wagon to his star. (Jerry               enters meeting)",4
9493,Man #1,50," Hey, Jerry.",4
9494,Jerry,50," Hi, how are you doing? Nice to see you all here. Hello.",4
9495,Rita,50," Hello, Jerry. I'm Rita Kearson.",4
9496,Jerry,50," Oh, uh, nice to meet you. Where's Russell?",4
9497,Rita,50," He, uh, had to go to LA. There's a problem on the set of               Blossom.",4
9498,Jerry,50," Oh, poor Blossom. (He sits)",4
9499,Rita,50," Anyway, he asked me to sit in for him.",4
9500,Man #2,50, Where's George?,4
9501,Jerry,50," Oh, he ran to say something to David Letterman.",4
9502,Susan,50, David Letterman's on the floor?,4
9503,Jerry,50," Yeah, he just walked by. ",4
9504,Rita,50," Well, I think we should get started anyway.",4
9505,Jerry,50," Yeah, good idea.",4
9506,Rita,50, So how are you guys comin' along?,4
9507,Jerry,50," Good, good, we've got a lot of ideas.",4
9508,Rita,50, Good. (Pause),4
9509,Jerry,50," Have you ever been to a Chinese restaurant and they tell               you it'll be, like, five minutes for a table and you wind up waitin'               there for, like, thirty minutes? Well, we thought it would be very               funny to do an entire show where all you're doin' is waitin' for               the table. (They don't seem to like it) Because we've all been in               that situation. You know, you're waiting... and you're hungry...               and you bump into somebody you know... When is Russell coming back?",4
9510,Rita,50, So that's the idea?,4
9511,Jerry,50," Well no, that's one. We have many others. We have an idea               where, uh, I get into an accident with a guy who has no insurance               and the judge sentences him to be my butler. (Everyone laughs) You               know he cooks for me, he has to cook for me... He cleans my house,               he's doin' my shopping, you know? I'm walkin' around with one of               those big neck collars.",4
9512,Man #2,50, Those collars are funny!,4
9513,Man #1,50," Once you see someone in those collars you start laughing               immediately. (George enters)",4
9514,George,50," You tellin' 'em about the butler story? Is that beautiful               or what? Hey, sorry I'm late. (Looks at Rita) Russell?",4
9515,Rita,50, I'm Rita Kearson.,4
9516,George,50," Oh, Rita. Hey, Mr. Shermack, how're you doing, good to               see you. Jay, always a pleasure. (To Susan) Sweetie. (Kisses her               and then sits down next to Jerry) Yeah, yeah, that butler idea,               that's beautiful. Isn't that killer? (Aside to Jerry) I thought               I was getting the butler.",4
9517,Jerry,50," Don't worry, uh, we'll find something for you.",4
9518,Jerry,50," So Letterman didn't spark to your idea, huh?",4
9519,George,50," No, he said there was nothing he could do, and next time               I should probably break the Prozacs in half.",4
9520,Kramer,50," You, you guys wanna hold it down? I'm watchin' Jeopardy.",4
9521,Jerry,50, Would you give him the TV back?,4
9522,Kramer,50," Oh, by the way, George. Susan called for you a minute ago.",4
9523,George,50," I bet they're probably doing summersaults about us over               there. You think they get butler stories like that everyday? (He               calls Susan)",4
9524,Kramer,50, (To the TV) Who is Joseph Cotton? Giddee up!,4
9525,Susan,50, Hello?,4
9526,George,50," Hi, it's me. It's Georgie Boy. What's going on?",4
9527,Susan,50," What's going on? What's going on? I'll tell you what's going               on. I'm fired!",4
9528,George,50, Fired? Why?,4
9529,Susan,50," Because you kissed me. You kissed me, you stupid idiot!               Rita called Russell and he fired me over the phone.",4
9530,Kramer,50, (To the TV) What is pi? Ooh! Giddee up again.,4
9531,George,50, But I had no... I didn't realize.,4
9532,Susan,50," You didn't realize? How could you not realize? You're stupid!               You're a stupid, stupid man!",4
9533,George,50, I just feel terrible This is just terrible.,4
9534,Kramer,50," (To the TV once again) What is the cha-cha? Ooh, yes indeed.",4
9535,Susan,50, I'll speak to you later.,4
9536,George,50," (Hangs up phone and pauses) this is great! He fired her!               This is incredible, he fired her. I'm out, baby! I'm out!",4
9537,Jerry,50, Why did he fire her?,4
9538,George,50," Because I kissed her in the meeting. Russell found out,               he fired her over the phone. Finally, my stupidity pays off!",4
9539,Kramer,50," What is here comes the judge, here comes the judge!",4
9540,Jerry,50," You can't break up with her now. Her life is shattered.               You got her fired. You gotta be there for her.",4
9541,George,50, What?,4
9542,Jerry,50, You gotta at least wait until she gets another job.,4
9543,George,50, Another job?,4
9544,Jerry,50, Couple of interviews.,4
9545,George,50," Oh, this is unbelievable. I'm stuck. Every time I think               I'm out, they pull me back in. ",4
9546,Marla,50," Are you gonna leave after its over? You know, if we have               sex.",4
9547,Jerry,50, What? Leave? Where? Why?,4
9548,Marla,50," You know, the apartment.",4
9549,Jerry,50, Why would I leave? This is my apartment.,4
9550,Marla,50, Well what if it was my apartment?,4
9551,Jerry,50, Who gave you this idea I would wanna leave?,4
9552,Marla,50, Well Elaine said men like to leave after it's over.,4
9553,Jerry,50," Listen, I wouldn't put too much stock into what Elaine has               to say about relationships. She comes from a broken home, and I               mean that literally. A tree fell on her roof and cracked the whole               structure. Her parents got along beautifully, but her house was               in bad shape.",4
9554,Marla,50, Maybe I should get going.,4
9555,Jerry,50, What else did you say to her?,4
9556,Elaine,50, Nothin'. I was just givin' her the straight dope.,4
9557,Jerry,50," More like a dope was giving it to her straight. Another               cup of coffee with you, she'll wind up in a convent.",4
9558,Elaine,50," Listen, there was a lot more I could've told her, believe               me.",4
9559,Jerry,50," What is that about leaving after sex? Did I ever leave with               you?",4
9560,Elaine,50," You might've if I'd stayed. So you know what? I got served               with papers today. Ping is suing me. I need your virgin as a witness.               You better be nice to her.",4
9561,Jerry,50, I was trying to be.,4
9562,Elaine,50," Look at George. (On the other side of the restaurant) He               lucked out, huh?",4
9563,Jerry,50," Oh, you're not kiddin'. Who'd 've figured Susan would break               up with him? They had a good thing going.",4
9564,Elaine,50," Yeah, since she met him she's been vomited on, her family               cabin's been burned down, she learned her father's a homosexual,               and she got fired from a high paying network job. Yeah, they had               a real good thing going.",4
9565,George,50," What do I do? Well actually, I'm a writer. In fact, I'm               writing a comedy pilot for NBC right now.",4
9566,Woman,50," A sitcom? How can you write that crap? Carol, this guy's               writing a sitcom.",4
9567,Carol,50," A sitcom? Come on, let's go. (They leave)",4

10134,Passenger 3,52," Oh, You know what? *I* ordered the kosher             meal.",4

It's like a small surprise party every time               you go in  there. The worst way of flying, I think is ""standby"",               you ever fly standby?

10378,GEORGE,53, Was there any nostril penetration?,4
10379,JERRY,53," There may have been some incidental penetration. But from             her angle she was in no position to make the call. ",4
10380,GEORGE,53," So let's say in her mind she witnessed a pick. Okay, so             then what?",4
10381,JERRY,53," Is that so unforgivable? Is that like breaking a commandment?             Did God say to Moses thou shalt not pick? ",4
10382,GEORGE,53," I guarantee you that Moses was a picker. You wander throughh               the desert for forty years with that dry air. ... You telling me             you're not going to have occasion to clean house a little bit. ",4
10383,JERRY,53," Let me ask you something. If you were going out with somebody               and if she did that what would, would you do? Would you continue             going out with her?",4

10395,JERRY,53, But that's not what she thinks. ,4

10397,JERRY,53," All right. I'll call the agency. [Elaine grabs card from               George] Hello. Yes, I'm trying to get in touch with Tia Van Camp.               Do you know if she's been in town? She's been in town. Oh really.               well thank you very much.

10400,SUSAN,53, I need someone a little more stable.,4
10401,GEORGE,53," I'm not stable? I'm like a rock. I take these glasses off,               you can't tell the difference between me and a rock. I put these               glasses on a rock. You know what jumps into most people's minds?             Costanza! ",4
10402,SUSAN,53, People don't change.,4
10403,GEORGE,53," I change I change. Two weeks ago I tried a soft boiled               egg. Never liked it before. Now I'm dunkin a piece of toast in there             and I'm loving it. ",4

10405,GEORGE,53, And I am not a piece of toast. ,4
10406,SUSAN,53, I just don't think we have anything in common. ,4
10407,GEORGE,53," That's okay. That's good. You think Louie Pasteur and his               wife had anything in common? He was in the fields all day with the               cows, you know with the milk, examining the milk, delving into milk,               consummed with milk. Pasteurization, Homogenization, She was in             the kitchen killing cockroaches with a boot on each hand. ",4
10408,SUSAN,53, Why were there so many cockroaches? ,4
10409,GEORGE,53," Because. There was a lot of cake lying around the house.               Just sitting there going with all the excess milk from all the experiments             [grins] ",4
10410,SUSAN,53, And they got along?,4

12429,GEORGE,65," Anyway, I think everything else is okay. Unless of course she's faking. ",5
12430,ELAINE,65, Who's faking?,5
12431,GEORGE,65, Nothing.,5
12432,ELAINE,65, Faking what?,5
12433,GEORGE,65, Nobody's faking.,5
12434,ELAINE,65, Ah! Orgasm?,5
12435,GEORGE,65, She's not faking!,5
12436,ELAINE,65, How do you know?,5
12437,GEORGE,65," I know. I can tell. It's one of my powers. Why, did you ever fake?",5
12438,ELAINE,65, Of course.,5
12439,JERRY,65, Really?,5
12440,GEORGE,65, You faked?,5
12441,ELAINE,65, On occasion.,5
12442,JERRY,65, And the guy never knows?,5
12443,ELAINE,65, No.,5
12444,JERRY,65, How can he not know that?,5
12445,ELAINE,65, Because I was gooood.,5
12446,JERRY,65, I guess after that many beers he's probably a little groggy anyway.,5
12447,ELAINE,65, You didn't know.,5
12448,JERRY,65, What?,5
12449,ELAINE,65, You didn't know.,5
12450,JERRY,65, Are you saying...,5
12451,GEORGE,65, I think I'll have a piece of cake.,5
12452,JERRY,65, With me? ,5
12453,ELAINE,65, Well...,5
12454,JERRY,65, You faked with me? ,5
12455,ELAINE,65, Yeah.,5
12456,JERRY,65, You faked with me?,5
12457,ELAINE,65, Yeah.,5
12458,JERRY,65, No.,5
12459,ELAINE,65, Yeah.,5
12460,JERRY,65, You faked it?,5
12461,ELAINE,65, I faked it.,5
12462,JERRY,65," That whole thing, the whole production, it was all an act?",5
12463,ELAINE,65, Not bad huh?,5
12464,JERRY,65," What about the breathing, the panting, the moaning, the screaming?",5
12465,ELAINE,65," Fake, fake, fake, fake.",5
12466,JERRY,65," I'm stunned, I'm shocked! How many times did you do this?",5
12467,ELAINE,65," Uuuhm, all the time.",5
12468,JERRY,65, All the time?!,5
12469,GEORGE,65, We got a chocolate malt in here!,5
12470,JERRY,65, But I'm so good.,5
12471,GEORGE,65, I'm sure you are.,5
12472,ELAINE,65," Jerry, listen, it wasn't you. I just didn't have 'em back then. ",5
12473,JERRY,65, She faked.,5
12474,JERRY,65, Maybe they've all been faking.,5
12475,ELAINE,65, I'm sure they're not.,5
12476,GEORGE,65, Maybe Karin is faking.,5
12477,[location,65, Jerry's apartment],5
12478,KRAMER,65, She was probably joking.,5
12479,JERRY,65," No no, it was no joke.",5
12480,KRAMER,65, She didn't have any?,5
12481,JERRY,65, No. None.,5
12482,KRAMER,65, She faked 'em all.,5
12483,JERRY,65, Faked 'em all.,5
12484,KRAMER,65," Well so she faked 'em, so what?",5
12485,JERRY,65, The woman had an orgasm under false pretences. That's sexual perjury. ,5
12486,KRAMER,65, You know I heard her screaming from my apartment? She woke me up a few times.,5
12487,JERRY,65," How did she do it? She's like Meryl Streep this woman. And I had to work the equipment. I'm not unskilled, I'm in the union. If she'd at least told me, maybe I could have done something about it. ",5
12488,KRAMER,65, Yeah I could have helped you out.,5
12489,JERRY,65, What could you have done?,5
12490,KRAMER,65, I could have given you some pointers. I know how to press those buttons body.,5
12491,JERRY,65, I'm feeling very inadequate about the whole thing.,5
12492,KRAMER,65, Aaaaah.,5
12493,JERRY,65, Don't aaaaah! I'm supposed to do something with her later? I don't even think I wanna see her. ,5
12494,KRAMER,65, Giddy-up.,5
12495,JERRY,65, Hello... Oh hello Elaine.,5
12496,ELAINE,65, So we're having dinner tonight?,5
12497,JERRY,65," I don't know, I'm not really in the mood.",5
12498,ELAINE,65, Why? What's wrong? You're not still thinking about this afternoon are you? ,5
12499,JERRY,65," What, the grilled cheese? Naaah, they always burn the toast.",5
12500,ELAINE,65," Nooo, the other thing.",5
12501,JERRY,65, Oooh that. Well...,5
12502,ELAINE,65," Oh come on, Jerry. Making to much of a big deal about it. ",5
12503,JERRY,65, Yeah I guess. So you wanna meet at that place at seven thirty?,5
12504,ELAINE,65, Okay. ,5
12505,JERRY,65, All right.,5
12506,ELAINE,65," All right, see you later.",5
12507,JERRY,65, Bye.,5
12508,ELAINE,65, Bye.,5
12509,[location,65, Elaine's office],5
12510,RENE,65," Yeah, sometimes. ",5
12511,ELAINE,65," Really, like when?",5
12512,RENE,65," Like if we went to a Broadway show, if we had really good seats.",5
12513,ELAINE,65," Yeah, well...",5
12514,RENE,65," Well you know, if it's enough all ready and I just wanna get some sleep.",5
12515,[location,65, Jerry's apartment],5
12516,JERRY,65, I really don't feel like seeing her.,5
12517,KRAMER,65," You know, I faked it.",5
12518,JERRY,65, What?!,5
12519,KRAMER,65, Yeah.,5
12520,JERRY,65, You faked it? Why would you do that?,5
12521,KRAMER,65," Well you know, if it's enough already and I just wanna get some sleep.",5
12522,JERRY,65," Yeah, but why would you... ",5
12523,JERRY,65, Bad peach?,5
12524,KRAMER,65, It's terrible! ,5
12525,JERRY,65, Did you get that at Joe's?,5
12526,KRAMER,65," Yeah, of course I got it at Joe's.",5
12527,JERRY,65," That's surprising, his fruit is usually the best.",5
12528,KRAMER,65, You know what I'm gonna do? I'm gonna return this.,5
12529,JERRY,65, You're returning used fruit?,5
12530,KRAMER,65, Jerry this peach is sub par.,5
12531,[location,65, Joe's],5
12532,JOE,65, So what do you want me to do?,5
12533,KRAMER,65, I want restitution.,5
12534,JOE,65, Restitution? You want restitution? Why should I give you restitution?,5
12535,KRAMER,65, Because it's no good.,5
12536,JOE,65," When you put that fruit out, that's where it ends for me.",5
12537,KRAMER,65," It's still your fruit, you gotta stand behind your fruit.",5
12538,JOE,65, I stand behind my fruit.,5
12539,KRAMER,65, So...,5
12540,JOE,65," Hey, you got a bad peach? That's an act of God. He makes the peaches. I don't make the peaches, I sell the peaches. You have a problem? You talk to him.",5
12541,KRAMER,65," You know this whole place is going vrrrrrrrrrrrrt, downhill. I could have come in here last week with a bad plum but I let it go.",5
12542,KRAMER,65, Oh now you don't want my business.,5
12543,JOE,65," No, I don't want your business and from this moment you're banned from the store, you're banned!",5
12544,KRAMER,65, But what am I gonna do for fruit?,5
12545,[location,65, restaurant],5
12546,GEORGE,65," You seem like you really enjoyed your Risotto. You have a very contented air over there. You look very contented, very satisfied. Are you satisfied?",5
12547,KARIN,65, I'm very satisfied.,5
12548,GEORGE,65, I'm sure if you weren't satisfied you would probably say something wouldn't you?,5
12549,KARIN,65, I probably would. But then again I'm an enigma. ,5
12550,GEORGE,65, Hey listen... instead of the movie... maybe we'll go back and... you know...,5
12551,KARIN,65, Maybe.,5
12552,GEORGE,65, So... you feel okay about that whole thing... what we do in there... generally okay with everything in there?,5
12553,KARIN,65, Generally.,5
12554,GEORGE,65, Do you feel the way you feel after the Risotto?,5
12555,KARIN,65," No, I feel full after the Risotto.",5

12564,JERRY,65, Yeah. You don't want coffee or anything do you?,5
12565,ELAINE,65," I really admire actors, you know. It's just such an incredible skill. ",5
12566,JERRY,65," Yeah, yeah, can we get off of this? ",5
12567,ELAINE,65, What's the matter?,5
12568,JERRY,65, Nothing.,5
12569,ELAINE,65, You're not still thinking about that are you?,5

13442,Kramer,68," Yes!! Yes, that's what they do! They live in the bathroom!               All right, what are we going to do? We are going to get our money               back, right? ",5
13443,Jerry,68," I don't know. This sweater really itches me. You want it?             ",5
13444,Kramer,68, Yeah. ,5
13445,Elaine,68," Hello.... hello, oh... ",5
13446,Jake,68," Well, you notice anything? ",5
13447,Elaine,68," You have cleaned out the whole apartment and you're making               dinner. Oh, you are a perfect, you are a perfect man. ",5
13448,Jake,68, Ooh... ,5
13449,Elaine,68, Did anyone call? ,5
13450,Jake,68," I got a few messages, I wrote them down. ",5
13451,Elaine,68, Where are they? ,5
13452,Jake,68," Lets see, they are...here they are. ",5
13453,Elaine,68," Thank you. Heh, I'll call you back.Ooh, Myra had the baby!               Oh, my God that's wonderful! Who called? ",5
13454,Jake,68, She did. ,5
13455,Elaine,68," She did? Oh, that's so great! ",5
13456,Jake,68, Where do you keep the corkscrew? ,5
13457,Elaine,68, In the drawer on the right. Hmm... ,5
13458,Jake,68, What? ,5
13459,Elaine,68, Oh it's nothing. ,5
13460,Jake,68, What is it? ,5
13461,Elaine,68, It's nothing. ,5
13462,Jake,68, Tell me. ,5
13463,Elaine,68," Well, I was just curious why you didn't use an exclamation               point? ",5
13464,Jake,68, What are you talking about? ,5
13465,Elaine,68," See, right here you wrote ""Myra had the baby"",               but you didn't use an exclamation point. ",5
13466,Jake,68, So? ,5
13467,Elaine,68," So, it's nothing. Forget it, forget it, I just find it               curious. ",5
13468,Jake,68, What's so curious about it? ,5
13469,Elaine,68," Well, I mean if one of your close friends had a baby and               I left you a message about it, I would use an exclamation point.             ",5
13470,Jake,68," Well, maybe I don't use my exclamation points as haphazardly               as you do. ",5
13471,Elaine,68," You don't think that someone having a baby warrants an               exclamation point. ",5
13472,Jake,68," Hey, I just chalked down the message. I didn't know I was               required to capture the mood of each caller. ",5
13473,Elaine,68," I just thought you would be a little more excited about               a friend of mine having a baby. ",5
13474,Jake,68," Ok, I'm excited. I just don't happen to like exclamation               points. ",5
13475,Elaine,68," Well, you know Jake, you should learn to use them. Like               the way I'm talking right now, I would put an exclamation points               at the end of all these sentences! On this one! And on that one!             ",5
13476,Jerry,68, You're out of your mind you know that. ,5
13477,Elaine,68, What? ,5
13478,Jerry,68," It's an exclamation point! It's a line with a dot under               it. ",5
13479,Elaine,68," Well, I felt a call for one. ",5
13480,Jerry,68," A call for one, you know I thought I've heard everything.               I've never heard a relationship being affected by a punctuation.             ",5
13481,Elaine,68, I found it very troubling that he didn't use one. ,5
13482,Jerry,68, George was right. Didn't take you long. ,5
13483,Kramer,68, Anything new on that guy on drugs? ,5
13484,Elaine,68, He's not on drugs. ,5
13485,Kramer,68," Then why the sniffing? Who walks around *sniff, sniff*               sniffing? ",5
13486,Elaine,68," All right, here, you call him right now. See if he's sniffing               right now. ",5
13487,Jerry,68, Good idea. ,5
13488,Voice on the phone,68, Prophet and Goldstein. ,5
13489,Jerry,68," Yes, I'd like to speak to Barry Prophet, please. ",5
13490,voice,68, I'm sorry he's out of town. ,5
13491,Jerry,68, Out of town? ,5
13492,voice,68," Yes, he went to South America. ",5
13493,Jerry,68, South America? ,5
13494,Kramer,68, South America? ,5
13495,Jerry,68," I'll call back, thank you. He went to South America! ",5
13496,Kramer,68, Yyyeeaaah!! ,5
13497,Elaine,68, So what? ,5
13498,Jerry,68, Who goes to South America? ,5

13500,Jerry,68," Yeah, and they come back with things taped to they're large               intestine. ",5
13501,Elaine,68," So, because of a few bad apples you're gonna impugn an               entire continent? ",5
13502,Jerry,68," Yes, I'm impugning a continent. ",5
13503,Kramer,68," Well, I say we're going to take our money right now! ",5
13504,Newman,68," Hey, hey... ",5
13505,Jerry,68, Hello Newman. ,5
13506,Newman,68," Hello Jerry. So, any news? ",5
13507,Kramer,68," Yeah, he skipped out and *ptruut* went to South America!             ",5
13508,Newman,68," South America?! What kind of snow blower did you get us               mixed up with? ",5
13509,Elaine,68," Ok, gentlemen. The fact remains you still have no proof.               This is all speculation and hearsay. ",5
13510,Kramer,68," Wait, there is one way to find out. We set up a sting.               You know like Abscam. Like Abscam Jerry. ",5
13511,Elaine,68," What are you gonna do? You gonna put on a phony beard and               dress-up like Arab sheiks and sit around in some hotel room. I mean               come on... ",5
13512,Jerry,68," Wait a second. Maybe there is someway we can tempt him and               find out... ",5
13513,Newman,68," If we put our three heads together we should come up with               something. ",5
13514,Kramer,68, What's today? ,5
13515,Newman,68, It's Thursday. ,5
13516,Kramer,68, Really? Feels like Tuesday. ,5
13517,Newman,68," Tuesday has no feel. Monday has a feel, Friday has a feel,               Sunday has a feel.... ",5
13518,Kramer,68, I feel Tuesday and Wednesday... ,5
13519,Jerry,68," All right, shut up the both of you! You're making me nervous.               Where is he already? He should've been out of work by now. ",5
13520,Newman,68," Hey, you know this is kind of fun. ",5
13521,Kramer,68," Yeah, maybe we oughta become private detectives... ",5
13522,Jerry,68, Yeah maybe you should. ,5
13523,Kramer,68, Maybe I will. ,5
13524,Newman,68," Yeah, me too. ",5

13528,Jerry,68," No, you stay in the car. ",5
13529,Newman,68, Who made you the leader? ,5

13598,Lippman,68," And, anyway I was just reading your final edit, um, there               seems to be an inordinate number of exclamation points. ",5

13600,Lippman,68," Oh, ""It was damp and chilly afternoon, so I decided               to put on my sweatshirt!"" ",5

Should we duck down behind the seats so they don't               see us watching them? Tennis is basically just ping-pong and the               players are standing on the table. That's all it is. And that goofy               scoring, you win one point and all the sudden you're up by 15. Two               points, 30-love. 30-love. Sounds like an English call girl. ""That'll               be 30, love... And could you be a little quieter next time, please,               shh.""",5
13690,Jerry,70, Are these seats unbelievable or what?,5
13691,George,70, Where's the sunblock?,5
13692,Jerry,70, Here.,5
13693,George,70, 25? You don't have anything higher?,5
13694,Jerry,70," What, are you on Mercury?",5
13695,George,70," I need higher. This has paba in it, I need paba-free.",5
13696,Jerry,70, You got a problem with paba?,5
13697,George,70," Yes, I have a problem with paba.",5
13698,Jerry,70, You don't even know what paba is.,5
13699,George,70, I know enough to stay away from it.,5
13700,George,70, So are you going to Todd's party this weekend?,5
13701,Jerry,70, I'll go if someone else drives. You going?,5
13702,George,70, Gwen really wants to go.,5
13703,Jerry,70, You're bringing a date to a party?,5
13704,George,70, No good?,5
13705,Jerry,70," A party is a bad date situation. It doesn't matter who you're               with. You could be with J. Edgar Hoover. You don't want to sit and               talk with Hoover all night. You want to circulate. (Makes hand motions)               Ho, ho, ho.",5
13706,George,70," Why'd you pick Hoover? Was he that interesting to talk               to?",5
13707,Jerry,70," Well I would think, with the law enforcement and the cross               dressing. Seems like an interesting guy.",5
13708,George,70," Yeah I guess. What can I do? I gotta take her with me.               Todd introduced us, I'm obligated.",5
13709,Jerry,70, That woman is absolutely stunning.,5
13710,George,70, The Croat? [the tennis player],5
13711,Jerry,70," Not the Croat, the lineswoman. That is the most beautiful               lineswoman I've ever seen.",5
13712,George,70," Yeah, she's a B.L.",5
13713,Jerry,70, B.L.?,5
13714,George,70," Beautiful lineswoman. I'm going to go to the concession               stand and get some real sunblock. You want anyting? Jerry? (Jerry               is staring at the lineswoman) Jerry?",5
13715,Coworker,70," You know, I just heard the Lexington line is out.",5
13716,Elaine,70, You are kidding me. How am I supposed to get to this meeting?,5
13717,Coworker,70, Take a car service. We have an account.,5
13718,Elaine,70," Oh forget it, I hate those. Everytime I take one, the driver               will *not* stop talking to me. No matter how disinterested I seem               he just keeps yakking away. Blah, blah, blah, blah. Why does everything               always have to have a social componant? Now a stage coach, that               would have been a good situation for me. Cause I'm in the coach,               and the driver is way up there on the stage. ",5
13719,Coworker,70," Well you're not going to get a cab now. Four thirty in               the afternoon? Read a magazine, keep your head down.",5
13720,Elaine,70, I guess that could work.,5
13721,Announcer,70," And that is it. The match to Ms. Natalia Valdoni. Comming               up next, mens single, but for now let's stop a minute and take a               look at our beautiful tennis center backdrop.",5
13722,Kramer,70," Hey, hey, it's George.",5
13723,Announcer,70," Holy cow it's a scorcher. Boy I bet you that guy can               cover a lot of court. Hey buddy, they got a new invention. It's               called a napkin. We'll take a station break and continue with more...",5
13724,Driver,70," Dag Gavershole Plaza (sp?) huh? (Elaine ignores him) Pendant               Publishing, that's books right? (Elaine is annoyed and still ignoring               him) Miss?",5
13725,Elaine,70, Pardon me?,5
13726,Driver,70," Books, that's what you do?",5
13727,Elaine,70, Yeah.,5
13728,Driver,70," Yeah, I don't read much myself, (Elaine is annoyed) well               you know besides the paper. Yeah a lot of people read to relax,               but not me. You know what I do? ",5
13729,Elaine,70," You know I'm having a lot of trouble, um, hearing you back               here. So...",5
13730,Driver,70," (Yelling) I said you know what I do (Elaine is very annoyed)               when I want to relax? The Jumble. Hey do you make a book of Jumbles?",5
13731,Elaine,70, I'm going to have to be honest with you. I'm going deaf.,5
13732,Driver,70, Going deaf?,5
13733,Elaine,70, What?,5
13734,Driver,70, Oh I'm sorry.,5
13735,Elaine,70, It can be very frustrating.,5
13736,Driver,70, Hey what about a hearing aid?,5
13737,Elaine,70," An I fearing AIDS? Oh, yeah sure, who isn't. But you know               you gotta live your life.",5
13738,Driver,70," No, no I said. Ehhh, forget it. (Elaine looks pleased)",5
13739,Jerry,70," I can't take my eyes off that lineswoman. That lineswoman               is absolutely mesmerizing.",5
13740,George,70, Boy you are really smitten.,5
13741,Jerry,70, I gotta talk to her. What do you think?,5
13742,George,70," Cold? How are you going to do that? You're not one of those               guys.",5
13743,Jerry,70," I'm going to psyche myself into it like those people that               just walk across the hot coals.",5
13744,George,70," They're not mocked and humiliated when they get to the               other side.",5
13745,Jerry,70, I have to. I won't be able to live with myself.,5
13746,George,70," Wait a minute Jerry, there's a bigger issue here. If you               go through that wall and become one of those guys I'll be left here               on this side. Take me with you.",5
13747,Jerry,70, I can't.,5
13748,George,70, What are you going to say?,5
13749,Jerry,70," I don't know, ""Hi"".",5
13750,George,70," You think you're going to the other side with ""Hi""?               You're not going to make it.",5
13751,Radio,70, Base to 92 come in,5
13752,Driver,70, Yes this is 92,5
13753,Driver,70, Righteo,5
13754,Radio,70, 794 Bleeker the party's Hanks. Tom Hanks.,5
13755,Elaine,70," Tom Hanks? After me you're picking up Tom Hanks? I love               him.",5
13756,Driver,70, So I guess your hearing goes in and out huh?,5
13757,Elaine,70, Yeah. Yes it does...,5
13758,Driver,70," Yeah. You know what I think? I think you made that whole               thing up. ",5
13759,Elaine,70," No no, no no.",5
13760,Driver,70," Yeah yeah, I know your type. You're too good to make conversation               with someone like me. Oh god forbid you could discuss the Jumbles.               But to go so far as to pretend you're almost deaf, I mean that is               truly disgusting. And Mr. Tom Hanks, may I say he too would be disgusted               by your behavior.",5
13761,Jerry,70," Excuse me. (Woman ignores him) Excuse me? (Still ignores               him) Oh that's nice. That's right ignore me. That's real polite.               Nobody's even talking to you. All you big lineswoman. Oh you've               got some kind of a cool job. I know your type thinking your too               good for everyone, but it's women like you (woman turns around and               notices him) oh well, what are you deaf?",5
13762,Laura,70, Bingo.,5
13763,Kramer,70, And you're saying she's deaf.,5
13764,Jerry,70," I'm not *saying* she's deaf, she's deaf.",5
13765,Kramer,70, Can't hear a thing.,5
13766,Jerry,70, Can't hear a thing.,5
13767,Kramer,70, And you're going to go out with her.,5
13768,Jerry,70," Yeah, isn't that something?",5
13769,Elaine,70, Hey.,5
13770,Jerry and Kramer,70, Hey.,5
13771,Kramer,70, Hey I know how to sign. ,5
13772,Jerry,70, Really?,5
13773,Kramer,70," Yeah when I was 8, I had a deaf cousin who lived with us               for about a year. (signing as he speaks) So I haven't been able               to do it in a while.",5
13774,Elaine,70, What is this about?,5
13775,Jerry,70, I met this deaf lineswoman at the tennis match.,5
13776,Elaine,70," You are kidding. That is amazing. (She pushes Jerry, Jerry               falls back into Kramer.) I just took a car service from work and               to get the driver to not talk to me, I pretended I was going deaf.",5
13777,Jerry,70, Wow good plan.,5
13778,Elaine,70," Oh didn't work. He caught me hearing. I know it's terrible,               but I'm not a terrible person.",5
13779,Jerry and Kramer,70, No.,5
13780,Elaine,70," No. When I shoo squirrels away, I always say ""get               out of here"". I never ever throw things at them and try to               injure them like other people. ",5
13781,Jerry,70, That's nice.,5
13782,Elaine,70," Yeah, and when I see freaks in the street I never, ever               stare at them. Yet, I'm careful not to look away, you know, because               I want to make the freaks feel comfortable.",5
13783,Jerry,70, That's nice for the freaks.,5
13784,Elaine,70," Yeah, and I don't poof up my hair when I got to a movie               so people behind me can see. I've got to make it up to this guy               or I won't be able to live with myself. What can I do?",5
13785,Jerry,70," Why don't you get him some tickets or something, how about               that friend of yours that works at the ticket area.",5
13786,Kramer,70," Yeah yeah Pete, he can get you great tickets to something.               Like a rock concert. Whatever you like.",5
13787,Elaine,70," Oh, thanks Kramer.",5
13788,Kramer,70," You got it. Hey Jerry, do me a favor. The next time you               see that lineswoman ask her how those ball boys get those jobs.               I would love to be able to do that.",5
13789,Jerry,70," Kramer, I think perhaps you've overlooked one of the key               aspects of this activity. It's ball *boys*, not ball men. There               are no ball men.",5
13790,Elaine,70, Yeah I think he's right. I've never seen a ball man.,5
13791,Kramer,70, Well there ought to be ball men.,5
13792,Jerry,70," All right I'll talk to her. If you want to be a ball man               go ahead, break the ball barrier.",5
13793,Elaine,70," Hey you know a friend of mine from work said that she saw               George at the tennis match on TV yesterday.",5
13794,Kramer,70," Yeah, yeah me too. Yeah he was at the snack bar eating               a hot fudge sundae. He had it all over his face. He was wearing               that chocolate on his face like a beard and they got in there real               nice and tight. And he's... (Imitates scooping up ice cream.)",5
13795,Gwen,70, I'm sorry George.,5
13796,George,70," I don't understand things were going so great. What happened?               Something must have happened.",5
13797,Gwen,70," It's not you, it's me.",5
13798,George,70," You're giving me the ""it's not you, it's me""               routine? I invented ""it's not you, it's me"". Nobody tells               me it's them not me, if it's anybody it's me.",5
13799,Gwen,70," All right, George, it's you.",5
13800,George,70, You're *damn* right it's me.,5
13801,Gwen,70, I was just trying to...,5
13802,George,70," I know what you were trying to do. Nobody does it better               than me.",5
13803,Gwen,70, I'm sure you do it very well.,5
13804,George,70," Yes well unfortunately you'll never get the chance to find               out.",5
13805,Jerry,70, But I thought things were going great.,5
13806,George,70, Yeah so did I.,5
13807,Jerry,70, Did she say why?,5
13808,George,70," No. She tried to give me the ""it's not you, it's me""               routine.",5
13809,Jerry,70, But that's your routine.,5
13810,George,70, Yeah. Well aparently word's out.,5
13811,Kramer,70," Hey, George, I saw you on TV yesterday.",5
13812,George,70, Really? At the tennis match?,5
13813,Kramer,70, Yeah you were at the snack bar eating a hot fudge sundae.,5
13814,George,70, Get out of here. I didn't see any cameras there.,5
13815,Kramer,70," Oh, the cameras was, vrooom, there. The announcers, they               made a couple of cracks about you.",5
13816,George,70, Cracks? What were they saying?,5
13817,Kramer,70," That you had ice cream all over your face. They were talking               about how funny you looked.",5
13818,George,70, Maybe Gwen saw it. Maybe that's what did it.,5
13819,Kramer,70, Well I'll tell you it wasn't a pretty sight.,5
13820,George,70, She must have seen me eating it on TV.,5
13821,Jerry,70," So she sees you with hot fudge on your face and she ends               it? You really think she would be that superficial?",5
13822,George,70, Why not. I would be.,5
13823,Jerry,70," Hello... Oh hi dad... You saw him?... Really with the ice               cream?... All right I'll talk to you later, bye. ",5
13824,George,70, You're parents saw me on TV?,5
13825,Jerry,70, Yeah.,5
13826,George,70, This is nighmare. Kramer how long was I on?,5
13827,Kramer,70, It felt like 8 seconds.,5
13828,George,70," One-one-thousand, two-one-thousand, three-one-thousand.",5
13829,Elaine,70," I heard you *really* inhaled that thing. Did anyone tape               it?",5
13830,George,70, Can we move on?,5
13831,Jerry,70," He thinks Gwen broke up with him because she saw him eating               the ice cream on TV.",5
13832,Elaine,70, Oh come on. If she's that superficial you don't want her.,5
13833,George,70, Yes I do.,5
13834,Elaine,70, So I guess you're not going to Todd's party on Friday.,5
13835,George,70," Well I can't now, Gwen's going to be there.",5
13836,Kramer,70, Well she should be the one that shouldn't go.,5
13837,Jerry,70," Well if a couple breaks up and have plans to go to a neutral               place, who withdraws? What's the ettiquite? ",5
13838,Kramer,70, Excellent question.,5
13839,Jerry,70," I think she should withdraw. She's the breaker, he's the               breakee. He needs to get on with his life.",5
13840,Elaine,70, I beg to differ.,5
13841,Jerry,70, Really.,5
13842,Elaine,70," He's the *loser*. She's the victor. To the victor belong               the spoils.",5
13843,Jerry,70," Well I don't care, I don't want to go anyway. I don't want               to fight that traffic on Friday night.",5
13844,Elaine,70, Well we can take the car service from my office.,5
13845,Jerry,70, Really?,5
13846,Elaine,70," Yeah, they don't know.",5
13847,Kramer,70," All right, I'll see you later.",5
13848,Jerry,70, Okay.,5
13849,George,70," ""To the victor goes the spoils."" What are you               going to do tonight?",5
13850,Jerry,70, Oh I got a date with Laura the lineswoman.,5
13851,George,70, Oh. (he stands there),5
13852,Jerry,70," Why? (George fiddles with the lock on the door.) Well what               are you doing?",5
13853,George,70," Well I was just going to wander the streets. Wouldn't want               to tag along with you or anything.",5
13854,Jerry,70," Oh, uh, do you want to come with us?",5
13855,George,70," Jerry please, that's very nice, but, uh, (closes the door)               where would we be going?",5
13856,George,70," So, I've got ice cream all over my face. There were no               napkins there. Whoever it was that's responsible for stocking that               concession stand cost me a relationship.",5
13857,Laura,70, They never have napkins there.,5
13858,Jerry,70," Let's get the check. (Waves in the air) Is this considered               signing? Do you do this when you want the check? Really. I know               a sign, that's my first sign.",5
13859,Laura,70," Uh, oh. That couple is breaking up.",5
13860,George,70, They're breaking up? How do you know?,5
13861,Jerry,70, She reads lips.,5
13862,George,70, What are they saying now?,5
13863,Laura,70," ""It's not you, it's me.""",5
13864,George,70," (Holding his drink up to his mouth) Oh my gosh, I just               had a great idea. She could come to the party tomorrow and read               Gwen's lips for me.",5
13865,Jerry,70, (Puts his hand over his mouth) What?,5
13866,George,70," (Puts nuts into his mouth, and in the process covers his               mouth) We bring her to the party, and she can tell me what Gwen               is saying about me.",5
13867,Jerry,70," (Holds his drink up to his mouth) She's not a novelty act,               George. Where you hire her out for weddings and bar mitzvas.",5
13868,George,70," (Puts his hands on his face, rubbing his eyes) Look. It's               a skill, just like juggling. She probably enjoys showing it off.",5
13869,Jerry,70," (Puts his napkin over his mouth) I don't know George. I'm               not sure about this.",5
13870,George,70," (Puts his arms in the air, stretching, and covers his mouth               with an arm) Could you ask her, just ask her. If she says no, case               closed.",5
13871,Jerry,70, (Puts his hand on his chin over his mouth) All right.,5
13872,Jerry,70," Uh Laura, George was wondering if...",5
13873,Laura,70, Sure. I'll do it.,5
13874,Jerry,70, So I really had a good time.,5
13875,Laura,70," Yeah, me too.",5
13876,Jerry,70, So you want to go to the party on Friday night?,5
13877,Laura,70, Yeah.,5
13878,Jerry,70," All right, we're taking a car service. So we'll swing by               and pick you up. How about six? (Laura looks offended). Six is good.               (Laura looks offended and angry). You got a problem with six? (Laura               opens the door and gets out). What? What? ",5
13879,Man,70," Okay listen up people. There are plenty of you here, but we've               only got two spots to fill. Good luck.",5
13880,Boy,70," Hey pops, isn't there a better way to spend your twilight               years?",5
13881,Kramer,70," I may be old, but I'm spry.",5
13882,Boy,70," The tryout lasts three and a half to four hours. Are you up               for it?",5
13883,Kramer,70, Oh I'll be up for it punk.,5
13884,Jerry,70," See I was saying ""six"" but she thought I was saying               ""sex"". We straightened the whole thing out though.",5
13885,George,70," She confused ""six"" with ""sex""?",5
13886,Jerry,70, Yeah.,5
13887,George,70," Well if she can't tell ""six"" from ""sex""               then how is she going to lip read from across the room?",5
13888,Jerry,70," Well ""six"" and ""sex"" are close.",5
13889,George,70," It's two completely different sounds. ""ih"" and               ""eh"".",5
13890,Jerry,70, Eh.,5
13891,George,70, It seems like a problem.,5
13892,Jerry,70, Well I'm not dating any other deaf women.,5

13894,Jerry,70, You're kidding.,5

13896,George,70, When is that car service comming?,5
13897,Jerry,70," In five minutes. He's then going to pick us up, then we're               going to pick up Elaine, and Laura is going to meet us there.",5
13898,George,70," If this lip reading thing works tonight do you know how               incredible this is going to be? It's like having Superman for your               friend.",5
13899,Jerry,70, I know. It's like X-ray vision.,5
13900,George,70," If we could just harness this power and use it for our               own personal gain, there'd be no stopping us.",5
13901,Newman,70," I hear you've got some lip reader working for you. You               gotta let me use her for one day. Just one day.",5
13902,Jerry,70, Can't do it Newman.,5
13903,Newman,70," But Jerry, we've got this new supervisor down at the post               office. He's working behind this glass. I know they're talking about               me. They're going to transfer me, I know it. Two hours, give me               two hours.",5
13904,Jerry,70, Not going to happen.,5
13905,Newman,70," (Sinister) All right, all right. All right you go ahead.               You go ahead and keep it secret. But you remember this. When you               control the mail, you control... information.",5
13906,Jerry,70, Oh just pull over right there by the stop sign.,5
13907,Driver (The same driver as before),70, Pardon me sir?,5
13908,Jerry,70, I said pull over by the stop sign.,5
13909,Driver,70," I'm so sorry, you'll have to forgive me. I can't hear a               damn thing. I went to that rock concert last night at the garden.               My seats were right up agains the speaker. It's a heavy metal group.               Metalla-something.",5

13915,Driver,70, My ears are still ringing. Some woman's idea of a joke.,5
13916,Driver,70, Get out. Get out. Go on. Hey. Shut the door.,5
13917,Jerry,70," You know the whole idea of taking the car service was so               I wouldn't have to fight the traffic on Friday night.",5
13918,Jerry,70," I know. I'm late. Hey now I know two signs, (puts his hand               in the air) check, and (points to his watch) late. Hey this is the               guy you helped become the first ball man.",5
13919,Kramer,70, She doesn't know what she's talking about.,5
13920,Todd,70, Guys you made it.,5
13921,George,70, Hey hey.,5
13922,Todd,70, Sorry to hear about Gwen.,5
13923,George,70," Why? Did she say something to you about why she broke up               with me?",5
13924,Todd,70," Oh no. Tonight will be the first chance I've had to talk               to her. Look George, I'm friends with both of you. I can't betray               her confidence by telling you anything.",5
13925,George,70," I wouldn't hear of it, huh. It's none of my business. You               should try to find out everything you possibly can. In fact, I'll               even stay all the way on the other side of the room so there's no               chance of me overhearing anything.",5
13926,Todd,70, You are so centered.,5
13927,George,70," (to the others) Let's go, let's go. All right what are               they saying?",5

13931,Kramer,70," ""You've got something between your teeth""",5
13932,George,70, What?,5
13933,Kramer,70," No that's what he said. ""That's interesting. I love               carrots, but I hate carrot soup. And I hate peas, but I love pea               soup."" So do I.",5
13934,Elaine,70," She's so wild. Can I borrow her for a few hours tomorrow               afternoon?",5
13935,Jerry,70, No. If I lend her to you I'll have to lend her to everybody.,5
13936,Gwen,70, I don't envy you Todd. The place is going to be a mess.,5
13937,Todd,70," Maybe you can stick around after everybody leaves and we               can sweep together.",5
13938,Kramer,70," ""Why don't you stick around and we can sleep together.""",5
13939,George,70, What?,5
13940,Kramer,70," ""You want me to sleep with you?""",5
13941,Todd,70, I don't want to sweep alone.,5

13945,Kramer,70," ""What? You're crazy.""",5
13946,George,70, I heard your whole conversation.,5
13947,Gwen,70, How?,5
13948,Kramer,70," ""How?""",5

13950,Gwen,70," No I didn't. I said ""sweep"". Let's sweep together,               you know with a broom. Cleaning up.",5
13951,Kramer,70," ""... with a broom, cleaning up.""",5

13973,George,72, Well a lot of people consider me small and prestigious.,5

13984,Jerry,72," ""Of course"" was the last thing he said?",5

13989,Elaine,72, Why don't you go ahead and call him?,5
13990,George,72," Because he made a big deal about how I understand everything               immediately. That's what",5

14050,Jerry,72, Hmm. Not bad.,5
14051,George,72, What's the worst thing that could happen?,5

14681,JERRY,77," I beg your pardon? Cinnamon takes a back seat to no Bobka. People         love cinnamon. It should be on tables at restaurants along with salt and         pepper. Anytime anyone says, ""Oh This is so good. What's in it?""         The answer invariably comes back, Cinnamon. Cinnamon. Again and again.         Lesser Bobka - I think not.",5

15145,JERRY,79," No. She wouldn't say anything. She just kept shaking her head         like this (Imitating Audrey) ",5
15146,GEORGE,79, Maybe she's diabetic. ,5
15147,JERRY,79, No. She carries Entemanns doughnuts in her purse. ,5
15148,GEORGE,79, Maybe you said something that offended her. ,5

15150,GEORGE,79, Like at the airport? (getting excited) ,5

15178,ELAINE,79, Get out! ,5
15179,KRAMER,79," It's uncanny! It's like they chopped off your arms and legs,         dipped you in plastic, and screwed you back all together, and stuck you         on a pedestal. It's really quite exquisite. ",5
15180,GEORGE,79," Kramer, what's the name of the store with the mannequin? ",5

15195,GEORGE,79," Whoa, look at this. This is a beautiful suit. Huh? ",5

15204,SALESWOMAN,79," I told you, I don't know. ",5
15205,ELAINE,79," (irritated, but still polite) Well, is there somebody         around here I could talk to who would know? ",5
15206,SALESWOMAN,79, Why? ,5
15207,ELAINE,79, Isn't it obvious? This mannequin looks exactly like me. ,5
15208,ELAINE,79," (upset) Did you just roll your eyes at him? Because let         me tell you something, if anobody should be rolling their eyes, it is         me at him about you. ",5

15210,ELAINE,79," What are you saying, that I'm not good enough for this hideous         dress? (looking at her name tag) Listen Natasha... I wouldn't be         caught dead wearing your crummy little euro-trash rags. (to George)         I'll meet you outside. ",5
15211,SALESWOMAN,79, What is her problem? ,5
15212,GEORGE,79," Pfft! What can you do? (looking at a tag on the suit)         Is this the price tag? ",5
15213,SALESWOMAN,79, Yes. ,5
15214,GEORGE,79," Yes, hello. Party's over. (taking off the suit) ",5
15215,SALESWOMAN,79," I'll tell you a little secret. We're having an unadvertised         sale starting Friday, that suit will be half-price. ",5
15216,GEORGE,79, So you think you can put the suit aside and hold it for me? ,5
15217,SALESWOMAN,79," Oh, I'm afraid I could't do that. It wouldn't be fair to         the other customers. ",5
15218,GEORGE,79," Oh yes, of course, and we have to be fair. (placing the suit         further away in the rack) ",5

15222,ELAINE,79," I don't know. They wouldn't tell me. (Jerry is not listening,         he's looking at two women sitting in the other booth) Jerry? Je...         Hello? ",5

15228,WOMAN 2,79," Yes, I was full. ",5

15230,WOMAN 2,79," No, I'm not a psycho. ",5
15231,JERRY,79," Exactly. You're not a psycho. You've been very helpful. Thank         you very much. Allow me to leave the tip. (sits back with Elaine and         Kramer) Well, I think we proven who the psycho is. ",5

15252,GEORGE,79," (outside, looking the guy trying the suit through the window,         and thinking out loud) What's this? Can't I leave this place for a         second? (goes in, take off his jacket, walks to the guy and talks to         him with an european accent) Can I help you? ",5
15253,BOB,79, I'm buying the suit. ,5
15254,GEORGE,79," No, no, no, this suit is not for sale. (tries to take off         the suit from the guy) ",5

15273,JERRY,79," Audrey, I got to be honest with you. I'm a very curious guy. It's         my nature. I need to know things. Not tasting the apple pie the other         day, I can't get past it. You obviously like pies. You carry doughnuts         in your bag, you're not averse to pastry. Surely you could see how such         a thing would prey on my mind. ",5
15274,AUDREY,79, Can we drop this? ,5

15303,GEORGE,79, Why didn't you just tell her? ,5
15304,JERRY,79," I don't think that's the kind of thing you wanna hear about your         father. But I'll tell you when he came out of that bathroom and he was         kneading that dough, it was a wild scene. ",5
15305,GEORGE,79, How could he not have washed? ,5
15306,JERRY,79," Even if you're not gonna soap up, at least pretend for my benefit.         Turn the water on, do something. ",5
15307,GEORGE,79," Yeah, just like I do. ",5

15314,GEORGE,79," I got to get downtown and buy that suit. The store opens in twenty         minutes. ",5

15320,GEORGE,79," (George takes out the suit from the other rack) Well,         look at this. (innocently) This doesn't belong here! Someone has         made a terrible mistake. ",5
15321,BOB,79, You bastard! You hid the suit. ,5
15322,GEORGE,79," Hid? I have no idea how this suit got misplaced. Nevertheless,         I do believe I shall purchase it. ",5
15323,BOB,79," I hope you rot in that suit. I'm gonna get you for this. I don't         know how, but I'm gonna get you. You are going to pay! ",5

15327,JERRY,79," Yeah, all right. Go ahead. (not very interested) ",5
15328,ELAINE,79," There's this blind guy at a party I was at, and he felt my face         for a really long time. You know, to see what I looked like. He almost         put his finger up my nose. ",5
15329,JERRY,79," Hum... ok, what else you got? ",5
15330,ELAINE,79," OK, I'm not gonna tell you the rest of the list. ",5
15331,JERRY,79," Oh, because I didn't think the blind guy did it? ",5
15332,ELAINE,79, Because you have an attitude. ,5
15333,JERRY and ELAINE,79, Oh! ,5
15334,JERRY,79, Georgio! Nice duds! ,5

15337,ELAINE,79," Yeah, like a swoosh. ",5
15338,JERRY,79, Yeah. ,5
15339,ELAINE,79," It must be the fabric. It's rubbing between you thighs when you         walk. That's what's making that swooshy sound. ",5
15340,GEORGE,79," I probably didn't hear it on the way over because of the street         noise. (he panics) This is no good! I got to meet these guys from         MacKenzie for lunch in half an hour! ",5
15341,JERRY,79, So what? What would they care? ,5
15342,GEORGE,79," This MacKenzie, he's a bit of a nut. Someone told me he fired         the last guy because his nose whistled when he breathed. ",5
15343,JERRY,79," So you think you're not gonna get the job because your pants make         a noise? ",5
15344,GEORGE,79," Let's say it comes down to me and one other guy. He's got a nice         quiet suit, and I'm whooshing all over the place! Who do you think he's         gonna hire? ",5

15598,JERRY,81," Yes, yes, you have.",5
15599,UNCLE LEO,81, Who told you when you went to school that you print well?,5
15600,JERRY,81," You did, you did.",5
15601,UNCLE LEO (to Meryl),81," When he was younger, he had a beautiful penmanship.         I used to encourage him to print.",5
15602,JERRY,81, I'm a good printer.,5
15603,UNCLE LEO,81," I remember your 'V.' It was like a perfect triangle. Whoa,         there's my bus! <Rushes out.> Hello! Wait! <Jerry tries to catch         Leo before he runs off to tell him about his ""pretend marriage,""         but doesn't make it.>",5
15604,GREG,81," I'm glad you're here. This can get really boring. Do you know where         I can get some good olives?",5
15605,ELAINE,81, I can find out.,5
15606,GREG,81, Would ya?,5
15607,ELAINE,81," Sure. <Thinks - Ooh, a project. That's a definite signal!>",5
15608,GREG,81," By the way, you look really great in that leotard.",5
15609,ELAINE,81," Oh, thanks. <Thinks - That's no signal, who wouldn't like         me in this leotard? I look amazing in this leotard.>",5
15610,GREG,81," Hey, you know what's weird? I think I had a dream about you last         night.",5
15611,ELAINE,81," <Thinks - Okay, he open-lips me, he dreams about me, we         have an olive project...that's it, I'm asking this guy out.> Um,         you know Greg, I...",5
15612,GREG,81, Can I have a sip of your water?,5
15613,ELAINE,81," Oh, yeah, sure. <Hands Greg her bottle.>",5
15614,GREG,81," Thanks. <Is about to take a drink, but wipes the neck of the         bottle with his shirt first.>",5
15615,ELAINE (shocked expression),81, <Thinks - Oh my God.>,5
15616,GREG (hands the bottle back),81," I'm sorry, what were you saying?",5
15617,ELAINE,81," It was nothing, forget it. <George enters the gym.>",5
15618,GREG,81," See that guy right there? I caught him urinating in the shower.         I'm thinking about turning him in, too. <On the other side of the room,         George falls off an exercise machine and gets his foot caught in it.>",5
15619,MERYL,81, Honey? Could you get me something to drink?,5
15620,"JERRY (from his bedroom hallway, alluding to the fact that she should         get the drink herself)",81, You're right there.,5
15621,MERYL,81," C'mon, I'm sitting! <Jerry walks to the kitchen, annoyed. Meryl         laughs at the TV show she's watching.>",5
15622,JERRY (looking in a drawer),81," Honey, what'd you do with the can opener?",5
15623,MERYL,81, I didn't do anything with it.,5
15624,JERRY,81," Well, it's not here, it was here yesterday.",5
15625,MERYL,81, It's in the first drawer.,5
15626,JERRY,81, I'm looking in the first drawer. It's not here.,5
15627,MERYL,81," Yes, it is.",5
15628,JERRY (irritated),81," Hey...I'm not stupid. I'm looking in that drawer,         there's no can opener.",5
15629,MERYL,81, Did I say you were stupid?,5
15630,JERRY (angrily),81," Well, wouldn't I have to be? You tell me there's a can         opener in the drawer, I'm looking in the drawer, there's no can opener         - what other conclusion could one reach? <The phone rings.>",5
15631,MERYL (getting up),81, Do you want me to go find it?,5
15632,JERRY (slams the drawer),81," Yes. I do. You show me where there's a can         opener in that drawer. <Answers the phone.> Hello! I'm sorry, I'm         just fighting with my wife.",5
15633,HELEN,81," Jerry, we just heard, what's going on?",5
15634,MORTY,81, Why the hell didn't you tell us?,5
15635,JERRY,81," Listen, Ma...",5
15636,MERYL (looking in the drawer),81, It was in here yesterday!,5
15637,JERRY (angrily),81," Yeah, that's what I said!",5
15638,HELEN,81, Who is she? When did this happen?,5
15639,MORTY (to Jerry),81," I told her you'd get married. She thought you'd never         do it.",5
15640,HELEN,81," Morty, you're talking too loud.",5
15641,MORTY,81, I'm not talking loud!,5
15642,HELEN,81, You're hurting my eardrum.,5
15643,MERYL (looking for the can opener),81," Well, you must have done something         with it!",5
15644,JERRY (to Meryl),81, I'm on the phone!,5
15645,HELEN,81, Is she there? Can we talk to her? What's her name?,5
15646,JERRY,81," Mom, I'm not married.",5
15647,HELEN,81, What?,5
15648,JERRY,81, I'm not married!,5
15649,MORTY,81," I knew it, I told ya!",5
15650,HELEN (to Jerry),81, Uncle Leo said.,5
15651,JERRY,81," I'm just pretending I'm married to get a discount on dry-cleaning.       ",5
15652,HELEN,81, A discount on dry-cleaning?,5
15653,"JERRY (to Meryl, who's making a racket in the kitchen looking for the         can opener)",81," Could you make a little more noise? <To his parents>         Listen, I'm gonna have to call you later.",5
15654,MERYL (not finding the opener),81," Well, I give up.",5
15655,JERRY,81," Well, whoopie whoop. <Meryl goes into the other room. Kramer         staggers in the door in his bathrobe.>",5
15656,KRAMER,81, Got any coffee?,5
15657,JERRY,81," Yeah. <Kramer lurches into the kitchen, trips, and falls onto         the kitchen floor.> I'll get it, I'll get it! Take it easy, why are         you so tired?",5
15658,KRAMER,81," My quilt is still at the cleaners. Jerry, I can't sleep without         my quilt. Like the other night? I was cold. So, last night, I turn up         the heat - it's too hot. I open up a window - it's too cold. <Frantic>         I can't get into a zone!",5
15659,JERRY,81, What is that? <Points to Kramer's pocket as Meryl comes back.>,5
15660,KRAMER,81," Oh, I forgot. <Hands back Jerry's can opener.>",5
15661,JERRY,81," Hey, I'm sorry about all that can opener stuff.",5
15662,MERYL,81," Yeah, me too. Love you.",5
15663,JERRY,81, Love you.,5
15664,MERYL,81," Well, goodnight.",5
15665,JERRY,81," Goodnight. <They kiss goodnight, then promptly roll away from         each other and go to sleep.>",5
15666,GEORGE,81, They could kick me out of the health club if he tells them!,5
15667,ELAINE,81, So what do you want me to do?,5
15668,GEORGE,81, Talk to him!,5
15669,ELAINE,81, How can I do that?,5
15670,GEORGE,81, You said the guy gave you an open-lipped kiss!,5
15671,ELAINE (enunciating clearly so George gets the point),81," Yes, but then         he wiped his hand on the top of the bottle when I offered him water!",5
15672,GEORGE,81," Well, that doesn't mean anything!",5
15673,ELAINE,81," Are you kidding? That's very significant! If he was interested         in me, he'd want my germs! He'd just crave my germs!",5
15674,JERRY (patiently),81," She's right, George. Bottle-wipe is big.",5
15675,GEORGE,81," Well, what about the open-lipped kiss?",5
15676,JERRY,81, Bottle-wipe supercedes it.,5
15677,GEORGE,81," Yeah, you're right, you're right. <To Elaine> Alright,         maybe he's not interested, but you still know him - can't you just ask         him?",5
15678,ELAINE,81," George...but if I ask him now, I will have no chance of going         out with him.",5
15679,GEORGE,81, Why?,5
15680,ELAINE,81, I...I don't know...,5
15681,GEORGE,81," Aha. Aha. Could it be because you don't want him to know that         you have a friend who pees in the shower, is that it?!",5
15682,ELAINE,81," No, that's not it!",5
15683,GEORGE,81," Oh, I think it is! I think that's exactly what it is!",5
15684,ELAINE,81, Why couldn't you just wait?,5
15685,GEORGE,81, I was there! I saw a drain!,5
15686,ELAINE,81, Since when is a drain a toilet?!,5
15687,GEORGE,81, It's all pipes! What's the difference?!,5
15688,ELAINE,81," Different pipes go to different places! You're gonna mix 'em         up!",5
15689,GEORGE,81, I'll call a plumber right now! <Goes for the phone.>,5
15690,JERRY,81," Alright, can we just drop all the pee-pipe stuff here?",5
15691,ELAINE (to George),81, Okay! Okay! I will talk to him. <Kramer enters.>,5
15692,KRAMER,81," Jerry, I think that quilt is ready.",5
15693,JERRY,81, Alright.,5
15694,KRAMER,81," Well, you gotta pick it up for me!",5
15695,JERRY,81," Alright, I'll pick it up, but it's the last time I'm doin' it!",5
15696,KRAMER,81, I'm so tired!,5
15697,ELAINE (to Kramer),81," Boy, you don't look good.",5
15698,KRAMER,81, Huh? I don't?,5
15699,ELAINE,81," No, you look pale.",5
15700,KRAMER,81," Pale? Oh my God...I gotta meet Anna's parents today! <The         phone rings.>",5
15701,JERRY,81," Hello? Oh, hi honey. <annoyed, weary> Yes, I told him. I'll         get it. <George and Elaine give each other a look, then leave Jerry         to argue with Meryl on the phone.> Whenever. Okay, I'm sorry...",5
15702,MARTY,81," I'm sorry, it's not ready yet. <Kramer bursts in.>",5
15703,KRAMER,81," Not ready? It has to be ready! What kind of a business are you         running here?",5
15704,MARTY,81, Who the hell are you? It's not your quilt.,5
15705,JERRY,81," He's a very good friend of mine, he's kind've like an older brother         to me...when things don't go right, he kinda takes it personally.",5
15706,MARTY,81," Well, uh...maybe tomorrow.",5
15707,"KRAMER (angrily, to Jerry)",81, Maybe.,5
15708,JERRY,81," Oh, it's okay, it'll be okay.",5
15709,KRAMER,81," Alright, I'm gonna see you later.",5
15710,JERRY,81, Where you goin'?,5
15711,KRAMER,81," I gotta meet Anna's parents today, remember? I look terrible!         I'm gonna hit the tanning machines.",5
15712,JERRY,81," I can't believe you still do that. You know those things are bad         for ya.",5
15713,KRAMER,81," Hey, that's how I maintain my glow. ",5
15714,JERRY,81," I'm goin' home. <Kramer exits. An attractive woman enters the         dry-cleaners with a bundle of clothes in her hands. Jerry notices her         and waits by the door.>",5
15715,"PAULA (to Marty, in a foreign accent)",81," Excuse me? Uh, how much would         it cost to clean this?",5
15716,MARTY,81," Oh, about thirteen dollars.",5
15717,PAULA,81," Thirteen? Well, I can't afford that.",5
15718,MARTY,81," Well, I'm sorry.",5
15719,ELAINE,81," Hi, Greg.",5
15720,GREG,81," Hey, Elaine. I'll be off in a second. <Another guy approaches         the exercise machine.>",5
15721,ELAINE,81," I got the machine next, buddy. <Greg finishes up his workout         and gets off the machine.>",5
15722,GREG (to Elaine),81," It's all yours. <Walks away. Elaine looks at the         machine, then George runs over.>",5
15723,GEORGE,81, What happened? Did he bring it up?,5
15724,ELAINE,81," Never mind that, look at the signal I just got.",5
15725,GEORGE,81, Signal? What signal?,5
15726,ELAINE,81," Lookit. He knew I was gonna use the machine next, he didn't wipe         his sweat off. That's a gesture of intimacy.",5
15727,GEORGE,81," I'll tell you what that is - that's a violation of club rules.         Now I got him! And you're my witness!",5
15728,ELAINE,81," Listen, George! Listen! He knew what he was doing, this was a         signal.",5
15729,GEORGE,81," A guy leaves a puddle of sweat, that's a signal?",5
15730,ELAINE,81, Yeah! It's a social thing.,5
15731,GEORGE,81," What if he left you a used Kleenex, what's that, a valentine?         Now you go up to him and you tell him that if he's thinking of turning         me in, that I got the goods on him!",5
15732,ELAINE,81, No! I won't be a party to this.,5
15733,GEORGE,81, So you're gonna let me get suspended for shower urination?,5
15734,ELAINE,81," Okay, I'll talk to him. But you're putting me in a very difficult         position. <Walks away.>",5
15735,PAULA,81, I won't let you do this!,5
15736,JERRY,81, I want to!,5
15737,PAULA,81, But it isn't right! I can't.,5
15738,JERRY,81, Give me the clothes. ,5
15739,PAULA,81," Jerry, please. What about her?",5
15740,JERRY,81," Oh, the hell with her. <Paula dramatically flees from the coffee         shop. Jerry thinks for a second, then follows her and catches up to her         on the street.>",5
15741,PAULA,81," No, Jerry, please!",5
15742,JERRY,81, I'm not gonna let you walk out of my life.,5
15743,PAULA (hands over the clothes),81," I can't fight you. <They embrace and         kiss passionately.>",5
15744,JERRY,81, Do you want box or hanger?,5
15745,PAULA,81, You decide. <Jerry considers.>,5
15746,ELAINE,81," You're really working up quite a sweat today, huh?",5
15747,GREG,81," Yeah. <Spies the shapely manager of the health club.> Oh,         there's the manager. Good. I think I'm gonna talk to her about that guy,         you know, we cannot have people like that in here.",5
15748,ELAINE,81, Are you sure you want to do that?,5
15749,GREG,81," Yeah. He's disgusting! Besides, I'll take any chance I can to talk         to her.",5
15750,ELAINE,81, You're interested in...in her? <Points at the manager.>,5
15751,GREG,81, Very.,5
15752,ELAINE,81," Ah. You know, uh...I'm engaged. <preens> Yep, gettin' married         in fifty years. <Snaps the straps of her leotard against her chest         and winces. George walks by the manager.>",5
15753,GREG,81," Oh good, there he is. I wanna be able to point him out.",5
15754,ELAINE,81," You know, Greg, I wouldn't do that if I were you.",5
15755,GREG,81, Why?,5
15756,ELAINE,81," Well, correct me if I'm wrong, but isn't it a violation of club         policy to not wipe down a machine after using it?",5
15757,GREG,81," Oh, I see...you're friends with the urinator, aren't you?",5
15758,ELAINE,81," Yeah, well, at least he had a drain.",5
15759,MARTY,81," Here you go, Mrs. Seinfeld...with your 25% discount, it comes         to $17.80.",5

15761,MARTY,81," Oh, yes it is. Your husband brought it in himself.",5
15762,MERYL,81," Really? <Takes her change and grabs the clothes off the hanger.>         Thank you. <Exits.>",5

15769,JERRY,81," Yes, that's right.",5
15770,MERYL,81," What happened to us, Jerry?",5
15771,JERRY,81, I'll tell you what happened. We got married.,5
15772,MERYL,81," I'm sorry, this is my fault. I pushed it on you.",5
15773,JERRY,81," No. I guess I just wasn't ready for the responsibilities of a         pretend marriage.",5
15774,MERYL,81," Goodbye, Jerry. Oh, I forgot...<reaches in her purse>...this         is your maple syrup.",5

15819,JERRY,82, What about little Joey?,5
15820,GEORGE,82, Who?,5
15821,JERRY,82," Ah, I think he's probably better off.",5
15822,GEORGE,82," I'm trying to get out of this Big Brother program. So when you         get to Paris (handing Morty the postcards) all you have to do is drop         'em in any mailbox. ",5
15823,MORTY,82, But there are no stamps on these.,5
15824,GEORGE,82," Well no not yet, you gotta buy french stamps (pauses) I-I'll         reimburse you of course. ",5
15825,HELEN,82, Why are you doing this?,5
15826,JERRY,82, He wants this guy to think he's in Paris. ,5
15827,HELEN,82, Why?,5
15828,JERRY,82, Because George is a deeply disturbed individual.,5
15829,KRAMER,82," Oh hey, Helen uh, Could I uh, use some more of your hand lotion?",5
15830,HELEN,82, I told you it was good. (hands Kramer the lotion),5
15831,KRAMER,82, (putting on the lotion) Ya,5
15832,HELEN,82, It's from the Sachs Fifth Avenue in Miami.,5
15833,KRAMER,82," Mmm (smelling the lotion as he rubs it in) I'm gonna remember         that if I'm ever in Florida.",5
15834,JERRY,82," Ya, or if you're ever on Fifth Avenue here in New York City, you         could get some there.",5
15835,KRAMER,82, Ya,5
15836,MORTY,82," Say those are some nice pants. I got a pair just like them at         home.",5
15837,KRAMER,82," Well uh that doesn't surprise me, ya i bought these at Rudy's.         It's a used clothing store. See when people like you die, the widows they         bring in their wardrobes, they make a bundle.",5
15838,GEORGE,82," Really? My father has a ton of old clothes just sitting up in         the attic, y-you think they're worth something?",5
15839,KRAMER,82," Ya if they're vintage, and you're a widow.",5
15840,GEORGE,82," What happens if the husband dies after the wife, who brings in         the clothing in then?",5
15841,KRAMER,82, Well I suppose the children do.,5
15842,GEORGE,82, (pondering) Yes I suppose they do.,5
15843,KRAMER,82," (takes another smell of his hands) Alright I gotta a ten o'clock,         I'll see everybody later.",5
15844,GEORGE,82," (grabbing his jacket) Hey oo, I just remembered uh my parents         really wanna have you guys over for dinner before you leave town. What         about tonight? ",5
15845,HELEN,82, Tonight?,5
15846,GEORGE,82, Yea they're making Payaya.,5
15847,HELEN,82," (looking at Morty) Uh oh I don't think we think we can make it         tonight, (turns toward George) we have plans.",5
15848,JERRY,82, (watching the whole conversation from his desk) What plans? ,5
15849,HELEN,82, (turns to Jerry) We have plans.,5
15850,JERRY,82, Where'd you get plans?,5
15851,HELEN,82, (annoyed) We have plans.,5
15852,GEORGE,82," Well um, what about tomorrow night?",5
15853,HELEN,82, (turns back toward George) Maybe,5
15854,GEORGE,82," Ok uh, I guess I'll tell them that.",5
15855,MORTY,82, (to George as he is about to leave) Hey give 'em our best though.,5
15856,GEORGE,82, (quietly) Ya.,5
15857,JERRY,82, (walking over toward George and the door) I'll call you later.,5
15858,GEORGE,82, Ya.,5
15859,JERRY,82, So what plans do you have?,5
15860,MORTY,82, None,5
15861,JERRY,82, So how come you're not going over there for dinner?,5
15862,HELEN,82, Jerry we don't care much for the Costanzas'.,5
15863,MORTY,82, We can't stand them.,5
15864,JERRY,82, Really? Since when?,5
15865,HELEN,82, Since always. We've never liked them.,5
15866,JERRY,82, Why?,5
15867,HELEN,82," Well they're so loud, they're always fighting it's uncomfortable,         you never notice?",5
15868,JERRY,82," No I notice but they're from your age group I didn't know you         could detect abnormal behavior among your own kind. ",5
15869,MORTY,82, Well we do.,5
15870,JERRY,82, Ya?,5
15871,ELAINE,82, It's us.,5
15872,JERRY,82," U-oh come on up. (buzzes them up) It's Elaine you don't have a         problem with her do you?",5
15873,HELEN,82, We adore Elaine.,5
15874,JERRY,82," She wants to say hi, she's with her new boyfriend.",5
15875,HELEN,82, What's he like?,5
15876,JERRY,82," He's nice, bit of a close talker.",5
15877,HELEN,82, A what?,5
15878,JERRY,82," You'll see. (pause) Boy, I had no idea you felt this way about         the Costanzas'",5
15879,HELEN,82, They're exhausting it's like being in an Asylum.,5
15880,EVERYONE,82, Hi.,5
15881,MORTY,82, Hello Elaine,5
15882,ELAINE,82, This is Aaron.,5

15889,AARON,82," I love France, (moving over to Morty's face) I was just there         last year. In fact, you know I still have an envelope full of French Franks,         I'll give 'em to ya.",5
15890,HELEN,82, We can't take money.,5

15895,HELEN,82," (grabbing Aaron) Really, you could do that?",5
15896,AARON,82, (up in Helen's face) Easily,5
15897,HELEN,82, I wouldn't be any trouble?,5

15920,JERRY,82, I don't know.,5
15921,ELAINE,82, What is that?,5
15922,JERRY,82, Maybe he was just trying to be nice.,5
15923,ELAINE,82, Have you ever heard of anyone doing anything like this?,5
15924,JERRY,82," Wait a second, he just did me a big favor.",5

15938,GEORGE,82," They said tomorrow, maybe.",5
15939,FRANK,82, Maybe?,5
15940,ESTELLE,82, Maybe they don't like us.,5
15941,FRANK,82," Why wouldn't they like us? (tastes the Paella; disgusted) Again         with the pepper? What do you gotta use all the pepper for?",5
15942,ESTELLE,82, Ah keep quiet.,5
15943,FRANK,82, What are you trying to set my mouth on fire?,5

15949,JERRY,82, Oh sure like Monet.,5
15950,MORTY,82," Don't you think he had to be uh near sighted? I mean nobody would         paint like that if they could see. It's all out of focus.",5
15951,JERRY,82," Well he's from the impressionist school, you know like Monet,         Manet, Tippi Tippi Dayday.",5
15952,MORTY,82, I say the guy was painting without his glasses.,5
15953,JERRY,82," (answering phone) Hello? Rachel, ya uh no they're back.",5

15967,MORTY,82," (noticing Kramer's coat) Look at that, Helen do you see what he's         wearing? That's the Executive.",5
15968,KRAMER,82, Now what is Executive?,5
15969,JERRY,82, The belt-less trench coat. My father invented it.,5
15970,MORTY,82," I sure did. Raincoats were my business. The Executive was a classic,         these haven't been made in twenty years.",5
15971,HELEN,82, Why would they? Nobody bought them then.,5
15972,MORTY,82, He's wearing one.,5
15973,KRAMER,82, Yea these are a hot item over at Rudy's.,5
15974,MORTY,82," You don't say? You know I have boxes of those sitting in my garage         in Florida?",5
15975,KRAMER,82," Get 'em up here. You give me twenty-five percent I-I'll take         care of everything.",5
15976,MORTY,82, You gotta deal.,5
15977,KRAMER,82, Yaaaa.,5
15978,JERRY,82, This is like the meeting of Smith and Wesson.,5
15979,MORTY,82," I'll call Jack Klompus, he's got a key to the garage. He can send         them overnight delivery.",5
15980,HELEN,82," You're gonna first start shipping boxes? We're leaving for Paris         in three days.",5
15981,MORTY,82, He'll send them express.,5
15982,HELEN,82, You're crazy.,5
15983,MORTY,82," I'll tell you how crazy I am, I'm gonna pay for this whole trip         with these coats.",5
15984,JERRY,82, N-na I'm paying for the trip.,5
15985,MORTY,82, So much the better.,5
15986,GEORGE,82," Anyway it's kind of a fluke thing but uh I'll be leaving for         Paris in two days. I will send you a postcard when I get there.",5
15987,ALEC,82, Paris huh?,5
15988,GEORGE,82," Yea, ya..ya know I feel terrible about Joey but it's jus..it's         a great business opportunity. I-I don't even know how long I'm gonna be         away for.",5
15989,ALEC,82, Where will you stay?,5
15990,GEORGE,82," An apartment complex, the uh the Eiffel Towers. uumm Like I said         uh you'll be getting a postcard uh in a few days and again I'm sorry.",5
15991,ALEC,82," George, you have no idea how fantastic this is. ",5
15992,GEORGE,82, Fantastic?,5
15993,ALEC,82," Ya, we've been trying to reunite Joey with his father who lives         in Paris. But he's afraid to fly alone, you know he's kinda withdrawn,         but he seems to take to you. (George smiling in surprise) So it's a perfect         solution. ",5
15994,GEORGE,82, How gee what a coincidence.,5
15995,ALEC,82, And you'll send me a postcard.,5
15996,AARON,82," Helen really seemed to respond to Renoir. I think she really connected         to the way he painted children.",5
15997,ELAINE,82, Mm hmm.,5
15998,AARON,82," And that Morty, I'll tell ya that guy is full of life. (laughs)         He was convinced Monet was near sighted. I kept telling him",5
15999,ELAINE,82, Aaron,5
16000,AARON,82, Yes?,5
16001,ELAINE,82," Uh, let me ask you a question. How come you asked Mr. and Mrs.         Seinfeld to go to the museum with you? ",5
16002,AARON,82," Well, they were in from out of town, I thought they would enjoy         it.",5
16003,ELAINE,82," Uhuh, um you didn't feel uncomfortable spending the whole day         at the museum with two complete strangers who were more than twice your         age?",5
16004,AARON,82," No, it was fun.",5
16005,ELAINE,82, You had fun with Mr. and Mrs. Seinfeld.,5
16006,AARON,82," Yea, they bought me a coke.",5
16007,KRAMER,82, So how'd you come up with the idea for the belt-less trench coat?,5
16008,MORTY,82," I came home one night, and I tripped over one of Jerry's toys.         (Jerry smiling points to himself and nods with cards in his hands) So         I took out my belt just to threaten him, and I got a glimpse of myself         in the mirror.",5
16009,KRAMER,82, How serendipitous.,5
16010,MORTY,82, So that night I cut off the loops and the Executive was born.,5
16011,KRAMER,82, Mmm,5
16012,JERRY,82," He also came up with an idea for a brimless rain-hat but that         never materialized. (to Morty) Alright come on let's play.",5
16013,KRAMER,82, Did you call Jack Klompus yet?,5
16014,MORTY,82," I haven't been able to reach him. Hey I'll call him right now.       ",5
16015,JERRY,82, Ah come on.,5
16016,MORTY,82, Just a second. (Goes to grab the phone),5
16017,HELEN,82, Jerry have you seen Schindler's List?,5
16018,JERRY,82, No I haven't seen it yet.,5
16019,HELEN,82, Oh you have to go you have to,5

16025,MORTY,82, It's Morty,5
16026,JACK,82, Who died?,5
16027,MORTY,82," Nobody died. Jack I want you to do me a big favor. (Jerry holding         up some cards looking at his father) In my garage there are a couple of         boxes.",5
16028,JACK,82, What boxes?,5
16029,MORTY,82, I'm gonna explain what boxes.,5
16030,JACK,82, Alright how the hell do I know?,5
16031,MORTY,82," Anyway there are these three big boxes, you can't miss them. I         want you to ship them here to New York for me.",5
16032,JACK,82, I thought you're going to Paris,5
16033,MORTY,82, I'm still going to Paris. I got a big deal cooking here.,5
16034,JACK,82, What's in the boxes?,5
16035,MORTY,82, Raincoats.,5
16036,JACK,82," Raincoats? (Doris sighs) You think you're gonna sell those old         crappy raincoats? That's garbage.",5
16037,HELEN,82, I guarantee you Doris is not letting him mail those boxes.,5
16038,JACK,82, When do you want these?,5
16039,MORTY,82, Send them tomorrow.,5
16040,ESTELLE,82, You think they're coming tonight?,5
16041,GEORGE,82, I dunno they said maybe.,5
16042,FRANK,82," Of course they're coming, they're leaving soon. If they don't         come tonight they might not see us.",5
16043,ESTELLE,82," Well they better come, I got all this Paella.",5
16044,FRANK,82," I admire Morty and Helen going to France. We should take a trip,         maybe a cruise. ",5
16045,GEORGE,82," Yes a cruise, a long cruise, just the two of you. ",5
16046,ESTELLE,82, Georgie what were you doing poking around the attic last night?,5
16047,GEORGE,82, I-I wasn't in the attic.,5
16048,ESTELLE,82, I heard noise.,5
16049,GEORGE,82, Maybe it was a mouse.,5
16050,FRANK,82, (jumping to his feet) OK that's it! We're moving! ,5
16051,GEORGE,82, What?,5
16052,FRANK,82, I will not tolerate infestation.,5
16053,GEORGE,82, You haven't even seen one.,5
16054,FRANK,82," Don't you understand the very thought, the very idea, I'll never         be comfortable again.",5
16055,Regulars,83,"        Jerry Seinfeld ....................... Jerry Seinfeld        Jason Alexander .................. George Costanza        Julia Louis-Dreyfus ............. Elaine Benes        Michael Richards ................. Cosmo Kramer",5
16056,JERRY,83, You know their timing couldn't be worse.,5
16057,GEORGE,83, Is there ever a good time to have your parents stay with you?,5
16058,JERRY,83," You don't understand, I haven't been together with Rachel for         like three weeks. First I was on the road, then my parents show up, I'm         getting a little uh backed up. ",5
16059,GEORGE,83, When are they leaving for Paris?,5
16060,JERRY,83, Not for another three days.,5
16061,GEORGE,83, What about her place?,5
16062,JERRY,83, She lives with her parents.,5
16063,GEORGE,83," Really? (Jerry shakes his head) Maybe this will become like a         cool thing, living with your parents.",5
16064,JERRY,83," (sarcastically)Ya, then maybe baldness will catch on. This will         all be turning your way. ",5
16065,GEORGE,83," Hey believe me, baldness will catch on. When the aliens come,         who do you think they're gonna relate to? Who do you think is going to         be the first ones getting a tour of the ship?",5
16066,JERRY,83, The baldies,5
16067,GEORGE,83," Hey by the way my parents really want to have your parents over         dinner before they leave town.",5
16068,JERRY,83," That's good, then I get the apartment for at least one night.         You know I'm paying for this whole Paris trip it's their anniversary present.",5

16074,ALEC,83," (Joey was about to talk) Hey listen, I was wondering if either         one of you guys would be interested in doing some work for the Big Brother         program? I'm kinda running the local chapter. What do you say George?",5
16075,GEORGE,83, Well uh....,5

16082,GEORGE,83, What could I do? Did you see the mug on that kid?,5
16083,JERRY,83," (acting like Joey) Wouldn't you like to pass the ketchup to someone         like me? Please?",5
16084,JERRY,83," Hey did you notice they moved where they do the interview on Jeopardy         now?",5
16085,GEORGE,83," Ya it used to be right in the middle of single Jeopardy and now         they do it right after single Jeopardy.",5
16086,JERRY,83," Ya, it's much better isn't it?",5
16087,GEORGE,83," Oh, n-no comparison.",5
16088,JERRY,83," Hey, I gotta stop off at the bookstore to pick up my parents one         of those French-English dictionaries.",5
16089,GEORGE,83, (stops Jerry realizing something) Hey hey hey hey hey hey.,5

16092,JERRY,83, Yea?,5
16093,GEORGE,83," So I tell Alec that I have to goto Paris for an undetermined         amount of time. Then all I have to do is buy some post cards and have         your parents mail them from Paris.",5
16094,JERRY,83, What about little Joey?,5
16095,GEORGE,83, Who?,5
16096,JERRY,83," Ah, I think he's probably better off.",5
16097,GEORGE,83," I'm trying to get out of this Big Brother program. So when you         get to Paris (handing Morty the postcards) all you have to do is drop         'em in any mailbox. ",5
16098,MORTY,83, But there are no stamps on these.,5
16099,GEORGE,83," Well no not yet, you gotta buy french stamps (pauses) I-I'll         reimburse you of course. ",5
16100,HELEN,83, Why are you doing this?,5
16101,JERRY,83, He wants this guy to think he's in Paris. ,5
16102,HELEN,83, Why?,5
16103,JERRY,83, Because George is a deeply disturbed individual.,5
16104,KRAMER,83," Oh hey, Helen uh, Could I uh, use some more of your hand lotion?",5
16105,HELEN,83, I told you it was good. (hands Kramer the lotion),5

16110,KRAMER,83, Ya,5
16111,MORTY,83," Say those are some nice pants. I got a pair just like them at         home.",5
16112,KRAMER,83," Well uh that doesn't surprise me, ya i bought these at Rudy's.         It's a used clothing store. See when people like you die, the widows they         bring in their wardrobes, they make a bundle.",5
16113,GEORGE,83," Really? My father has a ton of old clothes just sitting up in         the attic, y-you think they're worth something?",5
16114,KRAMER,83," Ya if they're vintage, and you're a widow.",5
16115,GEORGE,83," What happens if the husband dies after the wife, who brings in         the clothing in then?",5
16116,KRAMER,83, Well I suppose the children do.,5

16123,JERRY,83, (watching the whole conversation from his desk) What plans? ,5
16124,HELEN,83, (turns to Jerry) We have plans.,5
16125,JERRY,83, Where'd you get plans?,5
16126,HELEN,83, (annoyed) We have plans.,5
16127,GEORGE,83," Well um, what about tomorrow night?",5
16128,HELEN,83, (turns back toward George) Maybe,5
16129,GEORGE,83," Ok uh, I guess I'll tell them that.",5
16130,MORTY,83, (to George as he is about to leave) Hey give 'em our best though.,5

16138,MORTY,83, We can't stand them.,5
16139,JERRY,83, Really? Since when?,5
16140,HELEN,83, Since always. We've never liked them.,5
16141,JERRY,83, Why?,5
16142,HELEN,83," Well they're so loud, they're always fighting it's uncomfortable,         you never notice?",5
16143,JERRY,83," No I notice but they're from your age group I didn't know you         could detect abnormal behavior among your own kind. ",5
16144,MORTY,83, Well we do.,5

16224,JERRY,83, Oh sure like Monet.,5
16225,MORTY,83," Don't you think he had to be uh near sighted? I mean nobody would         paint like that if they could see. It's all out of focus.",5
16226,JERRY,83," Well he's from the impressionist school, you know like Monet,         Manet, Tippi Tippi Dayday.",5
16227,MORTY,83, I say the guy was painting without his glasses.,5

16243,KRAMER,83, Now what is Executive?,5
16244,JERRY,83, The belt-less trench coat. My father invented it.,5
16245,MORTY,83," I sure did. Raincoats were my business. The Executive was a classic,         these haven't been made in twenty years.",5
16246,HELEN,83, Why would they? Nobody bought them then.,5
16247,MORTY,83, He's wearing one.,5
16248,KRAMER,83, Yea these are a hot item over at Rudy's.,5
16249,MORTY,83," You don't say? You know I have boxes of those sitting in my garage         in Florida?",5
16250,KRAMER,83," Get 'em up here. You give me twenty-five percent I-I'll take         care of everything.",5
16251,MORTY,83, You gotta deal.,5
16252,KRAMER,83, Yaaaa.,5
16253,JERRY,83, This is like the meeting of Smith and Wesson.,5
16254,MORTY,83," I'll call Jack Klompus, he's got a key to the garage. He can send         them overnight delivery.",5
16255,HELEN,83," You're gonna first start shipping boxes? We're leaving for Paris         in three days.",5
16256,MORTY,83, He'll send them express.,5
16257,HELEN,83, You're crazy.,5
16258,MORTY,83," I'll tell you how crazy I am, I'm gonna pay for this whole trip         with these coats.",5
16259,JERRY,83, N-na I'm paying for the trip.,5
16260,MORTY,83, So much the better.,5
16261,GEORGE,83," Anyway it's kind of a fluke thing but uh I'll be leaving for         Paris in two days. I will send you a postcard when I get there.",5
16262,ALEC,83, Paris huh?,5
16263,GEORGE,83," Yea, ya..ya know I feel terrible about Joey but it's jus..it's         a great business opportunity. I-I don't even know how long I'm gonna be         away for.",5
16264,ALEC,83, Where will you stay?,5
16265,GEORGE,83," An apartment complex, the uh the Eiffel Towers. uumm Like I said         uh you'll be getting a postcard uh in a few days and again I'm sorry.",5
16266,ALEC,83," George, you have no idea how fantastic this is. ",5
16267,GEORGE,83, Fantastic?,5
16268,ALEC,83," Ya, we've been trying to reunite Joey with his father who lives         in Paris. But he's afraid to fly alone, you know he's kinda withdrawn,         but he seems to take to you. (George smiling in surprise) So it's a perfect         solution. ",5
16269,GEORGE,83, How gee what a coincidence.,5
16270,ALEC,83, And you'll send me a postcard.,5
16271,AARON,83," Helen really seemed to respond to Renoir. I think she really connected         to the way he painted children.",5
16272,ELAINE,83, Mm hmm.,5
16273,AARON,83," And that Morty, I'll tell ya that guy is full of life. (laughs)         He was convinced Monet was near sighted. I kept telling him",5
16274,ELAINE,83, Aaron,5
16275,AARON,83, Yes?,5
16276,ELAINE,83," Uh, let me ask you a question. How come you asked Mr. and Mrs.         Seinfeld to go to the museum with you? ",5
16277,AARON,83," Well, they were in from out of town, I thought they would enjoy         it.",5
16278,ELAINE,83," Uhuh, um you didn't feel uncomfortable spending the whole day         at the museum with two complete strangers who were more than twice your         age?",5
16279,AARON,83," No, it was fun.",5
16280,ELAINE,83, You had fun with Mr. and Mrs. Seinfeld.,5
16281,AARON,83," Yea, they bought me a coke.",5
16282,KRAMER,83, So how'd you come up with the idea for the belt-less trench coat?,5
16283,MORTY,83," I came home one night, and I tripped over one of Jerry's toys.         (Jerry smiling points to himself and nods with cards in his hands) So         I took out my belt just to threaten him, and I got a glimpse of myself         in the mirror.",5
16284,KRAMER,83, How serendipitous.,5
16285,MORTY,83, So that night I cut off the loops and the Executive was born.,5
16286,KRAMER,83, Mmm,5
16287,JERRY,83," He also came up with an idea for a brimless rain-hat but that         never materialized. (to Morty) Alright come on let's play.",5
16288,KRAMER,83, Did you call Jack Klompus yet?,5
16289,MORTY,83," I haven't been able to reach him. Hey I'll call him right now.       ",5
16290,JERRY,83, Ah come on.,5
16291,MORTY,83, Just a second. (Goes to grab the phone),5
16292,HELEN,83, Jerry have you seen Schindler's List?,5
16293,JERRY,83, No I haven't seen it yet.,5
16294,HELEN,83, Oh you have to go you have to,5

16300,MORTY,83, It's Morty,5
16301,JACK,83, Who died?,5
16302,MORTY,83," Nobody died. Jack I want you to do me a big favor. (Jerry holding         up some cards looking at his father) In my garage there are a couple of         boxes.",5
16303,JACK,83, What boxes?,5
16304,MORTY,83, I'm gonna explain what boxes.,5
16305,JACK,83, Alright how the hell do I know?,5
16306,MORTY,83," Anyway there are these three big boxes, you can't miss them. I         want you to ship them here to New York for me.",5
16307,JACK,83, I thought you're going to Paris,5
16308,MORTY,83, I'm still going to Paris. I got a big deal cooking here.,5
16309,JACK,83, What's in the boxes?,5
16310,MORTY,83, Raincoats.,5
16311,JACK,83," Raincoats? (Doris sighs) You think you're gonna sell those old         crappy raincoats? That's garbage.",5
16312,HELEN,83, I guarantee you Doris is not letting him mail those boxes.,5
16313,JACK,83, When do you want these?,5
16314,MORTY,83, Send them tomorrow.,5
16315,ESTELLE,83, You think they're coming tonight?,5
16316,GEORGE,83, I dunno they said maybe.,5
16317,FRANK,83," Of course they're coming, they're leaving soon. If they don't         come tonight they might not see us.",5
16318,ESTELLE,83," Well they better come, I got all this Paella.",5
16319,FRANK,83," I admire Morty and Helen going to France. We should take a trip,         maybe a cruise. ",5

16331,Jerry's stand-up,84," To me, the thing about birthday parties is that         the first birthday party you have and the last birthday party you have         are actually quite similar. You know, you just kinda sit there...you're         the least excited person at the party. You don't even really realize that         there is a party. You don't know what's goin' on. Both birthday parties,         people have to kinda help you blow out the candles, you can't do it...you         don't even know why you're doing it. What is this ritual? What is going         on? It's also the only two birthday parties where other people have to         gather your friends together for you. Sometimes they're not even         your friends. They make the judgement. They bring 'em in, they sit 'em         down, and they tell you - 'these are your friends! Tell them thank you         for coming to my birthday party.'",5

16479,GEORGE,84," Alright, just forget it.",5
16480,ERIC,84," Me forget it? You should forget it! You're livin' in the past,         man! You're hung up on some clown from the sixties, man!",5
16481,GEORGE,84," Alright, very good, very good...go fold your little balloon animals,         Eric. Eric! What kind of name is that for a clown, huh?",5
16482,ROBIN'S MOTHER,84," Excuse me...you must be George! I'm Robin's mother. Oh,         you seem like such a lovely young man!",5
16483,GEORGE,84," Well, I do what I can. <Robin comes over.>",5

16485,ROBIN'S MOTHER,84," Oh, this is just a wonderful party!",5
16486,ROBIN,84, The burgers should be ready in a minute.,5
16487,GEORGE,84," Ah, great, great. <sniffs> What's that smell? Smoke? <walks         to the kitchen> Hey everybody, I think I smell some smoke back here...<smoke         boils into the doorway.> FIRE! FIRE! Get out of the way!",5
16488,GEORGE (to the EMTs),84," It was an inferno in there! An inferno! <Eric,         Robin's mother, and all the kids rush at George.>",5
16489,ERIC,84," There he is! That's him! <Tries to clobber George with his big         shoe.>",5
16490,ROBIN'S MOTHER,84, That's the coward that left us to die!,5
16491,GEORGE (voice is hoarse from screaming),84," I...was trying to lead the way.         We needed a leader! Someone to lead the way to safety. ",5
16492,ROBIN,84," But you yelled ""get out of my way""!",5
16493,GEORGE,84," Because! Because, as the leader...if I die...then all hope is         lost! Who would lead? The clown? Instead of castigating me, you should         all be thanking me. What kind of a topsy-turvy world do we live in, where         heroes are cast as villains? Brave men as cowards?",5
16494,ROBIN,84," But I saw you push the women and children out of the way in a         mad panic! I saw you knock them down! And when you ran out, you left everyone         behind!",5
16495,GEORGE,84," Seemingly. Seemingly, to the untrained eye, I can fully understand         how you got that impression. What looked like pushing...what looked like         knocking down...was a safety precaution! In a fire, you stay close to         the ground, am I right? And when I ran out that door, I was not leaving         anyone behind! Oh, quite the contrary! I risked my life making sure that         exit was clear. Any other questions?",5
16496,FIREMAN,84, How do you live with yourself?,5
16497,GEORGE,84, Its not easy.,5
16498,GEORGE,84, So she doesn't want to see me anymore.,5
16499,JERRY,84," Did you knock her over too, or just the kids?",5
16500,GEORGE,84," No, her too. And her mother.",5
16501,JERRY,84, Really? Her mother.,5
16502,GEORGE,84," Yeah. I may have stepped on her arm, too, I don't know.",5
16503,JERRY,84, You probably couldn't see because of the smoke.,5
16504,GEORGE,84, Yeah. But it was somebody's arm.,5
16505,JERRY,84," So you feel ""women and children first,"" in this day         and age, is somewhat of an antiquated notion.",5
16506,GEORGE,84, To some degree.,5
16507,JERRY,84," So basically, it's every man, woman, child, and invalid for themselves.",5
16508,GEORGE,84, In a manner of speaking.,5
16509,JERRY,84," Well, it's honest.",5
16510,GEORGE,84," Yeah. She should be commending me for treating everyone like         equals.",5
16511,JERRY,84," Well, perhaps when she's released from the burn center, she'll         see things differently.",5
16512,GEORGE,84, Perhaps.,5
16513,JERRY,84," So, what was the fire? Just a couple of greasy hamburgers?",5
16514,GEORGE,84, Yeah. Eric the Clown put it out with his big shoe.,5
16515,JERRY,84," By the way, did you see this? <Hands George a magazine>",5
16516,GEORGE,84, What's that?,5
16517,JERRY,84," It's the Leonard Christian article about my show. Plus my gig         in Miami got cancelled, I betcha it's because of the article.",5
16518,GEORGE,84," Wow, he really does a number on you. <reads> ""Seinfeld         froze like a deer in the headlights in the face of incessant heckling.""",5
16519,JERRY,84, I should have let her have it! I held back because of Kramer.,5
16520,GEORGE,84," You know what you oughta do. You should go to her office and         heckle her. ",5
16521,JERRY,84," Yeah, right.",5
16522,GEORGE,84," You know, like all the comedians always say, 'How would you like         it if I came to where you work and heckled you?'",5
16523,JERRY,84," Yeah, that'd be something.",5
16524,GEORGE,84," I'm not kidding, you should do it.",5
16525,JERRY,84," But wouldn't that be the ultimate comedian's revenge? I've always         had a fantasy about doing that.",5
16526,GEORGE,84," Well, go ahead! Do it!",5
16527,JERRY,84, Why can't I?,5
16528,GEORGE,84, No reason!,5
16529,JERRY,84," You know what? I think I'm gonna do that! She came down to where         I work, I'll go down to where she works!",5
16530,GEORGE,84, This is unprecedented!,5
16531,JERRY,84," There's no precedent, baby!",5
16532,GEORGE,84, What...are you using my babies now?,5
16533,JERRY,84," Hey, nice shoes. What, you wear sandals to work? It's always nice         to walk into a room and get the aroma of feet. That's real conducive to         the work atmosphere. I'm sure your co-workers really appreciate it. 'Hey,         let's go eat in Toby's office. Great idea! We can check on her bunions!'",5
16534,TOBY,84," You know, I have work to do here! I'm very busy!",5
16535,JERRY,84," Oh, is this disruptive? You find it hard to work with someone...interrupting?",5
16536,TOBY,84," Well, how would you like it if I called security?",5
16537,JERRY,84," Security? Well, I don't know how you're gonna make it in this         business if you can't take it! Ya gotta be tough! Booo! Boooo!",5
16538,KRAMER,84," Wait a second, what's happenin' here? Toby! Toby!",5
16539,KRAMER,84, What did you go up there to heckle her for?,5
16540,JERRY,84," Because she came down to the club and heckled me! Give her a taste         of her own medicine! <George enters.>",5
16541,KRAMER,84," Oh, YEAH! You gave her a taste of medicine, alright.",5
16542,JERRY,84," Well, I didn't want her to have an accident.",5
16543,GEORGE,84, What accident?,5
16544,KRAMER,84," Well, after he heckled Toby, she got so upset, she ran out of         the building and a street sweeper ran over her foot and severed her pinky         toe.",5
16545,GEORGE,84, That's unbelievable!,5
16546,KRAMER,84," Yeah! Then after the ambulance left, I found the toe! So I put         it in a Cracker Jack box, filled it with ice, and took off for the hospital.",5
16547,GEORGE,84, You ran?,5
16548,KRAMER,84," No, I jumped on the bus. I told the driver, ""I got a toe         here, buddy - step on it.""",5
16549,GEORGE,84, Holy cow!,5
16550,KRAMER,84," Yeah, yeah, then all of a sudden, this guy pulls out a gun. Well,         I knew any delay is gonna cost her her pinky toe, so I got out of the         seat and I started walking towards him. He says, ""Where do you think         you're going, Cracker Jack?"" I said, ""Well, I got a little prize         for ya, buddy - "" <Kramer throws two quick punches and a massive         uppercut> - knocked him out cold!",5
16551,GEORGE,84, How could you do that?!,5
16552,KRAMER,84," Then everybody is screamin,' because the driver, he's passed         out from all the commotion...the bus is out of control! So, I grab him         by the collar, I take him out of the seat, I get behind the wheel and         now I'm drivin' the bus.",5
16553,GEORGE,84, You're Batman.,5
16554,KRAMER,84," Yeah. Yeah, I am Batman. Then the mugger, he comes to, and he         starts chokin' me! So I'm fightin' him off with one hand and I kept drivin'         the bus with the other, y'know? Then I managed to open up the door, and         I kicked him out the door with my foot, you know - at the next stop.",5
16555,JERRY,84, You kept makin' all the stops?,5
16556,KRAMER,84," Well, people kept ringin' the bell!",5
16557,GEORGE,84," Well, what about the toe? What happened to the toe?",5
16558,KRAMER,84," Well! I am happy to say that the little guy is back in place         at the end of the line.",5
16559,GEORGE,84, You did all this...for a pinky toe?,5
16560,KRAMER,84," Well, it's a valuable appendage.",5
16561,JOANNE,84," So, Kramer found the toe, and they re-attached it.",5

16568,TOBY,84," Oh no, I'll be fine...",5
16569,JERRY,84, She got the promotion?,5
16570,ELAINE (standing in the doorway),84, Yep.,5
16571,JERRY,84, Why?,5
16572,ELAINE,84," I'll tell ya why. Because of her pinky toe, that's why. Because         Lippman felt so sorry for her, he didn't want to hurt her feelings.",5
16573,JERRY,84, Too bad.,5
16574,ELAINE,84," Sure, the pinky toe is cute! But, I mean, what is it? It's useless!         It does nothing. It's got that little nail that is just impossible to         cut. What do we need it for?",5
16575,JERRY,84," Because Elaine, that's the one that goes 'wee-wee-wee all the         home.'",5
16576,ELAINE,84, Why don't you just shut the f-,5
16577,KRAMER (from his doorway),84," Hey Elaine, did you hear the good news? Toby         got promoted!",5
16578,ELAINE,84," Yes, I heard, Kramer - I work there, remember??",5
16579,KRAMER,84," Yeah, and you know what she told me? She said her first order         of business is to put my coffee table book into the bookstores as soon         as possible.",5
16580,ELAINE,84," Oh, wonderful!",5
16581,KRAMER,84," You know, throughout this whole thing, she always kept a smile         on her face.",5
16582,ELAINE,84," Oh, of course! She's deranged.",5
16583,JERRY,84," So, I went down to the magazine, I pleaded with him to come and         see me again, finally he agreed to come down tonight, and he's going to         write another article.",5
16584,RONNIE,84, I heard you went down to somebody's office and heckled them?,5

16587,JERRY,84," Well, it's about time one of us drew a line in the sand.",5
16588,RONNIE,84," Jerry, you're like Rosa Parks. You opened the door for all of         us. I can't wait till the next time someone heckles me.",5

16608,Jerry's stand-up #2,84," I was in a hotel the other day, and on the         back of the door in the hotel they have the fire map. I'm flattered that         they think I have it together enough to stand in a burning hotel room         memorizing directions. 'Yeah, I'll go left by the stairs, right by the         candy machine...' I'd probably get lost, have to go back to the room,         check the map again...and they always tell you, no matter what, whatever         you do in a hotel fire - do not panic. Hey, I got four minutes to live,         I've never panicked in my whole life - it's my option. Even if they find         you, you have a perfect excuse...'Gee, I heard they saved you swingin'         from the shower curtain naked with an ice bucket on your head. What happened         there?' 'Well, I panicked.' 'That's understandable.'",5

16764,Elaine,85," Oh, me too. I'll meet you down. (She goes in the hall and               sees",5
16765,George,85," Oh, okay. (Starts to walk other way and then walks to their               room",5
16766,Rachel,85, Hey!,5
16767,George,85," Oh, sorry.",5
16768,Rachel,85, Don't you knock?,5
16769,George,85," I'm sorry, uh, it's not like I'm gonna see something I've               never",5
16770,Jerry,85, You might have.,5
16771,George,85, I didn't.,5
16772,Jerry,85, You won't.,5
16773,Rachel,85," What'd you want anyway, George?",5
16774,Jerry,85," Yes, George. I'm kind of wondering myself. What is it what               you",5
16775,George,85," No, I was just wondering... if you guys, uh, had any gum.",5
16776,Jerry,85," Oh! So you were swimming in the pool, and you wanted some               gum.",5
16777,George,85," Yes, because the water was cold... and the chewing warms               me up.",5
16778,Rachel,85, We don't have any gum.,5
16779,George,85," Okay. (Chewing) Thanks anyway. (Continues to chew as he               exits)",5
16780,Rachel,85, Strange man.,5
16781,Jerry,85, Wait'll you get to know him.,5
16782,Rachel,85," So where is this baby, anyway?",5
16783,Jerry,85," Oh, check it out. I guarantee you've never seen anything               quite so",5
16784,Rachel,85," (She screams) Oh my God! I'm sorry, I thought this was               the baby's",5
16785,George,85, I was in the pool! I was in the pool!,5
16786,George,85, Did she do it on purpose?,5
16787,Jerry,85," It was my fault, I told her the wrong door.",5
16788,George,85, I was supposed to see her. She wasn't supposed to see me.,5
16789,Jerry,85, So what?,5
16790,George,85, Well ordinarily I wouldn't mind. But...,5
16791,Jerry,85, But...,5
16792,George,85," Well I just got back from swimming in the pool. And the               water was",5
16793,Jerry,85, Oh... You mean... shrinkage.,5
16794,George,85, Yes. Significant shrinkage!,5
16795,Jerry,85, So you feel you were short changed.,5
16796,George,85," Yes! I mean, if she thinks that's me she's under a complete",5
16797,Jerry,85," Well, so what's the difference?",5
16798,George,85, What if she discusses it with Jane?,5
16799,Jerry,85," Oh, she's not gonna tell Jane.",5
16800,George,85, How do you know?,5
16801,Jerry,85, Women aren't like us.,5
16802,George,85," They're worse! They're much worse than us, they talk about",5
16803,Jerry,85," No, I'm not gonna tell her about your shrinkage. Besides,               I think",5
16804,George,85," How do women know about shrinkage? (They see Elaine walking               down",5
16805,Elaine,85," What do you mean, like laundry?",5
16806,George,85, No.,5
16807,Jerry,85, Like when a man goes swimming... afterwards...,5
16808,Elaine,85, It shrinks?,5
16809,Jerry,85, Like a frightened turtle!,5
16810,Elaine,85, Why does it shrink?,5
16811,George,85, It just does.,5
16812,Elaine,85, I don't know how you guys walk around with those things.,5
16813,Michael,85," Thanks for the lobster, Kramer.",5
16814,Kramer,85," Rachel, aren't you gonna have any?",5
16815,Rachel,85," Oh, no, I can't. I'm kosher, we don't eat shellfish.",5
16816,Kramer,85, You mean you've never tasted lobster?,5
16817,Rachel,85, No.,5
16818,Kramer,85," Wow. You're so pious. I really respect that. You know when               you",5

16824,Carol,85, I'm gonna get him.,5

16828,Jane,85," It's nothing, George.",5
16829,George,85," You know, it's very impolite to tell secrets. Are you talking",5
16830,Jane,85, What is it with you?,5
16831,Jerry,85, (To George) Easy big fella.,5
16832,Michael,85," So Kramer, where'd you get all these lobster, at the",5
16833,Kramer,85," No, I got 'em in the ocean.",5
16834,Michael,85, The ocean? What'd you mean?,5
16835,Kramer,85," Well, I found this rope and I kept tugging on it, and all               these",5
16836,Michael,85, Those are commercial lobster traps. You can't take those,5
16837,Kramer,85, Take it easy. There's plenty of lobsters in the ocean for,5
16838,Michael,85, My father was a lobsterman. He got up every morning at,5
16839,Carol,85, (Entering with baby) Here he is.,5
16840,Kramer,85, Ahhh! (Falls to floor as he sees the baby),5
16841,Elaine,85," Some night, huh?",5
16842,Ben,85," Yeah, I wish I had my telescope.",5
16843,Elaine,85," Some dinner, huh?",5
16844,Ben,85, Nothing like fresh caught lobster.,5
16845,Elaine,85," Some house, huh?",5
16846,Ben,85, It was built by Mark Farman.,5
16847,Elaine,85," Some ugly baby, huh?",5
16848,Ben,85, What did you say?,5
16849,Elaine,85," I said, uh, some snuggly baby.",5
16850,Ben,85, He is something.,5
16851,Elaine,85," Well, to tell you the truth, Dr. Feffa, I , I was surprised               to hear",5
16852,Ben,85," Well, you know Elaine, sometimes you say things just to be",5
16853,Jerry,85, You told her?,5
16854,Rachel,85," Yeah, what's the big deal?",5
16855,Jerry,85," You don't understand. This organ, it's very... schizophrenic.",5
16856,Rachel,85," Jerry, what the difference? You know, you're the ones obsessed",5
16857,George,85, You're going back to New York now?,5
16858,Jane,85," Yeah, I have some things to do.",5
16859,George,85," Uh huh. Uh huh! I think you spoke to your little friend               Rachel,",5
16860,Jane,85, So what if I did?,5
16861,George,85, And she didn't say something to you about a certain something?,5
16862,Jane,85, I don't know what you're talking about.,5
16863,George,85," *I* think that *you* think that a certain *something* is               not all",5
16864,Jane,85, I'm sure it is.,5
16865,George,85," Look, you don't understand. There was shrinkage.",5
16866,Kramer,85, Looking for this? (Holding up lobster),5
16867,Rachel,85," Oh, Kramer! You startled me.",5
16868,Kramer,85," Well, I thought you might wind up around here.",5
16869,Rachel,85," Yeah, well, I couldn't stop thinking about how everyone               was",5
16870,Kramer,85, I'm afraid I couldn't do that.,5
16871,Rachel,85, Why not?,5
16872,Kramer,85," Well, that wouldn't be kosher.",5
16873,Rachel,85," C'mon, Kramer. I really want to try it.",5
16874,Kramer,85," Nah, I'm sorry, honey. Not on my watch.",5
16875,Rachel,85," Come on, Kramer.",5
16876,Kramer,85, Heyahhh!,5
16877,Rachel,85, I just heard a car drive out. What was that?,5

16881,Kramer,85, I didn't know you could cook.,5

16887,Michael,85, What happened?,5
16888,Rachel,85," Well, I almost tried the lobster, but Kramer stopped me.",5
16889,Kramer,85, You'd regret it for the rest of your life.,5
16890,Rachel,85," You're right, I would have. ",5
16891,Jerry,85," (Referring to George) Hey, look at this guy.",5
16892,George,85, A little breakfast.,5
16893,Jerry,85, Yeah.,5
16894,George,85," (To Rachel) And, uh, you eat eggs, right?",5
16895,Rachel,85," Yes, I do, thanks.",5

16897,Rachel,85, Umm... This is so good.,5
16898,George,85," Ah, enjoying them?",5

16901,Rachel,85, There's lobster in these eggs?,5
16902,George,85," Not that much. You know, they tend to shrink in the water.",5
16903,Jerry,85," Well, I guess I gotta go, too.",5
16904,Elaine,85," Well, this has turned out to be one *helluva* weekend.               (Policeman",5

16913,Jerry,85, I still can't believe Michael finked on Kramer.,5
16914,Elaine,85, How is he gonna pay off a thousand dollar fine?,5
16915,Jerry,85, They got some sort of program.,5

16918,Elaine,85, There's Rachel.,5
16919,George,85, Where? (He looks out window and gets hit by a tomato),5
16920,Jerry ,86," It is pretty hard to justify, at this point in history,               the existence of men and their",5
16921,Mr. Lippman ,86, To your promotion.,5
16922,Elaine ,86," Oh, thank you! ( They drink ) Oh, thank you, Mr Lippman,               I can't tell you",5
16923,Mr Lippman ,86," Well, you're really on your way now.",5
16924,Elaine ,86, You really oughtta do something about that cold.,5
16925,Jerry ,86, You got a raise?,5
16926,Elaine ,86," I don't fool around, baby!",5
16927,Jerry ,86, I thought you said Pendant was in financial trouble.,5
16928,Elaine ,86," They were, but they're being absorbed by Matsushimi, that               big Japanese conglomerate.",5
16929,Jerry ,86," Oh, when did that happen?",5
16930,Elaine ,86, They're signing the papers next week.,5
16931,Jerry ,86," Does this mean they're gonna be publishing Kramer's coffee               table book?",5
16932,Elaine ,86," Yeah, they'll definitely do it now.",5
16933,Jerry ,86," Boy, you're on quite a streak. Job promotion, plus you're               back with Jake Jarmal.",5
16934,Elaine ,86," Yeah, it's gettin' serious, we're talking about moving               in together.",5
16935,Jerry ,86," Boy, you really got it all, I'm sure Helen ""Girlie""               Brown would be very proud of you.",5
16936,Jerry ,86, Speaking of having it all ... Where were you?,5
16937,George ,86, I went to the beach. ( J and E exchange looks ),5
16938,Jerry ,86," Oh, the beach.",5
16939,George ,86," It's not working, Jerry. It's just not working.",5
16940,Jerry ,86, What is it that isn't working?,5
16941,George ,86," Why did it all turn out like this for me? I had so much               promise. I was personable, I was bright. Oh, maybe not academically               speaking, but ... I was perceptive. I always know when someone's               uncomfortable at a party. It became very clear to me sitting out               there today, that every decision I've ever made, in my entire life,               has been wrong. My life is the opposite of everything I want it               to be. Every instinct I have, in every of life, be it something               to wear, something to eat ... It's all been wrong.",5
16942,Waitress ,86," Tuna on toast, coleslaw, cup of coffee.",5
16943,George ,86," Yeah. No, no, no, wait a minute, I always have tuna on               toast. Nothing's ever worked out for me with tuna on toast. I want               the complete opposite of on toast. Chicken salad, on rye, untoasted               ... and a cup of tea.",5
16944,Elaine ,86," Well, there's no telling what can happen from this.",5
16945,Jerry ,86," You know chicken salad is not the opposite of tuna, salmon               is the opposite of tuna, 'cos salmon swim against the current, and               the tuna swim with it.",5
16946,George ,86, Good for the tuna.,5
16947,Elaine ,86," Ah, George, you know, that woman just looked at you.",5
16948,George ,86, So what? What am I supposed to do?,5
16949,Elaine ,86, Go talk to her.,5
16950,George ,86," Elaine, bald men, with no jobs, and no money, who live               with their parents, don't approach strange women.",5
16951,Jerry ,86," Well here's your chance to try the opposite. Instead of               tuna salad and being intimidated by women, chicken salad and going               right up to them.",5
16952,George ,86," Yeah, I should do the opposite, I should.",5
16953,Jerry ,86," If every instinct you have is wrong, then the opposite               would have to be right.",5
16954,George ,86," Yes, I will do the opposite. I used to sit here and do               nothing, and regret it for the rest of the day, so now I will do               the opposite, and I will do",5
16955,George ,86," Excuse me, I couldn't help but notice that you were looking               in my direction.",5
16956,Victoria ,86," Oh, yes I was, you just ordered the same exact lunch               as me.",5
16957,George ,86, My name is George. I'm unemployed and I live with my parents.,5
16958,Victoria ,86, I'm Victoria. Hi.,5
16959,Jerry ,86," Are you kidding? They can't cancel that show on me now,               it's too late for me to book anything else for that weekend. Alright,               alright ... okay, bye.",5
16960,Kramer ,86," Hey. Buddy, it's all happening!",5

16966,Jerry ,86, I'll loan you my puffy shirt.,5
16967,Kramer ,86," No,no,no.",5
16968,Jerry ,86, What're you gonna talk about?,5
16969,Kramer ,86," Well, coffee tables.",5
16970,Jerry ,86," Hello? What? Yeah, sure, I'll do it. I just had something               cancelled the same weekend. Ok. Great. Bye.",5
16971,Jerry ,86," You know, life is amazing. I just lost a job and five minutes               later get another, same weekend, same money.",5
16972,Kramer ,86, You know who you are? Even Steven,5
16973,Victoria ,86, Are you growing a beard?,5
16974,George ,86, Why shave every day? It just grows right back.,5
16975,Victoria ,86, I guess ...,5
16976,George ,86," I'm afraid I'm just not interested in how I present myself.               If those kind of superficialities are important to you, this probably               isn't gonna work.",5
16977,Victoria ,86," Hey watch, he just cut you off! Did you see that?!",5
16978,George ,86, Take it easy. Take it easy. It's not the end of the world.,5
16979,Man no.1 ,86," Hey baby, how about a little tongue action, huh?",5
16980,Man no.2 ,86," Yeah, stick your tongue down his throat!",5
16981,Victoria ,86, What are we gonna do? Shall we just move?,5
16982,George ,86, That won't be necessary.,5
16983,George ,86," Shut your traps and stop kicking the seats! We're trying               to watch the movie! And if I have to tell you again, we're gonna               take it outside and I'm gonna show you what it's like! You understand               me? Now, shut your mouths or I'll",5

16986,Victoria ,86," Who are you, George Costanza?",5
16987,George ,86, I'm the opposite of every guy you've ever met.,5
16988,Theater Manager ,86," Excuse me, is your name Elaine?",5
16989,Elaine ,86, Yes.,5
16990,Theater Manager ,86, Were you suposed to meet a Jake Jarmal here?,5
16991,Elaine ,86, Yeah.,5
16992,Theater Manager ,86," Well, I'm afraid he's been in an accident.",5
16993,Elaine ,86, An accident? What happened?,5

17010,Jake ,86," I would think, under the circumstances, it would have sent               you running out the building. Apparently, it didn't have any effect               on you.",5
17011,Elaine ,86," No, no, it does!",5
17012,Jake ,86," If you got into a car accident, I can guarantee you I wouldn't               stop for Jujyfruit!",5
17013,Elaine ,86, But...Jake...,5
17014,Jake ,86," I would like to be alone now, please.",5
17015,Elaine ,86," But, Jake, I didn't...",5
17016,Jake ,86, Goodnight!,5
17017,Man no.1 ,86," Ah, whaddya say we call it a night?",5
17018,Man no.2 ,86," Good idea, I'm kinda tired.",5
17019,Man no.3 ,86, How'd you do?,5
17020,Man no.4 ,86, Won 50.,5
17021,Man no.2 ,86, Lost 72.,5
17022,Man no.1 ,86, Won 37.,5
17023,Man no.3 ,86, Lost 15.,5
17024,Jerry ,86, Broke even.,5
17025,Regis ,86, Can I bring out our next guest now?,5
17026,Kathy Lee ,86," Please, please.",5
17027,Regis ,86," Young guy, he's got a new book coming out, and it's about,               and this is the best part -",5
17028,Kathy Lee ,86, I love this.,5
17029,Regis ,86, It's a coffee table book about coffee tables!,5
17030,Kathy Lee ,86, Yeah. Is that clever? I think that is so clever!,5
17031,Regis ,86, I think so too. Did you get to meet him back stage?,5
17032,Kathy Lee ,86, I did.,5
17033,Regis ,86," I mean, he looks like a fun guy, doesn't he?",5
17034,Kathy Lee ,86, I love his hair.,5
17035,Kathy Lee ,86," I don't know, maybe it's the hair or something!",5
17036,Regis ,86," Kramer. So, a coffee table book about coffee tables. Where               did you come up with this idea?",5
17037,Kramer ,86," Yeah, well, ah, I'll tell you, Regis... actually, this               is a true story. I was skiing at the time.",5
17038,Regis ,86," You know, when I'm skiing, Kramer, I'm trying not to kill               myself, and you're writing books!",5
17039,Kramer ,86," Yeah, well, now you kids don't go out and try that. You               stay in school!",5
17040,Kathy Lee ,86," Have you always had an interest in coffee tables, because,               really, I love coffee tables, and I thought I was the only one.",5
17041,Kramer ,86," You see the beauty of my book is, if you don't have a               coffee table, it turns into a coffee table.",5
17042,Kathy Lee ,86, Is that fabulous?,5
17043,Regis ,86, Look at this!,5
17044,Kathy Lee ,86, Is that fabulous?,5
17045,Regis ,86, Fabulous!,5
17046,Kathy Lee ,86, I want one of these.,5
17047,Regis ,86, Did I tell you this guy was bonkos?,5
17048,Kathy Lee ,86," This coffee table (book) is full of pictures of celebrities'               coffee tables.",5
17049,Kramer ,86, That's true. That's right.,5
17050,Regis ,86," Yeah? Well, I'm not in there. Where's mine?",5
17051,Kramer ,86," Oh, it's on file, right here. ( points to his head )",5
17052,Regis ,86," I'm tellin' ya, this guy's bonkos! He really is!",5
17053,Kathy Lee ,86, But he's adorable.,5
17054,Regis ,86, We'll be right back.,5
17055,Jerry ,86, So it's all over?,5
17056,Elaine ,86," Yeah, it got pretty nasty.",5
17057,Jerry ,86, And what did you go back for? Jujyfruit?,5
17058,Elaine ,86," It's not like I went across the street. I bought the Jujyfruit               and I got in a cab.",5
17059,Jerry ,86, Why didn't you eat it in the cab?,5
17060,Elaine ,86," Because I got popcorn too, and I ate that first.",5
17061,Elaine ,86, What's all this?,5
17062,Jerry ,86, Played cards last night.,5
17063,Elaine ,86, Oh yeah? How'd you do?,5
17064,Jerry ,86, Broke even.,5
17065,Elaine ,86, You always break even.,5
17066,Jerry ,86," Yeah, I know; like yesterday I lost a job, and then I got               another one, and then I missed a TV show, and later on they re-ran               it. And then today I missed a train, went outside and caught a bus.               It never fails! I always even out!",5
17067,Elaine ,86, Do you have twenty bucks?,5
17068,Jerry ,86, What for?,5
17069,Elaine ,86, Just gimme twenty bucks.,5
17070,Jerry ,86, What the hell was that?,5
17071,Elaine ,86, Let's see if you get the twenty bucks back.,5
17072,Jerry ,86," You know you could've thrown a pencil out the window and               seen if that came back.",5
17073,Elaine ,86," You know, things were going so good for me, you know,               I got the job",5
17074,Jerry ,86," Well, maybe next time someone's in a car accident you won't               stop off for candy first.",5
17075,George ,86," Hey, I just found twenty dollars! I tell you this, something               is happening in my life. I did this opposite thing last night. Up               was down, black was white, good was -",5
17076,Jerry,86, Bad.,5
17077,George ,86, Day was -,5
17078,Elaine ,86, Night.,5
17079,George ,86, Yes!,5
17080,Jerry ,86, So you just did the opposite of everything?,5
17081,George ,86," Yes. And listen to this, listen to this; her uncle works               for the Yankees and he's gonna get me a job interview. A front office               kind of thing. Assistant to the travelling secretary. A job with               the New York Yankees! This has been the dream of my life ever since               I was a child, and it's all happening because I'm completely ignoring               every urge towards common sense and good judgment I've ever had.               This is no longer just some crazy notion. Jerry, this is my religion.",5
17082,Jerry ,86, So I guess your Messiah would be the Anti-Christ.,5
17083,Jerry ,86, Elaine ... look! A twenty!,5
17084,Elaine ,86, Oh my God.,5
17085,Kramer ,86, Hey boss.,5
17086,Mr. Lippman ,86, Kramer. Come in.,5
17087,Kramer ,86," How're you doin' there, big guy? ( Puts his arm around               the tobacco store Indian )",5
17088,Mr. Lippman ,86, Have a seat.,5
17089,Kramer ,86," What, have you got yourself a cold?",5
17090,Kramer ,86," Wow, that's quite a honk! Get yourself some vitamin C               with rose hips and bioflavenoids.",5
17091,Mr. Lippman ,86," The reason I asked you in here, is I caught your               appearance on ""Regis and Kathy Lee"" the other day and               -",5
17092,Kramer ,86," It was pretty good, huh?",5
17093,Mr. Lippman ,86," Anyway, the thinking here is that it would be best               if you didn't do any more of these shows.",5
17094,Kramer ,86, Because of the coffee thing?,5
17095,Mr.Lippman ,86," Kramer, I'm sorry.",5
17096,Kramer ,86," What about ""Sonia Live""? Now you're not cancelling               ""Sonia Live""?",5
17097,Mr. Lippman ,86, It's out -,5
17098,Kramer ,86," She's a doctor, I got a thing for her.",5
17099,Mr. Lippman ,86," Kramer, I -",5
17100,Mr. Cushman ,86," Why don't you tell me about some of your previous               job experiences?",5
17101,George ,86," Alrighty. Ah ... my last job was in publishing ... I got               fired for having sex in my office with the cleaning woman.",5
17102,Mr. Cushman ,86, Go on.,5
17103,George ,86," Alright, before that, I was in real estate. I quit, because               the boss wouldn't let me use his private bathroom. That was it.",5
17104,Mr. Cushman ,86, Do you talk to everybody like this?,5
17105,George ,86, Of course.,5
17106,Mr. Cushman ,86, My niece told me you were different.,5
17107,George ,86," I am different, yeah.",5
17108,Mr. Cushman ,86," I gotta tell you, you are the complete opposite of               every applicant we've seen.",5
17109,Mr. Cushman ,86," Ah, Mr. Steinbrenner, sir. There's someone here I'd               like you to meet. This is Mr. Costanza. He's one of the applicants.",5
17110,Mr. Steinbrenner ,86, Nice to meet you.,5
17111,George ,86," Well, I wish I could say the same, but I must say, with               all due respect, I find it very hard to see the logic behind some               of the moves you have made with this fine organization. In the past               twenty years you have caused myself, and the city of New York, a               good deal of distress, as we have watched you take our beloved Yankees               and reduced them to a laughing stock, all for the glorification               of your massive ego!",5
17112,Mr. Steinbrenner ,86, Hire this man!,5
17113,Secretary ,86, Tina Robbins is here to see you. ,5
17114,Man ,86, Who's that?,5
17115,Elaine ,86," Ah, it's my ex-roommate, she moved out four years ago,               but I've been sub-",5
17116,Man ,86," Alright, see ya. ( Meets Tina in the door ) Hey.",5
17117,Tina ,86, Please.,5
17118,Elaine ,86, Hi Tina.,5
17119,Tina,86, Hi Elaine.,5
17120,Elaine ,86," So, I haven't seen you in a while.",5
17121,Tina ,86," Elaine, we have a problem.",5
17122,Elaine ,86," Well, what is it?",5
17123,Tina ,86, You're getting kicked out.,5
17124,Elaine ,86, Kicked out?! Why?!,5
17125,Tina ,86," Well, there's been a number of complaints.",5
17126,Elaine ,86, Yeah? Like what?,5
17127,Tina ,86," Well, like last Thanksgiving you buzzed up a jewel thief.",5
17128,Elaine ,86, I didn't know who he was!,5
17129,Tina ,86, That's why there's a buzzer.,5
17130,Elaine ,86, What else?,5
17131,Tina ,86," Well, apparently, the week after that, you buzzed up some               Jehova's Witnesses and they couldn't get them out of the building.",5
17132,Elaine ,86, What else have you got?,5
17133,Tina ,86," Well, let's see. ( Takes out a list from her bag )",5
17134,Jerry ,86," I'll tell you what the big advantage of homosexuality is.               If you're going out with someone your size, right there you double               your wardrobe.",5
17135,Rachel ,86, I suppose...,5
17136,Jerry ,86," Oh, come on, that's a huge feature. When they approach               a new recruit, I'm sure that's one of the big selling points.",5
17137,Rachel ,86, Jerry ...,5
17138,Jerry ,86, Yes?,5
17139,Rachel ,86, I've been doing a lot of thinking.,5
17140,Jerry ,86, Aha?,5
17141,Rachel ,86," Well, I don't think we should see each other any more.",5
17142,Jerry ,86," Oh, that's okay.",5
17143,Rachel ,86, What?,5
17144,Jerry ,86," Nah, that's fine. No problem. I'll meet somebody else.",5
17145,Rachel ,86, You will?,5
17146,Jerry ,86," Sure. See, things always even out for me.",5
17147,Rachel ,86, Huh?,5
17148,Jerry ,86," It's fine. Anyway, it's been really nice dating you for               a while. And ... good luck!",5
17149,Rachel ,86," Yeah, you too.",5
17150,Jerry ,86, The New York Yankees?!,5
17151,George ,86, The New York Yankees!,5
17152,Jerry ,86," Ruth, Gehrig, DiMaggio, Mantle ... Costanza?",5
17153,George ,86," I'm the assistant to the travelling secretary. I'm going               on the road trips with them! I'll be on the plane... I'm working               in Yankee Stadium! This is a dream, I'm busting, Jerry, I'm busting!",5
17154,Jerry ,86, I can't believe it.,5
17155,George ,86," And I' moving out of my parents' house, I'm taking that               apartment on 86th street, remember the one we saw?",5
17156,Jerry ,86, That's a great place!,5
17157,George ,86," I'm back in business, baby!",5
17158,Jerry ,86," George, I wouldn't get too excited about this stuff, you               know, things have a way of evening out.",5
17159,George ,86," Hey! ( to Elaine, who doesn't look too cheerful )",5
17160,Jerry ,86, Hi Elaine.,5
17161,Elaine ,86, Hi.,5
17162,Jerry ,86, How're things going?,5
17163,Elaine ,86," How're things going? You wanna know how things are going?               I'll tell you how things are going. I am getting kicked out of my               apartment!",5
17164,Jerry ,86, Why? Why are they doing that?,5
17165,Elaine ,86, I don't know! They have a list of grievances.,5
17166,Jerry ,86, The jewel thief?,5
17167,Elaine ,86," Yeah, the jewel thief.",5
17168,Jerry ,86, What else?,5
17169,Elaine ,86," I put Canadian quarters in the washing machine. I gotta               be out by the end of the month.",5
17170,George ,86," Well, you could move in with my parents.",5
17171,Elaine ,86," Was that the ... opposite ... of what you were going to               say, or was that just instinct? ( She squeezes G's mouth between               her fingers )",5
17172,George ,86, Instinct.,5
17173,Elaine ,86," Stick ... with the opposite. ( Slaps G on the forehead               )",5
17174,Jerry ,86," Elaine, don't get too down. Everything'll even out, see,               I have two friends, you were up, he was down. Now he's up, you're               down. You see how it all evens out for me?",5
17175,Secretary ,86," Mr. Lippman, the people from Matsushimi are here. ",5
17176,Mr. Lippman ,86," Alright... tell them I'll be right there. Well, this               is it, Elaine. You know, without this merger, we'd be out on the               street. Boy, they sure saved us.",5
17177,Interpreter ,86," Mr Lippman, it is with great pride that we undertake               this partnership with your company.",5
17178,Mr Lippman ,86," I ... I'm sorry, I can't shake your hand right now.               It's germs.",5
17179,Jerry ,86, Is that the end of it?,5
17180,George ,86," Yeah, it's the last one.",5
17181,Estelle ,86," I can't believe you're moving out. ( Grabs Kramer ) Kramer,               is this true? Is it really happening? It's ... it's like a dream.",5
17182,Kramer ,86," Oh, it's true.",5
17183,George ,86," Alright, let's go.",5
17184,Frank ,86," Don't get in trouble with the Yankees. You be nice. ( Slaps               G's forehead )",5
17185,George ,86, I'm not gonna be nice. That's how I got the job.,5
17186,Estelle ,86," Jerry, did you hear this?",5
17187,Jerry ,86, He knows what he's doing.,5
17188,George ,86," I just want the both of you to know how much you mean               to me, and I love you both very, very much.",5
17189,Jerry ,86, Opposite.,5
17190,Elaine ,86," I must've had at least eight in my mouth. I couldn't talk.               I couldn't talk!",5
17191,Jerry ,86, Why'd you have to eat so many?,5
17192,Elaine ,86," Because they're Jujyfruit. I like them. I didn't know               it would start a chain reaction that would lead to the end of Pendant               Publishing.",5
17193,Jerry ,86, Not to mention the end of Kramer's coffee table book.,5
17194,Kramer ,86," Yeah, you knew he had a cold. How'd you expect him to               blow his nose?",5
17195,Elaine ,86," Do you know what's going on here? Can't you see what's               happened? I've become George.",5
17196,Jerry ,86, Don't say that.,5
17197,Elaine ,86, It's true. I'm George! I'm George!,5
17198,Kramer ,86," Wait, wait, wait, that's too much. Mine was more than               yours.",5
17199,Jerry ,86, Ah ... let's call it even.,5
17200,Jerry ,86," Coffee's a drink that seems to encourage a lot of accessories               around it. Coffee cake, coffee table, coffee table book, clutches               of people. Say what you want about alcohol, but not only are there               not a lot of optional accessories, alcohol actually helps you get               rid of things. Family, home, job, driver's license. In fact, at               a certain point, the only thing you have to remember to get, is               more alcohol And maybe a rag for your squeegee.",5
17203,Jerry's stand-up,87," Baseball is so associated with sex. ""He's         playing the field,"" ""Hoo, he scored,"" ""oh, he didn't         get to first base."" ""I struck out."" ""Why?"" ""She         wanted a diamond."" It's always about baseball. Always baseball. As         far as baseball goes, I prefer the fat umpires...I feel if you're on the         field and you're not in the game, you should be in the worst physical         condition a human being could possibly be in. They should be allowed to         eat during the game. We're a little too into sports in this country, I         think we gotta throttle back. Know what I mean? People come home from         these games, ""We won! We won!"" No, they won - you watched.",6

17230,ELAINE,87," Hey, just because I'm not working doesn't mean I haven't got         any money. (To vendor) Yo! Dogs! Two!",6
17231,JERRY,87, I'm sorry.,6
17232,ANNOUNCER ON P.A. SYSTEM,87," Your attention please...the New York Yankees         would like to welcome Miss Connecticut, Miss Rhode Island and Miss North         Dakota, all of whom will be competing in the Miss America pageant this         weekend in Atlantic City. <The three contestants make their way to         their seats, right across the aisle from Jerry and Elaine.>",6
17233,JERRY (to Elaine),87," Now, there's a career path you may have overlooked.",6
17234,ELAINE,87," Ooh, I gotta check my machine. I'm waiting to hear about an interview.         Doubleday is looking for somebody to replace Jackie Onassis. ",6
17235,JERRY,87," Oh, she worked at Doubleday...?",6
17236,ELAINE,87," Yeah, she was an editor.",6
17237,JERRY,87," Right, just like you. ",6
17238,ELAINE,87, Yeah. Can you hold my seat? <Elaine gets up.>,6
17239,CROWD,87, Hey! Down in front! <Elaine clambers over Jerry and exits.>,6
17240,JERRY (offers a hot dog to Miss Rhode Island),87, Hot dog?,6
17241,MISS RHODE ISLAND,87," No, thanks. I'm watching my weight.",6
17242,JERRY,87," Ah. I'm watching my height. My doctor doesn't want me to get any         taller. So you're Miss, uh...",6
17243,MISS RHODE ISLAND,87, Rhode Island. ,6
17244,JERRY,87," I was almost Mr. Coffee. They felt I was a little too relaxed.         <Miss Rhode Island laughs.>",6
17245,GEORGE,87, Miss Rhode Island? When are you seeing her?,6
17246,JERRY,87," Tonight. I have to call her, she's staying in a hotel.",6
17247,GEORGE,87, You're incredible.,6
17248,JERRY,87," And get this - I'm working in Atlantic City this weekend, and         she's going to be down there for the pageant.",6
17249,GEORGE,87," What if she becomes Miss America? You could be dating Miss America,         Jerry!",6
17250,JERRY,87," The only bad thing is, we have to go out with a chaperone.",6
17251,GEORGE,87," Chaperone? What, are you kidding?",6
17252,JERRY,87," No, it's part of the contest rules.",6
17253,GEORGE,87, What does the chaperone do?,6
17254,JERRY,87," I don't know, she just sits there.",6
17255,GEORGE,87, Can she talk?,6
17256,JERRY,87," I'm not sure if she's allowed to talk. <Picks up the phone         and dials.>",6
17257,GEORGE,87, You're calling her?,6
17258,JERRY,87," Yeah. (sings) There she is...Miss - yes, room 417 please? Karen         Hanson?",6
17259,GEORGE,87," Hey, did you know that the Yankees don't wear cotton jerseys?",6
17260,JERRY,87," Of course, they're polyester.",6
17261,GEORGE,87," Well, what is that? That's a crime! Do you know how hot those         things get? They should be wearing cotton.",6
17262,JERRY,87, Why do they wear polyester?,6
17263,GEORGE,87, I don't know. That's all gonna change.,6
17264,JERRY,87, You're going to do something about it?,6
17265,GEORGE,87, Why shouldn't I?,6
17266,JERRY (doubtfully),87, No reason... ,6
17267,LANDIS,87," Of course, Jackie O. was a great lady. Those are going to be         some tough shoes to fill. Everyone loved her. She had such...grace.",6
17268,ELAINE (gushing),87, Yes! Grace!,6
17269,LANDIS,87, Not many people have grace.,6
17270,ELAINE,87," Well, you know, grace is a tough one. I like to think I have         a little grace...not as much as Jackie - ",6
17271,LANDIS,87," You can't have ""a little grace."" You either have grace,         or you...don't.",6
17272,ELAINE,87," O.K., fine, I have...no grace.",6
17273,LANDIS,87, And you can't acquire grace.,6
17274,ELAINE,87," Well, I have no intention of ""getting"" grace.",6
17275,LANDIS,87, Grace isn't something you can pick up at the market.,6
17276,ELAINE (fed up),87," Alright, alright, look - I don't have grace, I don't         want grace...I don't even say grace, O.K.?",6
17277,LANDIS,87, Thank you for coming in.,6
17278,ELAINE,87," Yeah, yeah, right.",6
17279,LANDIS,87," We'll make our choice in a few days, and we'll let you know.",6
17280,ELAINE (stands up),87," I have no chance, do I?",6
17281,LANDIS,87, No. <They shake hands.>,6
17282,LANDIS'S INTERCOM,87, Justin Pitt to see you.,6
17283,ELAINE,87, Justin Pitt?,6
17284,LANDIS,87, He was a very close friend of Mrs. Onassis's.,6
17285,ELAINE,87," ""Mrs. Onassis's""? That's hard to pronounce.",6
17286,LANDIS,87, Excuse me?,6
17287,ELAINE,87, Nothing. <Mr. Pitt comes in with some papers in hand.>,6
17288,PITT,87," Mrs. Landis, there's something wrong with this copying machine,         it's all coming out slanted. Now, I don't know if this is your department         or not.",6
17289,LANDIS,87," Justin Pitt, this is Elaine Benes. <Elaine turns around. With         sunglasses and a scarf on her head, she bears a close resemblance to Jackie         O.>",6
17290,PITT (clearly affected by Elaine's appearance),87, Charmed.,6
17291,ELAINE,87, I was a great admirer of Mrs. Onass-sis-sis-sis...,6
17292,JERRY,87," Hello, Karen? It's Jerry Seinfeld. Oh, that's very sweet of you.         You know, you better be careful, you don't want to get too congenial.         They'll slap that ""Miss Congeniality"" on you, and you'll congene         yourself right out of the contest. So, what time do you want to get together         later? What? So what, we don't need the chaperone. (To George) The chaperone         can't make it. (To Karen) Oh, you're not gonna get disqualified! So, we're         not going? <Kramer enters.> Hold on one second. (To Kramer) Hey,         what are you doing tonight?",6
17293,KRAMER,87, Nothin.',6
17294,JERRY,87," I'm going out with one of the Miss America contestants, you wanna         go?",6
17295,KRAMER,87, What state?,6
17296,JERRY,87, Rhode Island.,6
17297,KRAMER,87, They're never in contention.,6
17298,GEORGE,87, How do you know?,6
17299,KRAMER,87," Because I've seen every Miss America pageant since I was six.       ",6
17300,JERRY,87," Look, do you want to go or not? I'll buy you dinner.",6
17301,KRAMER,87, Giddy-up!,6
17302,JERRY (to Karen),87, I think I got someone!,6
17303,PITT (looking at Elaine and smiling),87," The resemblance is uncanny. <Elaine,         sipping soda through a straw, looks up with a sour expression on her face.>         Even the brown eyes.",6
17304,ELAINE,87," Well, a lot of people have brown eyes.",6
17305,PITT,87," No, there's something else. An indefinable quality.",6
17306,ELAINE,87, Grace?,6
17307,PITT,87," Grace, yes. ",6
17308,ELAINE,87, You think I have grace?,6
17309,PITT,87," Some grace, yes. ",6
17310,ELAINE,87, Just some?,6
17311,PITT,87," Well, you don't want too much grace or you won't be able to stand.",6
17312,ELAINE (laughing),87," Oh, Mr. Pitt.",6
17313,PITT,87," Elaine, I want you to come and work for me as my personal assistant.         Now, I'll pay you the same as Pendant, but I would need you to start right         away.",6
17314,GEORGE,87," Hey, Buck. Talk to you for a second?",6
17315,SHOWALTER,87," Sure, George.",6
17316,GEORGE,87, How's everything going? Everything O.K.?,6
17317,SHOWALTER,87," Well, all of a sudden there's a problem with Tartabull's swing...",6
17318,GEORGE,87," Listen, Buck, I uh...obviously I don't need to talk to you about         the importance of player morale, but uh...I've been talking to some of         the guys, and some of them - I don't want to mention any names - but some         of them...they're not too happy with the polyester uniforms.",6
17319,SHOWALTER,87, How so?,6
17320,GEORGE,87," Well, they get very hot in the polyester. You know, it's not         a natural fibre. I think they would prefer cotton.",6
17321,SHOWALTER,87," Cotton, huh?",6
17322,GEORGE,87," Yeah. Cotton breathes, you see, it's much softer. Imagine playing         games and your team is five degrees cooler than the other team. Don't         you think that would be an advantage? They're cooler, they're more comfortable...they're         happier - they're gonna play better.",6
17323,SHOWALTER,87," You may have something there, George.",6
17324,GEORGE,87, Oh - I've got something.,6
17325,SHOWALTER (considering),87, Hmm. Cotton uniforms.,6
17326,JERRY,87, Congratulations!,6
17327,ELAINE,87," Yeah! And the best part is, I still get to look for work in publishing.",6
17328,JERRY,87," Now, what is it that you do, exactly?",6
17329,ELAINE,87, I attend to his personal affairs. ,6
17330,JERRY,87, Like what?,6
17331,ELAINE,87," Well, like tomorrow for example, I have to uh...I have to buy         him some socks.",6
17332,JERRY,87, Really! Socks!,6
17333,ELAINE,87, Yeah. White ones. Like the ones you wear with sneakers.,6
17334,JERRY,87," Hey, maybe you can pick me up some underwear! <Kramer enters.>",6
17335,KRAMER (shows Jerry his outfit),87," So, what do you think? Does this work?",6
17336,JERRY,87," Listen...tonight, after we finish eating, you make like you got         something else to do and just ""recede into the night,"" if you         know what I mean.",6
17337,KRAMER,87, No way!,6
17338,JERRY,87, What?,6
17339,KRAMER,87," Look, if you think I'm just going to step aside and do nothing         while you defile this woman, you're crazy.",6
17340,JERRY,87," I'm not going to ""defile"" her!",6
17341,KRAMER,87," That's right, because I'm going to see it doesn't happen. Look,         Jerry, these girls are Miss America contestants. It's every little girl's         dream. And I'm not going to let you trample that dream and make a mockery         of everything the pageant stands for. ",6
17342,JERRY,87, But - ,6
17343,KRAMER (holds up his hand),87, AAAH! No buts! Those are my rules.,6
17344,JERRY,87, But wait a minute...,6
17345,KRAMER,87," Now, if you want to go out and have some good, wholesome fun         with a nice girl, I'd be glad to help you out...if you're looking for         something more than that, you've got the wrong guy, buddy! <Jerry tries         to get a word in during this entire speech, but Kramer won't budge an         inch.>",6
17346,KRAMER,87," If you were Miss America, what would you do to make the world         a better place?",6
17347,KAREN,87," As Miss America, I would try and bring an end to world hunger.         If every person sacrificed one meal a week, there would be enough to feed         the whole world!",6
17348,JERRY,87, That's a hell of a plan. (To Kramer) Listen - ,6
17349,KRAMER (to Karen),87, What advice would you give young people?,6
17350,JERRY,87," Alright, Kramer!",6
17351,KRAMER,87," This is important stuff! She's got to be able to answer these         questions. She's not going to have time to think, out there, with millions         of people watching her. Any hesitation could cost her the crown. You know,         poise counts.",6
17352,KAREN,87," You really know a lot about this, don't you?",6
17353,KRAMER,87," Oh yeah, like last year? Miss Texas? Now, she should have won         easily, but she lost points in the swimsuit competition.",6
17354,KAREN,87," Well, what could she have done?",6
17355,KRAMER,87, Tape her breasts together. <Jerry is shocked.>,6
17356,KAREN,87, What else?,6
17357,KRAMER,87," Well, take you for example. Now, you're very attractive, but         you got a big waist.",6
17358,JERRY,87," Hey, come on!",6
17359,KAREN,87," No, no...it's O.K. (To Kramer) Go on.",6
17360,KRAMER,87," Well, I'd recommend a waist cincher. ",6
17361,KAREN,87, Really.,6
17362,KRAMER,87," Oh, yeah. Just - thip! - suck you in.",6
17363,JERRY,87, I'll be right back. <Leaves the table.>,6
17364,KRAMER,87," So, what's your talent?",6
17365,KAREN,87, Magic.,6
17366,KRAMER,87, Mmm. I'm thinking of a number from one to ten.,6
17367,KAREN,87, Six.,6
17368,KRAMER,87," No, five. But you were close. ",6
17369,ANNOUNCER #1,87, And the Yankees take the field!,6
17370,ANNOUNCER #2,87," Is it my imagination, or do the Yankees look a little different         tonight? I can't put my finger on it...",6
17371,ANNOUNCER #1,87," Well, from what I understand, they've switched to cotton         uniforms.",6
17372,ANNOUNCER #2,87," They seem blousier, softer...",6
17373,ANNOUNCER #1,87," Well, it is a natural fibre...",6
17374,KRAMER,87, How's your evening?,6
17375,KAREN,87," Well, I'm wearing this red dress - ",6
17376,KRAMER,87, Stop right there.,6
17377,KAREN,87, No good?,6
17378,KRAMER,87, Disaster. ,6
17379,KAREN,87, Why?,6
17380,KRAMER,87," Well, you got brown eyes. You want to wear a green dress.",6
17381,KAREN,87, That makes sense. <The limo stops at Karen's hotel.>,6
17382,JERRY,87," Well, here we are...",6
17383,KAREN,87," Kramer, would you consider being my personal consultant for the         pageant?",6
17384,KRAMER,87," Okay. But if I'm going to do this, we play by my rules or we         don't play at all.",6
17385,KAREN,87," I am in your hands. <They shake hands.> Well! Oh, good night,         Jerry. <They're about to kiss, but Kramer stops them by clearing his         throat.> Kenneth will take you home. <She gets out, leaving Jerry         staring at Kramer with an angry expression on his face.>",6
17386,KRAMER,87, Hey.,6
17387,JERRY,87," Well, if it isn't Mr. Blackwell.",6
17388,KRAMER,87," Oh, come on.",6
17389,JERRY,87," And that waist cincher, that was the topper!",6
17390,KRAMER,87," Oh, you're poo-pooing!",6
17391,JERRY,87," Yes, I poo-poo.",6
17392,KRAMER,87," Well, let me tell you something. I'm taking this kid to the top.         To the top, Jerry! We're going for the crown, and you can't stop her!",6
17393,JERRY,87, I don't want to stop her!,6
17394,KRAMER,87," You can't stop her, Jerry! Oh, I've seen 'em come and         go, but this kid has got something! <Turns to leave.>",6
17395,JERRY,87," Yeah, so do you. <George enters with a newspaper.>",6
17396,GEORGE,87," Well, did you see it?",6
17397,JERRY,87, See what?,6
17398,JERRY,87," Boy, they really do sound comfortable.",6
17399,GEORGE (noticing Jerry's suitcase),87," Hey, where ya goin'?",6
17400,JERRY,87, I'm working in Atlantic City.,6
17401,GEORGE,87, Really!,6
17402,JERRY,87," Yeah. Hey, you're not working this weekend, why don't you come         down?",6
17403,GEORGE,87," Atlantic City? (thinks) Yes! Yes! I will go to Atlantic City.         I'm in. I'm down.",6
17404,JERRY,87," You know what, maybe Elaine wants to go too, lemme call her. <Picks         up the phone.> She's at Mr. Pitt's, I think I got the number...",6
17405,ELAINE,87," So, what do you think?",6
17406,PITT (pulling up the socks),87, No.,6
17407,ELAINE,87, You don't like them?,6
17408,PITT,87," No, I don't like them. ",6
17409,ELAINE,87, What's wrong?,6
17410,PITT,87, They're too tight.,6
17411,ELAINE,87, Too tight?,6
17412,PITT,87," There's no elastic, you need to pull too much <pulls them up         more>.",6
17413,ELAINE (examining the socks),87, I think they look good!,6
17414,PITT,87, They're cutting off the circulation. ,6
17415,ELAINE,87," Alright, well, I'll just take them back. <The phone rings.>",6
17416,PITT,87, Hello?,6
17417,JERRY,87," Hi, Mr. Pitt! Is Elaine there?",6
17418,PITT (hands the phone to Elaine),87, It's for you.,6
17419,ELAINE,87, Sorry. Hello?,6
17420,JERRY,87," Hey Elaine, it's me.",6
17421,ELAINE,87, Jerry?,6
17422,JERRY,87, We're going to Atlantic City.,6
17423,ELAINE,87, Really? When?,6
17424,JERRY,87," Today, right now! Are you in?",6
17425,ELAINE,87," One second, hang on. (To Mr. Pitt) Excuse me, Mr. Pitt? Would         it be alright if I got you the socks tomorrow?",6
17426,PITT,87, Tomorrow?,6
17427,ELAINE,87, Yes.,6
17428,PITT,87, But I was hoping for my new socks today!,6
17429,ELAINE,87," Well, it's just one more day. ",6
17430,PITT,87, I'm sorry. I must have them today.,6
17431,ELAINE (to Jerry),87, I can't go.,6
17432,JERRY,87, Why not?,6
17433,ELAINE,87, Because I have to return the socks and get different ones.,6
17434,PITT,87, Elaine!,6
17435,ELAINE,87, I gotta go. <Hangs up.>,6
17436,KRAMER,87," No. Alright, watch me now. <Karen sits on the bed. Kramer         walks across the room like a Miss America contestant with a big smile         on his face.> Turn, back, head up, shoulders back...posture. You see?         Posture.",6
17437,KAREN,87," Yes, I see. O.K.",6
17438,KRAMER,87," Let's try a few more questions, alright? <Karen stands up.>         If you were Miss America, and the U.S. was on the brink of a nuclear war,         and the only way the conflict could be averted was if you agreed to sleep         with the enemy's leader, what would you do?",6
17439,KAREN,87," Kramer, are these questions really that important...?",6
17440,KRAMER,87," Yes, they're important! If you stumble, if you hesitate, you         can kiss the crown goodbye. Now if I've told you once, I've told you a         thousand times - poise counts! It's just as important as the others. Swimsuit!         Evening wear! Talent! POISE!",6
17441,GEORGE,87, Hey. ,6
17442,JERRY,87, Hey.,6
17443,GEORGE,87, How was the show?,6
17444,JERRY,87, Good. How was the roulette?,6
17445,GEORGE,87," I won fifty bucks! Boy, this is great. Too bad Elaine's not here.",6
17446,JERRY,87," Yeah, all she had to do was buy Mr. Pitt a pair of socks!",6
17447,PITT,87," It's good, but...",6
17448,ELAINE,87, But what??,6
17449,PITT,87, Ultimately I don't think they'll stay up. ,6
17450,ELAINE (pulling up Pitt's socks),87," No, no! They'll stay up!",6
17451,PITT,87," For a while, yes, but not in the long run.",6
17452,ELAINE,87, But that's why I got you the tighter ones! <Holds them up.>,6
17453,PITT,87," Oh, forget about those! <Takes the socks from Elaine and throws         them on the floor.> Why do you keep mentioning those?",6
17454,ELAINE,87, What do you want!?,6
17455,PITT,87," I want a decent sock that's comfortable, that will stay on my foot!!",6
17456,JERRY,87, What the hell is that?,6
17457,GEORGE,87," I don't know, it sounds like pigeons or something!",6
17458,JERRY (getting out of bed),87," Well, I can't sleep with that noise. ",6
17459,GEORGE,87, Me either. Is there anything you can do to shut them up?,6

17473,KRAMER,87," Yeah, birds. She's got these trained doves, she does this magic         act, that was her talent for the pageant. You know what I think, Jerry?         I think somebody murdered those doves. Somebody wanted her out of that         contest bad. Somebody who was just eaten up with jealousy. Somebody who         just couldn't stand to have the spotlight taken off of them! <Kramer         turns around and notices the empty icebucket on the edge of Jerry's balcony.>",6

When you go into a stationery store that theyÂ’re                 manufacturing millions of pens; constantly weÂ’re all buying them.         I         must have bought six thousand Bics in my life.

Where are all the         pens?         ThatÂ’s why itÂ’s so embarrassing if you donÂ’t have one.         You got a pen? Can I borrow         a pen?

Former baseball start Steve Genderson, has been taken to Police headquarters         for questioning the murder of Bobby Pinkus the owner of Royal Dry Cleaners         at 2759 Amsterdam Avenue. According to Pinkus' wife, Gendeson had been         involved in a dispute with the cleaner about a stain on a pair of gray         Sans-A-Belt slacks. We also have a report that earlier in the day a groundskeeper         at Vancourtland's Golf Course saw an irate Gendeson leaving the clubhouse         in a huff. Whether there is a possible connection between the two is something         we'll just have to wait.",6

17630,Elaine,88," What? What are you trying to say, George?",6

17671,Jerry,88," No. It isn't and the most distressing part of it is, not that         she went out with him but that HE stopped seeing her. Do you understand?         He, Newman; Newman stopped seeing her. Newman never stopped seeing anybody.         Newman will see whoever is willing to see him. Not so much why she did         see him as disturbing as that is. But why, did HE, Newman, stop seeing         her? ",6

17683,Elaine,88, I bought mine yesterday on 14th Street. ,6
17684,Jerry,88," Well, what did you do that for? You ordered it.",6
17685,Elaine,88, To please Mr. Pitt. ,6
17686,Jerry,88," Well, you better go down there and tell this guy. He's very excited.       ",6
17687,Elaine,88," Uh, great!",6
17688,Jerry,88, Hi Julie.,6
17689,Jerry,88, Hi. ,6

17691,Jerry,88," Hi, how are you, Elaine? I'm meeting George here. ",6
17692,Elaine,88," Oh, well then I better get going otherwise George will make me         buy him lunch to make up for that big salad he bought me yesterday. ",6
17693,Jerry,88, How do you know THAT?,6
17694,Newman,88, Who is it.,6
17695,Jerry,88, It's Jerry.,6
17696,Newman,88, You've come at a bad time now. Could you come back later?,6
17697,Jerry,88, Come on Newman. OPEN THE DOOR!,6
17698,Newman,88," Hellooo Jerry. What a rare treat. What brings you down to the         east wing?",6
17699,Jerry,88," Okay, pudgy, lets stop playing games. What happened with margaret?",6
17700,Newman,88, There's no need to get excited. Can't we discuss this like gentlemen?,6
17701,Jerry,88," No, we can't. My skin is crawling just being inside your little         rat's nest. Now, what happened?",6
17702,Newman,88," Do you really want to know what happened? I'll tell you what         Happened. She wasn't my type. ",6
17703,Jerry,88, Noit your type? ,6
17704,Newman,88, Not really. ,6
17705,Jerry,88," Well, how come? ",6
17706,Newman,88," Ah, she just didn't do it for me. ",6
17707,Jerry,88," What, what is wrong with her? ",6
17708,Newman,88," Well, h ha ha- if you're happy with her, that's all that matters.",6
17709,Jerry,88, You don't think she's attractive?,6
17710,Newman,88," No. I need a really pretty face. But, Hey, that's me. ",6
17711,Jerry,88," Okay, Newman, thanks a lot. ",6
17712,Newman,88, Care for some lemonade? ,6
17713,Jerry,88," No, thank you. ",6
17714,Newman,88," Drop bye anytime, jerry. Hah, ha ha ",6
17715,Kramer,88," Listen to this, ""If a player cleans his ball during the         play of a hole accept on the putting green he shall incur a penalty of         one stroke. "" That's a rule, Jerry.",6
17716,Jerry,88, But it's just a friendly game. Why do you have to be such a stickler?,6
17717,Kramer,88," Because that's the way I weas raised. You know when I was growing         up I had to be in bed every night by nine o'clock. And if I wasn't, well         I don't have to tell you what happened. ",6
17718,Jerry,88, What are you so worried about this for?,6
17719,Kramer,88, You know he talked about Pinkus on the course? ,6
17720,Jerry,88, He did?,6
17721,Kramer,88," Oh yeah, he said he brought a pair of pants into Pinkus' and         they came back stained with some kind of dry cleaning fluid. And Pinkus         denied responsibility. You see he was very upset with Pinkus. ",6
17722,Jerry,88, So it had nothing to do with you. ,6
17723,Kramer,88," Yeah, but maybe I pushed him over the edge. ",6
17724,Jerry,88," No, I don't think so. ",6
17725,Kramer,88," Poor Pinkus, poor little Pinkus.",6
17726,Jerry,88," Hey, let me ask you a question. You met margaret. Doo you think         Margaret's good looking? Um, she's a natural beauty. Oh, no makeup. I         like that. ",6
17727,Jerry,88," Yeah, and the curls. You like the curls?",6
17728,Kramer,88," Oh, I love curls.",6
17729,Jerry,88," Yeah,, me too. ",6
17730,Kramer,88," All right, I'll see you later.",6
17731,Jerry,88, Where you going?,6
17732,Kramer,88, Genderson's.,6
17733,Jerry,88, You're going to see Genderson?,6
17734,Kramer,88, It's weighing on my conscience. ,6
17735,George,88," You know, I think I could have played with dolls if their were         dolls in the house. It seems like fun to me. It doesn't seem like a gender         thing. I think I would like to play with dolls. What's so terrible?",6
17736,Julie,88," Ha. So, George, I was talking to Elaine before.",6
17737,George,88, A ha! We're just friends. ,6
17738,Julie,88," Yes, well anyway, she said something that was kind of intriguing.       ",6
17739,George,88," Oh, share.",6
17740,Julie,88," Well, when I came over to the table she mentioned something about         how she better hurry up and leave or you'd make her buy lunch to make         up for the one you bought yesterday.",6
17741,George,88," Ha, ha ha uh, I'm not following that. ",6
17742,Julie,88," Well, my question is, How could Elaine be under the impression         that you bought the big salad, when I was the one who handed it to her?       ",6
17743,George,88," Well, she probably just assumed. ",6
17744,Julie,88," Um, did she?",6
17745,George,88," . . .uh, . . . wait a second. Are you suggesting that I went         out of my way to tell Elaine that even though you handed her the big salad,         that it came from me? ",6
17746,Julie,88, That's what I'm suggesting. ,6
17747,George,88," . . . WELL IT WAS A BIG SALAD. AND WHAT I WOULD LIKE TO KNOW         IS, HOW DOES A PERSON WHO HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH THE BIG SALAD CLAIM RESPONSIBILITY         FOR THAT SALAD AND ACCEPT THE THANK YOU UNDER FALSE PRETENSES - AH - AH?",6
17748,Julie,88," George, all I did was hand someone a bag. ",6
17749,Elaine,88," It's just that my boss is very demanding and he needed the pencil         right away.",6
17750,Stationer,88," Well,, why did you tell me to order it if you knew you were         going to get one someplace else?",6
17751,Elaine,88," No, no no I didn't know. I, I'm sorry. ",6
17752,Stationer,88," I went all the way down to the warehouse. It took me three         hours. I had a big fight with the foreman. ",6
17753,Elaine,88, Really? A fight with the foreman? ,6
17754,Stationer,88, Yes. ,6
17755,Elaine,88," Well, again, I'm just awfully sorry. ",6
17756,Stationer,88," Yeah? Well, then how about going out with me tonight? ",6
17757,Elaine,88, Okay. ,6
17758,Margaret,88," I mean they found a tee and he played golf that day. Nobody         walks into a dry cleaner's with a tee. The circumstantial evidence is         overwhelming. ",6
17759,Jerry,88, You had how many dates with him? Three? ,6
17760,Margaret,88, Around three. I don't know. ,6
17761,Jerry,88, And . . ,6
17762,Margaret,88," I told you. He stopped calling me. I moved on. I'm not hung         up on him. What are you looking at? ",6
17763,Jerry,88, What? I'm not looking. Nothing. ,6
17764,Jerry,88, Why are you looking at my face? ,6
17765,Jerry,88, Where am I going to look? ,6
17766,Margaret,88, Kiss me.,6
17767,Jerry,88, . . . I can't. ,6
17768,Jerry,88, Newman!,6
17769,Jerry,88," All I could think of was when I was looking at her face was; Newman         found this unacceptable. ",6
17770,Elaine,88," Well, ,I'm going out with the stationery store guy. ",6
17771,Jerry,88, You're going out with the stationery store guy?,6
17772,Elaine,88, I felt so guilty about the pencil I couldn't say no. ,6
17773,Elaine,88," Well, well, well, I'm not treating you to lunch ANYMORE! You         had to tell Julie that I made a special point of telling you that I bought         you the big salad. Didn't ya'. ",6
17774,Elaine,88," Uh, uh.",6
17775,George,88," You know, if it was a regular salad I wouldn't have said anything.         But you had to have the BIG SALAD. ",6
17776,Jerry,88," Hello, what? You're kidding. I'm turning it on. Oh, my god. Get         out of here. [hangs up] Hey listen to this. They issued a warrant for         Genderson's arrest. He escaped and the police spotted him on the New Jersey         Turnpike. ",6
17777,TV,88," As you can see white Bronco. The police have cleared the highway         traffic in front of him but they are keeping their distance and don't         want the situation to escalate.

17778,Police,88, 9-1-1 What are you reporting,6
17779,Kramer,88," Yeah, this is Kramer. I got Genderson in the car. He wants to         see his fish. I'm taking him to see his fish. So tell the police to back         off. ",6
17780,Police,88," Okay, sir, and what's your name?",6
17781,Kramer,88, My name is Kramer. You know who I am dammit! ,6
17782,Genderson,88, I told you not to take the turnpike.,6
17783,Kramer,88, I thought we would blend in.,6
17784,Genderson,88, If we took the palisades this never have happened. ,6

It's a lovely tribute to our past president,         by the way. It's not bad enough Lincoln got shot in the head, we gotta         pull down our pants and sit on him, too. It's just incomprehensible that         you would buy a thing like this, you install it on your toilet seat, and         this says what about you?

17906,MR. PITT,92, I'm looking there!,6
17907,ELAINE,92," No, no, unfocus.",6
17908,MR. PITT,92, I am unfocused!,6
17909,ELAINE,92," (answering phone) Hello? Oh, yeah, okay fine. Uh, he'll be right         down. (to Pitt) Car's here to pick you up and take you to the meeting.",6
17910,MR. PITT,92, (still staring at picture) Meeting?,6
17911,ELAINE,92," Yeah, the Poland Creek merger?",6
17912,MR. PITT,92, Why don't you go for me?,6
17913,ELAINE,92, How can I go?,6
17914,MR. PITT,92," Oh, all they're gonna do is read the report.",6
17915,ELAINE,92," Mr. Pitt, I do not think that is such a good idea.",6
17916,MR. PITT,92," Oh, DAMN this thing!",6
17917,JERRY,92," (trying desperately to make conversation) So, Ceausescu. He must've         been some dictator.",6
17918,KATYA,92, Oh yes. He was not shy about dictating.,6
17919,JERRY,92," He, uh, he must've been dictating first thing in the morning.         ""I want a cup of coffee and a muffin!""",6
17920,KATYA,92, And you could not refuse.,6
17921,JERRY,92," No, you'd have to be crazy.",6
17922,KATYA,92, He was a very bad dictator.,6
17923,JERRY,92," Yes. Very bad. Very, very bad.",6
17924,GEORGE,92," No, no. No, no, no. It was not trash!",6
17925,JERRY,92, Was it in the trash?,6
17926,GEORGE,92, Yes.,6
17927,JERRY,92, Then it was trash.,6
17928,GEORGE,92," It wasn't down in, it was sort of on top.",6
17929,JERRY,92, But it was in the cylinder!,6
17930,GEORGE,92, Above the rim.,6
17931,JERRY,92," Adjacent to refuse, is refuse.",6
17932,GEORGE,92, It was on a magazine! And it still had the doily on.,6
17933,JERRY,92, Was it eaten?,6
17934,GEORGE,92, One little bite.,6
17935,JERRY,92," Well, that's garbage.",6
17936,GEORGE,92, But I know who took the bite. It was her aunt!,6
17937,JERRY,92," Well, you, my friend, have crossed the line that divides Man and         Bum. You are now a Bum.",6
17938,JERRY,92, Hey!,6
17939,KRAMER,92, Hey.,6
17940,JERRY,92, What's with you?,6
17941,KRAMER,92, I got a stone.,6
17942,JERRY,92, What stone?,6
17943,KRAMER,92, A kidney stone.,6
17944,JERRY,92," What is that, anyway?",6
17945,KRAMER,92," It's a, it's a stony mineral concretion, formed abnormally in         the kidney. And this jagged shard of calcium pushes its way through the         ureter into the bladder. It's forced out through the urine!",6
17946,JERRY,92," Oh, that's gotta hurt.",6
17947,ARONSON,92," Our shareholders have given basic approval for the merger, including         the stock swap.",6
17948,ELAINE,92," Ah. The ""stock swap"". Let's swap some stock. (giggles)",6
17949,BECK,92," And if you'll just give this to Mr. Pitt, and tell him we expect         to be in full-scale production by the spring.",6
17950,ELAINE,92," All right. (standing up) Hey, you guys--what's the name of the         new company gonna be?",6
17951,BECK,92, Moland Spring.,6
17952,ELAINE,92," (making a face) ""Moland""?",6
17953,ARONSON,92," Yes, we combined Morgan and Poland.",6
17954,ELAINE,92," Yeah, I know, but... ""Moland""? I wouldn't drink anything         called ""Moland"".",6
17955,ARONSON,92, But it was Mr. Pitt's idea.,6
17956,ELAINE,92," Oh! Well, ah, what's in a name? I mean, water's water. Right?",6
17957,ARONSON,92, (to Beck) We've got to do something about that name.,6
17958,GEORGE,92," (on phone, as Jerry gestures beside him) No, Lindsay, it was         not IN the garbage. It was above the garbage. Hovering. Like an angel.         Of course I know your aunt bit it. I kissed her goodbye. Listen, can I         tell you something else? In my family, we used to eat out of the garbage         all the time. (Jerry makes a face) It was no big thing. That's right.         Oh, okay. Buh-bye. (hangs up phone) I'm back in, she gave me a second         chance.",6
17959,JERRY,92, Good for you.,6
17960,GEORGE,92," Yes, good for me!",6
17961,JERRY,92," Y'know what you should do now? Get her some flowers, smooth it         out.",6
17962,GEORGE,92," Yes, flowers. I will get her flowers, I will go to the florist!",6
17963,KRAMER,92," (enters apartment, holding up videotape) Behold! The Games of         the '84 Olympiad! Katya's silver medal performance! (inserts tape into         VCR, sets up TV)",6
17964,JERRY,92," Kramer, are you still on this? I've seen gymnasts. I know what         they do. It's not going to make any difference.",6
17965,KRAMER,92," Jerry, what is your problem?",6
17966,JERRY,92," Kramer, y'know, guys like you, with no conscience, don't know         what it's like for guys like me. I'm in the unfortunate position of having         to consider people's feelings.",6
17967,KRAMER,92," All right, Jerry--are you familiar with the Kama Sutra?",6
17968,JERRY,92, No.,6
17969,KRAMER,92, Tantric yoga?,6
17970,JERRY,92, No.,6
17971,KRAMER,92," Jerry, you stand on the threshold to the magical world of sensual         delights that most men dare not dream of!",6
17972,JERRY,92," Boy, you can really talk some trash. (to George) I guess that's         better than eating it.",6
17973,KRAMER,92," All right, all right, why don't we just watch the tape? (starts         playback)",6
17974,JERRY,92, All right.,6
17975,GEORGE,92, Did you pass your stone yet?,6
17976,KRAMER,92, Not yet. But the suspense is killing me.,6
17977,JERRY,92," (pointing at TV) Hey, that's her!",6
17978,KRAMER,92," Oh yeah. Oh yeah, that's her. (feminine grunts and sighs can         be heard as they watch the tape) Look at the height, Jerry, the extension!         Now watch the tuck. Handstand, half-turn, giant into a straddle, back         into another handstand. Nice kip. Reverse hecht. Oh, nice leg extension,         good form! Now, here comes the big dismount. Look at the rotation, full         in, double back, and she sticks the landing! (gets up to leave as George         and Jerry continue to watch, mouths agape) Perhaps you'd like to keep         the tape? (silence) Well, I'll take that as a yes.",6
17979,JERRY,92," (smiling and excited) Well, here we are.",6
17980,KATYA,92, Yes. We are here.,6
17981,JERRY,92," How did you stay on that beam like that? (holds up hand) I mean,         it's only this wide!",6
17982,KATYA,92, I can balance myself in any position.,6
17983,KATYA,92," It is amazing after years of training how one can contort one's         body. Of course, it is only useful in gymnastics.",6
17984,JERRY,92, Oh boy...,6
17985,JERRY,92," I couldn't believe it. Uh, I mean I thought I was entering a ""magical         world"" of sensual delights, but it was just so ordinary. I mean,         there was nothing gymnastic about it.",6
17986,ELAINE,92," Well, what did you think she was gonna do?",6
17987,JERRY,92," Well, you know. I mean... I dunno.",6
17988,ELAINE,92," No, what?",6
17989,JERRY,92," Well, obviously I prefer not to mention any, you know...",6
17990,ELAINE,92," What did you think, she was going to take some of that chalk         and...",6
17991,JERRY,92," You see, now I really don't want to get into this, any kind of         specifics...",6
17992,ELAINE,92," Oh, come on. One thing? One thing! What?",6
17993,JERRY,92," Well... Frankly, I thought, you know, I was gonna kinda' be like         the apparatus.",6
17994,KRAMER,92, You mean like the uneven parallel bars?,6
17995,JERRY,92," See, again, I really don't feel that...",6
17996,ELAINE,92, The balance beam?,6
17997,JERRY,92, Could we stop?,6

17999,JERRY,92, All right. Let's just drop it.,6
18000,ELAINE,92," I dunno, at least three weeks.",6
18001,JERRY,92," (sarcastic) Oh, great.",6
18002,ELAINE,92," Jerry, that is such small potatoes. I think that I may have single-handedly         put the kibosh on the big water merger.",6
18003,JERRY,92, Between Poland and Morgan?,6
18004,ELAINE,92, Yeah. Started a big name controversy.,6
18005,JERRY,92, Kramer! The stone!,6
18006,JERRY,92," What happened, did you pass the stone?",6
18007,KRAMER,92," (Off-screen) No, I tried to do a reverse hecht off my couch and         I didn't make it.",6

You won't regret it. Okay, I'll see         you later. Buh-bye. (hangs up)",6

18023,KRAMER,92," All right, where you going?",6
18024,JERRY,92," We're going to the circus. One of her old Olympic teammates is         an acrobat. I don't even feel like going out.",6
18025,KRAMER,92," Well, Jerry, it's your obligation. C'mon.",6

18077,MR. PITT,92," I have been accused of wrong-doing. But these false accusations         will not deter us. We WILL annex Poland by the Spring, at any cost! AND...         our stock will rise HIGH! (raises hand)",6

18119,ELAINE,96, Uh uh,6
18120,JERRY,96," I was the last one on the end. George was next to me. And Mr.         Bevilacqua, the gym . . . ",6

18124,JERRY,96," He was down at the other end. So he yells out, ""Ready, On         your mark, Get set, "" and I was so keyed up I just took off. By the         time he said go I was ten yards ahead of everybody.",6
18125,ELAINE,96, No.,6

18130,ELAINE,96, Well what happened when you raced him again?,6
18131,JERRY,96," I never did. In four years of high school I would never race anyone         again. Not even to the end of the block to catch a bus. And so the legend         grew. Everyone wanted me to race. They begged me. The track coach called         my parents. Pleading. Telling them it was a sin to waste my god given         talent. But I answered him in the same way I answered everyone. I chose         not to run. ",6
18132,ELAINE,96, So now Duncan is back? ,6

20773,Kim,110," That voice? It sounds so familiar. It reminds me of when I was ayoung         girl in Korea and I met an American businessman. He was a very unusual         man. Quick temperd with a strange halting way of speaking. We fell in         love but when I brought him home to meet my father? He refused to take         his shoes off.

21902,HOLLY,114, That is so funny. Did you just make that up?,7
21903,JERRY,114," I wish I could take credit for it. It's actually the line my butcher         uses when we're chewing the fat. How about that beautiful desk over there?         (hides meat in napkin in jacket)",7
21904,HOLLY,114, That was in Grandma's study.,7

27449,Jerry,138," I'm fine. (George enters, Kramer exits) How was the party?",8
27450,George,138, Food was good.,8
27451,Jerry,138, So I didn't miss anything?,8
27452,George,138," Well, actually you did miss one nugget of entertainment.               (Pause) Have you",8
27453,Jerry,138, Elaine danced?,8
27454,George,138, It was more like a full bodied dry heave set to music.,8
27455,Jerry,138, Did she do the little kicks and the thumbs?,8
27456,George,138," What, you mean you know about this?",8
27457,Jerry,138," For some time. It was about five years ago. I never knew               what to say to her",8
27458,George,138," Well, sometimes you can't help these people 'til they hit               rock bottom.",8
27459,Jerry,138, And by then you've lost interest.,8
27460,George,138," Hey, you gotta take a ride with me later. I borrowed my               father's car. '68",8
27461,Jerry,138, What made him get that thing?,8
27462,George,138," During that period when my folks were separated he went               a little crazy.",8
27463,Jerry,138, Not a very long trip. (Enter Kramer),8
27464,Kramer,138, Brody's in.,8
27465,Jerry,138, I don't even have the extra ticket yet.,8
27466,Kramer,138," Well, you better get on the horn.",8
27467,Elaine,138," I'm tellin' you Jerry I'm gettin' a vibe. If I didn't know               better, I'd say",8
27468,Jerry,138, How could that be?,8
27469,Elaine,138," Jerry, it's like the feeling is palpable. You think it               could have something",8
27470,Jerry,138," No, George was there, he said he had a great time.",8
27471,Elaine,138," Oh, it's George. I bet you this is somehow George related.",8
27472,Jerry,138," Oh, what are you talkin' about?",8
27473,Elaine,138," He's like a virus. He attaches himself to a healthy host               company, and the",8
27474,Jerry,138, Now you're talkin' crazy!,8
27475,Elaine,138," All right, Jerry, if that's not what it is, you tell me.               What is it?",8

27477,Anna,138, You have a minute to approve some copy?,8

27479,Anna,138, It was a real... kick.,8
27480,Elaine,138," Hey, did you happen to speak to my friend George?",8
27481,Anna,138, As a matter of fact I did.,8
27482,Elaine,138," Ah hah. Well, listen. You would be wise to keep your distance               from him.",8
27483,Anna,138, Why? He seems harmless.,8
27484,Elaine,138, Oh he's not. He's very harmful.,8
27485,Anna,138, Really?,8
27486,Elaine,138," Oh trust me. He's a bad seed. He's a horrible seed. He's               one of the worst",8
27487,Anna,138, And you two are friends?,8
27488,Elaine,138," Yeah, we're good friends.",8
27489,George,138, So this Anna called me from out of the blue.,8
27490,Jerry,138, Really? I thought you were rebuffed.,8
27491,George,138, With extreme prejudice.,8
27492,Jerry,138, Maybe Elaine put in a good word for you.,8
27493,George,138," No, no. That's just the thing. Anna told me that Elaine               said I was one of",8
27494,Jerry,138," Interesting. She doesn't care for you, then a stern warning,               suddenly a",8
27495,George,138, I'm the bad boy. I've never been the bad boy.,8
27496,Jerry,138," You've been the bad employee, the bad son, the bad friend...",8
27497,George,138," Yes, yes...",8
27498,Jerry,138," The bad fiancÂ‚, the bad dinner guest, the bad credit               risk...",8
27499,George,138," Okay, the point is made.",8
27500,Jerry,138," The bad date, the bad sport, the bad citizen... (looks at               table as George",8

27504,Jerry,138, That's quite a feed bag you're workin' on there.,8
27505,Brody,138, It's for all of us. Is there a problem?,8
27506,Kramer,138," Brody, c'mon. He's just kidding. He's a joke maker. Tell               him, Jerry.",8
27507,Jerry,138, I'm a joke maker.,8

27510,Kramer,138," Relax, he does that all the time.",8
27511,Jerry,138, Does what?,8
27512,Kramer,138," He's making a copy of the movie for sale on the street,               huh?",8
27513,Jerry,138, May I see you outside for a moment please?,8
27514,Kramer,138, But I want to--,8

27517,Worker,138," Uh, she just went to meet your friend George.",8
27518,Elaine,138, To meet George? I knew it. Where did they go?,8
27519,Worker,138," The park, why?",8
27520,Elaine,138," Don't you see? George is in the bloodstream! You stay away               from him, too!",8
27521,Jerry,138, What do you mean he's bootlegging the movie?,8

27524,Kramer,138, It's a business.,8
27525,Jerry,138, Where did you meet this guy?,8
27526,Kramer,138," He's a friend of a friend. You know Corky Ramarez up on               94th Street? One day he and I are playing Pinochle--",8

27530,Anna,138, You know I'm not supposed to be talking to you.,8
27531,George,138," No one's putting a gun to your head. Do I, uh, scare you?",8

27551,Kramer,138," Jerry, if the man is in pain...",8
27552,Jerry,138," Yeah well, maybe if he didn't lick his fingers before he               reached in the bag we would've eaten some. Serves him right.",8
27553,Brody,138, (pulls out a gun) What are you some kind of tough guy?,8

27561,Jerry,138," Kramer, you make me get a ticket for this friend of yours               and then the guy forces me to bootleg the movie at gun point!",8
27562,Kramer,138," He's quite a character, isn't he?",8
27563,Jerry,138," You know, he came by here at 3 o'clock in the morning to               pick up the tape. I was scared out of my mind!",8

27569,Jerry,138, What if I didn't do it right?,8
27570,Kramer,138, It's your first time. He'll understand.,8

27577,Jerry,138," Well, I did the best I could.",8
27578,Brody,138," I got another project for you. It's a movie called Cry Cry               Again. I was gonna give it to one of my other guys, but it's an               arty movie and quite frankly, they don't have the sensibility.",8
27579,Brody,138, May I use your phone?,8
27580,Kramer,138, Uh yeah. It's under the couch.,8

27591,Anna,138, This? It's mine.,8
27592,Elaine,138," Oh really? 'Cause it looks a little big for you. It looks               like something a short, stocky, slow-witted, bald man might wear.",8
27593,Anna,138, He's not stocky.,8
27594,Elaine,138, Who did that? Who did that?!?,8

27599,Kramer,138, It's about a guy buying a loaf of bread.,8
27600,Jerry,138," No, bread is his soul. He's trying to buy back a loaf of               his soul.",8
27601,Kramer,138, Wha? Where?,8
27602,Jerry,138," Kramer there is no way you're giving this tape to Brody               and telling him I shot it.",8
27603,Kramer,138," Nah, he's not going to know the difference.",8
27604,Jerry,138," I don't care about Brody. I was up on 96th Street today,               there was a kid couldn't have been more than ten years old. He was               asking a street vendor if he had any other bootlegs as good as Death               Blow. That's who I care about. The little kid who needs bootlegs,               because his parent or guardian won't let him see the excessive violence               and strong sexual content you and I take for granted.",8

28450,Jerry,143, Why?,8
28451,Kramer,143," Well somebody had to. You know, just because a person's a smoker, that doesn't mean he's not a human being.",8
28452,Jerry,143, It doesn't?,8
28453,Kramer,143," Jerry, these people aren't just going to let themselves be flicked into the ashbin of society.",8

28498,Elaine,143, Oh yes you are. We'll just stop having sex.,8
28499,George,143," Guys, hitting is not about muscle. It's simple               physics. Calculate the velocity, v, in relation to the trajectory,               t, in which g, gravity, of course remains a constant. (Hits a home               run) It's not complicated.",8

28510,Jerry,143," And give you the chance to see some real disappointed               kids. (Waitress comes to table)",8

28523,Elaine,143, What? What are you talking about?,8
28524,Jerry,143," To a woman, sex is like the garbage man. You               just take for granted the fact that any time you put some trash               out on the street, a guy in a jumpsuit's gonna come along and pick               it up. But now, it's like a garbage strike. The bags are piling               up in your head. The sidewalk is blocked. Nothing's getting through.               You're stupid.",8
28525,Elaine,143, I don't understand.,8

28532,Kramer,143," My face is all craggly, it's crinkly.",8
28533,Jerry,143," It's from all that smoke. You've experienced               a lifetime of smoking in 72 hours. What did you expect?",8
28534,Kramer,143," Emphysema, birth defects, cancer. But not               this. Jerry, my face is my livelihood, my allure... my twinkle!   Everything I have I owe to               this face.",8

28542,Jerry,143, So what did you do?,8
28543,George,143, I told her I would have to think about it.,8
28544,Jerry,143," But ultimately, you're gonna choose in favor               of sex, right?",8
28545,George,143," I don't know. Perhaps I can better serve the               world this way.",8
28546,Jerry,143," You mean, not subjecting yourself to your sexual               advances.",8
28547,George,143, Simple joke from a simple man. ,8
28548,Jerry,143, So you're never gonna have sex again?,8
28549,George,143," Well, Jerry. There was a pretty good chance               I was never gonna have sex again anyway.",8
28550,Jerry,143," So you ready for the assembly tomorrow? You               know what you're gonna say about the Yankees?",8

28569,Elaine,143, Not good. I'm a moron.,8

28571,Elaine,143," Well, that kinda brings us to why I'm here.               You got eleven minutes?",8
28572,Jerry,143, What for? Oh come on.,8
28573,Elaine,143," I just wanna clear my head. It has nothing               to do with you.",8
28574,Jerry,143, I think it has something to do with me.,8

28588,Jackie,143," Rugged? The man's a goblin. He's only been               exposed to smoke for four days. By the time this case gets to trial,               he'll be nothing more than a shrunken head.",8

28595,Ben,143," I'm sorry, Elaine. I always knew that after I               became a doctor, I would dump whoever I was with and find someone               better. That's the dream of becoming a doctor.",8
28596,Elaine,143," Look it, are we going to have sex, or not?",8

29060,HELEN,145," Enough with the comedy! You're very clever, you should look into         advertising.",8
29061,MORTY,145, He never even called Ed Roydlick. They were looking for someone!,8
29062,JERRY,145, I'm not calling Ed Roydlick. I'm doing fine! <George enters.>,8
29063,HELEN,145, That's it. I'm going to send you fifty dollars.,8
29064,JERRY,145, You are NOT sending me fifty dollars!,8
29065,HELEN,145," We're sending you fifty dollars! Morty, get me an envelope.",8
29066,JERRY (angrily),145," I swear to God, if you send me fifty dollars, you are         gonna be so sorry!",8
29067,MORTY,145, I don't see envelopes!,8
29068,HELEN,145," They're right in front of you! Oh, for heaven's sakes... <She         puts the phone down on the couch and goes to help Morty.>",8

29071,JERRY,145, Good.,8
29072,GEORGE,145, So? Movie tonight?,8
29073,JERRY,145, I thought you were going out with Celia.,8
29074,GEORGE,145," I did. I'm back. I love this relationship, I feel so liberated!",8
29075,JERRY,145, Having her in jail.,8
29076,GEORGE,145," The only thing that bothers me is that I'm just coming up with         this now.",8
29077,JERRY,145," Yeah, dating a convicted felon. I don't know how you missed it.",8
29078,ELAINE,145," Here. <Shows Kurt's driver's licence to Jerry.> Take a         look at that.",8
29079,JERRY,145, Huh. Kurt's an organ donor.,8
29080,ELAINE,145," No! He's not bald. Look! He's got a full head of hair. <George         overhears and stands up, concerned.>",8
29081,JERRY,145, So he just shaves his head for no reason?,8
29082,GEORGE,145, That's like using a wheelchair for the fun of it!,8
29083,ELAINE,145," And he's growing it in just for me. (Happily) It's mine. It's         all mine.",8
29084,JERRY,145, It's just hair.,8
29085,ELAINE,145, It's not just hair! Look! <Shows Kurt's licence to Jerry again.>,8
29086,JERRY,145, It's brown.,8
29087,ELAINE,145, It's chestnut with auburn highlights!,8
29088,JERRY,145, So?,8
29089,ELAINE,145," You're not around women. You don't know how important a man's         hair is. <They both look at George, who is reading a newspaper and         struggling to keep his composure.> I'm sorry, George, but it's true.",8
29090,GEORGE (close to tears),145, I knew it.,8
29091,MARCELINO,145," Hey, Kramer. Nice rooster. What's his name?",8
29092,KRAMER,145," Well, this is Little Jerry Seinfeld.",8
29093,MARCELINO,145, Little Jerry Seinfeld. Does he bounce checks? (laughs),8
29094,KRAMER,145," Look, can't you take Jerry's check down?",8
29095,MARCELINO,145," Sorry Kramer, can't help you.",8
29096,MARCELINO (impressed),145, I like the way he handles himself.,8

29098,KURT,145, What?,8
29099,ELAINE,145," Well, it doesn't seem to be coming in so good over here. Or here.",8
29100,KURT,145, What do you mean? <Goes into the bedroom to look in the mirror.>,8
29101,ELAINE,145," Well, I don't know...how long have you been shaving your head         for?",8
29102,KURT (from the bedroom),145, About three years.,8
29103,ELAINE,145, Huh.,8
29104,KURT,145, Oh my God! <Steps into the doorway> I'm going bald! ,8
29105,CELIA,145, George! I'm so glad to see you!,8
29106,GEORGE,145," Hey, I brought you some cigarettes. You buy yourself something         nice.",8
29107,CELIA,145, Good news - I'm up for parole.,8
29108,GEORGE,145, Parole! <Feigning joy> That's dynamite!,8
29109,JERRY,145, So Marcelino's going to take down the check?,8
29110,KRAMER,145," Well, it comes down if Little Jerry Seinfeld wins the cockfight.",8
29111,JERRY,145, Great! <realizing> What?,8
29112,KRAMER,145," Well, Marcelino, he has cockfights in the back of his store.",8
29113,JERRY,145, Ah ha...,8
29114,KRAMER,145," So, he says if Little Jerry Seinfeld wins, the check comes down.",8
29115,JERRY,145," Kramer, cockfighting is illegal.",8
29116,KRAMER,145, Only in The United States.,8
29117,JERRY,145, It's inhumane!,8
29118,KRAMER,145," No, Jerry, it's not what you think it is.",8
29119,JERRY,145, It's two roosters peckin' at each other!,8
29120,KRAMER,145, What?,8
29121,JERRY,145, Yeah!,8
29122,KRAMER,145," Well, I thought they wore gloves and helmets, you know, like         ""American Gladiators.""",8
29123,JERRY,145," No Kramer, Little Jerry could get hurt.",8
29124,KRAMER,145," Well, I left him with Marcelino!",8
29125,KRAMER,145, My Little Jerry! <Runs out.>,8
29126,JERRY,145," Hey, did you get Little Jerry, is he O.K.?",8
29127,KRAMER,145," Well, he's more than O.K., he won!",8
29128,JERRY,145, You let him fight?,8
29129,KRAMER,145," I couldn't get there in time to stop it, but you should have         seen Little Jerry, Jerry! Flappin' his wings and struttin' his stuff!         He was peckin' and weavin' and bobbin' and talkin' trash! He didn't even         have to touch him! The other rooster ran out of the ring. The whole fight         lasted two seconds.",8
29130,JERRY,145, How long do they usually last?,8
29131,KRAMER,145," Five seconds. And Marcelino says he's taking your check down         today.",8
29132,JERRY,145, Great!,8
29133,KRAMER,145, Hey.,8
29134,GEORGE,145, Celia's up for parole.,8
29135,KRAMER,145," Hey, Little Jerry won his cockfight.",8
29136,GEORGE,145, What?,8
29137,KRAMER,145, Who?,8
29138,JERRY,145, I'm too tired.,8
29139,KRAMER (to Jerry),145," O.K., listen, I want you to come by later, alright?         'Cause we're having a victory party for Little Jerry.",8
29140,JERRY,145, Alright. <Kramer leaves.>,8
29141,GEORGE (sadly),145," It's over, Jerry. She's gettin' out.",8
29142,JERRY,145," Ah, I'm so sorry.",8
29143,GEORGE,145," She's been locked up for two years. She's gonna want to make         up for lost time. Dinners. Movies. <Rubs his forehead.> Talking...",8
29144,JERRY,145," In other words, a normal relationship.",8
29145,GEORGE,145," And that's no good. I've tried it straight, Jerry. We've all         seen the results. For me, sick is the only way to go.",8
29146,JERRY,145," Well, she'll still be an ex-con.",8
29147,GEORGE,145, It's not the same. ,8
29148,JERRY,145," Hey, if you two are meant to be together...I'm sure the cops'll         pick her up on something.",8
29149,ELAINE,145, Kurt? What's with the sweats? Aren't we going out?,8
29150,KURT,145, I don't care.,8
29151,ELAINE,145," You, uh...got a big stain on your shirt.",8
29152,KURT,145, Yeah...meatball...fell out of my sandwich.,8
29153,ELAINE,145, You already ate?,8
29154,KURT,145, It's from yesterday.,8
29155,MARCELINO,145, Jerry! You missed a hell of a cockfight last night.,8
29156,JERRY,145, Then what is my check still doing up? We had a deal!,8
29157,MARCELINO,145, Now we have a new deal.,8
29158,JERRY,145, New deal?,8
29159,MARCELINO,145," When Little Jerry Seinfeld is mine, the check will be yours.",8
29160,JERRY,145, This is outrageous! (To Marcelino) Pack of Juicy Fruit.,8
29161,MARCELINO (puts the gum on the counter),145, 85 cents.,8
29162,JERRY,145, 85 cents? That is outrageous!,8
29163,JERRY,145," Kramer, Marcelino wants us to sell him Little Jerry Seinfeld.       ",8
29164,KRAMER,145," Well, that's out of the question.",8
29165,JERRY,145," But Kramer, cockfighting is an illegal and immoral activity.",8
29166,KRAMER,145," Yeah, if you got a loser. But Little Jerry was born to cockfight!",8
29167,JERRY,145," No, no more cockfighting. Let's just sell him to Marcelino the         cockfighter and be done with it!",8
29168,KRAMER,145," You know, I think you're jealous.",8
29169,JERRY,145, Of what?,8
29170,KRAMER (points at Jerry like he's found him out),145," Yah, yah! You see in         Little Jerry Seinfeld the unlimited future you once had. Now, just because         Jerry Seinfeld is a has-been, don't make Little Jerry Seinfeld a never-was!       ",8
29171,JERRY,145," Kramer, give me that rooster!",8
29172,KRAMER,145," Never! You hate him because he's doing more with your name than         you ever will! Yah-yah! <Kramer leaves.>",8
29173,BETSY,145," George, Celia has listed you as a character reference. Whatever         you can tell us would certainly be helpful in her getting paroled. ",8
29174,GEORGE,145," Well, anything I can do to help, um...she's a wonderful girl.         Very smart. Very...crafty. ",8
29175,BETSY,145, Does she have any plans after she's released?,8
29176,GEORGE,145," Plans. Schemes. She keeps talking about getting back together         with her old friends - ""the gang,"" as she likes to call them,         you know. Yeah, they're hatching something, you can count on that. ",8
29177,MARCELINO,145, Jerry! Tonight's fight-night. Where's my rooster?,8
29178,JERRY,145, Kramer won't sell.,8
29179,MARCELINO,145," Well, tell you what I'm gonna do. I'm gonna take down your         check anyway.",8
29180,JERRY,145," Well, thank you, Marcelino.",8
29181,MARCELINO,145," Well, perhaps someday you will do me a favor. And that day         is today. Little Jerry Seinfeld must go down in the third round of tomorrow's         main event.",8
29182,JERRY,145, You want Little Jerry to take a dive?,8
29183,MARCELINO,145," Shhh, not so loud.",8
29184,JERRY,145," First of all, I don't think you can make a rooster take a dive.",8
29185,MARCELINO,145," Can, too!",8
29186,JERRY,145," Second of all, Jerry Seinfeld - big or little - doesn't go down         for anyone, anywhere, at anytime! Now I'd appreciate it if you please         leave.",8
29187,MARCELINO (leaving),145," Big Jerry is making a big mistake, Jerry.",8
29188,JERRY,145," We'll see about that. <Runs to the window and shouts up to         Kramer, who's on the roof.> Kramer, I'm comin' up! We got a cockfight         to win!",8
29189,KRAMER,145, O.K.!,8
29190,KURT,145, Elaine said you would be the best person I could talk to.,8
29191,GEORGE (examining Kurt's head with a lamp),145," Yep. Classic horseshoe pattern.         I've seen a lot of this. ",8
29192,KURT,145," Oh, God.",8
29193,GEORGE,145," No, no, Kurt - wrong attitude. You should be happy now. ",8
29194,KURT,145, Happy? Why should I be happy?,8
29195,GEORGE,145," You've still got pretty good coverage. Once the enemy advances         beyond this perimeter - <points at Kurt's head with a pen> - then         you won't be Kurt anymore.",8
29196,KURT,145, Who will I be?,8
29197,KURT,145, How long do I have?,8
29198,GEORGE (solemnly),145, 14 months. Maybe 10.,8
29199,KURT,145, Is there anything I can do?,8
29200,GEORGE,145," Yes. Live, dammit. Live! Every precious moment as if this was         the last year of your life. Because in many ways...it is. <There's         a knock at the door.> Excuse me.",8
29201,GEORGE,145, Celia? What are you doing here?,8
29202,CELIA,145," Well, I didn't get my parole, so I busted out. ",8
29203,GEORGE (nervously),145, And you just decided to pop in...!,8
29204,ELAINE,145, Kurt!,8
29205,KURT,145," Elaine...<holds out a wedding ring> Will you marry me? <Elaine         is shocked.>",8
29206,KRAMER,145," Oh, yeah. He's lookin' good, huh Jerry?",8
29207,JERRY,145," Yeah. Alright, I think that's enough for today. <Kramer picks         up Little Jerry and takes him to the sink.> Little Jerry is lean, mean,         peckin' machine! <Kramer starts filling a pot with water.> What         are you doing with that?",8
29208,KRAMER,145," I'm just gonna heat this up. Make a little hot-tub for Little         Jerry.",8
29209,JERRY,145," Hey, Kramer...?",8
29210,JERRY,145," Be careful. <George enters.> Hey, guess what! Little Jerry         ran from here to Newman's in under thirty seconds!",8
29211,GEORGE,145, Is that good?,8
29212,JERRY,145, I don't know. Where have you been?,8
29213,GEORGE,145," Celia broke out of prison. I'm sitting in my home, she shows         up at the door!",8
29214,JERRY,145, Oh my God! The break-out/pop-in!,8
29215,GEORGE,145," Yeah. Hey Jerry, listen to this. I discovered something even         better than conjugal visit sex. Fugitive sex! Now, it's like everytime         -",8
29216,JERRY (interrupts),145," George, this is a little too much for me - escaped         convicts, fugitive sex...I got a cockfight to focus on. <Jerry leaves.>",8
29217,ELAINE,145," Hey Kurt, slow down! I just can't marry you, whim-bam-boom! I         mean, I need some ""fiance-time,"" I need some ""make-my-girlfriends-jealous""         time...",8
29218,KURT,145," Plus, you want to get to know me.",8
29219,ELAINE,145," Yeah, yeah, that too.",8
29220,KURT,145," Well, how much time?",8
29221,ELAINE,145, I don't know...a year?,8
29222,KURT,145," No, no, no...it has to be now.",8
29223,ELAINE,145, Could I see the ring again?,8
29224,JERRY (to Elaine),145," So, you're actually considering it?",8
29225,ELAINE,145," Well, it'll be a couple of years before he's completely bald.         Those'll be good times.",8
29226,JERRY,145," Marriage is a big step, Elaine. Your life'll totally change.",8
29227,ELAINE,145," Jerry, it's three-thirty in the morning. I'm at a cockfight.         What am I clinging to? <George comes over.>",8
29228,GEORGE,145," Hey, sorry I'm late. ",8
29229,JERRY,145, Where's Celia?,8
29230,GEORGE,145," She didn't want to come, she's not really into sports. <Kramer         comes over with Little Jerry.>",8
29231,JERRY,145," Hey, how's he doin'?",8
29232,KRAMER,145," He's got a big sweat going. <Takes an envelope out of his         pocket.> Oh, this came for you express-mail. It's from your parents.",8
29233,JERRY (opens the envelope),145, Fifty dollars. I don't believe this!,8
29234,KRAMER,145," There's Marcelino. <Marcelino enters the ring holding a huge         white rooster.>",8
29235,JERRY,145, Look at the size of his bird!,8
29236,KRAMER,145, That looks like a dog with a glove on his head.,8
29237,KURT,145," Hi, is George back from the cockfight yet? You know, I gotta thank         him, he changed my life.",8
29238,CELIA,145," No, it must have been a good fight, he's not back yet.",8
29239,KURT,145," Ah, damn. ",8
29240,DETECTIVE #1 (to Kurt),145," Sorry to bother you, Mr. Costanza. Well, well,         well. Look who's here.",8
29241,CELIA,145," Aw, man!",8
29242,DETECTIVE #2 (to Kurt),145," Mr. Costanza, you're under arrest for aiding         and abetting a known fugitive.",8
29243,KURT (laughs),145, I'm not George Costanza.,8
29244,DETECTIVE #2,145," Save it. We know you're bald. We know it's you. Let's go!         <They escort Kurt and Celia out.>",8
29245,ELAINE (to a woman at the fight),145," Muchos gracias. <Turns back to Jerry         and Kramer.> O.K., I got the whole scoop. Marcelino flew the bird in         from Ecuador. He's 68 and 0!",8
29246,JERRY,145, He's a ringer!,8
29247,GEORGE,145," Where's the tamale guy? <The bell rings, and the cockfight         begins.>",8
29248,KRAMER,145," Little Jerry's going to get his clock cleaned. I gotta get him         outta there. ",8
29249,KRAMER (lunging for Little Jerry),145, Little Jerry!,8
29250,JERRY,145, Kramer!,8
29251,ELAINE,145, Stop the fight!,8
29252,GEORGE (holds up one finger),145, Tamale!,8
29253,ELAINE,145, Why did you get into a fist fight with the cop? You were innocent!,8
29254,KURT,145," They thought I was George. I'm not that bald. I have too little         time left to take that kind of crap, so I slugged him.",8
29255,ELAINE,145," So, how long are you gonna be in here for?",8
29256,KURT,145," Well, my lawyer says 14 months, but with good behavior, maybe...10?",8
29257,ELAINE,145," So, 10 to 14 months.",8

29922,Kramer,153, I live for Merlot.,8
29923,Waiter,153, We're out of Merlot.,8
29924,Agent,153," So you, uh, know Betha and Arnie pretty well?",8
29925,Elaine,153," Oh, yeah, yeah.",8
29926,Agent,153, Do you socialize with them often?,8
29927,Elaine,153," Yeah, we got out to dinner a lot. Usually Chinese, well               sometimes Thai. And we go to the movies, Arnie's a real film buff.",8
29928,Agent,153, Oh.,8
29929,Elaine,153," Actually, I remember this one time, um, this is funny.               Um, we went to see the movie Striptease. I don't know if you've               seen... doesn't matter. Anyway, I was whispering something to Beth,               and Arnie leens over to me, and he goes, ""Would you SHUT UP?!""               I mean, he barely even knew me. Where did he get ah-- But they're               nice people. (Elaine tries to smile realizing her mistake)",8
29930,George,153," Oh, you're in here.",8
29931,Jerry,153, What're you doing here?,8
29932,George,153, I knew you had an appointment.,8
29933,Jerry,153, Well this is very awkward.,8
29934,George,153," I'll leave when the guy comes in. I gotta tell you, I am               loving this yada yada thing. You know, I can cross over my whole               life story. (Picks up dental tool)",8
29935,Jerry,153," Hey, you don't play with that. That's going in my mouth.",8
29936,George,153," Hey, what this thing? Whew!",8
29937,Jerry,153," All right, that's enough. Now get going. Get outta here.               (Tim and his staff enter)",8
29938,George,153," Hey, Tim. Quick question. Is it normal for your teeth to               make noises, like a hissing or a chirping?",8
29939,Jerry,153, George...,8
29940,Tim,153, Um...,8
29941,George,153," Fine, I'll make an appointment. (He leaves)",8
29942,Tim,153," All right, it is cavity time. Ah, here we go. Which reminds               me, did you here the one about the rabbi and the farmer's daughter?               Huh?",8
29943,Jerry,153, Hey.,8
29944,Tim,153, Those aren't mahtzah balls.,8
29945,Jerry,153," Tim, do you think you should be making jokes like that?",8
29946,Tim,153," Why not? I'm Jewish, remember?",8
29947,Jerry,153," I know, but...",8
29948,Tim,153," Jerry, it's our sense of humor that sustained us as a people               for 3000 years.",8
29949,Jerry,153,5000,8
29950,Tim,153," 5000, even better. Okay, Chrissie. Give me a schtickle of               flouride.",8
29951,Jerry,153, And then he asked the assistant for a schtickle of flouride.,8
29952,Elaine,153, Why are you so concerned about this?,8
29953,Jerry,153," I'll tell you why. Because I believe Whatley converted to               Judaism just for the jokes. (Phone rings)",8
29954,Phone,153," Would you be interested in a subscription to the New York               Times?",8
29955,Jerry,153, Yes. (Slams down phone. Kramer and Mickey enter),8
29956,Kramer,153, I don't believe that.,8
29957,Mickey,153," If you had gotten into the backseat of the car we could've               figured this whole thing out.",8
29958,Kramer,153, Why were you holding the door open for?,8
29959,Mickey,153, Not for you! Who holds a door open for a man?,8
29960,Kramer,153," Well, I thought it was a nice gesture. But I guess I was               wrong!",8
29961,Mickey,153, Let's just put they're names in a hat.,8
29962,Kramer,153," I don't even know their names! Look, why don't you just               take the one that was on the left?",8
29963,Mickey,153, I'm not sure she was my type.,8
29964,Kramer,153," Oh, everybody's your type.",8
29965,Mickey,153, What the hell does that mean?,8
29966,Kramer,153, You've been married three times.,8
29967,Mickey,153," That's it, it's go time! (Charges toward Kramer, only to               be held back by Jerry and Elaine)",8
29968,Jerry,153," All right, take it easy.",8
29969,Elaine,153," Hey, hey, hey!",8
29970,Kramer,153," Come on, let him go. You want throw? Let's throw!",8
29971,Elaine,153," Hey! Hold on a second. All right, look, I got an idea.               Why don't you just show up early for your next date, sit across               from each other, and see who the girls sit next to.",8
29972,Mickey,153, That's not bad.,8
29973,Kramer,153," All right, so we let the girls decide.",8
29974,Mickey,153," Yeah, why should we knock ourselves out?",8
29975,Kramer,153," Yeah, I wanna wear that shirt next time.",8
29976,Mickey,153," No, no one wears the shirt next time.",8
29977,Kramer,153," That's right, 'cause they already saw it.",8
29978,Mickey,153, We'll look like idiots. (They exit),8
29979,George,153," Well, we were engaged to be married, uh, we bought the               wedding invitations, and, uh, yada yada yada, I'm still single.",8
29980,Marcy,153, So what's she doing now?,8
29981,George,153, Yada.,8
29982,Marcy,153," Speaking of ex's, my old boyfriend came over late last night,               and, yada yada yada, anyway. I'm really tired today.",8
29983,Elaine,153," Beth, Arnie, hi. What's up?",8
29984,Arnie,153, Well our adoption application was denied.,8
29985,Elaine,153, Really.,8
29986,Beth,153," The adoption agent seems to feel that Arnie has a violent               temper.",8
29987,Elaine,153, Oh.,8
29988,Beth,153," So we're just asking our friends what they may have said               to the adoption agent.",8
29989,Elaine,153," Uh, you know, I just told them what kind people you are               and, uh, yada yada yada, that is it.",8
29990,Jerry,153, How you doing?,8
29991,Father,153, I have a discomfort in my molar. (Enter Tim),8
29992,Tim,153," Well, the Curtis, why don't you come in? (To Jerry) Father               Curtis, good guy. Oh, which reminds me, did you hear the one about               the Pope and Raquel Welch on the lifeboat, huh? I'll tell you later.               (Exits)",8
29993,Jerry,153," Whatley. (Like ""Newman"")",8
29994,Kramer,153, What are they doing here?,8
29995,Mickey,153, I told you we should've gotten here a half hour early.,8
29996,Kramer,153," All right, all right. Now what're we gonna do?",8
29997,Mickey,153," All right, don't panic. Let's just decide now. Which one               do you want?",8
29998,Kramer,153," All right, I'll take Julie.",8
29999,Mickey,153, I knew you wanted her. That's who I wanted.,8
30000,Kramer,153," All right, I'll take Karen.",8
30001,Mickey,153," No, no, you think I'm fallin' for that? I'll take Karen.",8
30002,Kramer,153," All right, which one is Julie? (They walk over to the table               and fight over who sits where) Hey, you ladies look lovely tonight.               (Continue to struggle)",8
30003,Jerry,153," So Whatley sayd to me, ""Hey, I can make Catholic jokes,               I used to be Catholic.""",8
30004,Elaine,153," You see, I don't think it is a Catholic joke. I think it's               more of a Raquel Welch joke. What was it? No, I said hand me the               buoys. (Laughing) Bouys!",8
30005,Jerry,153," Don't you see what Whatley is after? Total joke telling               immunity. He's already got the two big religions covered, if he               ever gets Polish citizenship there'll be no stopping him.",8
30006,Elaine,153, So what're you gonna do?,8
30007,Jerry,153," I think this Father Curtis might be very interested to hear               what Whatley has the Pope doing with Raquel Welch.",8
30008,Elaine,153," (Calling on phone) Hey, Beth, Arnie, it's Elaine. Um, thought               you guys might wanna have lunch. Gimme a call. Bye.",8
30009,Jerry,153," They're not getting a baby so you're taking them out to               lunch?",8
30010,Elaine,153, Thought it would be nice.,8
30011,Jerry,153, Poor Beth.,8
30012,Elaine,153," Hey, Arnie's just as upset.",8
30013,Jerry,153, Oh screw him! (George enters),8
30014,George,153," Listen to this. Marcy comes up and she tells me her ex-boyfriend               was over late last night, and ""yada yada yada, I'm really tired               today."" You don't think she yada yada'd sex.",8
30015,Elaine,153, (Raising hand) I've yada yada'd sex.,8
30016,George,153, Really?,8
30017,Elaine,153," Yeah. I met this lawyer, we went out to dinner, I had the               lobster bisk, we went back to my place, yada yada yada, I never               heard from him again.",8
30018,Jerry,153, But you yada yada'd over the best part.,8
30019,Elaine,153," No, I mentioned the bisk.",8
30020,George,153," Well, I gotta do somethin'. (Walks over to bathroom. Kramer               enters)",8
30021,Kramer,153," Well, I gotta do somethin'.",8
30022,Jerry,153, George is already in there.,8
30023,Kramer,153," (Confused) No, Mickey and I, we can't work it out. You               know, I'm thinking of asking that Karen out by myself.",8
30024,Jerry,153, I thought you were leaning towards Julie.,8
30025,Kramer,153," I was, but the one I thought was Julie turned out to be               Karen.",8
30026,George,153, Well it was a helluva yada yada.,8
30027,Marcy,153," He's moving to Seattle. We wanted to say goodbye, I was               just getting out of the shower, and yada yada yada--",8
30028,George,153," All right, enough! Enough! From now on, no more yada yada's.               Just give me the full story.",8
30029,Marcy,153, Okay.,8
30030,George,153, Tell me about the free facial.,8
30031,Marcy,153," Okay, well, like I said I was on 3rd Avenue, and I stopped               by a large department store.",8
30032,George,153, Which one?,8
30033,Marcy,153, Bloomingdale's.,8
30034,George,153, Very good. Go on.,8
30035,Marcy,153," Oh, and I stole a Piaget watch.",8
30036,George,153, What's that?,8
30037,Marcy,153," And then, I was on such a... high, that I went upstairs               to the salon on the fifth floor, and got a massage and facial, and               skipped out on the bill.",8
30038,George,153, Shoplifting.,8
30039,Marcy,153," Well, what about you? You told me that you were engaged.               What was the rest of that? (Pause)",8
30040,Jerry,153," Excuse me, Mother?",8
30041,Nun,153, Sister.,8
30042,Jerry,153," Sister, right. Do you know when Father Curtis has office               hours?",8
30043,Nun,153, Well not until tomorrow.,8
30044,Jerry,153," Hmm, I really need to speak with him.",8
30045,Father,153, That's a kneeler.,8
30046,Jerry,153, Oh. (Adjusts accordingly),8
30047,Father,153," Tell me your sins, my son.",8
30048,Jerry,153, Well I should tell you that I'm Jewish.,8
30049,Father,153, That's no sin.,8
30050,Jerry,153," Oh good. Anyway, I wanted to talk to you about Dr. Whatley.               I have a suspicion that he's converted to Judaism just for the jokes.",8
30051,Father,153, And this offends you as a Jewish person.,8
30052,Jerry,153," No, it offends me as a comedian. And it'll interest you               that he's also telling Catholic jokes.",8
30053,Father,153, Well.,8
30054,Jerry,153," And they're old jokes. I mean, the Pope and Raquel Welch               in a lifeboat.",8
30055,Father,153, I haven't heard that one.,8
30056,Jerry,153," Oh, I'm sure you have. They're out on the ocean and, yada               yada yada, and she says, ""Those aren't buoys."" (Father               starts laughing) Father...",8
30057,Father,153," One second... Well, if it would make you feel better I               could speak to Dr. Whatley. I have to go back and have a wisdom               teeth removed.",8
30058,Jerry,153," You know the difference between a dentist and a sadist don't               you?",8
30059,Father,153, Um...,8
30060,Jerry,153, Newer magazines.,8
30061,Father,153, Now if you'll excuse me. (Closes door. George enters confessional.),8
30062,George,153," Jerry, I gotta talk to you.",8
30063,Kramer,153, Hi.,8
30064,Karen,153," Hi, Kramer.",8
30065,Kramer,153, Got a minute?,8
30066,Karen,153," Uh, actually my parents are over, but, would you like to               meet them?",8
30067,Kramer,153, Sure.,8
30068,Karen,153," (Parents enter and are little people like Mickey) Mom, Dad.",8
30069,Kramer,153, Hi.,8
30070,Arnie,153," Elaine, I have to ask you something. What exactly happened               down there?",8
30071,Elaine,153," Well, I don't know. I mean, I talked to him and, blah blah               blah, he asked about you guys and, da da da da da, more questions,               bleh bleh bleh....",8
30072,Arnie,153," All right, shut up!",8
30073,Elaine,153, Again you are telling me to shut up?,8
30074,Arnie,153, What?,8
30075,Elaine,153," You yelled that time at the movies. That's why you're not               getting the baby.",8
30076,Arnie,153, Oh my God. How am I gonna tell Beth?,8
30077,Elaine,153," Look, I'll go down and talk to this adoption guy and I'll               make sure that it all gets worked out.",8
30078,Arnie,153," All right, just don't screw it up this time! (He exits)",8
30079,Elaine,153," See, again with the yelling. Not a fan of the yelling.",8
30080,Jerry,153," (In pain) Oh, are you about done?",8
30081,Tim,153," I'm just getting warmed up. Because I'm just a sadist with               newer magazines.",8
30082,Jerry,153, Huh?,8
30083,Tim,153, Father Curtis told me about your little joke.,8
30084,Jerry,153, What about all your Jewish jokes?,8
30085,Tim,153," I'm Jewish, you're not a dentist. You have no idea what my               people have been through.",8
30086,Jerry,153, The Jews?,8
30087,Tim,153," No, the dentists. You know, we have the highest suicide rate               of any profession?",8
30088,Jerry,153, Is that why it's so hard to get an appointment?,8
30089,Kramer,153," So, I'll uh... all right. (Hangs up)",8
30090,Jerry,153, Date with Karen?,8
30091,Kramer,153," No, Julie. She's the one.",8
30092,Jerry,153, What happened to Karen?,8
30093,Kramer,153," Well, Mickey and her have a lot more in common. you know               her parents are little people?",8
30094,Jerry,153," Oh, small world. So little people can have not little people               children?",8
30095,Kramer,153," Oh yeah, and vice versa. Mother Nature's a mad scientist,               Jerry.",8
30096,Jerry,153," So you won't believe what happened with Whatley today. It               got back to hime that I made this little dentist joke and he got               all offended. Those people can be so touchy.",8
30097,Kramer,153," Those people, listen to yourself.",8
30098,Jerry,153, What?,8
30099,Kramer,153," You think that dentists are so different from me and you?               They came to this country just like everybody else, in search of               a dream.",8
30100,Jerry,153," Kramer, he's just a dentist.",8
30101,Kramer,153," Yeah, and you're an anti-dentite.",8
30102,Jerry,153, I am not an anti-dentite!,8
30103,Kramer,153," You're a rabid anti-dentite! Oh, it starts with a few jokes               and some slurs. ""Hey, denty!"" Next thing you know you're               saying they should have their own schools.",8
30104,Jerry,153, They do have their own schools!,8
30105,Kramer,153, Yeah!,8
30106,Elaine,153," One little baby, whatever you have in stock.",8
30107,Agent,153, Miss Benes...,8
30108,Elaine,153," Look it, look it, Ryan. These people are gettin' a baby.               Period. Now we can do this the easy way, or we can do this the fun               way.",8
30109,Beth,153," Jerry, I'm sorry to bother you, but you always said you'd               be there for me.",8
30110,Jerry,153," Well, what's wrong?",8
30111,Beth,153, I'm thinking of leaving Arnie.,8
30112,Jerry,153, Talk to me.,8
30113,Beth,153," He met with Elaine, and I asked him what happened, and he               yada yada'd me. I mean, could he be having an affair?",8
30114,Jerry,153," Well, I wouldn't put anything past anybody.",8
30115,Beth,153, But we just got married.,8
30116,Jerry,153," Well obviously that was a mistake. You need to forget about               Arnie. The important thing is you're moving on.",8
30117,Beth,153, Why would Elaine do that to me?,8
30118,Jerry,153," Forget about Elaine. Let's just focus on us. Come on, big               hug. (Mickey and Karen enter)",8
30119,Mickey,153, Hey Jerry. Where's Kramer? I've got exciting news.,8
30120,Jerry,153, I'm kinda in the middle of something.,8
30121,Mickey,153, Karen and I are getting married.,8
30122,Jerry,153," Oh, congratulations. Her marriage just fell apart.",8
30123,Mickey,153, (To Beth) How many is that for you?,8
30124,Beth,153, Two.,8
30125,Mickey,153," You're a lightweight. Come on, honey.",8
30126,Elaine,153, Hey Jerry. What are you doing here with Beth?,8
30127,Jerry,153, Beth and Arnie broke up.,8
30128,Elaine,153, So they don't want a baby?,8
30129,Jerry,153, (Shaking his head no) Pff.,8
30130,Elaine,153," (Realizes her mistake) I think I'm gonna be sick. (George               enters alone)",8
30131,Jerry,153," Hey, where's Marcy?",8
30132,George,153," She, uh, went shopping for some shoes for the wedding and,               yada yada yada, I'll see her in six to eight months. (Kramer and               Julie enter)",8

30136,Elaine,153, Nice looking family.,8
30137,Jerry,153, Very handsome.,8
30138,Kramer,153, (To Mr. Abbott) How ya doing?,8
30139,Mr. Abbott,153, Hey Kramer.,8
30140,Julie,153," Oh Mickey. Excuse me, I can't take this. (She exits quickly)",8
30141,Jerry,153," Hi, Mr. Abbott.",8
30142,Mr. Abbott,153," That's Dr. Abbott, D.D.S. Tim Whatley was one of my               students. And if this wasn't my son's wedding day, I'd knock you               teeth out you anti-dentite bastard.",8
30143,Beth,153, What was that all about?,8
30144,Jerry,153," Oh, I said something about dentists and it got blown all               out of proportion.",8
30145,Beth,153," Hey, what do you call a doctor who fails out of med school?",8
30146,Jerry,153, What?,8
30147,Beth,153, A dentist. (They laugh),8
30148,Jerry,153, That's a good one. Dentists.,8
30149,Beth,153," Yeah, who needs 'em? Not to mention the Blacks and the Jews.               (Jerry fakes a smile)",8
30150,Elaine,153, Where's Beth?,8
30151,Jerry,153, She went out to get her head shaved.,8
30152,Father,153," We are gathered her today to unite this couple in holy...               matrimony.",8
30153,Jerry,153, Those wisdom teeth are tough to get out.,8
30154,Father,153," Marriage is not an intervention to be entered lightly...               Yada yada yada, I pronounce you man and wife. (They kiss, walk toward               exit)",8

30160,Man,155, Excuse me. Would you mind watching my bag for a minute?,8
30161,George,155, Yeah. No problem.,8
30162,Jerry,155, Let's go.,8
30163,George,155," Woah, I gotta watch this guy's bag.",8
30164,Jerry,155, For how long?,8
30165,George,155, I'm sure he'll be back in a second.,8
30166,Jerry,155, Come on.,8
30167,George,155, Excuse me sir. Would you mind watching my bag for a minute?,8
30168,Man 2,155," Why? So I can stand here like an idiot not knowing if you'll               ever come back?",8
30169,George,155, Where are you going?,8
30170,Jerry,155, I'm going to be this guy's friend.,8
30171,Jerry,155, New clothes?,8
30172,George,155," Yeah. I did some shopping. Some new clothes shopping. (turns               to a man) Can I borrow your menu?",8
30173,Jerry,155," Strange. For new pants, there's noticable wear on the buttocks               of those chinos. Wait those are the clothes from the bag!",8
30174,George,155, The guy never came back.,8
30175,Jerry,155, He asked you to watch them not wear them.,8
30176,George,155, I'm still watching them.,8
30177,Jerry,155, You look like a tourist.,8
30178,Jerry,155, When you hear like a soft russeling.,8
30179,Jerry,155," Oh right, the new job, how is it?",8
30180,George,155," I love it. New office, new salary. I'm the new Wilhelm.",8

30186,Alex,155, I'll be right back.,8
30187,George,155," Where are you meeting these women? When they get off the               bus at the port authority?",8
30188,Jerry,155," Right here, George. In here. (pointing to his chest) Try               opening this up. You'll find the biggest dating scene in the world.",8
30189,George,155, Thanks. Thanks a lot.,8
30190,Kramer,155, Hey.,8
30191,Elaine,155, Hey.,8
30192,Kramer,155, Hi.,8
30193,Elaine,155, Where's Jerry?,8
30194,Kramer,155, Well he's in the shower. You want me to get him?,8
30195,Elaine,155, No. No no. Actually I kind of need to speak to you.,8
30196,Kramer,155, Well let's sit down.,8
30197,Elaine,155," Kramer, ahem, remember that whole deal with you selling               Peterman your stories for his book and then he gave them back to               you?",8
30198,Kramer,155, Vaguely.,8
30199,Elaine,155," Well I was kind of, hehehe, short on material and I, um,               I put them in the book anyway.",8
30200,Kramer,155, You put my life's stories in his autobiography?,8
30201,Elaine,155," Kramer listen, it is such a stupid book. It doesn't matter.",8
30202,Kramer,155," Oh no. Sure. It matters. Wow. I've broken through, huh.               I'm part of popular culture now. Listen I've got to thank Mr. Peterman.",8
30203,Elaine,155, He's doing a book signing at Waldenbooks this afternoon.,8
30204,Kramer,155, Waldenbooks? That's a major chain huh.,8
30205,Kramer,155," He Jerry, I'm going to waldenbooks.",8
30206,Jerry,155, (yelling) Get out! Get out! I don't want to live like this.,8
30207,Kramer,155," All right, let's go.",8
30208,Elaine,155," Mr. Lippman, how are you?",8
30209,Mr Lippman,155, Well I'm not bad. Not bad. ,8
30210,Elaine,155, What are you doing here?,8
30211,Mr Lippman,155, I work for Pundant Publishishing. This is our book.,8
30212,Elaine,155, Oh.,8
30213,Mr Lippman,155," If you can call it that. Why is it every half-wit and               sitcom star has his own book out now?",8
30214,Kramer,155, Hey buddy. Remember me?,8
30215,Mr Peterman,155, You're that gangly fellow we bought the stories from.,8
30216,Kramer,155," Yeah, I'm just here to do my part. What's your name darling?",8
30217,Woman,155, Who are you?,8
30218,Kramer,155, I'm the real Peterman.,8
30219,Mr Peterman,155, All right playtime's over.,8
30220,Kramer,155," Relax man. There's enough juice here to keep us all fat               and giggley.",8
30221,Woman,155, I can't believe somebody pulled the top off of this muffin.,8
30222,Elaine,155, That was me. I'm sorry. I don't like the stumps.,8
30223,Mr Lippman,155, So you just eat the tops.,8
30224,Elaine,155," Oh yeah. It's the best part. It's crunchy, it's explosive,               it's where the muffin breaks free of the pan and sort of (makes               hand motions) does it's own thing. I'll tell you. That's a million               dollor idea right there. Just sell the tops.",8
30225,Kramer,155," I have a right to be here. These are my fans. Hey you're               hurting my elbow.",8
30226,Man 1,155, Try looking up hayseed.,8
30227,Man 2,155, You wanna sightsee? Get on a bus.,8
30228,Mary Anne,155, Please don't think all New Yorkers are so rude.,8
30229,George,155, Well actually I'm...,8
30230,Mary Anne,155," I'm Mary Anne. I work for the New York Visitor's Center.               Where are you visiting from?",8
30231,George,155," Little Rock, Arkensas.",8
30232,Mary Anne,155, Ooh.,8
30233,Jerry,155, Hmm. That looks new.,8
30234,Kramer,155," So get this. Peterman has his henchmen forcefully eject               me from the book signing like I'm some kind of a maniac.",8
30235,Jerry,155, (uncomfortably) Yeah that's too bad.,8
30236,Kramer,155, What's the matter with you?,8
30237,Jerry,155, (uncomfortably) Nothing.,8
30238,Kramer,155," No, no, no. Don't give me that. I know you. Something's               wrong. What is it.",8
30239,Jerry,155, I did something stupid.,8
30240,Kramer,155, What did you do?,8
30241,Jerry,155," Well I was shaving. And I noticed an asymmetry in my chest               hair and I was trying to even it out. Next thing I knew, (high pitched               voice) Gone.",8
30242,Kramer,155," Don't you know you're not supposed to poke around down               there.",8
30243,Jerry,155, Well women do it.,8
30244,Kramer,155," (high pitched voice) ""Well women do it."" I'll               tell you what. I'll pick you up a sundress and a parasol and you               can just (high pitched voice) sashey your pretty little self around               the town square.",8
30245,Jerry,155, Well what am I going to tell Alex?,8
30246,Kramer,155," Listen to me. You don't tell anybody about this. No one.               You hear me?",8
30247,Jerry,155, Um hum.,8
30248,Kramer,155," Hey, Jerry shaved his chest.",8
30249,Jerry,155, Hey!,8
30250,Kramer,155, I forgot. Wait. Never mind. ,8
30251,Alex,155, How about the beach this weekend?,8
30252,Jerry,155," You couldn't pay me enough to go to the beach on a weekend.               I mean it's hard enough...",8
30253,Alex,155," All right. All right. Wow is that a Mexican Hairless? Oh,               I love those. Ooh, Hairless. This is where it's at. It's so much               smoother and cleaner.",8
30254,Jerry,155, Really?,8
30255,Elaine,155," ""Top of the Muffin to you!""?",8
30256,Mr. Lippman,155, Top of the muffin to you. Elaine!,8
30257,Elaine,155, Mr Lippman?,8
30258,Jerry,155, So you're pretending to be a tourist?,8
30259,George,155," It's beautiful. She makes all the plans. I'm not from around               here so it's okay if I'm stupid, and she knows I'm only in town               visiting so there's no messy breakup",8
30260,Jerry,155, How do you explain your apartment?,8
30261,George,155, I got a hotel room.,8
30262,Jerry,155, you moved into a hotel?,8
30263,George,155," Well I don't know anyone here Jerry. Where else am I going               to stay?",8
30264,George,155, So?,8
30265,Jerry,155," So. I figure since she likes one hairless animal why not               another.",8
30266,George,155, Oh really. You tell her you shaved it?,8
30267,Jerry,155," Are you nuts? I don't want her to think I'm one of those               low-rise briefs guys who shaves his chest.",8
30268,Kramer,155, (yelling up at Jerry) Hey Jerry.,8
30269,Kramer,155," (yelling) I'm starting a Peterman Reality Bus Tour. Check               it out. Hahaha.",8
30270,George,155, Reality tour?,8
30271,Jerry,155," The last thing this guy's qualified to give a tour of is               reality.",8
30272,Elaine,155, This was my idea you stole my idea.,8
30273,Mr. Lippman,155," Elaine these ideas are all in the air. They're in               the air.",8
30274,Elaine,155," Well if that air is comming out of this face then it is               my air and my idea.",8
30275,Mr. Lippman,155, You want a muffin or not?,8
30276,Elaine,155, Peach.,8
30277,Mary Anne,155, So I notice you don't have much of an accent.,8
30278,George,155, Yeah my parents have it. Sometimes it skips a generation.,8
30279,Mary Anne,155," Look george, I'm really enjoying spending time with               you but I'm not sure this is going to work out. At some point you're               going back to your job at Tyler Chicken and your three-legged dog               Willie.",8
30280,George,155, Willie. Yeah.,8
30281,Mary Anne,155, And I'm still going to be here.,8
30282,George,155, Well what if I told you I'm thinking of moving here?,8
30283,Mary Anne,155," (laughs) George, no offense. But this city would eat               you alive.",8
30284,Jerry,155," You're moving to New York? That's fantastic. I can see you               all the time now.",8
30285,George,155," Eat me alive, huh? We'll see who can make it in *this*               town.",8
30286,Jerry,155, What is it she think you can't do?,8
30287,George,155, Find a job. Get an apartment.,8
30288,Jerry,155, How did you do those things?,8
30289,George,155," Never mind. The're done. All I have to do now is redo them.               You know if you take everything I've ever done in my entire life               and condense it down into one day, it looks decent.",8
30290,Jerry,155," Hey, what were you doing with that bus yesterday?",8
30291,Kramer,155," Here you go, here you go, check it out.",8
30292,Jerry,155," ""The Real Peterman Reality Bus Tour"". I'm confused.",8
30293,Kramer,155," Peterman's book is big business. People want to know the               stories behind the stories.",8
30294,Jerry,155," Nobody wants to go on a three hour bus tour of a totally               unknown person's life.",8
30295,Kramer,155," I'm only charging $37.50, plus you get a pizza bagel and               desert.",8
30296,George,155, What's desert?,8
30297,Kramer,155," Bite-size Three Musketeers. Just like the real Peterman               eats.",8
30298,George,155, He eats those?,8
30299,Kramer,155, No. I eat those. I'm the real Peterman.,8
30300,George,155," I think I understand this. Jay Peterman is real. His biography               is not. Now, you Kramer are real. ",8
30301,Kramer,155, Talk to me.,8
30302,George,155," But your life is Peterman's. Now the bus tour, which is               real, takes to places that, while they are real, they are not real               in sense that they did not *really* happen to the *real* Peterman               which is you.",8
30303,Kramer,155, Understand?,8
30304,Jerry,155, Yeah. $37.50 for a Three Musketeers.,8
30305,Mr. Lippman,155," Elaine. I'm in over my head. Nobody likes my muffin               tops.",8
30306,Elaine,155, So? What do you want me to do about it?,8
30307,Mr. Lippman,155," You're the muffin top expert, tell me what I'm doing               wrong.",8
30308,Elaine,155," Mr. Lippman, when I worked for you at Pendent Publishing,               I believed in you, you know as a man of integrity. But, I saw you               in that paper hat and that aprin...",8
30309,Mr. Lippman,155, What if I cut you in for 30% of the profits?,8
30310,Elaine,155," Deal. Here's your problem. You're making just the muffin               tops. You've gotta make the *whole* muffin. Then you... Pop the               top, toss the stump. Taste.",8
30311,Mr. Lippman,155, Ah. (takes a bite of the top.) Mmmmm. Ah hah?,8
30312,Elaine,155, Yeah.,8
30313,Mr. Lippman,155, So what do we with the bottoms?,8
30314,Elaine,155," I don't know, give em to a soup kitchen.",8
30315,Mr. Lippman,155, That's a good idea.,8
30316,Elaine,155," And one more thing, you really think we need the exclamation               point? Because, it's not ""Top of the Muffin *TO YOU!!!*""",8
30317,Mr. Lippman,155, No. No. It is.,8
30318,Kramer,155, Hey Jerry. What is this? Lady Gillette? What's going on?,8
30319,Jerry,155, What? Can't I get a moment's peace?,8
30320,Kramer,155, What are you doing to yourself?,8
30321,Jerry,155, I can't stop. Alex thinks I'm naturally hairless. ,8
30322,Kramer,155," You can't keep this up. Don't you know what's going to               happen? Everytime you shave it, it's going to come in thicker and               fuller and darker.",8
30323,Jerry,155, Oh that's an old wives tale.,8
30324,Kramer,155, Is it? Look at this.,8
30325,Kramer,155," (high pitched voice) Look at it! Look at it! And it's all               me. I shaved there when I was a lifeguard.",8
30326,Jerry,155," Oh come on. That's genetics. That's not going to happen               to me.",8
30327,Kramer,155, Won't it? Or is it already starting to happen?,8
30328,Elaine,155, Wow. Look at this. We're cleaning up.,8
30329,Rebecca,155," Excuse me, I'm Rebecca Demore from the homeless shelter.",8
30330,Elaine,155," Oh, hi.",8
30331,Rebecca,155," Are you the ones leaveing the muffing pieces behind our               shelter?",8
30332,Elaine,155, You been enjoying them?,8
30333,Rebecca,155, They're just stumps.,8
30334,Elaine,155, Well they're perfectly edible.,8
30335,Rebecca,155," Oh, so you just assume that the homeless will eat them,               they'll eat anything? ",8
30336,Mr. Lippman,155," No no, we just thought...",8
30337,Rebecca,155," I know what you thought. They don't have homes, they don't               have jobs, what do they need the top of a muffin for? They're lucky               to get the stumps.",8
30338,Elaine,155," If the homeless don't like them the homeless don't have               to eat them.",8
30339,Rebecca,155, The homeless don't like them.,8
30340,Elaine,155, Fine.,8
30341,Rebecca,155," We've never gotten so many complaints. Every two minutes,               ""Where is the top of this muffin? Who ate the rest of this?""             ",8
30342,Elaine,155, We were just trying to help.,8
30343,Rebecca,155," Why don't you just drop off some chicken skins and lobster               shells.",8
30344,Elaine,155, I think I might.,8
30345,Mary Anne,155," I can't believe you found something so quickly. How               much you pay?",8
30346,George,155,"$2,300.00 ",8
30347,Mary Anne,155, Ouch. A month?,8
30348,George,155, Yeah.,8
30349,Mary Anne,155," Well, guess that's all right for now, but if you say               here for more than a few months, you're a real sucker.",8
30350,George,155," Yeah, well I uh got lots of other stuff to show you too.               Wait till you see the plum job that I landed.",8
30351,Mary Anne,155," Yeah. We should let this place air out anyway. It smells               like the last tenant had monkeys or something.",8
30352,Kramer,155," Comming up on the right, if you glance up you can just               make out my bedroom window. It's the one that's covered in chicken               wire.",8
30353,Woman,155," Hey if you're the real Peterman, who come you're wearing               those ratty clothes? The're not very romantic.",8
30354,Kramer,155, (over the speaker) Well that's your opinion.,8
30355,Man 1,155, Can I have another Three Musketeers? They're rather small.,8
30356,Kramer,155, Forget it. Okay Newman's postal route is around here somewhere.,8

31423,Helen,160," That's why we joined a program. We walk once around the block         three times a week. ",9
31424,Morty,160, And every morning I eat a plum. ,9
31425,Jerry,160," Well, what ever you do, you're wearing me out. ",9
31426,Helen,160, What about you? ,9
31427,Morty,160," Yeah, looks like you're getting a little spare tire there, tiger.       ",9
31428,Jerry,160, Really? ,9
31429,Kramer,160," Hey, Seinfelds! ",9
31430,Morty,160," Hey, Mr. Kramer! ",9
31431,Kramer,160, How long are you staying? ,9
31432,Helen,160, We just came down for a funeral. ,9
31433,Kramer,160," Oh yeah, yeah I heard, Marvin Kessler. Boy, that makes you think.         If he could go... ",9
31434,Helen,160, See you downstairs with the car. ,9
31435,Jerry,160, Are you sure you don't need a hand with that? ,9
31436,Morty,160," No no, the luggage is on the program. I got a brick in here. ",9
31437,Jerry,160, Did you give blood? ,9
31438,Kramer,160," No, not giving. hoarding. I'm storing it in to a blood bank.         Just in case. ",9
31439,Jerry,160, In case of what? ,9
31440,Kramer,160," Jerry, I know myself. If I'm out on the street and it's starts         to go down, I don't back off until it's finished. ",9
31441,Jerry,160, Are we finished? ,9
31442,Kramer,160, Done. ,9
31443,Vivian,160," Elaine, I'm so glad you came out. ",9
31444,Elaine,160, Yeah... ,9
31445,Vivian,160, You haven't seen Jimmy for years. ,9
31446,Elaine,160," I know, I'm glad I got to see him before he hit puberty and got,         you know all lurchy and awkward. ",9
31447,Vivian,160," Actually, I'm gonna need someone to look after him tomorrow evening.       ",9
31448,Elaine,160," Tomorrow evening, sure. ",9
31449,Vivian,160, Do you know anyone responsible? ,9
31450,Elaine,160, Do I know anyone?? ,9
31451,Vivian,160," Well, if you think of anybody, give me a call. ",9
31452,George,160, What are you doing? ,9
31453,Tara,160," Incense, for the mood. ",9
31454,George,160," Oh yes, by no means, the mood. Let me know if there's anything         I can do to lend support to the mood. ",9
31455,George,160," Um, cream soda? ",9
31456,Tara,160, Vanilla. ,9
31457,Elaine,160," Can you believe that, Vivian doesn't think I'm responsible? ",9
31458,Elaine,160," I couldn't raise a kid? Come on, I love bossing people around.       ",9
31459,Jerry,160," What happened, I thought you were with Tara tonight? ",9
31460,George,160," I was, I had to leave. She lit some vanilla incenses. The smell         drove me nuts, all I could think about was food, I had to get out of there.         We need some pudding here! Pudding! ",9
31461,Elaine,160, You just left? What did you tell her? ,9
31462,George,160," I told I had a bus transfer that was only good just for another         hour. ",9
31463,Jerry,160, What? ,9
31464,George,160," I don't know, I was starving Jerry! ",9
31465,George,160," Oh, pudding! You want some? ",9
31466,Jerry,160," Hey, you guys think I'm getting a little...chunky? ",9
31467,George,160," What are you kidding? We look great! You know what this pudding         needs? The skin on the top, you know like your mother used to make it         on the stove. ",9
31468,Jerry,160," Elaine, what do you think? ",9
31469,Elaine,160," I think you're getting a little pudding under the skin yourself.       ",9
31470,Kramer,160," My service rates went up? You banks are all the same with your         hidden fees and your service charges. Well, maybe I'll just take my blood         elsewhere, yeah. ",9
31471,Bank employee,160," Well, we can transfer to another bank for you. ",9
31472,Kramer,160," Oh, no no no...no more banks. I'm keeping my blood in my freezer         with...my money! ",9
31473,George,160," So eh, what do you say? ",9
31474,Tara,160, I guess we could use some food in our lovemaking. ,9
31475,George,160," Ok, we got your...got your strawberries, your chocolate sauce,         your pastrami on rye with mustard, your honey... ",9
31476,Tara,160," Wait wait wait, pastrami on rye with mustard? ",9
31477,George,160," Oh yeah yeah, don't you know they used pastrami in that movie         9 weeks? Remember the pastrami scene? ",9
31478,Tara,160, No. ,9
31479,George,160," Well, maybe it was Ghostbusters? Where ever it was, it worked!       ",9
31480,Jerry,160," Didn't go for it, huh? ",9
31481,George,160, No. ,9
31482,Jerry,160," So, she didn't appreciate the erotic qualities of the salted cured         meats? ",9
31483,George,160," She tolerated the strawberries and the chocolate sauce, but eh,         it's not a meal, you know? Food and sex, those are my two passions. It's         only natural to combine them. ",9
31484,Jerry,160," Natural? Sex is about love between a man and a woman, not a man         and a sandwich. ",9
31485,George,160," Jerry, I'm not suggesting getting rid of the girl. She's integral.       ",9
31486,Jerry,160," Maybe instead of trying to satisfy two of your needs, how about         satisfying one of somebody else's. ",9
31487,George,160," Hey, speaking of which, I found a great way to separate the skin         from the top of the pudding without leaving any around the edges; Exacto         knife. ",9
31488,Jerry,160," I told you George, no more pudding. I'm starting a purification         program. Keep all that kind of food away from me. ",9
31489,George,160," Well, I guess these would be out of the question. [pulls out         two pudding skins in plastic bags.] ",9
31490,Jerry,160, What the hell is that? ,9
31491,George,160, Pudding skin singles. ,9
31492,Kramer,160," Hey buddy, I'm borrowing all your Tupperware. ",9
31493,Jerry,160," Oh, why? ",9
31494,Kramer,160, I closed down my account at the blood bank. ,9
31495,Jerry,160," What, it...it's here in the building? ",9
31496,Kramer,160," Right across the hall. What, you wanna go see? ",9
31497,Jerry,160," No I don't! In fact, if even one corpuscles of that blood should         find it's way across that hall I will freak out on you Kramer! Freak out.       ",9
31498,Kramer,160," You know, for a fat guy you're not very jolly. ",9
31499,Elaine,160," Hey, working out? ",9
31500,Jerry,160, You know it and I ditched all my junk food. ,9
31501,Kramer,160, What the heck is going on here? ,9
31502,Jerry,160," Sorry buddy, clean house. It's all health food. ",9
31503,Kramer,160," Well, I may have to take it, but I don't have to like it. ",9
31504,Elaine,160," Vivian left me a message. I guess a certain someone changed her         mind about whether someone was responsible enough to watch certain other         someone. ",9
31505,Jerry,160, Is this about me? ,9
31506,Elaine,160, No. ,9
31507,Jerry,160," Oh, then I lost interest. ",9
31508,Elaine,160," Vivian, hi it's Elaine. Yeah, I'm over at Jerry's, I got your         message...What? Yeah, he's right here, hold on...[hands the phone to Kramer.]       ",9
31509,Kramer,160," For me? Go...Yeah, what tonight? Yeah, I'll be there...Yeah later.         [puts the phone down] Well, somebody's baby-sitting. ",9
31510,Elaine,160, You? I'm more responsible than you are! ,9
31511,Kramer,160," Don't be ridiculous. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have to go to         fill my freezer with my own blood. ",9
31512,George,160," Oh, Tara! ",9
31513,Kramer,160," Hello, Vivian! Oh, this is a nice screen. ",9
31514,Elaine,160, Kramer... ,9
31515,Kramer,160, Don't take my money! ,9
31516,Elaine,160," It is me, you idiot. Hi, all right you've got to get out of here,         I'm gonna baby-sit the hell out of that kid. ",9
31517,Kramer,160," No, I'm the baby-sitter. ",9
31518,Elaine,160," No no no, you're out, I'm in. Now, hit the road. ",9
31519,Vivian,160, Elaine? What are you doing here? ,9
31520,Elaine,160," Kramer is actually sleeping one off, so I thought that I'd help         out...[Kramer moans from the bushes] what's that, some raccoon or something...[hits         Kramer with a broom.] ",9
31521,Vivian,160," Well, I guess this would be all right. Jimmy, you remember Elaine?         She's gonna watch you tonight. ",9
31522,Elaine,160," Hi Jimmy. [Jimmy kicks Elaine to the shin.] Ouch! [The screen         door hits her in the head.] ",9
31523,Jerry,160," Hey, what are you doing here? I thought you were baby-sitting         at Vivian's. ",9
31524,Kramer,160, There was an incident. ,9
31525,Jerry,160," Oh no, where's the blood? [opens the fridge] It's in here isn't         it? ",9
31526,Kramer,160, Would you stop it. ,9
31527,Jerry,160, What is this? ,9
31528,Kramer,160, It's Jell-O. ,9
31529,Jerry,160, What about this? This is blood isn't it?! ,9
31530,Kramer,160," This is tomato juice, look...[drinks from the bottle.] ",9
31531,Jerry,160," Ooh, you're sick! You're sick!! ",9
31532,Kramer,160," Will you calm down. I took all my blood down to Newman's. He         let me put it in his meat freezer. ",9
31533,Jerry,160," Hey, what's going on? Who made pudding? ",9
31534,Kramer,160," Oh yeah yeah, George he came by and made more of those pudding         skin singles. They're delicious. ",9
31535,Jerry,160," Damn that George, I told him I don't want this stuff around here         anymore... ",9
31536,Kramer,160, Heads up! ,9
31537,Jerry,160, Aaah... ,9
31538,Jimmy,160," You're dead, president Lincoln! You're dead! ",9
31539,Elaine,160, I wish I was dead. ,9
31540,Jimmy,160, Can I have your juice? ,9
31541,Elaine,160, As long as you don't put... ,9
31542,Elaine,160, Thanks for the re-fill. ,9
31543,Vivian,160," Hey, Elaine! How did it go? ",9
31544,Elaine,160," Oh, he's...he's a joy... ",9
31545,Vivian,160, Really? Some sitter have told me he's bit of a handful. ,9
31546,Elaine,160," Oh, handful of sunshine. I wish I could do this every day. ",9
31547,Vivian,160," Oh Elaine, that's so good to hear. I've been having a few health         problems lately. ",9
31548,Elaine,160," It's not serious, is it? ",9
31549,Vivian,160," Well, it might be. Just in case anything does happen, it's nice         to know there's somebody like you around. ",9
31550,Elaine,160," Oh yeah, that eh...that is nice to know. [Pours the juice from         the bag back to glass.] ",9
31551,Jerry,160, Aah! ,9
31552,Kramer,160," It's ok, Jerry. I'm right here. ",9
31553,Jerry,160, I can see that! What happened? ,9
31554,Kramer,160," That knife, it nicked your jugular. You know Jerry, when somebody         yells 'heads up', you're not supposed to actually look up. ",9
31555,Jerry,160, I'll remember that. ,9
31556,Kramer,160," Anyway, you were lucky that I was there. You lost a lot of blood.       ",9
31557,Jerry,160, What? ,9
31558,Kramer,160," Oh yeah, you've got three pints of Kramer in you, buddy. ",9
31559,George,160, Three pints of Kramer's blood? ,9
31560,Jerry,160," I can feel his blood inside of me. Borrowing things from my blood.       ",9
31561,George,160," Well, so much for purification week. ",9
31562,Jerry,160," So, how's the fornicating gourmet? ",9
31563,George,160," Doing quite well, thank you. Yesterday I had a soft boiled egg         and a quickie. You know what? If I could add TV to the equation, that         would really be the ultimate. ",9
31564,Jerry,160," George, we're trying to have a civilization here. ",9
31565,Elaine,160, Hey. ,9
31566,Jerry,160," Hey, how was baby-sitting? ",9
31567,Elaine,160," Oh, just great. I found out that Vivian has some kind of medical         problem and if the worst happens she wants me to take care of Jimmy. ",9
31568,Jerry,160," Oh, I'm sure it won't be the worst. ",9
31569,Elaine,160," It doesn't matter. If anything happens to her, I'm on deck! Scissors         mishap, air show disaster, chinese organ thieves...it's a dangerous world.       ",9
31570,George,160," She's right, I heard Kramer got mugged out on the suburbs on         a baby-sitting gig. ",9
31571,Jerry,160, Really? ,9
31572,Kramer,160," Look at this, look at the hair on the back of my neck. It's all         bramble, see it's like thicket back there. Look, I need somebody to shave         it for me, huh? ",9
31573,Jerry,160, I'm not touching that thing. ,9
31574,Kramer,160," Well, I have to say I'm very surprised and disappointed - blood         brother. ",9
31575,Jerry,160," Oh, no... ",9
31576,Kramer,160," What? Jerry, I gave you my blood. Listen to your pulse, [takes         Jerry hand] hey buddy-hey buddy-hey buddy... ",9
31577,Jerry,160," Kramer, I'm not shaving your neck. ",9
31578,Kramer,160," So, my blood is not enough. Would you like a kidney too, because         I'll give it to you? I'll rip it out right here and stack it on the table!       ",9
31579,Jerry,160," All right, all right I'll do it, sit down. ",9
31580,Kramer,160," No no no, I don't have time right now. I'll catch you tonight,         we'll do sort of an all over kind of thing, all right? ",9
31581,Jerry,160, Hello? ,9
31582,Helen,160," Kramer called, he told that you were in a hospital. ",9
31583,Jerry,160, Kramer called you? ,9
31584,Helen,160, He calls every week. Are you all right? ,9
31585,Jerry,160," Yes, I'm fine. ",9
31586,Helen,160, He says he's fine. ,9
31587,Morty,160, Tell him to eat a plum. ,9
31588,Helen,160," Jerry, you really have to take better care of yourself. We bought         you some session with a personal trainer. ",9
31589,Jerry,160," I don't need a personal trainer. [Kramer comes in] all right I've         got to go, we'll talk about this later. ",9
31590,Morty,160, Plum...[Jerry hangs up.] ,9
31591,Jerry,160, Why are you calling my parents? ,9
31592,Kramer,160," Well, maybe if you called more often, I wouldn't have to. Listen,         is it all right if I watch a tape in here? ",9
31593,Jerry,160, Why here? ,9
31594,Kramer,160," Well, I'm taping Canadian Parliament, you know on C-Span. ",9
31595,Jerry,160, Ok... ,9
31596,Kramer,160," Is it all right if I watch it in your bedroom, cause your bed         is really nice? ",9
31597,Jerry,160, Fine... ,9
31598,Kramer,160, Ok! ,9
31599,Jerry,160, No no no no no no no no no no! I do not want that in here! ,9
31600,Kramer,160, Blood! ,9
31601,Jerry,160, All right. ,9
31602,Izzy,160," Hello, dough boy. ",9
31603,Jerry,160, Mr. Mandelbaum? You're the personal trainer? ,9
31604,Izzy,160," I'm here to whip you in to shape, so grab your jocks - if you need         one. It's go-time. ",9
31605,Vivian,160, Elaine? Elaine? ,9
31606,Elaine,160," Oh, hi, oh God. I didn't here you come in. ",9
31607,Vivian,160, Where's Jimmy? ,9
31608,Elaine,160," I don't know, I don't know...we had HoHos for dinner and then         eh...and then he put this plastic bag over his head and started running         around until he got tired and then he laid down somewhere I...I tell you         I'm no good watching that kid. ",9
31609,Vivian,160," Sleeping like an angel. Elaine, you're the best. ",9
31610,Elaine,160," No! I'm a scatter brain. That's why I probably can't hold a job         or keep a man! ",9
31611,Vivian,160," Be quiet. So, will you watch Jimmy tomorrow? ",9
31612,Elaine,160," All right, but I'm running out of purses here. [takes her purse         from a punch ball.] ",9
31613,Jerry,160," Ok Mr. Mandelbaum, what you want me to do? ",9
31614,Izzy,160," Drop your purse, and pick up that medicine ball. ",9
31615,Jerry,160," Is this a gym, or some kind of fitness museum? ",9
31616,Izzy,160," Not funny, over your head with it. Are you ready? ",9
31617,Jerry,160, For what? ,9
31618,Izzy,160, All aboard in the pain train! ,9
31619,Jerry,160, How many session did my parents paid for? ,9
31620,Izzy,160," Not enough to make a man of you, daffodil. ",9
31621,George,160," Oohoho...spicy mustard...woohoho, you're hot tonight! ",9
31622,Tara,160," Oh, George! ",9
31623,George,160," And now for the trifecta. [Picks up a hand held TV and gets back         under the covers.] ",9
31624,Tara,160," George? George? What are you doing?! [Pulls the covers off. George         is eating a sandwich and watching TV.] ",9
31625,George,160, Pleasuring you? ,9
31626,"[5A. Kramer and Newman are making sausages. Tape recorder plays Jackie         Davis",160, Manana. Jerry comes in.] ,9
31627,Jerry,160, What is this? ,9
31628,Kramer,160, We're making sausages. ,9
31629,Jerry,160, I thought you were gonna watch a video. ,9
31630,Kramer,160," Yeah, an instructional video about how to make your own sausages.       ",9
31631,Jerry,160," Kramer, I'm not in a mood for this. ",9
31632,Kramer,160," All right, all right. Newman, let's go grab some mail sacks and         haul these beauties out of here. ",9
31633,Jerry,160," Blood over there, sausages over here. I'm living in a slaughter         house. ",9
31634,Izzy,160," Tonight I want you to sleep on this. Toughens the vertebrae. [Looks         at the sausages] What in holy hell? Sausages? Is this your diet? ",9
31635,Jerry,160, No they're not mine Mr. Mandelbaum... ,9
31636,Izzy,160," Don't lie to me, butter bean. We're taking it up a notch. ",9
31637,Jerry,160," So, the free love buffet is over? ",9
31638,George,160," I got greedy. Flew too close to the sun on wings of pastrami.       ",9
31639,Jerry,160," Yeah, that's what you did...I can't believe I got another session         with Izzy Mandelbaum, he's probably makes me box a kangaroo. ",9
31640,Jerry,160, What's going on? ,9
31641,George,160, I don't know. This sandwich is making me flush. ,9
31642,Jerry,160," Oh no, I'll tell you what you did Caligula; you combined food         and sex in to one disgusting uncontrollable urge. ",9
31643,George,160, I think you're right. You gonna eat that? ,9
31644,Jerry,160," No, but please tell me that's all you're gonna do with it. ",9
31645,Elaine,160," Jerry, I tell you; if this woman dies, it is going to be a major         inconvenience. ",9
31646,George,160, These fries are really really good... ,9
31647,Jerry,160," All right, that's enough of that. [Jerry takes the plates and         hands them to a waitress.] ",9

This family sits up next to me.         I go in to the surfs and when I come from out, my clothes, my towel, my         umbrella, they're all gone. I am furious, I start screaming to these kids         demanding my stuff back and finally I lose it; I grab their boom box and         I chuck it in to the ocean. ",9

32035,George,163, Like retouched. ,9

32055,Elaine,163, How do you do that? ,9
32056,Kramer,163," Yeah well, that's easy. Just let me finish this mile high and         I'll be right with you. Oh, and Jerry, we are gonna need a case of Kaiser         rolls. ",9

32060,Kramer,163," Ok, oh, you see this socket it's probably connected to her apartment.         So what we'll do, we'll take this paper clip and bend it so it'll short         out the entire circuit. Here you go... ",9
32061,Elaine,163, I think I'll let you do it. ,9
32062,Kramer,163," No no no. It's easy, you just...do it quickly. ",9

32074,Sara,163," A joke. Do you have any idea how it feels like to save someone's         life? ",9

32114,George,163," No no no no no, this has to be carefully orchestrated. You go         to a fancy dinner, flowers... ",9
32115,Jerry,163, Flowers? ,9
32116,George,163," Yeah, you gotta do it classy [wipes his mouth to his sweater.]       ",9
32117,Jerry,163," So, you've done this? ",9
32118,George,163," Almost. Couldn't get the girl go out with me the second time.       ",9
32119,Kramer,163, I think we are looking half a millimeter. ,9
32120,Elaine,163, Can it cut that thin? ,9
32121,Kramer,163," Oh, I've cut slices so thin, I couldn't even see them. ",9
32122,Elaine,163, How did you know you cut it? ,9
32123,Kramer,163," Well, I guess I just assumed. ",9
32124,Elaine,163," Hold on kitty, dinner's coming. ",9
32125,Kramer,163," Yeah, that's a hall of famer. ",9
32126,Elaine,163," Alright, let's do it. ",9
32127,Kramer,163," Alright, here we go. Yeah, watch that baby slide...[Puts a slice         of meat under the door.] ",9
32128,Elaine,163," Come on, come on kitty...[slice disappears] ooh...how about that;         it worked! Wow, can I borrow that thing for a while? ",9
32129,Kramer,163," Oh no, I don't think so. ",9
32130,Elaine,163, Why not? ,9
32131,Kramer,163," Well, you're not checked at on it. ",9
32132,Elaine,163, What do I have to know? ,9
32133,Kramer,163," Well, where the meat goes? ",9
32134,Elaine,163, Right there. ,9
32135,Kramer,163, Where do you turn it on? ,9
32136,Elaine,163, Right there. ,9
32137,Kramer,163," But where does the meat go?         [Jerry is on the revenge date with Sara.] ",9
32138,Sara,163," Restaurant, flowers...this is so nice. ",9
32139,Jerry,163," Well, I'm a classy guy. How's the life saving business? ",9
32140,Sara,163, It's fine. ,9
32141,Jerry,163," It must take a really really big zit, to kill a man! ",9
32142,Sara,163, What is with you? ,9
32143,Jerry,163, You call yourself a lifesaver. I call you pimple popper MD! ,9
32144,Parry,163, Dr. Sitarides? ,9
32145,Sara,163," Mr. Parry, how are you? ",9
32146,Parry,163, I just wanted to thank you again for saving my life. ,9
32147,Jerry,163, She saved your life? ,9
32148,Parry,163, I had skin cancer. ,9
32149,Jerry,163, Skin cancer! Damn. ,9
32150,Elaine,163," You were right Kramer, this slicer is absolutely amazing...yeah,         yeah...no no no I'll bring it by tonight...ok bye.         [Walks off the couch.] ",9
32151,Elaine,163, These heals are so uneven. [Watches the slicer.] ,9
32152,Clerk,163, Here you Mr. Costanza. ,9
32153,George,163, What is this? This is a drawing. ,9
32154,Clerk,163," Looks real, doesn't it? ",9
32155,George,163, This is a cartoon! ,9
32156,Clerk,163," Hey, I had to draw that guy from memory. Considering, I think         that's damn good. ",9
32157,George,163," But it's not a photograph, I need a photograph! ",9
32158,Clerk,163, Then you better get a camera. ,9
32159,Jerry,163, He looks like a Peanuts character. ,9
32160,George,163," I know. The only way to fix it now, is to get a whole new photo         of Kruger. ",9
32161,Jerry,163, You can do that. ,9
32162,George,163, Without his shirt on. ,9
32163,Jerry,163," You can't do that. Well, maybe Kruger wasn't the place for you.       ",9
32164,George,163, It seemed so disorganized. ,9
32165,Jerry,163, I understand. ,9
32166,George,163," What about the Coast Guard? Seems like a lot of pride there,         a lot of tradition. ",9
32167,Jerry,163," True. You mean, for you? ",9
32168,George,163, I think. ,9
32169,Jerry,163, What about your sea sickness? ,9
32170,George,163, Maybe I could be a land guy. ,9
32171,Jerry,163, I don't know if they have land guys. ,9
32172,George,163," Someone's have to unhook the boat before it leaves...the place!       ",9
32173,Elaine,163, Pliers? ,9
32174,Jerry,163, Drawer. ,9
32175,Elaine,163, Got it. ,9
32176,Jerry,163, What are they for? ,9
32177,Elaine,163, I...eh...I got a piece a my heal stuck in a slicer. ,9
32178,Jerry,163, Come again? ,9
32179,Elaine,163," Okay, I got a little slicer happy, but listen; don't tell Kramer,         okay? He has very strong feelings for it. ",9
32180,George,163, I forgot to ask you; how did the revenge date go? ,9
32181,Jerry,163," Eh, it went okay. ",9
32182,George,163," Did you dressed nice, did you do it classy? ",9
32183,Jerry,163," Yeah, I started out real classy... ",9
32184,George,163," Yeah you did, you classed it up! ",9
32185,Jerry,163, But then I found out about the skin cancer. ,9
32186,George,163," Oh, so it backfired? ",9
32187,Jerry,163, Yeah. ,9
32188,George,163," So, I guess I was lucky that I never tried that myself. ",9
32189,Elaine,163," Of course she treats skin cancer. That's how I met her, she was         doing a skin cancer screening at Peterman. That's what dermatologists         do. ",9
32190,Jerry,163," Sadly, that knowledge could've help me. ",9
32191,George,163," Wait a minute, she did a skin cancer screening at Peterman? ",9
32192,Elaine,163, Aha. ,9
32193,George,163, Could she do that at Kruger? ,9
32194,Elaine,163," I don't know, I guess. ",9
32195,George,163," So I set up a screening, everyone takes their shirt off and click,         I snap me a shot of a bear-chested Kruger. ",9
32196,Elaine,163, You have a little thing for this fella'? ,9
32197,George,163," Jerry, you gotta talk to Sitarides. ",9
32198,Jerry,163, Yesterday you said I had to get my revenge on her! ,9
32199,George,163," And that was wrong, Jerry! You simple must to apologize.. ",9
32200,Jerry,163, Must I? ,9
32201,George,163," Yes! Because it is the mature, adult thing to do. ",9
32202,Jerry,163, How does that reflect me? ,9
32203,Kramer,163," Elaine, alright where's the SP2000? Cause I gotta slice. ",9
32204,Elaine,163," Aah, I forgot it. I gotta get home. ",9
32205,Kramer,163," Ok, I'll go with you. ",9
32206,Elaine,163," Umm, I'm not actually going straight to home, I have to first         stop at the eh...circus, you know with all the...clowns. ",9
32207,Kramer,163," Oh, well you have fun...[Elaine leaves] oh no clowns...hate clowns...the         clowns. ",9
32208,Jerry,163," So again, I'm sorry. I had no right to yell at you, you're a life         saving doctor and I'm just a comedian... ",9
32209,Sara,163," Jerry, enough. I'll do your friend's cancer screening, because         I believe in that, but as far as you and I are concerned; it's off. ",9
32210,Jerry,163, Was it pimple popper MD? ,9
32211,Sara,163, That's the one. [Taps Jerry on the cheek and leaves.] ,9
32212,Jerry,163, Still got it. ,9
32213,Elaine,163," Out, damn heal! ",9
32214,Kramer,163, Elaine? ,9
32215,Elaine,163, Kramer? ,9
32216,Kramer,163," Yeah listen, I need my slicer back. ",9
32217,Elaine,163, Just hold on! ,9
32218,Kramer,163," Hey, what's going on? ",9
32219,Elaine,163," Nothing...[heal comes loose and Elaine opens the door.] Here,         ok I'm on the phone alright? I'm on the phone with someone... ",9
32220,Kramer,163," My blade is all dinged up. Oh, come on! Elaine! ",9
32221,Elaine,163, Phone call! I'm in a big phone call! ,9
32222,Kramer,163," Come on, this is important! [Shakes the door handle and it comes         loose. Kramer falls backwards to the next door.] ",9
32223,Neighbor,163," Hey, get the hell out of here! ",9
32224,Kramer,163," Wow, that's a lot of potatoes. ",9
32225,Kramer,163," So, George took my slicer down to Kruger and they're smoothing         it out for me. ",9
32226,Jerry,163, What the hell is this? ,9
32227,Kramer,163," Boy, that looks like an allergic reaction. Have you been wearing         a fake beard? ",9
32228,Jerry,163, No. ,9
32229,Kramer,163," Well, what have you been doing? ",9
32230,Jerry,163," Nothing, I got up, run some errands, I went down to Sara's office         and apologized... ",9
32231,Kramer,163," Whoa whoa, backup, Dr. Sitarides, what happened there? ",9
32232,Jerry,163," Well, I tried to apologise, it didn't go over that well... ",9
32233,Kramer,163," There, there's your hives. ",9
32234,Jerry,163," What, she gave me hives? ",9
32235,Kramer,163," Jerry, as the Bible says; Thou who cureth, can maketh ill. ",9
32236,Jerry,163, She did kind of touch my face. ,9
32237,Kramer,163," Now you listen to me, you've got to find this woman and tell         her that you're not a test tube pin cushion. ",9
32238,Jerry,163," It does itch. Maybe I will go down at Kruger and talk to her.       ",9
32239,Kramer,163," Alright, great, because I got to get down there and pick up my         blade. Hey, and I couldn't find that stock room. ",9
32240,Elaine,163," Oh, that's fantastic. ",9
32241,George,163," I just talked to Mr. Kruger, he'll be down in a minute. He wanted         me to take a photograph for the record. ",9
32242,Sara,163, What record? ,9
32243,George,163," His personal file, I, I don't ask... ",9
32244,Sara,163, Jerry? What brings you here? ,9
32245,Jerry,163," I don't know, this? [Shows his neck to Sara.] ",9
32246,Sara,163, Looks like hives. ,9
32247,Jerry,163, Where do you suppose that could've come from? ,9
32248,George,163," Jerry, what are you doing... ",9
32249,Kramer,163, He is just setting the record straight. ,9
32250,Jerry,163," Come on Sitarides, cop to it. What brand of perverted science         do you practice? ",9
32251,Sara,163, Are you suggesting I somehow I infected you on purpose? ,9
32252,Jerry,163," I want the antidote, pimple popper! ",9
32253,Sara,163," That's it, I'm out of here! You're insane. ",9
32254,Jerry,163, Am I? You touched my face. I didn't imagine that! ,9
32255,George,163," Dr. Sitarides don't go! Oh, thanks Jerry! ",9
32256,Kruger,163," Hey George, hey Doc. We doing the screening here? ",9
32257,George,163," Aah, yeah, yeah. Won't you head on in, we'll be in in a second.         Be right with you. ",9
32258,Kramer,163," Doc, huh? ",9
32259,George,163," Kramer, this is perfect. I need you to go in there, pretend you're         a doctor and check this guy for moles. ",9
32260,Kramer,163," Moles, yes. Freckle's ugly cousin. ",9
32261,George,163," And get a picture of him, with his shirt off. ",9
32262,Kramer,163," You really are cooking up a little scheme here, aren't you? ",9
32263,George,163," Alright, lets get in there. Quick, quick, quick... ",9
32264,Elaine,163, This is it. I can take this anymore. ,9
32265,[She turns the radio on loud (Foghat,163," Slow Ride) and ""dances""         few little kicks.] ",9
32266,Kramer,163," Male mammal. Approximately 30 to 60 years of age. Weight...uh         indeterminate. Ok, Mr. Kruger, we are gonna take a photo now for the records.         So if you'll stand up please and give me a big smile, oh no no no, not         that big. Yeah, that's nice, yes okay. Yes, let's have a looksee...ok,         so eh, fiber from shirt on the left shoulder. I'm gonna have to keep my         on that. ",9
32267,Kruger,163, How long have you been doing this Dr. Van Nostrand? ,9
32268,Kramer,163," Uuh, long long time. Yes, I've seen moles so big they have their         own moles. Freckles that cover two men. ",9
32269,Kruger,163," So, how am I looking? ",9
32270,Kramer,163," Oh, so far, so good...[looks at Mr. Kruger's shoulder] yeuye...       ",9
32271,George,163," Kramer, I really owe you one. ",9
32272,Kramer,163," George, we got a problem. ",9
32273,George,163, What? ,9
32274,Kramer,163," Well, he's got a mole on his shoulder. Very suspicious. ",9
32275,George,163," So, tell him you're concerned about it and he should see someone         else. ",9
32276,Kramer,163," George, why would I, a Juilliard trained dermatologist, send         him to another doctor? ",9
32277,George,163," Because, you're not a dermatologist. ",9
32278,Kramer,163," He thinks I am. I'm not gonna betray that trust. Here's what         I wanna do; I think I can get a section... ",9
32279,George,163," Whoa, whoa, a section?! ",9
32280,Kramer,163," Yeah, if I could crab my slicer and he'd hold still... ",9
32281,George,163," No, you're not taking a deli slicer to my boss... ",9
32282,Kramer,163," It'll be operative thing, he would barely feel it. ",9
32283,George,163, No! Absolutely Not! ,9
32284,Kramer,163," Well, it's my medical opinion, that you're making a big mistake.         And it's going in my chart. ",9
32285,"         [Elaine is on the phone and the radio plays music very loud (Iron Butterfly",163,"         In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida)] ",9
32286,Elaine,163," Yeah, hello is this Allied Lock Smith?! Oh, finally, listen I         need someone to come over here right away! ",9
32287,Neighbor,163, Turn it off! Turn it off! ,9
32288,Elaine,163," I am getting a lock smith, alright?! Relax! ",9
32289,Neighbor,163," Alright, that's it! ",9
32290,Elaine,163," Yeah, the address is 78th West... ",9
32291,Neighbor,163," Oh, oh mama... ",9
32292,Jerry,163," So, Kramer pulled it off? ",9
32293,George,163," Yep, and the photo was all fixed and back on his desk, no thanks         to you. ",9
32294,Jerry,163," Well, that woman had it coming to her. Look at my neck, it looks         like I had a beard of bees! ",9
32295,George,163, Why don't you see someone about it? ,9
32296,Jerry,163," I've called everyone. You know how hard it is to get a dermatologist         in this town? [Kramer comes in] A real dermatologist. ",9
32297,Kramer,163, [Points to a page on the book] Squamous cell carcinoma. ,9
32298,George,163," You're not a doctor. You shouldn't even have books like this.       ",9
32299,Kramer,163," George, that's what he has and I have to give him a call. Now         we gotta came clean. ",9
32300,George,163," You can't tell him the truth, you're gonna blow the whole thing.       ",9
32301,Kramer,163, I don't want this on my conscience. ,9
32302,George,163," I'll get him to see a real doctor. You just stay away from this.       ",9
32303,Kramer,163," Yeah, alright... ",9
32304,Jerry,163," Hey, I wonder if they have a picture of my rash in here. ",9
32305,Kramer,163," They've got everything there, Jerry. I underlined the best parts.       ",9
32306,Jerry,163," Hey, this looks like the thing I have. Caused by exposure to benzene,         a common ingredient in metal cleaners. ",9
32307,Kramer,163," Well, that's weird. ",9
32308,Jerry,163, What are you doing? ,9
32309,Kramer,163," Well, I'm cleaning my slicer. ",9
32310,Jerry,163," That's my hand towel! I use that on my face, hands and chest!         That's where the hives are coming from! It's not from Dr. Sitarides, it's         from Dr. Van Nostrand! ",9
32311,Kramer,163," So, somehow the Bronzo (?) is reacting to the poison she's giving         you. ",9
32312,Jerry,163," Alright, get out. And take your Bronzo with you [throws the bottle         to Kramer.] ",9
32313,Kramer,163," Ohh, that's toxic. [Jerry throws the towel over Kramer's head.]         Ououou.... ",9
32314,Kruger,163," George, come in. I'm just going over our annual report...boy         did we take it on the chin last year. ",9
32315,George,163," Eh, listen Mr. Kruger, I got a message from Dr. Van Nostrand         and he says it might be wise to you to see another doctor about that mole.       ",9
32316,Kruger,163, I'm not too worried about it. ,9
32317,George,163," Well, he said it could be cancer, maybe you should get it checked         out. ",9
32318,Kruger,163," George, take a look at this photo. This is taken 10 years ago.         That mole looks exactly as it does today. So, there's no cause for concern,         eh? ",9
32319,George,163, Whatever. ,9
32320,Kruger,163," Actually, funny thing about this photo. We were at the beach         and there was this dumb looking guy near by. When he went in for a swim,         my sons and I took all his stuff and threw it in the ocean! What a pear         shaped loser. ",9
32321,George,163," Well, that pear shaped loser was me! And I was in that photo,         until I broke in here, stole the photograph and airbrushed myself out         of there! ",9
32322,Kruger,163," Well, I'll be...you have lost a lot of hair. ",9
32323,George,163, That's what they tell me! ,9
32324,Kramer,163, Do you want more pastrami? ,9
32325,Elaine,163," Um, what was that last thing you gave me? That was pretty good.       ",9
32326,Kramer,163," Yeah, it was olive loaf. You want that? ",9
32327,Jerry,163, I can't believe Kruger didn't fire you after all you did. ,9
32328,George,163," He said he didn't care. Oh, God I love that place. Hey, have         you seen other dermatologist? ",9
32329,Jerry,163," Yeah, I finally got to see Dr. Kazarian. He said it was really         bad. ",9
32330,George,163, What did he give you for it. ,9
32331,Jerry,163, Aloe. So where's that lock smith? ,9
32332,George,163, Have to give him time on this hour. ,9

33659,George hangs up the phone,168, That's my toaster. I got to go. Ohhhhhhhhhhhhh!,9
33660,Jerry,168," You know, sometimes I get the feeling George isn't being               completely honest with me.",9

33664,Elaine,168, What are you talking about?,9
33665,Kramer,168," Well, they're hanging from the trees. You know, Newman               found one there yesterday. Man, that guy can climb like a ring-tailed               lemur!",9
33666,Elaine,168, 88th Street? That's where Joe Mayo lives. That's the coat!,9

33669,Newman,168," So, to what do I owe this unusual invitation?",9
33670,Elaine,168," Come in, come in.",9
33671,Newman,168," Ahh! This is very much as I imagined it to be. Aside from               this rattan piece, which seems oddly out of place.",9
33672,Elaine,168," Please, sit down. Newman, um, I wanted to talk to you about               something.",9
33673,Newman,168, This isn't about my opening your mail?,9
33674,Elaine,168, What?,9
33675,Newman,168," Because I don't, never have, anything I read was already               open.",9
33676,Elaine,168," Uh, yeah, uh, no. Newman, uh, I heard that you found a               fur coat in a tree. And, I believe that it belongs to a friend of               mine, and I'd like to give it back to him.",9
33677,Newman,168," Sorry. Climbers, keepers.",9
33678,Elaine,168," You know, Newmie. Um, I know how you feel about me, and               I have to tell you, I'm quite flattered.",9
33679,Newman,168, You are?,9
33680,Elaine,168," Oh, yeah. I mean, of all the men that I know, you're the               only one who's held down a steady job for several years.",9
33681,Newman,168," Well, it's-it's interesting work, I don't mind it.",9
33682,Elaine,168, Ha ha ha ha.,9
33683,Newman,168," Don't you have a-a boyfriend? A, uh, burly, athletic type?",9
33684,Elaine,168," Uh, don't worry, he's cool.",9
33685,Newman,168, Cool?,9
33686,Elaine,168," Very cool. So, what do you say? Can you do this one little               favor, Newmie?",9
33687,Newman,168," Oh, how I've waited for this moment. But alas, my heart               belongs to another man's wife, and I have given the coat to her.",9
33688,Elaine,168," All right, we're done here.",9
33689,Newman,168," For I am in love with Svetlana, and I don't care if the               whole world knows, except for Silvio, who would throw me out of               the apartment, where I would be",9
33690,Elaine,168," Thank you, thank you, thank you very much.",9

33693,Keri,168, Do you still have my lipstick?,9
33694,Jerry,168," Uh, yeah, I think I do. I can never find anything in here.               Ah, here it is. So, that Joe Mayo throws the worst parties, doesn't               he? So what was your job?",9
33695,Keri,168, My job was to keep you away from the music.,9
33696,Jerry,168," What, he doesn't like my taste in music?",9
33697,Keri,168, Guess not.,9
33698,Jerry,168, You should've been there last year. I got jiggy with it!,9
33699,Silvio,168," Kramer! It's Silvio! Open up, I need to talk to you! I               can see you through the reverse peephole.",9

33702,Kramer,168, Huh?,9
33703,Silvio,168," Svetlana says she find it in the laundry room, but I think               it is a gift from that postman agitator. Where is he?",9
33704,Kramer,168," Relax, Silvio.",9
33705,Silvio,168," No, that's it. You're both out of the building!",9
33706,Kramer,168," Oh, come on! Hey, Newman didn't even give her that! No,               that's not even a woman's coat. It's a man's!",9

33711,Silvio,168, Would you?,9
33712,Kramer,168, No.,9
33713,Silvio,168, Then who?,9
33714,Kramer,168, What about Jerry?,9
33715,Silvio,168, Jerry?,9
33716,Kramer,168," Yeah, sure, he's a celebrity. Oh, yeah, they wear a lot               of furs. They're desperate, insecure people.",9
33717,Silvio,168," Yes, you are right. It's all about, me, me, me. Please,               look at me! I am so pretty! Love me! Want me!",9
33718,Kramer,168," Yeah, something like that.",9
33719,Jerry,168, I have to do what?,9
33720,Kramer,168," All you have to do is wear the fur so Silvio thinks it's               yours.",9
33721,Jerry,168, I'm not wearing the fur.,9
33722,Kramer,168," Well, then, Newman and I, we get thrown out of the building.",9
33723,Jerry,168, Is that right?,9
33724,Kramer,168," All right, why don't you just take a good, hard look at               what your life will be like if I'm not around?",9
33725,Jerry,168," Newman, too?",9
33726,Kramer,168," Oh, come on, man! Well, I'll tell you what, if you do this,               I'll give you that walkman you're always asking about.",9
33727,Jerry,168, That's my walkman!,9
33728,Kramer,168, And you'll get it back.,9
33729,Jerry,168, All right.,9
33730,Kramer,168," All right. Good, thanks, I owe you one.",9
33731,George,168, Hey.,9
33732,Kramer,168," Oh, hey, and by the way, uh, that walkman was broke when               you gave it to me.",9
33733,Jerry,168," George, did you get that chair yet?",9
33734,George,168, It gets here when it gets here. Would you stop ridin' me?,9
33735,Jerry,168, You know what? Just call up and cancel it. I'm out.,9
33736,George,168, Excuse me?,9
33737,Jerry,168," Joe Mayo doesn't like my taste in music. He's not gettin'               a gift from me.",9
33738,George,168," Oh, I can't believe you're dropping out, too. So now Kramer               and I have to pay for the entire gift?",9
33739,Kramer,168," Whoa, whoa. Now, who's this Joe Mayo everyone's talking               about?",9
33740,George,168," He's the guy we're the buying the chair for, remember?               It was your suggestion.",9
33741,Kramer,168," I think the chair is a fantastic gift idea. But I never               heard of this Joe Mayo. And frankly, it sounds made up.",9
33742,George,168," Oh, so now I have to buy this whole chair by myself?",9
33743,Jerry,168," No, you don't have to buy anything.",9
33744,George,168," I already bought it! I've been lyin' to you for three days,               and now you're all screwin' me!",9
33745,Jerry,168, I don't understand. Why didn't you tell us you had it?,9
33746,George,168, I needed it! My back is... a little tweaked.,9
33747,Jerry,168, Because of your giant wallet. Just get rid of it!,9
33748,George,168," Never! It is a part of me. I will just return the chair,               and it will be easy, because the receipt is in my good friend.",9
33749,Jerry,168, Your good friend is morbidly obese.,9
33750,George,168," Well, at least, I'm not carrying a purse.",9
33751,Jerry,168, It's not a purse. It's European!,9
33752,Kramer,168," All right, Silvio's down there. He's shoveling the walk.               Now, all you gotta do is put this on, you go down to the corner,               you pick up a paper, and you come",9

33760,Silvio,168, That is your coat?,9
33761,Jerry,168, It sure is.,9
33762,Silvio,168," Kramer says you need it because you're an entertainer and               you're desperate for attention.",9
33763,Jerry,168, That's true.,9
33764,Kramer,168," Jerry, you forgot your purse.",9
33765,Jerry,168," Oh, thanks.",9
33766,Kramer,168," Hey, Silvio, look at Jerry here, prancing around in his               coat with his purse. Yup, he's a dandy. He's a real fancy boy.",9
33767,Jerry,168, Maybe this isn't my coat.,9
33768,Kramer,168," All right, you're not fancy!",9
33769,Silvio,168," No, he's very fancy! Want me, love me! Shower me with kisses!",9
33770,Elaine,168," Jerry, where'd you get it? That's his coat.",9
33771,Jerry,168," No, it's not. It's mine. I'm a fancy boy.",9
33772,Elaine,168," No, that's not your coat.",9

33774,Elaine,168, It's Joe Mayo's coat.,9
33775,Silvio,168, Who's Joe Mayo?,9
33776,Kramer,168, That must be the man that's sleeping with your wife.,9
33777,Jerry,168, Hey! Officer! Someone took my European carryall!,9

33779,Jerry,168," The...black, leather...thing with a strap.",9

33782,Jerry,168," So, Silvio ambushed Joe Mayo?",9
33783,Elaine,168," Yeah, he was waitin' inside his apartment for him with               a sock full of pennies.",9

34506,ELAINE,174," No. A $29,000 piece of cake. Peterman got it at The Duke               Of Windsor auction. It was the most romantic thing I've ever eaten.",9
34507,JERRY,174, How'd it taste?,9
34508,ELAINE,174, A little stale.,9
34509,JERRY,174, Yeah.,9
34510,GEORGE (nudges Elaine with his elbow),174," So, uh are you sleeping               with Peterman?",9
34511,ELAINE (nudges George with her elbow),174," No. He doesn't know I ate               it. In fact, he almost caught me. I have to sneak back in and even               it out.",9
34512,GEORGE,174," You know, they say ostrich has less fat, but you eat more               of it.",9
34513,ELAINE,174," Hey, so I talked to Lisi and she has got a big surprise               for you. She's planning a weekend trip to Pennsylvania Dutch country.",9
34514,JERRY,174," Pennsylvania Dutch country? Oh, that's the serious relationship               weekend place.",9
34515,EALINE,174, What is going on with you two?,9
34516,JERRY,174," Well, I think by sleeping with her, I may have sent her               the wrong message.",9
34517,GEORGE,174, What's that?,9
34518,JERRY,174," Well, I'm calling this off right now. ",9
34519,ELAINE,174," No, no. You are way past the phone call breakup stage.",9
34520,JERRY,174," Well, I'm not going over there. That's where the Lopper               is.",9
34521,ELAINE,174," Oh...it's daylight. It won't take you that long. Just make               a clean break.",9
34522,ELAINE,174, Just a little off the side...,9
34523,ELAINE,174," Well, no point in wasting $1,200.",9
34524,ELAINE (thinking),174," Oh, commander, isn't the wedding marvelous?               More cake? Oh, I shouldn't. I mustn't. Ah, what the hell?",9
34525,GEORGE,174," Now, each of you is here because you're the best at what               you do.",9
34526,GEORGE,174," Slippery Pete, Kramer tells me you are one hell of a rogue               electrician. And shlomo, you're the best truck driver.",9
34527,SHLOMO,174, I don't know If I'm the best.,9
34528,GEORGE,174, Oh...you're very good.,9
34529,SHLOMO,174," Let's say ""good.""",9

34531,KRAMER,174, Lock and load.,9
34532,SLIPPERY PETE,174," You think you can handle that, numb nuts?",9
34533,KRAMER,174," All right, all right, come on, now.",9
34534,SLIPPERY PETE,174, That was my mail-order bride.,9
34535,KRAMER,174," Hey, you weren't home, so I signed for her.",9
34536,SLIPPERY PETE,174, It doesn't give you the right to make out with her.,9
34537,KRAMER,174, You weren't even married yet.,9
34538,GEORGE,174," All right, all right, calm down, calm down. Whatever happened               in the past is past.",9
34539,GEORGE,174," Now, this is the basic layout for Mario's Pizza.",9
34540,SHLOMO,174, So what kind of jail time are we looking at if we're caught?,9
34541,GEORGE,174, What do you mean?,9
34542,SLIPPERY PETE,174," We're stealing this thing, right?",9
34543,GEORGE,174, No. I--I paid for it.,9
34544,SLIPPERY PETE,174, I thought we were stealing it.,9
34545,KRAMER,174, Yeah. It feels like we're stealing it.,9
34546,GEORGE,174, We're not stealing it.,9
34547,SHLOMO,174, I definitely thought we're stealing it.,9
34548,GEORGE,174," All right, let's--let's focus. Can we get back to the plan?",9
34549,SLIPPERY PETE,174," Well, I need a battery for this kind of a job. Can               I at least steal a battery?",9
34550,GEORGE,174," Fine. Steal the battery. Now, all right, here is the Frogger.               This is the front door, and this is the outlet.",9
34551,SLIPPERY PETE,174, What's that?,9
34552,GEORGE,174, The outlet?,9
34553,SLIPPERY PETE,174, Mm-hmm.,9
34554,GEORGE,174, That's where the electricity comes out.,9
34555,SLIPPERT PETE,174," Oh, you mean the holes.",9

34561,SLIPPERY PETE,174, Where are all the pizza ovens?,9
34562,SHLOMO,174, I thought the bathroom was here.,9
34563,GEORGE,174, All right. You understand now? It's not that complicated.,9
34564,ELAINE,174,I need to replace an antique piece of cake.,9
34565,ELAINE,174," Do you have anything that's been...you know, laying around               for a while? Something prewar would be just great.",9
34566,KRAMER,174," Oh, hey, Elaine. What, you got the munchies?",9
34567,ELAINE,174," Oh, Kramer, I am in big. big, big trouble. I need a cake               that looks like this.",9
34568,KRAMER,174," Oh, yeah--Sotheby's. Yeah. They make good cake.",9
34569,ELAINE,174, Do any of these look close?,9
34570,KRAMER,174," No, but I know I've seen cake just like that. Oh--Entenmann's.               Yeah.",9
34571,ELAINE,174, Entenmann's? From the supermarket?,9

34573,JERRY,174," Hi, Lisi.",9
34574,LISI,174," Hi, honey. Is that a bat? ",9
34575,JERRY,174," Uh, yeah. I found it on the street. It's gotta be worth               something.",9
34576,LISI,174," So, what do you want to do, Sweetheart?",9
34577,JERRY,174," Well, before we do anything...maybe we should talk.",9
34578,MONTAGE,174,,9
34579,JERRY,174," Then this Pennsylvania Dutch thing comes out of nowhere.               I mean, how am I supposed to respond to that?",9
34580,LISI,174, Then may I say something... without being interrupted?,9
34581,JERRY,174," Well I'm sorry if I ruined your life. That's exactly what               I set out to do.",9
34582,LISI,174, Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Mm-hmm. Uh-huh...,9
34583,LISI,174, Are you afraid to kiss me in public?,9

34650,EALINE,174, Ohh...,9

34757,JERRY,175, She's not a maid. She might be a news woman!,9
34758,KRAMER,175," Hey. Well, I just saw Madeline off. Yeah. She's in a cab               and--nguh nguh nguh--on her way. I miss her already.",9

34774,PHONE MAN,175," Look, I work for the phone company. I've had a lot of               experience with semantics, so don't try to lure me into some maze               of circular logic.",9

34802,MAN,175, What area? New Jersey?,9
34803,ELAINE,175," No, no. It's right here in the city. It's the same as 212.               They just multiplied it by 3, and then they added one to the middle               number. It's the same.",9

34848,JERRY,175,40,9
34849,GEORGE,175," 40? I'm payin' 60 to my maid. She doesn't do laundry and               I'm gettin' nothin'. All right. Once she pinched my ass, but I don't               know what that was.",9

34852,JERRY,175, Ooh.,9
34853,KRAMER,175," Jerry, you wouldn't believe what it's like down there.               Taxicab drivers are insane. You know, everybody is in a hurry.",9

34897,GEORGE,175, Really? Coco?,9
34898,CINDY,175, Yeah. Coco. That girl's all right.,9
34899,GEORGE,175," You know, if I could get this Coco woman down to Kruger,               they wouldn't be able to call me Koko anymore because Kruger would               never allow 2 Kokos.",9
34900,JERRY,175, Sounds like he runs a real tight ship.,9
34901,GEORGE,175, Say good-bye to Koko.,9
34902,JERRY,175," Good-bye, Koko.",9
34903,KRAMER,175," Bye, Koko. Whew! Jerry, this relationship is killing me.               The distance, the longing, the distance, the-- you know, I didn't               realize it, but I'm a needy person.",9
34904,JERRY,175," Kramer, maybe this relationship isn't for you.",9
34905,KRAMER,175," Oh, yeah? So what am I supposed to do, be more like you?               All sealed up in here, emotionally unavailable, paying scrubwomen               for sexual favors! No! Jerry, I won't be like you! Never! I'll never               be like you! ",9
34906,CINDY,175, What was that?,9
34907,JERRY,175, I didn't hear anything.,9
34908,CINDY,175," All right, I'm takin' off. Aren't you forgetting something?",9

34910,CINDY,175, No. My money.,9
34911,JERRY,175, For what?,9
34912,CINDY,175, For my maid services. You booked me for today.,9
34913,JERRY,175, But you didn't really do any work.,9
34914,CINDY,175, I made the bed.,9
34915,JERRY,175, But you took a nap in it.,9
34916,CINDY,175, So?,9
34917,JERRY,175, I thought that was kind of girlfriend bed making.,9
34918,CINDY,175, No. That was the maid.,9
34919,JERRY,175," Well, who took the nap?",9
34920,CINDY,175, The girlfriend.,9
34921,JERRY,175, $40 seems kind of steep for a nap.,9

34923,JERRY,175," Ho, ho...ho! Hold on. Let's keep this sophisticated.",9
34924,CINDY,175," You know, I don't think I want to be your girlfriend or               your maid.",9
34925,JERRY,175, So is this a breakup/quitting?,9
34926,CINDY,175, Yeah. Don't ever call me or hire me again.,9

35458,George,179, It's a talent I have.,9
35459,Kimbrough,179," Why don't we sit down, glad you're here.",9
35460,George,179," Woo! Some day out there - You ever see weather like that? Woo! It's crisp -        it's crispy crisp.",9
35461,Jerry,179," Shut up, George.",9
35462,Kimbrough,179, Can I get you anything?,9
35463,George,179, What do we have in the fruit department?,9
35464,Jerry,179, Oy.,9
35465,Stu ,179, Pineapple.,9
35466,George,179," Oh, that's a dangerous fruit. It's like a weapon that thing, got spikes on the        end. You can get killed from ",9
35467,Kimbrough,179," Anyway, let me tell you why I called. When I took over here last month, I        reviewed what was in development,and it was pretty much same old, same old.",9
35468,George,179," Been there, done that.",9
35469,Kimbrough,179," Right. I was looking for something different. Something that would have        people talking at the water coolers.",9
35470,George,179, Water coolers?,9
35471,Crespi,179, We call it a water-cooler show.,9
35472,Jerry,179," Because the next day in the offices, people gather around the water coolers to        talk about it, right?",9
35473,George,179," See, I think people would talk about it at the coffee machines.",9
35474,Jerry,179," Well it's probably just easier to say ""water cooler show"" than        ""coffee machine show.""",9
35475,George,179," It's really not accurate. Nobody drinks from a water cooler any more - they use        bottles.",9
35476,Jerry,179, But I think Mr. Kimbrough makes a good point.,9
35477,Kimbrough,179," Anyway, Stu here started telling me about a show, ""Jerry"", that he        developed five years ago.",9
35478,Stu,179, I have always loved it.,9
35479,Kimbrough,179," He said it was a show about nothing. So, I saw the pilot and I've got to        tell you - I flipped out.",9
35480,Crespi,179, He totally flipped out.,9
35481,Kimbrough,179," What I want to do is put it on the air. 13-episode commitment. Start it off        on Wednesday night, build up an",9
35482,Jerry,179, He's a little off the wall.,9
35483,Crespi,179, Oh yeah.,9
35484,Stu,179, Kramer.,9
35485,Kimbrough,179, And Elaine - I wouldn't mind seeing something happening between you two.,9
35486,Jerry,179, Definitely.,9
35487,George,179," I tell you, I really don't think so-called relationship humor is what this show        is all about.",9
35488,Kimbrough,179," Or we could not do the show altogether, how about that?",9
35489,George,179, Or we could get them together. Woo!,9
35490,George,179, Yeah!,9
35491,Jerry,179, Yeah!,9
35492,Elaine,179," Jill, hi, it's Elaine. Well, I'm calling from my home. Indoors. Well, I was        just calling to see how your fa.. ",9
35493,Jerry,179," Hi. Elaine, it's me.",9
35494,Elaine,179," Jerry, I'm on the other line.",9
35495,Jerry,179, No no - this is an emergency - get off the phone.,9
35496,Elaine,179," I'm sorry, Jill. I'm going to have to take this call. Jerry, what's the        emergency?",9
35497,Jerry,179," The ""Jerry""'s back on - the TV show! George and I are moving to        California!",9
35498,Elaine,179, That's the emergency?,9
35499,Jerry,179, Did you hear what I said?,9
35500,Elaine,179, I was on the other line talking to Jill.,9
35501,Jerry,179," Jill? Well, why didn't you say so?",9
35502,Elaine,179, You said it was an emergency.,9
35503,Jerry,179," So now she's lost a phone face-off? That's even worse than your cell phone        walk-and-talk.",9
35504,Helen,179," Congratulations, they're doing the show.",9
35505,Morty,179," They should have put that show on 5 years ago. Bunch of idiots at that network.        Can I tell you something, Jerry? It's all crap on TV. The only thing I watch is Xena the        Warrior Princess. She must be about six-six.",9
35506,Helen,179, She's not six-six.,9
35507,Morty,179," Jerry, you ever watch that?",9
35508,Jerry,179," Yeah, it's pretty good.",9
35509,Estelle,179, They picked up the show?,9
35510,George,179, I'm moving to California.,9
35511,Frank,179," Oh baby-doll, this kid's going places, I told you.",9
35512,Estelle,179, The NBC guy liked it?,9
35513,George,179, Of course he liked it.,9
35514,Estelle,179, He told you he liked it?,9
35515,George,179, He wouldn't put it on if he didn't like it.,9
35516,Estelle,179," Well, what are you doing?",9
35517,George,179, I'm writing.,9
35518,Estelle,179, You know how to write?,9
35519,Frank,179," Without the writing, you have nothing. You're the ones that make them look good.",9
35520,Estelle,179, Since when do you know how to write? I never saw you write anything.,9
35521,George,179, Ma?!,9
35522,Estelle,179," I don't know how you're going to write all those shows. And where are you get        all the ideas?",9
35523,Frank,179, Would you leave him alone? You'll shatter his confidence!,9
35524,George,179, I don't need any ideas. It's a show about nothing.,9
35525,Estelle,179," Nothing. Please. I'll tell you the truth - the whole thing sounds pretty        stupid to me.",9
35526,Jerry,179," NBC is letting me use their private jet? And I can go anywhere I want? That's        fantastic! Thanks. Great. ",9
35527,Kramer,179, Oh hey!,9
35528,Jerry,179, Hey - how was the beach?,9
35529,Kramer,179," Oh, you missed it, buddy - lot of femininas - some major femininas",9
35530,Jerry,179, I had a little meeting today at NBC. What are you doing?,9
35531,Kramer,179," You know, I went swimming and I can't get this water out of my ear.",9
35532,Jerry,179," So do you remember five years ago, we did that pilot, ""Jerry""? Well,        the new guy at NBC wants to do it. ",9
35533,Kramer,179, You're moving to California?,9
35534,Jerry,179," Yeah, only for a while.",9
35535,Kramer,179," Yeah, but Jerry, what happens if the show's a hit? You could be out there for        years! You might never come",9
35536,Jerry,179," No, I'll be back.",9
35537,Kramer,179," Jerry. It's L.A. Nobody leaves. She's a seductress, she's a siren, she's a        virgin, she's a whore.",9
35538,Jerry,179," And my agent said as a bonus, I can use their private jet, so we'll all go        somewhere - the four of us, one big fling before George and I go to California.",9
35539,Kramer,179, Fling!,9
35540,Elaine,179, So we can go anywhere we want?,9
35541,Jerry,179, Anywhere.,9
35542,Elaine,179, Why are they doing this?,9
35543,Jerry,179," I think they want to make it up to us cause they let this thing sit on their        shelf for five years.",9
35544,Elaine,179, This is all very exciting.,9
35545,George,179, So? Where are we going?,9
35546,Kramer,179, I say Japan.,9
35547,Elaine,179, Why Japan?,9
35548,Kramer,179," Oh - geishas - they cater to your every whim. They're shy at first, but they're        quite skilled at conversation. They can discuss anything from world affairs to the fine        art of fishing - or baking.",9
35549,Elaine,179, Oh - I got it - how about Russia?,9
35550,Jerry,179," Russia, it's so bleak.",9
35551,Elaine,179, It's not bleak - it's springtime.,9
35552,Jerry,179, It's still bleak.,9
35553,Elaine,179, You can't be bleak in spring.,9
35554,Jerry,179, You can be bleak in spring.,9
35555,George,179," If you're bleak, you're bleak.",9
35556,Elaine,179, What about Switzerland?,9
35557,Kramer,179," Oh - Switzerland - the Von Trapp family, huh?",9
35558,George,179, It's a bit hilly - no?,9
35559,Elaine,179, You're not going to do any walking.,9
35560,George,179, What if I want to walk around a little?,9
35561,Elaine,179, So then you'll walk down the hill and we'll pick you up.,9
35562,George,179, What if I'm at the bottom?,9
35563,Elaine,179," All right! You know what, just forget it!",9
35564,Jerry,179," Alright - come on - come on now, people. Let's face it, we're not all going to        agree on anything. ",9
35565,Elaine,179, I'll go to Paris.,9
35566,George,179, Me too.,9
35567,Kramer,179, Oh yeah - oui oui.,9
35568,Jerry,179," So that's it - it's settled, we're going to Paris.",9
35569,Group,179, Yeah!,9
35570,Elaine,179," Hey. NBC limo is downstairs - beep beep beep. {NBC tune} I'm just going to call        Jill one more time before we go.",9
35571,Jerry,179," Wait, you can't make a call like that on your way out. You can't rush that        conversation.",9
35572,Elaine,179," Well, I can't call from the limo. Can I call from the plane?",9
35573,Jerry,179," First you make a cell-phone walk-and-talk, then she loses a call-waiting        face-off, now you're talking about",9
35574,Elaine,179," All right, I'll just have to call her from Paris.",9
35575,Newman,179," Hello, Jerry.",9
35576,Jerry,179," Hello, Newman. What gives?",9
35577,Newman,179," I was speaking earlier with Kramer and he mentioned something about a private        jet to Paris?",9
35578,Jerry,179," Yeah, that's right.",9
35579,Newman,179," Well, I hear it's quite beautiful there this time of year, and of course you        know I'm one-quarter French.",9
35580,Jerry,179, Really.,9
35581,Newman,179," Oh yes, in fact I still have family there. This probably won't interest you,        but I have a cousin there who's suffering very badly. She's lost all use of her muscles.        She can only communicate by blinking. I would so love to see her - bring a ray of sunshine        into her tragic life. But alas, I can't afford it, for I am, as you know, but a simple        postal worker.",9
35582,Jerry,179, That's a shame.,9
35583,Newman,179, Take me! Take me!,9
35584,Jerry,179," Oh, forget it. Pull yourself together. You're making me sick. Be a man!",9
35585,Newman,179," All right! But hear me and hear me well - The day will come. Oh yes, mark my        words, Seinfeld - your day of ",9
35586,Captain,179," Ah, Jerry?",9
35587,Jerry,179, Yeah.,9
35588,Captain,179," I'm Captain Maddox this is my co-pilot, Kurt Adams. Ready to go to Paris?",9
35589,Jerry,179, All set. We'll just grab the bags.,9
35590,Captain,179, Don't worry about that. We'll take care of them for you.,9
35591,Jerry,179, Just keeps on getting better and better.,9
35592,Jerry,179, Not bad.,9
35593,Elaine,179, Wow!,9
35594,Kramer,179, The only way to fly.,9
35595,George,179, This is it?,9
35596,George,179," I'm sorry - I have to say, I'm a little disappointed, I thought it would be a        lot nicer.",9
35597,Jerry,179, You're complaining about a private jet?,9
35598,George,179, You think this is the plane that Ted Danson gets?,9
35599,Jerry,179, Ted Danson is not even on the network anymore.,9
35600,George,179," Still, I bet when they gave him a plane, it was a lot nicer than this one.",9
35601,Elaine,179, Will you shut up? You are ruining the whole trip.,9
35602,George,179," This is a real piece of junk. I don't even feel safe on this thing. I have a        good mind to write a letter toMr. Kimbrough.",9
35603,Jerry,179, You're not writing any letters!,9
35604,Elaine,179, Will you turn around?,9
35605,George,179, Why?,9
35606,Elaine,179, You are annoying me sitting like that. It's effeminate.,9
35607,George,179, It's effeminate to sit like this? ,9
35608,Elaine,179," Yes, I think it's a little effeminate.",9
35609,George,179, How is this effeminate?,9
35610,Elaine,179, I don't know - it just is.,9
35611,George,179," Kramer, what are you doing?",9
35612,Jerry,179, Still got water in your ear?,9
35613,Kramer,179, Can't get rid of it. Maybe it leaked inside my brain.,9
35614,George,179, Would you stop that? It's not safe to be jumping up and down on a plane.,9
35615,Kramer,179," I got to get it out, I can't take this anymore.",9
35616,George,179," Kramer, don't be fooling around up here.",9
35617,George,179, Kramer!,9
35618,Captain,179," Hey, get the hell out of here!",9
35619,Elaine,179, What is that?,9
35620,George,179, Oh my God!,9
35621,Elaine,179, What is that noise? What is that noise?,9
35622,Jerry,179," Kramer, what the hell did you do?",9
35623,Kramer,179, I lost my balance.,9
35624,Elaine,179, Oh my God!,9
35625,Elaine,179, What's going on?,9
35626,Jerry,179, Kramer!,9
35627,Kramer,179, It was an accident.,9
35628,George,179, I told you to stop with the hopping.,9
35629,Elaine,179," Oh my God, we're going down. We're going to die!",9
35630,George,179, Just when I was doing great. I told you God wouldn't let me be successful.,9
35631,Jerry,179, Is this it? Is this how it ends? It can't- it can't end like this.,9
35632,Kramer,179, I'm ready! I'm ready! Glory hallelujah!,9
35633,George,179, Jerry? Jerry can you hear me?,9
35634,Jerry,179, Yeah.,9
35635,George,179, There's something I have to tell you.,9
35636,Jerry,179, What? What is it?,9
35637,George,179, I cheated in the contest.,9
35638,Elaine,179, What?,9
35639,Jerry,179, What?,9
35640,George,179, The contest - I cheated.,9
35641,Jerry,179, Why?,9
35642,George,179, Because I'm a cheater! I had to tell you.,9
35643,Jerry,179, Great - I won.,9
35644,Elaine,179," Jerry, I gotta tell you something too.",9
35645,Jerry,179," Yeah, Elaine I got something I want to say to you.",9
35646,Elaine,179, No no - me first.,9
35647,Jerry,179, Alright.,9
35648,Elaine,179," Jerry, I've always loved ..u..",9
35649,George,179, Hey - What's going on?,9
35650,Kramer,179, We're straightening out!,9
35651,Elaine,179, We're straightening out?,9
35652,Jerry,179, We're straightening out!,9
35653,George,179, We're straightening out!,9
35654,Group,179, Yeah!,9
35655,Captain,179," Well, again, sorry about that little mishap. But once you get everything        checked out there shouldn't be anymore problems.",9
35656,Jerry,179, Where are we?,9
35657,Captain,179," Latham, Massachusetts. Why don't you take a cab into town, get yourself        something to eat. I got your beeper number - I'll beep you as soon as we're ready.",9
35658,Jerry,179, Okay.,9
35659,Elaine,179, Okay.,9
35660,Jerry,179, We'll see you later.,9
35661,Elaine,179," Well, what are we going to do about Paris? I mean are we actually going to get        back on this plane?",9
35662,Jerry,179," I say we go back to New York, and take a regular flight.",9
35663,George,179," I'm not getting on a regular plane now - I'm all psyched up to go on a private        jet. No way I'm getting on a regular plane.",9
35664,Elaine,179," Well, I'm sure that they would fly us first class.",9
35665,George,179," First class doesn't make it anymore. Now you get on the phone with Kimbrough,        tell him what happened and tell him to get another plane down here, but this time, the        good one - the Ted Danson plane.",9
35666,Jerry,179," Alright, I'll feel him out.",9
35667,George,179," Yeah, just tell him to hurry it up.",9
35668,Stranger,179, Nice day.,9
35669,Jerry,179, Another one?,9
35670,Robber,179," Alright fatso, out of the car.",9
35671,Kramer,179, I want to capture this.,9
35672,Robber,179, Come on! Gimme your wallet.,9
35673,Victim,179, Don't shoot.,9
35674,Jerry,179," Well, there goes the money for the lipo.",9
35675,Elaine,179," See, the great thing about robbing a fat guy is it's an easy getaway. You know?        They can't really chase ya!",9
35676,George,179, He's actually doing him a favor. It's less money for him to buy food.,9
35677,Robber,179," I want your wallet. Come on. Come on, come on.",9
35678,Jerry,179," That's a shame. Alright, I'm gonna call NBC.",9
35679,Victim,179," Officer, he's stealing my car! Officer, I was carjacked. I was held up at        gunpoint! He took my wallet, everything!",9
35680,Jerry,179," Okay, thanks anyway. They can't get another plane.",9
35681,Kramer,179," All right, what's wrong with the plane we got? They're just checking it out.",9
35682,Elaine,179, Forget it.,9
35683,Jerry,179," No, no, no. We're not getting on there. Come on, let's go get something to eat        in Sticksville.",9
35684,Officer,179," All right, hold it right there.",9
35685,Kramer,179, What?,9
35686,Officer,179, You're under arrest.,9
35687,Jerry,179, Under arrest? What for?,9
35688,Officer,179, Article 223-7 of the Latham County Penal Code.,9
35689,Elaine,179," What? No, no - we didn't do anything.",9
35690,Officer,179, It's new. It's called the Good Samaritan Law. Let's go.,9
35691,Elaine,179, The Good Samaritan Law? Are they crazy?,9
35692,George,179, Why would we want to help somebody?,9
35693,Elaine,179, I know.,9
35694,George,179, That's what nuns and Red Cross workers are for.,9
35695,Kramer,179, The Samaritans were an ancient tribe - very helpful to people.,9
35696,Elaine,179," Alright - um, excuse me, hi, could you tell me what kind of law this is.",9
35697,Deputy,179," Well, they just passed it last year. It's modeled after the French law. I heard        about it after Princess Diana was killed and all those photographers were just standing        around.",9
35698,Jerry,179," Oh, yeah.",9
35699,Elaine,179," Oh, yeah.",9
35700,Deputy,179," You're the first ones to be arrested on it, probably in the whole country.",9
35701,George,179," All right, so what's the penalty here? Let's just pay the fine or something and        get the hell out of here.",9
35702,Deputy,179," Well, it's not that easy. Now see, the law calls for a maximum fine of $85,000        and as much as five years in prison.",9
35703,Elaine,179, What?,9
35704,George,179," Oh no no no no - we have to be in California next week. We're starting a TV        show.",9
35705,Deputy,179," California? Oh gosh, I don't think so. Yeah, my guess is you're gonna be        prosecuted. Better get yourselves a good lawyer.",9
35706,Chiles,179," Who told you to put the cheese on? Did I tell you to put the cheese on? I        didn't tell you to put the cheese on.",9
35707,Secretary,179, Jerry Seinfeld on the phone.,9
35708,Chiles,179," You people with the cheese. It never ends. Hello? Uh huh. Uh huh. Uh huh. Good        Samaritan Law? I never heard of it. You don't have to help anybody. That's what this        country's all about. That's deplorable, unfathomable, improbable. Hold on. Suzie, cancel        my appointment with Dr. Bison. And pack a bag for me.

You're going to walk into        that courtroom, and the jury's going to see a mean, nasty, evil George Costanza. I want        them to see Perry Como. No one's going to convict Perry Como.

Now, essentially, we made it a crime to ignore a fellow human        being in trouble. Now this group from New York not only ignored, but, as we will prove,        they actually mocked the victim as he was being robbed at gunpoint. I can guarantee you        one other thing, ladies and gentlemen, this is not the first time they have behaved in        this manner. On the contrary, they have quite a record of mocking and maligning. This is a        history of selfishness, self-absorption, immaturity, and greed. And you will see how        everyone who has come into contact with these four individuals has been abused, wronged,        deceived and betrayed. This time, they have gone too far.

You know what these four people were? They were        innocentbystanders. Now, you just think about that term. Innocent. Bystanders. Because        that's exactly what they were. We know theywere bystanders, nobody's disputing that. So        how can a bystander be guilty? No such thing. Have you ever heard of a guilty bystander?        No, because you cannot be a bystander and be guilty. Bystanders are by definition,        innocent. That is the nature of bystanding. But no, they want to change nature here. They        want to create a whole new animal - the guilty bystander. Don't you let them do it. Only        you can stop them.",9

35954,Hoyt,179, How did she try to kill you?,9
35955,Pitt,179, She tried to smother me with a pillow.,9
35956,Hoyt,179, Call Yev Kassem to the stand.,9
35957,Bailiff,179, Call Yev Kassem.,9
35958,Jerry,179, Who?,9
35959,Elaine,179, The Soup Nazi!,9
35960,Chiles,179, Soup Nazi? You people have a little pet name for everybody.,9
35961,Hoyt,179, State your name.,9
35962,Soup Nazi,179, Yev Kassem.,9
35963,Hoyt,179, Could you spell that?,9
35964,Soup Nazi,179, No! Next question.,9
35965,Hoyt,179, How do you know the defendants?,9
35966,Soup Nazi,179, They used to come to my restaurant.,9
35967,George,179, Medium turkey chili.,9
35968,Jerry,179, Medium crab bisque.,9
35969,George,179, I didn't get any bread.,9
35970,Jerry,179, Just forget it. Let it go.,9
35971,George,179," Um, excuse me, I think you forgot my bread.",9
35972,Soup Nazi,179, You want bread?,9
35973,George,179," Yes, please.",9
35974,Soup Nazi,179, Three dollars!,9
35975,George,179, What?,9
35976,Soup Nazi,179, No soup for you!,9
35977,Soup Nazi,179," But the idiot clowns did not know how to order. I banned that one - the        woman - for a year. Then one day, ",9
35978,Elaine,179," Five cups chopped porcini mushrooms. Half a cup of olive oil. Three pounds        celery.",9
35979,Soup Nazi,179, That's my recipe for wild mushroom.,9
35980,Elaine,179," You're through, Soup Nazi. Pack it up. No more soup for you. Next!",9
35981,Soup Nazi,179," She published my recipes. I had to close the store, move to Argentina. She        ruined my business!",9
35982,Elaine,179, Soup's not all that good anyway.,9
35983,Soup Nazi,179, What did you say?!,9
35984,Hoyt,179, The state calls Mr. Babu Bhatt to the stand.,9
35985,Jerry,179, How did they find Babu?,9
35986,Elaine,179, I thought he was deported.,9
35987,Hoyt,179," You came a long way to be here today, haven't you?",9
35988,Babu,179," Yes, all the way from Pakistan.",9
35989,Hoyt,179, And what's your connection to the defendant?,9
35990,Babu,179," I owned a restaurant. Seinfeld told me to change the menu to Pakistani. But        nobody came! There were no people.",9
35991,Hoyt,179, And then what happened?,9
35992,Babu,179," Then, he got me an apartment in his building. But they mixed up the mail. And I        never got my immigration renewal papers. So they deported me. It's all his fault. Him. And        the woman. But they did not care. They're totally indifferent. All they do is mock me,        just like they did the fat fellow. All the time. Mocking, mocking, mocking, mocking,        mocking. All the time! Now it is Babu's turn to mock. Finally I will have some justice.        Send them away! Send them all away! Lock them up forever! They are not human. Very bad!        Very, very, very bad!",9
35993,Rivera,179," Hi everybody, I'm Geraldo Rivera and welcome to this special edition of Rivera        Live. Well, arguments in the ",9
35994,Wells,179," Geraldo, just a few minutes ago, the jury asked to see the video tape.",9
35995,Rivera,179," That's the one where they are overheard making sarcastic remarks during the        robbery.",9
35996,Wells,179," Yes, it's a very incriminating piece of evidence. But I must tell you, Geraldo,        this courtroom and everyone who has attended this trial is still reeling from the endless        parade of witness who have come forth so enthusiastically to testify against these four        seemingly ordinary people. One even had the feeling that if Judge Vandelay didn't finally        put a stop to it, it could've gone on for months.",9
35997,Rivera,179," Jane, whose testimony do you think resonated most strongly with this jury?",9
35998,Wells,179," That is so hard to say. Certainly there's the doctor with the poison        invitations. The Bubble Boy was an extremely sympathetic and tragic figure. And that        bizarre contest certainly didn't sit well with this small town jury.There's the woman they        sold the defective wheelchair to, the deported Pakistani restaurateur. Geraldo, it just        went on, ",9
35999,Rivera,179, And so we wait.,9
36000,Jerry,179, Do they make you wear uniforms in prison?,9
36001,Elaine,179, I think so.,9
36002,Jerry,179, It's not that bright orange one is it?,9
36003,Elaine,179," I hope it's not that one, because I cannot wear orange.",9
36004,Kramer,179," Will you stop worrying? Jackie's going to get us off. He never loses. How about        when he asked that cop ",9
36005,Estelle,179," Sorry to bother you, Judge.",9
36006,Vandelay,179, How did you get in here?,9
36007,Estelle,179," Please, if he's found guilty, please be kind to him. He's a good boy.",9
36008,Vandelay,179, This is highly irregular.,9
36009,Estelle,179," Well, maybe there's something I can do for you.",9
36010,Vandelay,179, What do you mean?,9
36011,Estelle,179, You know,9
36012,Sidra,179," Oh, Jackie, you're so articulate.",9
36013,Jackie,179," We have plenty of time, too. This jury could be out for days.",9
36014,Jackie,179, Hello? Damn. They're ready.,9
36015,Jerry,179," Hey Elaine, what was it you were about to say to me on the plane when it was        going down?",9
36016,Elaine,179, I've always loved ... United Airlines.,9
36017,Kramer,179, I think it's going to be okay - that girl just smiled at me.,9
36018,Jerry,179, Maybe because she knows you're going to jail.,9
36019,Bailiff,179, All rise.,9
36020,Vandelay,179," Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, have you reached a verdict?",9
36021,Foreman,179," We have, Your Honor.",9
36022,Vandelay,179," Will the defendants please rise. And how do you find, with respect to the        charge of criminal indifference?",9
36023,Foreman,179, We find the defendants - guilty.,9
36024,Vandelay,179," Order! Order in this court, I will clear this room! I do not know how, or        under what circumstances the four of you found each other, but your callous indifference        and utter disregard for everything that is good and decent has rocked the very foundation        upon which our society is built. I can think of nothing more fitting than for the four of        youto spend a year removed from society so that you can contemplate the manner in which        you have conducted yourselves. ",9
36025,George,179, You had to hop! You had to hop on the plane.,9
36026,Elaine,179," Puddy, don't wait for me.",9
36027,Puddy,179, Alright.,9
36028,Frank,179, We gotta get out of here. We want to beat the traffic.,9
36029,Sidra,179," Come on, Jackie. Let's go.",9

36032,Jerry,179," Well, it's only a year. That's not so bad. We'll be out in a year, and then        we'll be back",9
36033,Kramer,179," Could be fun. Don't have to worry about your meals, or what you're going to do        Saturday night. And they do shows. Yeah, we could put on a show - maybe ""Bye Bye        Birdie"" or ""My Fair Lady"". Elaine, you could be Liza Doolittle.",9
36034,Elaine,179, Why don't you just blow it out your...,9
36035,Elaine,179," If I call Jill from prison, do you think that would make up for the other ones?",9
36036,Jerry,179, Sure.,9
36037,Elaine,179, Cause you only get one call. The prison call is like the king of calls.,9
36038,Jerry,179, I think that would be a very nice gesture.,9
36039,Kramer,179," I got it - it's out! How about that, huh? Oh, boy, what a relief.",9
36040,Jerry,179," See now, to me, that button is in the worst possible spot.",9
36041,George,179, Really?,9
36042,Jerry,179," Oh yeah. The second button is the key button. It literally makes or breaks the        shirt. Look at it, it's ",9
36043,George,179, Haven't we had this conversation before?,9
36044,Jerry,179, You think?,9

36048,Prisoner 1,179, I am.,9

36054,Prisoner 3,179, You suck - I'm gonna cut you.,9
36055,Jerry,179," Hey, I don't come down to where you work, and knock the license plate out of        your hand.",9
36056,Guard,179," Alright, Seinfeld, that's it. Let's go. Come on.",9
36057,Jerry,179," Alright, hey, you've been great! See you in the cafeteria.",9
36058,Jerry,180," It seems like whenever these office people call you in for a meeting,         the whole thing is about the sitting down. I would really like to sit         down with you. I think we need to sit down and talk. Why don't you come         in, and we'll sit down. Well, sometimes the sitting down doesn't work.         People get mad at the sitting.You know, we've been sitting here for I         don't know how long. How much longer are we just going to sit here? I'll         tell you what I think we should do. I think we should all sleep on it.         Maybe we're not getting down low enough. Maybe if we all lie down, then         our brains will work.",9
36059,George,180," I can't eat this without catsup. Would it kill her to check up on us? Would        that be a terrible thing? ""How's everything? Do you need anything? What can I do for        you?""",9
36060,Jerry,180, I know what you mean.,9

36075,Jerry,180, Did you shower today?,9
36076,George,180, Yeah.,9
36077,Jerry,180, That's usually the kind of mood I'm in when I haven't showered.,9

36198,Stu,180, Kramer.,9
36199,Kimbrough,180, And Elaine - I wouldn't mind seeing something happening between you two.,9
36200,Jerry,180, Definitely.,9
36201,George,180," I tell you, I really don't think so-called relationship humor is what this show        is all about.",9
36202,Kimbrough,180," Or we could not do the show altogether, how about that?",9
36203,George,180, Or we could get them together. Woo!,9
36204,George,180, Yeah!,9
36205,Jerry,180, Yeah!,9
36206,Elaine,180," Jill, hi, it's Elaine. Well, I'm calling from my home. Indoors. Well, I was        just calling to see how your fa.. ",9
36207,Jerry,180," Hi. Elaine, it's me.",9
36208,Elaine,180," Jerry, I'm on the other line.",9
36209,Jerry,180, No no - this is an emergency - get off the phone.,9
36210,Elaine,180," I'm sorry, Jill. I'm going to have to take this call. Jerry, what's the        emergency?",9
36211,Jerry,180," The ""Jerry""'s back on - the TV show! George and I are moving to        California!",9
36212,Elaine,180, That's the emergency?,9
36213,Jerry,180, Did you hear what I said?,9
36214,Elaine,180, I was on the other line talking to Jill.,9
36215,Jerry,180," Jill? Well, why didn't you say so?",9
36216,Elaine,180, You said it was an emergency.,9
36217,Jerry,180," So now she's lost a phone face-off? That's even worse than your cell phone        walk-and-talk.",9
36218,Helen,180," Congratulations, they're doing the show.",9
36219,Morty,180," They should have put that show on 5 years ago. Bunch of idiots at that network.        Can I tell you something, Jerry? It's all crap on TV. The only thing I watch is Xena the        Warrior Princess. She must be about six-six.",9
36220,Helen,180, She's not six-six.,9
36221,Morty,180," Jerry, you ever watch that?",9
36222,Jerry,180," Yeah, it's pretty good.",9
36223,Estelle,180, They picked up the show?,9
36224,George,180, I'm moving to California.,9
36225,Frank,180," Oh baby-doll, this kid's going places, I told you.",9
36226,Estelle,180, The NBC guy liked it?,9
36227,George,180, Of course he liked it.,9
36228,Estelle,180, He told you he liked it?,9
36229,George,180, He wouldn't put it on if he didn't like it.,9
36230,Estelle,180," Well, what are you doing?",9
36231,George,180, I'm writing.,9
36232,Estelle,180, You know how to write?,9
36233,Frank,180," Without the writing, you have nothing. You're the ones that make them look good.",9
36234,Estelle,180, Since when do you know how to write? I never saw you write anything.,9
36235,George,180, Ma?!,9
36236,Estelle,180," I don't know how you're going to write all those shows. And where are you get        all the ideas?",9
36237,Frank,180, Would you leave him alone? You'll shatter his confidence!,9
36238,George,180, I don't need any ideas. It's a show about nothing.,9
36239,Estelle,180," Nothing. Please. I'll tell you the truth - the whole thing sounds pretty        stupid to me.",9
36240,Jerry,180," NBC is letting me use their private jet? And I can go anywhere I want? That's        fantastic! Thanks. Great. ",9
36241,Kramer,180, Oh hey!,9
36242,Jerry,180, Hey - how was the beach?,9
36243,Kramer,180," Oh, you missed it, buddy - lot of femininas - some major femininas",9
36244,Jerry,180, I had a little meeting today at NBC. What are you doing?,9
36245,Kramer,180," You know, I went swimming and I can't get this water out of my ear.",9
36246,Jerry,180," So do you remember five years ago, we did that pilot, ""Jerry""? Well,        the new guy at NBC wants to do it. ",9
36247,Kramer,180, You're moving to California?,9
36248,Jerry,180," Yeah, only for a while.",9
36249,Kramer,180," Yeah, but Jerry, what happens if the show's a hit? You could be out there for        years! You might never come",9
36250,Jerry,180," No, I'll be back.",9
36251,Kramer,180," Jerry. It's L.A. Nobody leaves. She's a seductress, she's a siren, she's a        virgin, she's a whore.",9
36252,Jerry,180," And my agent said as a bonus, I can use their private jet, so we'll all go        somewhere - the four of us, one big fling before George and I go to California.",9
36253,Kramer,180, Fling!,9
36254,Elaine,180, So we can go anywhere we want?,9
36255,Jerry,180, Anywhere.,9
36256,Elaine,180, Why are they doing this?,9
36257,Jerry,180," I think they want to make it up to us cause they let this thing sit on their        shelf for five years.",9
36258,Elaine,180, This is all very exciting.,9
36259,George,180, So? Where are we going?,9
36260,Kramer,180, I say Japan.,9
36261,Elaine,180, Why Japan?,9
36262,Kramer,180," Oh - geishas - they cater to your every whim. They're shy at first, but they're        quite skilled at conversation. They can discuss anything from world affairs to the fine        art of fishing - or baking.",9
36263,Elaine,180, Oh - I got it - how about Russia?,9
36264,Jerry,180," Russia, it's so bleak.",9
36265,Elaine,180, It's not bleak - it's springtime.,9
36266,Jerry,180, It's still bleak.,9
36267,Elaine,180, You can't be bleak in spring.,9
36268,Jerry,180, You can be bleak in spring.,9
36269,George,180," If you're bleak, you're bleak.",9
36270,Elaine,180, What about Switzerland?,9
36271,Kramer,180," Oh - Switzerland - the Von Trapp family, huh?",9
36272,George,180, It's a bit hilly - no?,9
36273,Elaine,180, You're not going to do any walking.,9
36274,George,180, What if I want to walk around a little?,9
36275,Elaine,180, So then you'll walk down the hill and we'll pick you up.,9
36276,George,180, What if I'm at the bottom?,9
36277,Elaine,180," All right! You know what, just forget it!",9
36278,Jerry,180," Alright - come on - come on now, people. Let's face it, we're not all going to        agree on anything. ",9
36279,Elaine,180, I'll go to Paris.,9
36280,George,180, Me too.,9
36281,Kramer,180, Oh yeah - oui oui.,9
36282,Jerry,180," So that's it - it's settled, we're going to Paris.",9
36283,Group,180, Yeah!,9
36284,Elaine,180," Hey. NBC limo is downstairs - beep beep beep. {NBC tune} I'm just going to call        Jill one more time before we go.",9
36285,Jerry,180," Wait, you can't make a call like that on your way out. You can't rush that        conversation.",9
36286,Elaine,180," Well, I can't call from the limo. Can I call from the plane?",9
36287,Jerry,180," First you make a cell-phone walk-and-talk, then she loses a call-waiting        face-off, now you're talking about",9
36288,Elaine,180," All right, I'll just have to call her from Paris.",9
36289,Newman,180," Hello, Jerry.",9
36290,Jerry,180," Hello, Newman. What gives?",9
36291,Newman,180," I was speaking earlier with Kramer and he mentioned something about a private        jet to Paris?",9
36292,Jerry,180," Yeah, that's right.",9
36293,Newman,180," Well, I hear it's quite beautiful there this time of year, and of course you        know I'm one-quarter French.",9
36294,Jerry,180, Really.,9
36295,Newman,180," Oh yes, in fact I still have family there. This probably won't interest you,        but I have a cousin there who's suffering very badly. She's lost all use of her muscles.        She can only communicate by blinking. I would so love to see her - bring a ray of sunshine        into her tragic life. But alas, I can't afford it, for I am, as you know, but a simple        postal worker.",9
36296,Jerry,180, That's a shame.,9
36297,Newman,180, Take me! Take me!,9
36298,Jerry,180," Oh, forget it. Pull yourself together. You're making me sick. Be a man!",9
36299,Newman,180," All right! But hear me and hear me well - The day will come. Oh yes, mark my        words, Seinfeld - your day of ",9
36300,Captain,180," Ah, Jerry?",9
36301,Jerry,180, Yeah.,9
36302,Captain,180," I'm Captain Maddox this is my co-pilot, Kurt Adams. Ready to go to Paris?",9
36303,Jerry,180, All set. We'll just grab the bags.,9
36304,Captain,180, Don't worry about that. We'll take care of them for you.,9
36305,Jerry,180, Just keeps on getting better and better.,9
36306,Jerry,180, Not bad.,9
36307,Elaine,180, Wow!,9
36308,Kramer,180, The only way to fly.,9
36309,George,180, This is it?,9
36310,George,180," I'm sorry - I have to say, I'm a little disappointed, I thought it would be a        lot nicer.",9
36311,Jerry,180, You're complaining about a private jet?,9
36312,George,180, You think this is the plane that Ted Danson gets?,9
36313,Jerry,180, Ted Danson is not even on the network anymore.,9
36314,George,180," Still, I bet when they gave him a plane, it was a lot nicer than this one.",9
36315,Elaine,180, Will you shut up? You are ruining the whole trip.,9
36316,George,180," This is a real piece of junk. I don't even feel safe on this thing. I have a        good mind to write a letter toMr. Kimbrough.",9
36317,Jerry,180, You're not writing any letters!,9
36318,Elaine,180, Will you turn around?,9
36319,George,180, Why?,9
36320,Elaine,180, You are annoying me sitting like that. It's effeminate.,9
36321,George,180, It's effeminate to sit like this? ,9
36322,Elaine,180," Yes, I think it's a little effeminate.",9
36323,George,180, How is this effeminate?,9
36324,Elaine,180, I don't know - it just is.,9
36325,George,180," Kramer, what are you doing?",9
36326,Jerry,180, Still got water in your ear?,9
36327,Kramer,180, Can't get rid of it. Maybe it leaked inside my brain.,9
36328,George,180, Would you stop that? It's not safe to be jumping up and down on a plane.,9
36329,Kramer,180," I got to get it out, I can't take this anymore.",9
36330,George,180," Kramer, don't be fooling around up here.",9
36331,George,180, Kramer!,9
36332,Captain,180," Hey, get the hell out of here!",9
36333,Elaine,180, What is that?,9
36334,George,180, Oh my God!,9
36335,Elaine,180, What is that noise? What is that noise?,9
36336,Jerry,180," Kramer, what the hell did you do?",9
36337,Kramer,180, I lost my balance.,9
36338,Elaine,180, Oh my God!,9
36339,Elaine,180, What's going on?,9
36340,Jerry,180, Kramer!,9
36341,Kramer,180, It was an accident.,9
36342,George,180, I told you to stop with the hopping.,9
36343,Elaine,180," Oh my God, we're going down. We're going to die!",9
36344,George,180, Just when I was doing great. I told you God wouldn't let me be successful.,9
36345,Jerry,180, Is this it? Is this how it ends? It can't- it can't end like this.,9
36346,Kramer,180, I'm ready! I'm ready! Glory hallelujah!,9
36347,George,180, Jerry? Jerry can you hear me?,9
36348,Jerry,180, Yeah.,9
36349,George,180, There's something I have to tell you.,9
36350,Jerry,180, What? What is it?,9
36351,George,180, I cheated in the contest.,9
36352,Elaine,180, What?,9
36353,Jerry,180, What?,9
36354,George,180, The contest - I cheated.,9
36355,Jerry,180, Why?,9
36356,George,180, Because I'm a cheater! I had to tell you.,9
36357,Jerry,180, Great - I won.,9
36358,Elaine,180," Jerry, I gotta tell you something too.",9
36359,Jerry,180," Yeah, Elaine I got something I want to say to you.",9
36360,Elaine,180, No no - me first.,9
36361,Jerry,180, Alright.,9
36362,Elaine,180," Jerry, I've always loved ..u..",9
36363,George,180, Hey - What's going on?,9
36364,Kramer,180, We're straightening out!,9
36365,Elaine,180, We're straightening out?,9
36366,Jerry,180, We're straightening out!,9
36367,George,180, We're straightening out!,9
36368,Group,180, Yeah!,9
36369,Captain,180," Well, again, sorry about that little mishap. But once you get everything        checked out there shouldn't be anymore problems.",9
36370,Jerry,180, Where are we?,9
36371,Captain,180," Latham, Massachusetts. Why don't you take a cab into town, get yourself        something to eat. I got your beeper number - I'll beep you as soon as we're ready.",9
36372,Jerry,180, Okay.,9
36373,Elaine,180, Okay.,9
36374,Jerry,180, We'll see you later.,9
36375,Elaine,180," Well, what are we going to do about Paris? I mean are we actually going to get        back on this plane?",9
36376,Jerry,180," I say we go back to New York, and take a regular flight.",9
36377,George,180," I'm not getting on a regular plane now - I'm all psyched up to go on a private        jet. No way I'm getting on a regular plane.",9
36378,Elaine,180," Well, I'm sure that they would fly us first class.",9
36379,George,180," First class doesn't make it anymore. Now you get on the phone with Kimbrough,        tell him what happened and tell him to get another plane down here, but this time, the        good one - the Ted Danson plane.",9
36380,Jerry,180," Alright, I'll feel him out.",9
36381,George,180," Yeah, just tell him to hurry it up.",9
36382,Stranger,180, Nice day.,9
36383,Jerry,180, Another one?,9
36384,Robber,180," Alright fatso, out of the car.",9
36385,Kramer,180, I want to capture this.,9
36386,Robber,180, Come on! Gimme your wallet.,9
36387,Victim,180, Don't shoot.,9
36388,Jerry,180," Well, there goes the money for the lipo.",9
36389,Elaine,180," See, the great thing about robbing a fat guy is it's an easy getaway. You know?        They can't really chase ya!",9
36390,George,180, He's actually doing him a favor. It's less money for him to buy food.,9
36391,Robber,180," I want your wallet. Come on. Come on, come on.",9
36392,Jerry,180," That's a shame. Alright, I'm gonna call NBC.",9
36393,Victim,180," Officer, he's stealing my car! Officer, I was carjacked. I was held up at        gunpoint! He took my wallet, everything!",9
36394,Jerry,180," Okay, thanks anyway. They can't get another plane.",9
36395,Kramer,180," All right, what's wrong with the plane we got? They're just checking it out.",9
36396,Elaine,180, Forget it.,9
36397,Jerry,180," No, no, no. We're not getting on there. Come on, let's go get something to eat        in Sticksville.",9
36398,Officer,180," All right, hold it right there.",9
36399,Kramer,180, What?,9
36400,Officer,180, You're under arrest.,9
36401,Jerry,180, Under arrest? What for?,9
36402,Officer,180, Article 223-7 of the Latham County Penal Code.,9
36403,Elaine,180," What? No, no - we didn't do anything.",9
36404,Officer,180, It's new. It's called the Good Samaritan Law. Let's go.,9
36405,Elaine,180, The Good Samaritan Law? Are they crazy?,9
36406,George,180, Why would we want to help somebody?,9
36407,Elaine,180, I know.,9
36408,George,180, That's what nuns and Red Cross workers are for.,9
36409,Kramer,180, The Samaritans were an ancient tribe - very helpful to people.,9
36410,Elaine,180," Alright - um, excuse me, hi, could you tell me what kind of law this is.",9
36411,Deputy,180," Well, they just passed it last year. It's modeled after the French law. I heard        about it after Princess Diana was killed and all those photographers were just standing        around.",9
36412,Jerry,180," Oh, yeah.",9
36413,Elaine,180," Oh, yeah.",9
36414,Deputy,180," You're the first ones to be arrested on it, probably in the whole country.",9
36415,George,180," All right, so what's the penalty here? Let's just pay the fine or something and        get the hell out of here.",9
36416,Deputy,180," Well, it's not that easy. Now see, the law calls for a maximum fine of $85,000        and as much as five years in prison.",9
36417,Elaine,180, What?,9
36418,George,180," Oh no no no no - we have to be in California next week. We're starting a TV        show.",9
36419,Deputy,180," California? Oh gosh, I don't think so. Yeah, my guess is you're gonna be        prosecuted. Better get yourselves a good lawyer.",9
36420,Chiles,180," Who told you to put the cheese on? Did I tell you to put the cheese on? I        didn't tell you to put the cheese on.",9
36421,Secretary,180, Jerry Seinfeld on the phone.,9
36422,Chiles,180," You people with the cheese. It never ends. Hello? Uh huh. Uh huh. Uh huh. Good        Samaritan Law? I never heard of it. You don't have to help anybody. That's what this        country's all about. That's deplorable, unfathomable, improbable. Hold on. Suzie, cancel        my appointment with Dr. Bison. And pack a bag for me. I want to get to Latham,        Massachusetts,right away.",9
36423,Prosecutor,180," So they got Jackie Chiles, huh?",9
36424,D.A. Hoyt,180," Uh huh. You know what that means. This whole place is going to be swarming        with media by the time this thing is over. You're not going to be able to find a hotel        room in this town. The whole country is going to be watching us. Now we got to do whatever        it takes to win it, no matter what the cost. The big issue in this trial is going to be ",9
36425,Kramer,180," Mmmm, this is pretty good chow, huh?",9
36426,George,180," Would it kill him to check up on us? No - drops off the meals and that's it. I        realize we're prisoners, but we're still entitled to catsup.",9
36427,Elaine,180, I guess we could've called for help.,9
36428,Jerry,180, But then we would have missed the whole thing.,9
36429,Kramer,180, I still had it on video. We could have watched it later.,9
36430,George,180," Yeah, he's right.",9
36431,Jerry,180, I forgot about the video.,9
36432,Elaine,180, Sure - the video.,9
36433,Elaine,180, What is that?,9
36434,Jerry,180, Plane's ready.,9
36435,Rivera,180," Hi everybody, I'm Geraldo Rivera. Tonight we'll be talking about what most of        you have probably been ",9
36436,Wells,180," Yes. Good evening, Geraldo.",9
36437,Rivera,180, What's the mood? What's going on tonight?,9
36438,Wells,180," Well, Latham is fairly quite tonight, considering the media circus that has        descended upon this quaint little town.",9
36439,Rivera,180," And what about the defendants - the so-called New York Four. How are they        holding up?",9
36440,Wells,180," Well, I did speak with one of the deputies who had some contact with them, and        he told me quote ""There's no love lost with that group.""",9
36441,Rivera,180," Anything else, Jane?",9
36442,Wells,180," There also seems to be some friction between Mr. Seinfeld, and Ms. Benes. The        rumor is that they once dated,",9
36443,Rivera,180," Well, ladies and gentlemen, who know, maybe this trial will bring them closer        together. Maybe they'll even end up getting married.",9
36444,Helen,180, I hope you packed enough - this trial could last for weeks.,9

Now, essentially, we made it a crime to ignore a fellow human        being in trouble. Now this group from New York not only ignored, but, as we will prove,        they actually mocked the victim as he was being robbed at gunpoint. I can guarantee you        one other thing, ladies and gentlemen, this is not the first time they have behaved in        this manner. On the contrary, they have quite a record of mocking and maligning. This is a        history of selfishness, self-absorption, immaturity, and greed. And you will see how        everyone who has come into contact with these four individuals has been abused, wronged,        deceived and betrayed. This time, they have gone too far.

You know what these four people were? They were        innocentbystanders. Now, you just think about that term. Innocent. Bystanders. Because        that's exactly what they were. We know theywere bystanders, nobody's disputing that. So        how can a bystander be guilty? No such thing. Have you ever heard of a guilty bystander?        No, because you cannot be a bystander and be guilty. Bystanders are by definition,        innocent. That is the nature of bystanding. But no, they want to change nature here. They        want to create a whole new animal - the guilty bystander. Don't you let them do it. Only        you can stop them.",9

36703,Hoyt,180, And what's your connection to the defendant?,9
36704,Babu,180," I owned a restaurant. Seinfeld told me to change the menu to Pakistani. But        nobody came! There were no people.",9
36705,Hoyt,180, And then what happened?,9
36706,Babu,180," Then, he got me an apartment in his building. But they mixed up the mail. And I        never got my immigration renewal papers. So they deported me. It's all his fault. Him. And        the woman. But they did not care. They're totally indifferent. All they do is mock me,        just like they did the fat fellow. All the time. Mocking, mocking, mocking, mocking,        mocking. All the time! Now it is Babu's turn to mock. Finally I will have some justice.        Send them away! Send them all away! Lock them up forever! They are not human. Very bad!        Very, very, very bad!",9
36707,Rivera,180," Hi everybody, I'm Geraldo Rivera and welcome to this special edition of Rivera        Live. Well, arguments in the ",9
36708,Wells,180," Geraldo, just a few minutes ago, the jury asked to see the video tape.",9
36709,Rivera,180," That's the one where they are overheard making sarcastic remarks during the        robbery.",9
36710,Wells,180," Yes, it's a very incriminating piece of evidence. But I must tell you, Geraldo,        this courtroom and everyone who has attended this trial is still reeling from the endless        parade of witness who have come forth so enthusiastically to testify against these four        seemingly ordinary people. One even had the feeling that if Judge Vandelay didn't finally        put a stop to it, it could've gone on for months.",9
36711,Rivera,180," Jane, whose testimony do you think resonated most strongly with this jury?",9
36712,Wells,180," That is so hard to say. Certainly there's the doctor with the poison        invitations. The Bubble Boy was an extremely sympathetic and tragic figure. And that        bizarre contest certainly didn't sit well with this small town jury.There's the woman they        sold the defective wheelchair to, the deported Pakistani restaurateur. Geraldo, it just        went on, ",9
36713,Rivera,180, And so we wait.,9
36714,Jerry,180, Do they make you wear uniforms in prison?,9
36715,Elaine,180, I think so.,9
36716,Jerry,180, It's not that bright orange one is it?,9
36717,Elaine,180," I hope it's not that one, because I cannot wear orange.",9
36718,Kramer,180," Will you stop worrying? Jackie's going to get us off. He never loses. How about        when he asked that cop ",9
36719,Estelle,180," Sorry to bother you, Judge.",9
36720,Vandelay,180, How did you get in here?,9
36721,Estelle,180," Please, if he's found guilty, please be kind to him. He's a good boy.",9
36722,Vandelay,180, This is highly irregular.,9
36723,Estelle,180," Well, maybe there's something I can do for you.",9
36724,Vandelay,180, What do you mean?,9
36725,Estelle,180, You know,9
36726,Sidra,180," Oh, Jackie, you're so articulate.",9
36727,Jackie,180," We have plenty of time, too. This jury could be out for days.",9
36728,Jackie,180, Hello? Damn. They're ready.,9
36729,Jerry,180," Hey Elaine, what was it you were about to say to me on the plane when it was        going down?",9
36730,Elaine,180, I've always loved ... United Airlines.,9
36731,Kramer,180, I think it's going to be okay - that girl just smiled at me.,9
36732,Jerry,180, Maybe because she knows you're going to jail.,9
36733,Bailiff,180, All rise.,9
36734,Vandelay,180," Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, have you reached a verdict?",9
36735,Foreman,180," We have, Your Honor.",9
36736,Vandelay,180," Will the defendants please rise. And how do you find, with respect to the        charge of criminal indifference?",9
36737,Foreman,180, We find the defendants - guilty.,9
36738,Vandelay,180," Order! Order in this court, I will clear this room! I do not know how, or        under what circumstances the four of you found each other, but your callous indifference        and utter disregard for everything that is good and decent has rocked the very foundation        upon which our society is built. I can think of nothing more fitting than for the four of        youto spend a year removed from society so that you can contemplate the manner in which        you have conducted yourselves. ",9
36739,George,180, You had to hop! You had to hop on the plane.,9
36740,Elaine,180," Puddy, don't wait for me.",9
36741,Puddy,180, Alright.,9
36742,Frank,180, We gotta get out of here. We want to beat the traffic.,9
36743,Sidra,180," Come on, Jackie. Let's go.",9
36744,Jerry,180, What?,9
36745,Chiles,180," Oh, and by the way, they're real, and they're spectacular.",9
36746,Jerry,180," Well, it's only a year. That's not so bad. We'll be out in a year, and then        we'll be back",9
36747,Kramer,180," Could be fun. Don't have to worry about your meals, or what you're going to do        Saturday night. And they do shows. Yeah, we could put on a show - maybe ""Bye Bye        Birdie"" or ""My Fair Lady"". Elaine, you could be Liza Doolittle.",9
36748,Elaine,180, Why don't you just blow it out your...,9
36749,Elaine,180," If I call Jill from prison, do you think that would make up for the other ones?",9
36750,Jerry,180, Sure.,9
36751,Elaine,180, Cause you only get one call. The prison call is like the king of calls.,9
36752,Jerry,180, I think that would be a very nice gesture.,9
36753,Kramer,180," I got it - it's out! How about that, huh? Oh, boy, what a relief.",9
36754,Jerry,180," See now, to me, that button is in the worst possible spot.",9
36755,George,180, Really?,9
36756,Jerry,180," Oh yeah. The second button is the key button. It literally makes or breaks the        shirt. Look at it, it's ",9
36757,George,180, Haven't we had this conversation before?,9
36758,Jerry,180, You think?,9
36759,George,180, I think we have.,9
36760,Jerry,180," Yeah, maybe we have.",9
36761,Jerry,180," So what is the deal with the yard? I mean when I was a kid my mother wanted me        to play in the yard. But of ",9
36762,Prisoner 1,180, I am.,9
36763,Jerry,180," I'll talk slower. I'm kidding - I love Cellblock D. My friend George is in        Cellblock D. What are you in for,sir?",9
36764,Prisoner 2,180, Murder one.,9
36765,Jerry,180," Murder one? Oooooo, watch out everybody. Better be nice to you. I'm only kidding        sir - lighten up. How about ",9
36766,Prisoner 3,180, Grand theft auto.,9
36767,Jerry,180, Grand theft auto - don't steal any of my jokes.,9
36768,Prisoner 3,180, You suck - I'm gonna cut you.,9
36769,Jerry,180," Hey, I don't come down to where you work, and knock the license plate out of        your hand.",9
36770,Guard,180," Alright, Seinfeld, that's it. Let's go. Come on.",9
36771,Jerry,180," Alright, hey, you've been great! See you in the cafeteria.",9
